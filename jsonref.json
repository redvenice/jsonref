Earlier this month it was announced Paul McKay was joining Morecambe on loan.McKay\u0027s other son Mark followed in his father\u0027s footsteps and also works as a football agent, helping West Ham sign Dimitri Payet from Marseille in a £10.7million move in 2015.  Mark was the director of the Glasgow-based company Excelfoot Ltd, which went into liquidation in 2017.           Football agent Willie McKay (right) watches The Willie McKay Sports Management Handicap Stakes with his wife  McKay\u0027s son Mark (pictured left and right) followed in his father\u0027s footsteps and also works as a football agent, helping West Ham sign Dimitri Payet from Marseille in a £10.7million move in 2015. He also represents Everton midfielder Idrissa Gana GueyeIn 2012 he told the Telegraph that his arrest in 2007 was the \u0027lowest point\u0027 of his life and, despite no charges ever being brought, described the deep impact it had both on his family and career.\u0027Before I got arrested, I had arranged to meet the police,\u0027 he said. \u0027The day before it happened, two helicopters flew over.\u0027Someone said to me, \u0027There\u0027s two police helicopters, someone must be missing\u0027. No, at 6am the next morning, there were 32 police officers.\u0027They were all over the place for two days. They talk about £7 million costs for this investigation but I think you could multiply that by another five.

He was cautioned after a bag of cocaine was found in his car.The agent pleaded guilty to driving while disqualified and without insurance at Westminster Magistrates’ Court but was criticised by District Judge Quentin Purdy who him he had \u0027arrogantly\u0027 flouted the ban and fined him more than £6,000.In 2015 it was reported that he had been declared bankrupt at a hearing in Glasgow. McKay revealed assets of just £987, while court documents detailed that he owed £713,292.   "},{"url":null,"title":"PAUL BRACCHI Jack Shepherd no apology no remorse","story":"    Shepherd was convicted of killing Charlotte Brown when he drunkenly flipped his speedboat on the Thames while trying to impress her on a first date in 2015He might have changed his appearance, sporting shorn hair and a longer straggly beard, but his fleeting moment before the cameras in the Georgian capital was entirely in keeping with the young man who was too cowardly to take his place in the dock at the Old Bailey to face manslaughter charges over the death of 24-year-old Charlotte in a speedboat accident on the Thames just over three years ago.He has remained too cowardly to face her heartbroken parents and sisters, and too cowardly to give himself up after taking out roughly £50,000 in loans to go on the run in March.He was spotted by a local journalist who recognised him – following press reports in the former Soviet republic that he might be in hiding in the country – and tipped off the police.So Shepherd, 31, does not even deserve a shred of credit for finally doing the right thing he didn\u0027t.Indeed his capture, in its own way, shames our own justice system as well as him. He was convicted in his absence (of manslaughter by gross negligence) and received a six-year sentence but – scandalously in the eyes of many – he was still granted Legal Aid to mount an appeal after absconding.          Shepherd smiled for the camera today. Ignoring the jury\u0027s verdict that he was responsible for the safety of the boat and those on board, he said: \u0027It\u0027s very upsetting to read these lies in the newspaper\u0027His lawyers at Tuckers Solicitors, which has offices around the country, were in communication with their client all along.Under client confidentiality rules, they were not in a position to help Scotland Yard find him and repeatedly stressed they didn\u0027t know where he was in any case.Not that the Metropolitan Police covered themselves in glory either. Officers, it emerged, were tipped off that Shepherd had fled to Georgia more than six months ago yet did nothing.The Georgian authorities invited their British counterparts to belatedly join the hunt for the killer, who is believed to have entered the country after disappearing nearly a year ago, but the offer wasn\u0027t taken up.Charlotte\u0027s family met Home Secretary Sajid Javid this week and he vowed to \u0027strain every sinew\u0027 to catch him.That meeting followed a campaign by the Daily Mail which put up a £25,000 reward to bring Shepherd to justice.          Shepherd zigzagged across the water at almost twice the speed limit of 12 knots. Sometime before midnight, the speedboat (pictured) hit a submerged log near Wandsworth Bridge and capsizedLet us remind you of the circumstances surrounding Charlotte\u0027s death on December 9, 2015, to explain why we took that decision.It was Shepherd\u0027s first date with Charlotte, who must have been more than a little impressed by the dashing, well-spoken man wining and dining her at the glamourous Oblix restaurant on the 32nd floor of the The Shard skyscraper at London Bridge.What Charlotte could not have known was that womanising Shepherd wasn\u0027t interested in romance, or even having a relationship with her or anyone else. He was a predator who had wined and dined up to ten other young women shortly before they met.Charlotte, an English literature graduate and business consultant, agreed to his suggestion that, after leaving the Oblix, they should take taxi back to his place – a houseboat on the Thames at Hammersmith, West London.  Jack Shepherd looks a different man after his time on the run. Pictured left: at the Old Bailey in 2016. Right: speaking in Georgia after his re-arrest todayMoored outside was a 14ft Fletcher Arrowflyte speedboat with a supply of champagne, for a late night, drink-fuelled spin along the river – purchased, he would later admit to detectives, to \u0027pull women\u0027.The boat was a death trap. The craft\u0027s kill cord (which is used to cut the engine if the driver becomes incapacitated) had been disconnected, the life jackets were tucked away out of reach, and the steering was faulty. Shepherd knew all this he knew that his boat was an accident waiting to happen.Still, he zigzagged across the water at almost twice the speed limit of 12 knots (14mph). And let us not forget that he had already been warned twice before by the river police about speeding. But, as we have already stated, arrogance was one of Shepherd\u0027s defining characteristics.‘I am thankful for Mariano’s support’: President Trump...Share this articleSometime before midnight, the speedboat hit a submerged log near Wandsworth Bridge and capsized. What happened next, you might think, also revealed another aspect of his character.Shepherd called out from the water for someone to \u0027help me\u0027 – not \u0027help us\u0027.Apparently Shepherd, a web designer, was still slurring his words for hours afterwards.Charlotte herself was eventually pulled from the water and died in hospital. She never regained consciousness after the accident.Due to the complexities of the case, the investigation was passed from Wandsworth CID to Scotland Yard\u0027s Homicide and Serious Crime Command.It wasn\u0027t until September 2017 that Shepherd, who had met Charlotte online, was charged with her death. He denied manslaughter and was granted unconditional bail. Then, after attending three preliminary hearings, he absconded.Charlotte\u0027s devastated family knew nothing of this until the eve of the trial, which went ahead without him in July 2018. Her mother Roz Wickens, 43, a council careline operator, expressed what everything else was thinking: \u0027There has got to be someone harbouring him, either financially or otherwise. He has got support.\u0027I don\u0027t think he\u0027s able to do this on his own.\u0027The public might now find out if that was indeed the case. He took out loans of at least £50,000 before he fled and has failed to pay back a single penny.Perhaps it is no surprise to learn that Shepherd is also facing trial for grievous bodily harm after being accused of glassing a barman, which makes the decision to grant him Legal Aid all the more astonishing.Typical of his heartless behaviour was the fact that he also married his wife – who lives in Wales with their baby son – only two months after the speedboat tragedy.Shepherd grew up in Paignton, Devon, with two younger sisters and a brother.His orced father, who worked as a product control administrator, was 40 at the time of his birth and had already fathered five children from previous relationships. His mother, 26 at the time, was a sales assistant.          Charlotte Brown, who died aged 24, on a date on a speedboat with Jack Shepherd on the Thames in 2015The couple ran a health food shop in nearby Totnes and kept what is said to have been a chaotic household (\u0027the parents were hippy-dippy types who never properly punished their kids\u0027, says one acquaintance).They split up when Shepherd was a teenager.Extremely \u0027arrogant\u0027 (that word again) is how his old teacher Richard Pennell remembers him. \u0027He thought he was better than everyone else,\u0027 he said. \u0027Despite our best efforts we weren\u0027t able to help him behave better.\u0027Since then much more has come to light about Shepherd.After leaving school in 2005, he did not go to university but went instead to London to pursue a career in IT.In 2013 he incorporated a web development company (named JSS Web after his initials). But it was struck off the register six months later without ever having filed accounts.He created a second software business, JS Digital, in 2014, again as the sole director. But Shepherd also had another, less respectable, business. He was behind a website called Dating In Kent which claimed to have more than 7,000 members and offered its users advice on \u0027how to impress on the first date\u0027. One section read: \u0027First dates should supply a window into the excitement and joy you can offer your partner, so never be afraid to think outside the box to ensure that your name is the first on your lover\u0027s lips.\u0027Another website linked to Shepherd, allegedly with 1,000 members, included a \u0027newbie\u0027s guide to no-strings sex\u0027.This is surely what he was trying to accomplish on his first – and only date – with Charlotte.This will be why he took her to the swish Oblix restaurant, an establishment which combines \u0027sophisticated, urban dining\u0027 with spectacular views over the capital. Sadly for Charlotte, it was all part of his cynical seduction routine.She had met Shepherd on an unconnected dating website. The pair had been exchanging messages for about four weeks before their fateful date.Haunting video footage retrieved from Charlotte\u0027s smartphone from that night shows the flickering lights of the capital reflected in the water as they speed along the river. Charlotte can be heard exclaiming: \u0027Oh my god, you\u0027re going so fast.\u0027Four months before the speedboat tragedy (at a time when Shepherd must have been dating his future wife), a young woman called Clare Hyam posted an image of herself \u0027drinking champers\u0027 on his boat near the Houses of Parliament.Meanwhile, several mysteriously anonymous Twitter accounts have sprung up on social media to defend Shepherd. One recently claimed that he \u0027loves\u0027 his son and is \u0027missing his family, too\u0027.Of course nothing can match the anguish and anger of poor Charlotte\u0027s family, who spoke yesterday to the BBC\u0027s Victoria Derbyshire show.Her father Graham Brown, a civil servant, told the programme: \u0027Our family do feel let down by the criminal justice system because Jack Shepherd was able to flout the law and unfortunately our daughter lost her life.\u0027His absence from trial while on unconditional bail, and just how easy it was to abscond, has surely got to be a concern.\u0027I don\u0027t know whether it\u0027s the police, the Crown Prosecution Service, the clunky justice system – but something is not right.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/09/04/4FEA8B8F00000578-0-image-a-21_1536462301439.jpg","title":"Qantas non stop flight Perth London turned two hours disruptive passenger","story":"    A non-stop Qantas flight from Perth to London on Saturday night was forced to turn back two hours after take-off due to a disruptive male passenger (pictured QF10)The Flightradar24 app showed the plane returning to Perth west of Shark Bay.One passenger said the man became \u0027agitated\u0027 and \u0027hyper-aggressive like a cornered animal\u0027 having returned to his seat after walking towards the bathroom.According to PerthNow, the passenger said the man stood up and was \u0027shouting and pointing in an extremely aggressive manner\u0027.He said: \u0027Whatever happened next he was suddenly standing up and shouting and pointing in an extremely aggressive manner.

This photograph was taken by Gijsbert Hanekroot, the Netherlands\u0027 premier rock photographer at the time, who said that Bowie was his favourite musician to work with. On one occasion in 1971, Hankeroot told of how he bumped into Bowie in a canteen while he was working on lyrics for Ziggy Stardust and asked his opinion on one of the lines          Bob Dylan photographed at Madison Square Garden in New York, 1974. Hankeroot managed to inset himself in the midst of a heady time in both music and culture, living the rockstar lifestyle by proxy as he flew all over the world to photograph its biggest stars. \u0027We saw The Eagles in London, Paul McCartney in south of France, Bob Dylan in New York and the Stones in Hamburg. We visited London every two months. It was the most natural thing in the world,\u0027 he said          John Lennon and Yoko Ono photographed in Selfridges on Oxford Street in 1971. Hankeroot was best-known for working in low-light settings, such as concert halls and music venues, so this is one of his rarer daylight shots. He used darkroom techniques that lent a grainy texture to the pictures he took, which is particularly visible on the faces of his subjects          Keith Richards, of the Rolling Stones, smoke a cigarette somewhere in Belgium, 1976. Hankeroot was recognised for his talent in his own time, working for Dutch magazine Oort, but he left the field of music photography in the 80s and his work has gone ingored. But he is now opening a new show in Hong Kong to display a retrospective of his works          Lou Reed lights a cigarette in Amsterdam, 1972. Hankeroot liked to spend as much time as possible with his subjects, staying the full length of their set if they were playing, or \u0027until the subject was bored of me\u0027, if they were in a studio. \u0027That\u0027s the moment that he or she would stop acting or posing, those often became the best pictures,\u0027 he said  Neil Young slumps on a sofa in his hotel  in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1976 (left) while Patti Smith poses during a photo shoot in Amsterdam, exact date unknown (right). Hankeroot tried to embody the same spirit of reinvention and innovation that the musicians put into their songs in his photography, searching for new way to capture and define the seminal decade in art          Leonard Cohen, photographed on a cobbled street among pigeons, somewhere in Amsterdam in 1974.  Hankeroot was deeply embedded in the musical culture of the 1970s, by the time the following decade rolled around he decided to pursue \u0027other adventures\u0027, and now works mostly as a street photographer and documentary-maker          Frank Zappa photographed in Amsterdam in 1972. Though Hankeroot was born in Brussels, in neighbouring Belgium, he grew up in the Netherlands where he was given his first camera aged 13. At 16 he dropped out of school to pursue photography full-time and got an internship with Philip Mechanicus, where he learned to take portraits          Bryan Ferry at the Amstel Hotel in Amsterdam, 1976. At the time, Ferry had just released Let\u0027s Stick Together, his first solo album since Roxy Music disbanded for the first time earlier the same year. He would release In Your Mind the following year and The Bride Stripped Bare the year after that before Roxy Music reformed          Photographers crowd around Mick Jagger, who is behind the camera in the shot, as they try to get a picture of him in Hamburg, Germany, in 1970          Hankeroot began digitising his archives years ago which led to the publication of Abba...

Banks ditch...Disturbing moment \u0027sex attacker\u0027 wipes his brow and emerges...Share this article\u0027Barclays - as you know, a major United Kingdom-based bank - was unavoidably caught up in that crisis.\u0027And we will be examining how those at the very top of the bank responded to the pressure that it created.\u0027Mr Brown told jurors that by the spring and early summer of 2008, Barclays and many other banks were \u0027under sometimes extreme pressure to raise further capital - that is to say, to raise further investment in the bank itself to secure its financial position\u0027.He said: \u0027The foundation of any bank of course is its capital base. And without a secure and confident capital base, a bank cannot conduct its business with any confidence.\u0027It was this confidence that had evaporated in the banking sector in 2007 and 2008.\u0027In June 2008 - so, getting to the early summer of that year - there was a significant need to increase the capital base at Barclays.\u0027  Thomas Kalaris and Richard Boath are also facing fraud charges and are seen arriving at Southwark Crown Court today By autumn of 2008, the need to increase capital was being imposed by the Government, Mr Brown told the court.  \u0027Some United Kingdom banks had been forced into Government hands, as a Government bailout was all that they could turn to,\u0027 he said. \u0027Those at the top of Barclays were very anxious to avoid accepting Government money, thereby placing itself under greater Government control and scrutiny.\u0027It is no exaggeration to say that Barclays\u0027 future as an independent bank was in jeopardy in September and October of 2008.\u0027He said the board, which included Varley, was \u0027determined to avoid taking Government funds, convinced that doing so would render Barclays restricted in its flexibility and constrained by Government policy\u0027.Mr Brown said the further investment in the bank was to be achieved through \u0027capital raisings\u0027, a process which involved shares and other financial instruments in the bank being sold to an investor or investors at a particular price per share.He added: \u0027As is normal in such capital raisings, the investors were to be paid a fee for making their investments.\u0027In the capital raisings we are concerned with in this case, all investors are paid at the same percentage commission fee for their investment.\u0027The overall figures involved are very considerable indeed as you might expect.\u0027In June 2008, the capital raising undertaken by Barclays secured £4.4 billion.          Varley (right) leaving Southwark Crown Court on January 14 \u0027In October 2008, when further shoring up of Barclays\u0027 capital ratios was imposed upon it, it raised a total of £6.8 billion.\u0027As we shall see, during these capital raisings, the Qataris in particular - through the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) and Qatar Holding - the Qataris made what were very substantial investments in Barclays to shore up their capital base: approximately £1.9 billion in June 2008 and £2.05 billion in November 2008 when the Qatari money was essential.\u0027Those within the bank at that time commented that without it the consequences would be dire - for the bank and personally.\u0027Mr Brown told the jury that when a capital raising of this type takes place, there is an obligation on a bank to tell the shareholders, the investors and the wider market what has taken place.\u0027As all those involved in transactions of this nature know, there is a legal requirement that the information published by Barclays in this case is honest and accurate. That will be no surprise to you of course.\u0027It ensures that there is transparency and that existing investors, prospective investors and the wider market are properly informed about what has happened.\u0027All experienced bankers know about the fundamental principles attaching to the contents of such public-facing documents, not least that they must contain the truth and must not mislead.\u0027In this case, in addition to the amounts which Barclays revealed that it was paying to the investors in the public-facing documents, additional commission fees for investing were paid to the Qataris ... that were not paid to other investors and were not revealed.\u0027It is the hiding of these additional commission fees which lies at the heart of this case and the conspiracies alleged against the defendants, disguising and hiding extra fees to the tune, ultimately, of a total of nearly a third of a billion pounds, £322 million.\u0027Mr Brown said the commission fees were hidden in two agreements described as Advisory Service Agreements (ASAs).He said: \u0027The evidence demonstrates that the Qataris drove a hard bargain.\u0027Mr Brown explained that they received more than double the commission fee of other investors in the bank.The court heard that when a capital raising takes place the bank is obliged to tell shareholders, investors and the wider market.He explained this process of \u0027disclosure\u0027 is made through public documents, the key one being a Prospectus.He said: \u0027The Prospectuses contained statements as to the amounts of fees and commissions being paid to investors, and the overall costs of the capital raisings, which took no account of the fees payable under the ASAs. Public announcements made by Barclays were to the same effect.\u0027Likewise, Subscription Agreements made between Barclays, and the Qataris and other key investors in both capital raisings referred only to the disclosed fees and commissions and contained warranties to the effect that there were no other fees or commissions payable by Barclays in connection with the investments being made.\u0027Say the prosecution, in respect of the Qatari investment, that was plainly a lie.\u0027Mr Brown said the Prosecution claims that each of the defendants entered into the agreements alleged against them with the intention that one or more of their number would make the false representation that the only fees payable to the Qataris for their investments were the fees disclosed in the Prospectuses and Subscription Agreements.          The accusations of wrongdoing at Barclays date to around the time of the financial crisis  \u0027What matters is whether that each of the iniduals entered into the criminal agreement with the intent that the offence of fraud by false representations would be committed by one or more of their number.\u0027As a matter of law, once they had entered into that agreement, that criminal agreement, the offence is complete. Nothing in fact need be done in pursuit of that agreement,\u0027 he said.Mr Brown added that in this case the agreement was brought into effect because the false representations were made to the other investors. \u0027The evidence demonstrates that each of the iniduals joined in the conspiracies alleged against them and when they did, they intended that the offences of fraud by false representations would be made by one or more of the conspirators,\u0027 he said.Mr Brown told the jury: \u0027The conspiracies to make false representations were entered into with the intention that by making the false representations, the conspirators would make gain for themselves or another, cause loss to another or at the very least, expose another to the risk of loss.\u0027What that means on the facts of this case is that the conspirators intended, principally, that Barclays would gain by the making of the false representations.\u0027Barclays would gain because it would secure the Qatari investment, on the terms demanded by the Qataris, without revealing the true position to other investors and the wider market.\u0027He said this meant that Barclays would gain by avoiding paying others at the same rate.\u0027By depriving the other investors of knowing the truth, at the very least it exposed those other investors to a risk of loss.\u0027Had they known about the true position, contrary to the intention of the conspirators, the other investors may not have chosen to invest at all, or, more likely, would have demanded the same terms as the Qataris.\u0027By making the false representations, hiding the true position, they denied the other investors the opportunity to make that decision for themselves.\u0027That, at the very least, say the Crown, exposed them to the risk of loss.\u0027The loss being that they invested in Barclays when they may not have chosen to do so, or not on the terms that they did, had they known the true position,\u0027 he said.Mr Brown said the bank also stood to gain by \u0027avoiding looking weak to the market by for example having to pay all investors at the higher rate, and it would gain by securing the capital raisings as a whole\u0027.The defendants themselves also had personal motivations, namely their jobs and potentially \u0027very large bonuses\u0027, the court heard.The jury was told: \u0027The security of their jobs and the very large bonuses that they might receive in addition to their salaries were in jeopardy if the future and the security of the bank was in doubt, or placed in the hands of the UK Government.\u0027Varley, 62, of west London, Jenkins, 63, of Malibu, California, Boath, 60, of Henley-on-Thames, and Kalaris, 63, of south-west London, are charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation in relation to Barclays\u0027 June 2008 capital raising.Varley and Jenkins are charged with a second count of conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation in relation to Barclays\u0027 October 2008 capital raising.Jenkins is a former executive chairman of investment banking and investment management in the Middle East and North Africa, Barclays Capital.Boath is former Barclays Capital head of European Financial Institutions Group.Kalaris is former chief executive of Barclays wealth management. The four men deny the charges against them."},{"url":null,"title":"Theresa Mays deal acceptable Brexit outcome voters","story":"    Research by Number Cruncher Politics found Theresa May\u0027s prosed Brexit deal was the least isive for votersMeanwhile, no-deal Brexit was backed by 45 per cent and unacceptable to 39 per cent. But by contrast.

His ambition is that it should be independent of Government interference, with the kind of role as the Office For Budget Responsibility plays in fiscal policy – acting as an independent, arms-length arbiter.Missing, in his view, from the Government\u0027s industrial strategy is a means of tracking progress. Haldane says that an early task \u0027will be to develop a framework that enables us to keep score on how well the strategy is doing\u0027.There has been much anxiety about how short-termism in Britain means some of our crown jewels have been sold to overseas buyers. Haldane believes that this has actually been a good thing. \u0027If you look at foreign-owned companies here, their levels of productivity are a multiple of domestically owned companies. \u0027Exposure to international competition, to international flows of people, to international best practices managerially and otherwise does appear to have lifted the spirits of corporate Britain.\u0027He says the low level of management skills is why the UK has so many under-performers.The Bank seeks to assist corporate Britain and households by listening to fears that interest rates could hit levels seen in the past, and provide reassurance.He notes that monetary conditions in the UK are still very competitive. Interest rates in the UK had never been below 2 per cent up until the financial crisis and ten years after they are still below 1 per cent.\u0027If you believe markets we\u0027ll be a long time getting back to even 2 per cent. If the economy continues to tick along, as we expect, then we might expect some further limited and gradual rises,\u0027 Haldane says, keeping to the interest rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee\u0027s current assumptions.But in a nod to Brexit uncertainty, he concedes: \u0027If the economy begins to change direction we will be flexible in the face of that.\u0027 It is the faintest hint that, as after the referendum in 2016, the Bank may be ready with some kind of monetary safety net.Fees back in tradesFees back in tradesGood for big potsTools and fund ideas\u0026gt Compare the best investing platform for you"},{"url":null,"title":"Swanky holidays dining footballers kicking Monaco life football mega agent","story":"    Monaco-based Willie McKay is one of the most successful agents in the gameWillie McKay is one of the most successful former agents in the game, brokering huge contracts over the years and pulling the strings to secure some of the biggest transfers in history.In his career  he was involved in 485 deals, including acting for Queens Park Rangers during negotiations to sign Joey Barton on a free transfer.He has represented Joey Barton, Charles N\u0027Zogbia, Ross McCormack, Pascal Chimbonda and Amdy Faye, among others. For years he based himself in Monaco, although he now lives in Doncaster.His twin sons Paul and Jack have gone on to become footballers while his other son Mark followed his career path to become a football agent.  McKay, who was born in Scotland, was one of five men arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and false accounting in November 2007 as part of the City of London Police football corruption probe before he was cleared of any wrongdoing 18 months later.In December 2008, he was given a suspended ban by the FA for breaching regulations by acting for two different clubs in two consecutive transfers of Portsmouth and Manchester City striker Benjani.His footballing twins Jack and Paul McKay, 22, have been on the books of Doncaster Rovers, Leeds United and Cardiff City.Social media posts by him and his sons reveal a luxurious lifestyle of fine dining, expensive resorts and relaxation in Monaco and beyond.   Left, football agent William McKay with Leeds and Senegal star El Hadji Diouf and right, his son Mark - who also works as an agent - with his girlfriend Rachel Morse          Mark McKay - who helped West Ham sign Dimitri Payet from Marseille in 2015 - often posts photos from his lavish holidays The brothers began their football education in France and had offers to go to other academies but settled at hometown club Doncaster when they were 16 years old. Jack is a striker who has spent time out on loan with the Scottish League One outfit, while Paul plays at centre-back. In 2016, Leeds United signed the twins, then aged 19, for undisclosed fees on two-and-a-half-year deals from Doncaster Rovers.In mid-January last year they joined Cardiff City after a short trial with the Bluebirds\u0027 Under-23s.

Shepherd smiled for the camera today. Ignoring the jury\u0027s verdict that he was responsible for the safety of the boat and those on board, he said: \u0027It\u0027s very upsetting to read these lies in the newspaper\u0027His lawyers at Tuckers Solicitors, which has offices around the country, were in communication with their client all along.Under client confidentiality rules, they were not in a position to help Scotland Yard find him and repeatedly stressed they didn\u0027t know where he was in any case.Not that the Metropolitan Police covered themselves in glory either. Officers, it emerged, were tipped off that Shepherd had fled to Georgia more than six months ago yet did nothing.The Georgian authorities invited their British counterparts to belatedly join the hunt for the killer, who is believed to have entered the country after disappearing nearly a year ago, but the offer wasn\u0027t taken up.Charlotte\u0027s family met Home Secretary Sajid Javid this week and he vowed to \u0027strain every sinew\u0027 to catch him.That meeting followed a campaign by the Daily Mail which put up a £25,000 reward to bring Shepherd to justice.          Shepherd zigzagged across the water at almost twice the speed limit of 12 knots. Sometime before midnight, the speedboat (pictured) hit a submerged log near Wandsworth Bridge and capsizedLet us remind you of the circumstances surrounding Charlotte\u0027s death on December 9, 2015, to explain why we took that decision.It was Shepherd\u0027s first date with Charlotte, who must have been more than a little impressed by the dashing, well-spoken man wining and dining her at the glamourous Oblix restaurant on the 32nd floor of the The Shard skyscraper at London Bridge.What Charlotte could not have known was that womanising Shepherd wasn\u0027t interested in romance, or even having a relationship with her or anyone else. He was a predator who had wined and dined up to ten other young women shortly before they met.Charlotte, an English literature graduate and business consultant, agreed to his suggestion that, after leaving the Oblix, they should take taxi back to his place – a houseboat on the Thames at Hammersmith, West London.  Jack Shepherd looks a different man after his time on the run. Pictured left: at the Old Bailey in 2016. Right: speaking in Georgia after his re-arrest todayMoored outside was a 14ft Fletcher Arrowflyte speedboat with a supply of champagne, for a late night, drink-fuelled spin along the river – purchased, he would later admit to detectives, to \u0027pull women\u0027.The boat was a death trap. The craft\u0027s kill cord (which is used to cut the engine if the driver becomes incapacitated) had been disconnected, the life jackets were tucked away out of reach, and the steering was faulty. Shepherd knew all this he knew that his boat was an accident waiting to happen.Still, he zigzagged across the water at almost twice the speed limit of 12 knots (14mph). And let us not forget that he had already been warned twice before by the river police about speeding. But, as we have already stated, arrogance was one of Shepherd\u0027s defining characteristics.‘I am thankful for Mariano’s support’: President Trump...Share this articleSometime before midnight, the speedboat hit a submerged log near Wandsworth Bridge and capsized. What happened next, you might think, also revealed another aspect of his character.Shepherd called out from the water for someone to \u0027help me\u0027 – not \u0027help us\u0027.Apparently Shepherd, a web designer, was still slurring his words for hours afterwards.Charlotte herself was eventually pulled from the water and died in hospital. She never regained consciousness after the accident.Due to the complexities of the case, the investigation was passed from Wandsworth CID to Scotland Yard\u0027s Homicide and Serious Crime Command.It wasn\u0027t until September 2017 that Shepherd, who had met Charlotte online, was charged with her death. He denied manslaughter and was granted unconditional bail. Then, after attending three preliminary hearings, he absconded.Charlotte\u0027s devastated family knew nothing of this until the eve of the trial, which went ahead without him in July 2018. Her mother Roz Wickens, 43, a council careline operator, expressed what everything else was thinking: \u0027There has got to be someone harbouring him, either financially or otherwise. He has got support.\u0027I don\u0027t think he\u0027s able to do this on his own.\u0027The public might now find out if that was indeed the case. He took out loans of at least £50,000 before he fled and has failed to pay back a single penny.Perhaps it is no surprise to learn that Shepherd is also facing trial for grievous bodily harm after being accused of glassing a barman, which makes the decision to grant him Legal Aid all the more astonishing.Typical of his heartless behaviour was the fact that he also married his wife – who lives in Wales with their baby son – only two months after the speedboat tragedy.Shepherd grew up in Paignton, Devon, with two younger sisters and a brother.His orced father, who worked as a product control administrator, was 40 at the time of his birth and had already fathered five children from previous relationships. His mother, 26 at the time, was a sales assistant.          Charlotte Brown, who died aged 24, on a date on a speedboat with Jack Shepherd on the Thames in 2015The couple ran a health food shop in nearby Totnes and kept what is said to have been a chaotic household (\u0027the parents were hippy-dippy types who never properly punished their kids\u0027, says one acquaintance).They split up when Shepherd was a teenager.Extremely \u0027arrogant\u0027 (that word again) is how his old teacher Richard Pennell remembers him. \u0027He thought he was better than everyone else,\u0027 he said. \u0027Despite our best efforts we weren\u0027t able to help him behave better.\u0027Since then much more has come to light about Shepherd.After leaving school in 2005, he did not go to university but went instead to London to pursue a career in IT.In 2013 he incorporated a web development company (named JSS Web after his initials). But it was struck off the register six months later without ever having filed accounts.He created a second software business, JS Digital, in 2014, again as the sole director. But Shepherd also had another, less respectable, business. He was behind a website called Dating In Kent which claimed to have more than 7,000 members and offered its users advice on \u0027how to impress on the first date\u0027. One section read: \u0027First dates should supply a window into the excitement and joy you can offer your partner, so never be afraid to think outside the box to ensure that your name is the first on your lover\u0027s lips.\u0027Another website linked to Shepherd, allegedly with 1,000 members, included a \u0027newbie\u0027s guide to no-strings sex\u0027.This is surely what he was trying to accomplish on his first – and only date – with Charlotte.This will be why he took her to the swish Oblix restaurant, an establishment which combines \u0027sophisticated, urban dining\u0027 with spectacular views over the capital. Sadly for Charlotte, it was all part of his cynical seduction routine.She had met Shepherd on an unconnected dating website. The pair had been exchanging messages for about four weeks before their fateful date.Haunting video footage retrieved from Charlotte\u0027s smartphone from that night shows the flickering lights of the capital reflected in the water as they speed along the river. Charlotte can be heard exclaiming: \u0027Oh my god, you\u0027re going so fast.\u0027Four months before the speedboat tragedy (at a time when Shepherd must have been dating his future wife), a young woman called Clare Hyam posted an image of herself \u0027drinking champers\u0027 on his boat near the Houses of Parliament.Meanwhile, several mysteriously anonymous Twitter accounts have sprung up on social media to defend Shepherd. One recently claimed that he \u0027loves\u0027 his son and is \u0027missing his family, too\u0027.Of course nothing can match the anguish and anger of poor Charlotte\u0027s family, who spoke yesterday to the BBC\u0027s Victoria Derbyshire show.Her father Graham Brown, a civil servant, told the programme: \u0027Our family do feel let down by the criminal justice system because Jack Shepherd was able to flout the law and unfortunately our daughter lost her life.\u0027His absence from trial while on unconditional bail, and just how easy it was to abscond, has surely got to be a concern.\u0027I don\u0027t know whether it\u0027s the police, the Crown Prosecution Service, the clunky justice system – but something is not right.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Theresa privately resigned delaying Brexit nine months","story":"    Labour\u0027s Yvette Cooper, pictured outside the Cabinet Office, has been working on a plan to force PM Theresa May to defer Brexit by at least nine months to avert a cliff-edge departure in March as Parliament is yet to agree a deal to leave the European Union           International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, pictured here in Davos, Switzerland, claims the plot was \u0027impossible\u0027 and suggested overturning the Brexit result would be \u0027calamitous\u0027 But sources last night said Mrs May is privately resigned to having to delay the UK’s departure date beyond March 29 if Parliament votes for Home Affairs select committee chairman Miss Cooper’s plan.One ally said that there would be ‘nothing we can do’ to prevent a delay if the plan is passed.The proposal would allow backbenchers to bring forward legislation on February 5 to extend Article 50. If passed, Mrs May would have three weeks to win a vote on her Brexit deal in Parliament before being required to seek an extension of Article 50.With Labour hinting it will back Miss Cooper’s bid, and a number of Tory Remainers also indicating support, the move has a realistic chance of success.Instagram \u0027ghouls\u0027 are accused of making \u0027suicide porn\u0027...Father of 14-year-old girl who took her own life after...Share this articleAllies of the Prime Minister fear the move would release the pressure on the EU to compromise – and believe that it would leave ministers until only February 5 to come forward with a new plan.One said: ‘Yvette Cooper’s amendment is of a different order to the others. The rest are expressions of parliamentary will – in theory, she could ignore them.‘But Cooper is proposing legislation. If that passes there is nothing we can do.‘It’s massively unhelpful. We’d have a week to try to persuade the Commons not to back the bill or Brexit would be delayed and the pressure would come off the EU.’Miss Cooper’s bid to seize control of the Brexit process will be debated and voted on by MPs on Tuesday.Her proposal, drawn up in conjunction with former Tory minister Nick Boles, would tear up Britain’s constitutional conventions and allow backbench MPs to push through legislation in the face of Government opposition.          Theresa May has to return to Parliament later this month with her new Brexit dealLabour yesterday signalled it would back the controversial bid to delay Brexit.Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said it was ‘highly likely’ that Labour would support the move, although he suggested it might push for the Brexit delay to be limited to three months.He added: ‘Yvette Cooper has put an amendment down, which I think is sensible... so I think it’s increasingly likely already that we’ll have to take that option because the Government has run the clock down.’Shadow Cabinet Office minister Jon Trickett argued that the plan would help stop a No Deal Brexit, adding: ‘If a resolution comes forward, in principle yes we can back it.’ A spokesman for Jeremy Corbyn, who held private talks with Miss Cooper about the issue last night, suggested the Labour leader might even be prepared to open talks with Mrs May if the prospect of a No Deal Brexit is pushed back.Eight pro-Remain Tory MPs have also backed the plan, with more expected to follow suit in the coming days. Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has urged Mrs May to allow a free vote – and warned that a string of ministers could resign to back the proposal if she does not.But some Labour MPs in Brexit supporting areas are opposed to the move, meaning Tuesday night’s vote could be tight.Former minister Caroline Flint yesterday indicated she would oppose the plan and said those pushing it ‘don’t want to leave the EU and are using Parliament to frustrate the process’.Dr Fox also questioned the motives of those behind the plan, saying: ‘There are many who talk about delaying Brexit when what they really mean is not having Brexit at all.’ He warned that overturning the referendum result would lead to ‘calamitous’ political consequences.Extending Article 50 would also require the unanimous consent of the other 27 EU countries.Pierre Moscovici, EU commissioner for economic affairs, said this would be granted only if it was clear that the UK had an alternative plan it needed time to implement.He told Bloomberg News: ‘An extension is a possible scenario, but for that there are two things required. First, we have to have unanimity on that.‘I am not so worried about that, because until now the 27 have been united, and I don’t see why that would change. Second, you need to have a reasoned request (from the UK), meaning we are not going to extend just because we are not there. We need to know why we extend. What for? What is the plan?’The development came as Downing Street confirmed Theresa May and her husband Philip hosted a private dinner at Chequers for DUP leader Arlene Foster, her deputy Nigel Dodds and their partners as part of a Brexit charm offensive.The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has warned British MPs that ‘opposing a No Deal will not stop a No Deal from happening’ unless they agree to support an alternative.Mrs May invited Nicola Sturgeon and Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford to join a Cabinet committee preparing the UK for Brexit, with or without a deal.George Osborne warned that a hardcore of Tory Remainers would side with Labour to force a general election if Mrs May tries to take Britain out of the EU without a deal. "},{"url":null,"title":"QUENTIN LETTS Reshuffle poser led buttocky wriggling","story":"Prime Minister Theresa May, pictured, tried to defend sending several cabinet ministers to Davos and was rightly attacked by Jeremy CorbynI could dwell on Mr Corbyn kicking at the self-appointed sultans of the World Economic Forum in Davos, to which Mrs May has, for some unholy reason, despatched various ministers – a waste of money, morally stinky.

They were mocking Mr Fabricant’s hair, which is possibly someone else’s hair, if hair it be at all. Miss Tolhurst was until recently in the whips’ office. Former whips are usually more grown-up.Instead, let me describe two moments, one comical, one sad.Peter Bone (Con, Wellingborough), a Eurosceptic who has watched Mrs May’s diluted Brexit plans in horror, told her: ‘Your Government is stuffed full of Remainer ministers who do not want to leave the EU.‘Would you replace them with colleagues from these benches who actually believe in upholding the decision of the British people to leave the EU on 29 March?’ Corker.          Peter Bone asked Mrs May whether she would consider replacing her Remainer ministers with people who believe in BrexitMrs May good-naturedly wondered if Mr Bone was applying for a job.Actually, he was making a point one often hears raised by Tory activists who have lost patience with Cabinet ministers being wilfully anti-Brexit.If you doubt the galvanised engagement of Tory members, you should have been with me later when I tried to get into a Bruges Group speech by Jacob Rees-Mogg. There was not a hope. The place was packed.But back to Mr Bone. Remainer Cabinet ministers squirmed on their sphincters when he suggested a reshuffle. Chancellor Philip Hammond shook his head. Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, looking utterly whacked (I have never seen her more hollow-eyed), gave a ghostly smile. Tory Party chairman Brandon Lewis and Education Secretary Whatsisname Hinds affected mirth.Beside them was pro-Brexit Transport Secretary Chris Grayling. He was not smiling at all. Perhaps he agreed with Mr Bone. Non-entity Cabinet sponges such as Lidington, Mundell and Bradley do need moving. Is it mere fancy to imagine that anti-Brexit Miss Rudd, recently returned to high office, will resign? I suspect it is not. But goodness, what buttocky wriggling Mr Bone’s question caused.          Jeremy Corbyn, pictured, amed Mrs May’s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, as a supporter of the customs union. Little Barwell, in a civil servants’ box, blushed like a strawberry lollipopAnd then the sad moment. John Mann (Lab, Bassetlaw), better by miles than most of the careerist greasers in this stinking reed marsh, asked Mrs May about emergency mental health care for youngsters. He spoke about Nathan Garrett, 18, a volunteer in his local party, a ‘brilliant, engaging, kind young man’ who was a county athletics champ and gifted musician. Shortly before Christmas he had sought help from a mental health crisis team and it had not been forthcoming.Voice almost cracking, Mr Mann recounted being told that everything had become too much for Nathan and he had taken his own life.Nathan’s parents and grandmother were in the gallery. Who can know what they felt as they listened to Mr Mann’s words, and Mrs May’s well-chosen, tender reply? Tears were somehow blinked and brushed aside.

Did I sense any regret about the situation he’d left behind? Not really’ This picture has actually lost me a few jobs. Plus I think I might even have lost a flat because of it. I was looking at a property and was chatting to the estate agent and told them that I’d recently shot David Cameron. We put an offer in – for the asking price – but it was turned down. So yes, I do suspect people don’t like David Cameron.But when you shoot someone like Cameron, though, you have to remain neutral. If you turn up thinking too many things then you’ll inevitably forget something, or position the lighting wrong, and the subject will get irritated. You have to go in with clarity. Whether you’re a former prime minister or a bus driver, I’ll always have the same clarity of thought.The photograph came about as part of a project I was working on, aiming to capture interesting faces in the style of artists such as Holbein and Caravaggio. It took place in Cameron’s office, almost exactly one year after his resignation. My degree is in medieval history, and so shooting people who are part of our history like this gives me an excuse to touch history.He arrived in his gym clothing, which was rather funny, and he was worried he looked a bit pasty. I explained my ideas, and about how I wanted to capture this sort of meditative statesman feeling. I wanted a sense of looking backwards at the current political situation.I was worried that Cameron might be a difficult person to photograph, but as a sitter he proved to be a darling. He had a lot of patience. You have to separate politics from the person, and he was a charming chap.I knew the public would be wondering, what is he thinking? That’s why I wanted him in this pose, shot in profile. There are no other pictures of Cameron like this – the others normally capture the signature “call me Dave” look. But now he’s not in power he can afford to show more emotion and try different poses.I do think the contemplation was genuine. I’ve worked with a lot of actors in Los Angeles so I know what faking it looks like. I’ve also worked with many politicians, both Conservative and Labour, and when I ask for a certain look, some of them can turn around instantly with that expression. But David seemed to me a genuine guy, a family man, who had a real sense of the seriousness of office. Did I sense any regret about the situation he’d left behind? Not really.However, I never mentioned the B-word during the half hour we had for the sitting. I decided that wouldn’t have been a good idea. But he seemed very happy to talk about other things throughout his career. He told me that the most interesting place he’d visited was Libya after Gaddafi.I was inspired by Sir James Guthrie, the realist painter who depicted a lot of politicians straight after the first world war. They’d experienced all that horror and history, and he captured that moment. Backdrops are important for me. Guthrie painted in a muddy brown, suggestive of the trenches. I went with a fading blue backdrop. You can interpret that as the European flag fading away, or simply as the blue of Conservatism.I’m a realist photographer so I like to capture everything – the grey hairs, blotchy skin, all the details and lines. I want to say – this was the true image of David Cameron at this moment in history.He’s not the first leader I’ve photographed – I did John Major back in 2017 for another project. When I went to shoot him there was a sense of betrayal there. It was in his mouth, in his breath. But with David there was not that sense. He was energetic, almost raring to go. There was a restlessness I could really sense. I think he wants to return after this Brexit situation is resolved. I think he’ll be back.Born: Chester, 1982.Training: King’s College London.Influences: Caravaggio, Titian, Ribera, HolbeinHigh point: ‘Sir Patrick Stewart portrait sitting, New York.’Low point: ‘Not picking up a camera after I graduated.’Top tip: ‘Direction, direction, direction: break the ice with your subjects.’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc22c891578aa3acbb862dbfbc706b56da578f06/0_0_1238_1449/master/1238.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3bcbc1acc0e88449ea348c1a602a466a 1320w","title":"hold the front pages meet the endpaper enthusiasts","story":"In a small sanctuary from world events, book lovers gather to sigh over the most beautiful decorative pages and compare techniquesFaced with the hideous maw that is today’s news cycle, there could be little more soothing than slipping into the esoteric world of We Love Endpapers, a society for enthusiasts to share their favourite examples of the most beautiful pages bookending tomes.Endpapers date back to at least the 15th century, when pieces of old manuscript or vellum would be used to help sew a book block into its binding, and to protect it. By the 17th century, they were being used as decorative items today, they can feature everything from maps to an extra shot of artwork from a book’s illustrator.Membership of We Love Endpapers has mushroomed over the last two years, says antiquarian bookseller Simon Beattie, who initially founded the group just for his friends. Its nearly 3,000 members now include antiquarian booksellers, special collections librarians, private collectors and book designers. “Everyone is very civilised,” he says. “Everyone just likes endpapers and looking at books.”Defined simply – and comfortingly – as “a place for people to post pictures of nice endpapers they come across”, recent examples shared online by members range from the vibrantly beautiful examples in a 1776 German edition of Tristram Shandy to the gilt birds on a pink background inside a French manuscript of chansons, made for a young woman in the 1790s. Far from the madding crowd of today’s politics, the book lovers discuss, in painstaking detail, the different techniques used: marbling, sprinkling, block-printing, embossing …“LOVELY,” proclaims one member describing an 18th-century Scottish binding’s decorative endpapers. “Splendid! I would like to see the spine,” declares another. “Such a beautiful combination!! Love the red and gold bestiary, and as for the binding ... superb!” says a third.“Just yesterday a librarian in Durham had a question about a particular style of marbling. Within a couple of hours her question had been answered and the technique identified, by a paper marbler in Chile,” says Beattie. He first fell for endpapers when he started out as a bookseller, 20 years ago: “I’d seen marbled papers before, but I hadn’t seen the block-printed ones, and I sort of fell in love with these 18th-century things. Some of them are surprisingly modern. The colours are often very vibrant. Because they’re inside the book they haven’t faded, become marked or dust-soiled. They remain the colour they were when that book was bound.”Beattie has become something of an endpapers spokesman since launching the group, recently writing a piece for the Antiquarian Booksellers’ Association of America in which he lays out a short history of hand-pressed endpapers.Marbling, developed in Asia as early as the 12th century, “is achieved not directly on to the sheet of paper itself, but on a liquid called the marbling ‘size’ … Marbling paints are then sprinkled on to the size, in a flat tray, where they can either be left to float, or be manipulated with tools such as needles or combs to produce the decoration desired the paper is then laid on to the size and the pattern thus transferred on to the paper.” Sprinkling, used since the 16th century, involves running a finger along a loaded brush to distribute drops of paint over the paper. “It was a particularly popular in Germany, where it is known as Kiebitzpapier (literally, ‘lapwing paper’, as the speckled effect was thought similar to the pattern found on some birds’ eggs),” writes Beattie. Embossing, which alters the paper with a raised texture, found popularity in the 18th century. It often uses one of Beattie’s favourite techniques, Dutch gilt – a misnomer, since they were made in Germany and Italy, but exported to Britain via the Netherlands.“It’s nice to come across things make you go, ‘Wow!’” says Beattie. “It’s a bit like if you see the inside of a man’s suit, if it’s got a fancy lining – a flash of colour, it’s nice!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1321ce207000bd01cde42de410f8069d76591a22/0_242_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05d120534696ac96658059c3e55ee76b","title":"patisserie valerie cafes shut old compton street london","story":"Original outlet in London’s Soho among those closed at cost of 920 jobsLuke Johnson, the multimillionaire chairman of collapsed cafe chain Patisserie Valerie, has extracted more than £40m from the business since the cafe group floated on the stock market less than five years ago.Other shareholders are considering legal action after their investments in Patisserie Holdings, the parent company of brands including Patisserie Valerie, Druckers Vienna Patisserie and Philpotts, were wiped out when the business went into administration on Tuesday.More than 900 staff have already lost their jobs as the administrator, KPMG, announced on Wednesday that 71 outlets had closed immediately, including the original Patisserie Valerie outlet, which has been trading on Old Compton Street in central London since the 1940s.The company has been in crisis since October, when a £40m black hole in its finances was blamed on “potentially fraudulent” accounting irregularities. Earlier this week the company said it had been unable to renew its bank facilities as a “direct result of the significant fraud”.In November it secured £15m in new cash from shareholders in a bid to keep trading.Johnson, who bought Patisserie Valerie in 2006, sold nearly £23m of shares when the company floated in 2014 and nearly £13m a year later and has also collected idends and a £60,000 a year salary. There is no suggestion that the entrepreneur was involved in any fraudulent activity.He has loaned the company a net £13m in recent months, most of which is unlikely to be paid back.Former chief executive Paul May took out nearly £11m in share sales, pay and idends, including more than £2.6m in profits on sales of share options last year, according to  research. Former finance director Chris Marsh made more than £4.4m including profits of £2m on share options in 2018.Marsh was arrested by Hertfordshire police and bailed in October. He resigned that month.The Unite union blamed government inaction over financial regulation for putting jobs at riskUnite assistant general secretary Gail Cartmail said: “Workers at Patisserie Valerie are the innocent victims of bandit capitalism, they have been failed by the government which has failed to take action to end these practices.“This latest corporate collapse demonstrates why the financial regulators are not fit for purpose, they need to be able to take action before a company collapses, rather than after jobs are lost.“Since Carillion’s collapse the government has continued as though it is business as normal and has ignored all suggestions to initiate vitally needed reforms.”The administrators running the collapsed cafe group said they are “hopeful of a positive outcome” for the remains of the business even though more than a third of its outlets have already closed with the loss of 920 jobs.Patisserie Valerie on Old Compton Street closed on Tuesday night, along with 51 of the chain’s other outlets including concessions in Debenhams and Next. The entire 19-strong Druckers cafe chain has also closed.David Costley-Wood, a partner at KPMG and joint administrator, said the group’s remaining 122 outlets would continue to trade while the administrators seek a buyer for the business.“Since our appointment less than 24 hours ago, we have been pleased with the level of interest we have received in the business,” he said.“In the meantime, we can reassure customers that across the remaining 122 stores, it is all but business as usual.”The chief executive of Patisserie Holdings, Steve Francis, who stepped in to try and turn the company around after the potential fraud emerged, said the administration was a “genuinely positive development”.“I would rather have 2,000 fully employed staff than 3,000 with no future,” he told The Grocer trade journal.He said the “cloak of uncertainty” surrounding the details of the group’s accounts including its profitability meant that “no half sensible banker was going to back that situation”. visited a number of central London stores where staff claimed they had not been briefed on their future yet. “We haven’t been told anything,” said one. “We are working as normal.”In another of its cafes, a waitress said she did not know where she would go if she lost her job, adding: “For the moment, we are open.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22cb23c0f7579be5664d2108cc829b9b399a1437/0_90_2702_1621/master/2702.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b2e58d3159e9227056c86aa64a26d36","title":"airbus brands uk government handling of brexit a disgrace","story":"CEO pleads for people not to ignore Brexiters’ ‘madness’ and warns no-deal would prompt ‘very harmful decisions’Airbus has branded the UK government’s handling of Brexit a “disgrace” and warned the aerospace firm could pull out of the UK if the country crashes out of the EU without a deal.In a video message released on Thursday, Tom Enders, the chief executive, warned that if there was a no-deal Brexit, Airbus would have to make “potentially very harmful decisions for the UK”.He added: “Please don’t listen to the Brexiteers’ madness which asserts that because have huge plants here we will not move and we will always be here.

These turn the food into nutritious meals and provide support for vulnerable people.Currently about 43,000 tonnes of surplus food is redistributed from retailers and food manufacturers every year, the government says. But it estimates a further 100,000 tonnes of food – equating to 250m meals a year – is edible and readily available but goes uneaten and thrown away.There are more than 1,000 UK community cooks working in local authorities and charities but who face the challenge of how to make the most of unusual or unexpected ingredients and large quantities of fresh seasonal produce. Tesco’s development chefs have worked with Jamie Oliver to produce nutritionally balanced recipes.“It’s fantastic to join the work that Tesco and FareShare are doing to reduce food waste,” said Jamie Oliver. “I’ve written these recipes to arm all those amazing community cooks with the tools to create something delicious and balanced for people who need it the most.”The FareShare, chief executive, Lindsey Boswell said: “With Tesco’s support, FareShare is working with charities across the country to help feed hundreds of thousands of people in need every week. Most of these charities provide meals made by community cooks, who may already have lots of experience and just need some new ideas or they could do with a really good grounding in nutrition and the scaling up of meals.”MPs recently urged the government to appoint a minister for hunger in a new report which warned that nearly two million people in the UK may be undernourished.The government recently appointed a “food waste champion” in an attempt to eliminate food waste going to landfill by 2030."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9dd5c541ed87b220263076066d2f90e35b65f4e0/0_120_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b625f2888d06f0308eb40978a089a94f","title":"davos 2019 hammond faces uk businesses over brexit live","story":"Rolling coverage of the third day of the World Economic Forum, as Philip Hammond addresses business leaders on Brexit and leaders debate the way forward for EuropeHancock says the second area of focus, after prevention, will be innovation.He says there has been a major lack of development of new antibiotics in recent years. No new innovation in the basic bedrock of every health service in the world which is shocking and deeply troubling.He says the focus has been on expensive new cancer and heart drugs for instance, limiting the time and money spent on new antibiotics.The health secretary says the UK will be looking for advice from the livestock industry, which has successfully reduced the use of antibiotics.Doctors, vets farmers and patients will all be included in the discussions.Matt Hancock says he couldn’t look his children in the eye unless he was doing all he could to act on mounting resistance to antibiotics.Britian’s health secretary is speaking in Davos to launch a five year plan of action. “The urgency is now,” he says.The focus will be on three areas: prevention, innovation and collaboration. Everyone can play a part by only using antibiotics when they are really needed.Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister, broke the news in Davos...Up in the mountains around Davos, climate change scientists at the Arctic basecamp will today urge world leaders to do more to rein in carbon emissions. They’re holding a session with musician and environmental campaigner Ellie Goulding, along with former executive secretary of the UNFCCC and Mission 2020 convenor Christiana Figueres, and 16-year old climate activist Greta Thunberg.Despite significant progress in the low carbon economy, scientific evidence in 2018 showed that emissions are again rising, and the sustainable target is 1.5C, not 2C as previously thought.Furthermore, disappointing outcomes from the COP24 in Katowice did not raise ambitions to a level that will save the planet.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the third day of the World Economic Forum.“Brexit is like Groundhog Day without the happy ending,” bemoaned one senior UK economist last night, as anxiety over Britain’s exit from the EU continue to rattle Davos.Chancellor Philip Hammond is in town, and understood to be breakfasting with around 30 business leaders this morning. He’s then speaking at the CBI’s traditional lunch, where he can expect a rough ride from chief executives who are watching the clock tick down to 29 March with growing exasperation and alarm.So what’s UK PLC’s message to Hammond? “Just sort it”, says one City figure, who fears a six month extension would just mean six months more uncertainty and deadlock.It’s not all work, of course - top bankers such as UBS’s Axel Weber rubbed shoulders with trade secretary Liam Fox and former Brexit secretary David Davis at a whisky tasting last night, organised by Aberdeen Standard.But as a bagpiper played a dirge outside, City figures said they’re no more reassured about Brexit than at the start of the week. They’re looking to Hammond to push back against cabinet ministers who lean towards a no-deal Brexit. Hammond is also due to appear on a panel at WEF this morning, to discuss Europe. He’ll be accompanied by EC trade commissioner Cecilia Malmström, Santander chair Ana Botín, Leo Varadkar, the Taoiseach of Ireland, Dutch PM Mark Rutte, and Mateusz Morawiecki, the prime minister of Poland.Health minister Matt Hancock is announcing a new programme to fight antimicrobial resistance. Last night, he told me that the issue was crucial: “Antimicrobial resistance, if we don’t get ahead of it, will mean that antibiotics can’t work, and the consequences would be devastating for the world. If these antibiotics cease to work - as they’re starting to cease to work - we won’t be able to live modern life as we know it.”Bank of England governor Mark Carney is also making an appearance, to discuss whether the global financial architecture needs to change.Here’s what’s on the agenda"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3adf5aa4ddd3c6d0eef8b221b20692dd9997a14b/0_8_2449_1469/master/2449.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88e48bcf9e1dff0b8aafcc9c4c1f8549","title":"which is the worlds most lgbt friendly city","story":"Even when cities seem progressive on the surface, the lived experience of members of the LGBT community can tell a dramatically different storyAmid a mass of colour and pounding Latin rhythms, revellers at this year’s Bogotá Pride march waved banners stating “not one step back”. They were among tens of thousands who took to the streets to celebrate and support Colombia’s LGBT community.Many annual Pride marches that were once solemn protests against repression have become celebrations of now-existing rights or progress, reflecting the strength of LGBT communities. In Bogotá, for example, the capital of a macho and socially conservative country, there has been surprising progress in LGBT rights.In March, Angélica Lozano Correa, a former member of the Bogotá city council, became the first openly LGBT person to be elected to the country’s Senate. In 2016 the country’s government passed laws allowing same-sex couples to adopt and marry, and the previous year it granted transgender people the right to change their identity on official government documents – policies which have allowed more equality and openness.But while these laws and political representation might suggest Bogotá is “friendly” and tolerant of the LGBT community, the issue is not clear-cut. This year’s Bogotá Pride march was marked by an undertone of resistance to and fear of the right-wing government of the new president, Ivan Duque.Duque openly opposes the LGBT-inclusive peace agreement his predecessor, Juan Manuel Santos, signed with leftist rebels Farc in 2016. Activists claim he is also against same-sex marriage and adoption rights.“Although the government promised there would be no setbacks to LGBT rights, the appointment of several anti-LGBT officials, cuts in resources for public policies and the continued strengthening of radical religious movements that promote hate speech and misinformation against the LGBT population are worrying,” says Marcela Sánchez, director of Colombia Diversa, a leading LGBT rights organisation.Indeed, determining a city’s attitude towards the LGBT community is complex. Studies that try to do this often look at political or legal metrics such as freedom to marry, or laws protecting against discrimination.Equaldex, a collaborative knowledge base for the global LGBT movement that maps the legality of homosexuality, identifies a number of factors including freedom to change gender and to adopt – although it hasn’t ranked countries or cities in order of best to worst.An index from the Human Rights Campaign looks at municipal services, law enforcement and the city leadership’s public position on equality across the US.Seventy-eight out of 506 US cities had a “perfect score” of 100, for reasons such as introducing trans-inclusive health benefits to city employees, as in Brookings, South Dakota. Birmingham, Alabama, obtained a full score for passing comprehensive nondiscrimination ordinances, along with other cities such as Cleveland in Ohio, a state that had previously prohibited same-sex marriage and civil unions.However, the Human Rights Campaign clearly states its index does not and cannot reflect a city’s friendliness.Other global surveys have tried to assess friendliness by covering public attitudes, access to nightlife and personal safety. A 2017 survey by the housing website Nestpick ranked the best LGBT cities by asking thousands of people how friendly they felt their city was based on safety and nightlife. Madrid, Amsterdam and Toronto came out as the top three.Arguably the size of the LGBT population in urban areas could reflect the level of friendliness, as “many LGBTI folk head to cities from rural areas because of the promise of a freer, more tolerant life there,” says André du Plessis, executive director of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association.But even when cities seem progressive on the surface, the lived experience of members of the LGBT community can tell a dramatically different story.Brazil’s second-largest city, Rio de Janeiro, has been branding itself as an LGBT tourist destination for years. It has made huge efforts in providing anti-bullying projects aimed at students, and has outlawed discrimination in nightclubs. However, the last year has seen record numbers of violent attacks against the queer community.And with a newly elected far-right government, there are fears it could get worse.Conversely, in some countries with backward and dangerous attitudes to the LGBT community, such as Iran and Saudi Arabia, discreet but vibrant underground scenes can thrive. This is even the case in Russia, where activists say two people were killed last week and nearly 40 detained, as part of a new homophobic crackdown by police in the Chechnya region.“You’ll find a gay scene in many places that may surprise you,” says Ed Salvato, an LGBT travel expert. “Some places like Moscow and St Petersburghave vibrant gay communities, despite the homophobic laws there.”In Dublin, an exciting scene exploded out of a staunchly Catholic country.“Dublin is like gay Disneyland now, and that wasn’t the case 20 or 30 years ago,” says Prof Andrew Reynolds, founder of the University of North Carolina’s LGBTQ Representation and Rights Research Initiative.“With the last couple of referendums, Ireland and Dublin have embraced their new presentation as an inclusive, progressive and loving place.”He says: “They went to Australia. They went to America. Now they’ve come home.”The political glass ceiling has broken for many LGBT people across the world, which inevitably has ripple effects on the community. Minneapolis made US history last year by electing Andrea Jenkins, the first openly trans woman of colour to office in 2017. The gay stronghold of Palm Springs, California, has elected an entire city council that identifies as LGBT. And in November, Jared Polis became the first openly gay man to be elected as a US state governor.In Poland, one of Europe’s most Catholic and conservative countries, voters in the small city of Slupsk this year elected a gay atheist mayor, Robert Biedron. Just a few years ago, Biedron was attacked on the streets of his city because of his sexuality.In Kathmandu, Nepal, Sunil Pant became Asia’s first openly gay federal-level elected official in 2008, resulting in a spate of public scrutiny.“I think that the spinoff is that Kathmandu is a lot more gay-friendly than it was before,” says Reynolds. “Whilst it is not perfect by any stretch, like Bogotá, it is a place now that I feel like is much more friendly and accepting – and that’s obviously coming from a place where the Hindu religion was not helpful before.”As the most direct representatives of citizens, city officials are uniquely positioned to understand and address the needs of their communities, says Xavier Persad of the Human Rights Campaign, pointing to “the need to provide for one’s family without the fear of being fired, to secure housing without the fear of eviction, and to participate in community life”.“When cities enact LGBTQ-inclusive protections,” he adds, “they send a clear message that they value and welcome everyone, attracting the country’s top talent and spurring economic growth.”Ultimately, even the most progressive laws and equal representation at political levels do not necessarily reflect the efficiency of enforcement, or indeed capture the lived experience of discrimination and fear many LGBT people face every day.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04dc981106ad569046908624ba8a4897e7139225/182_274_2970_1781/master/2970.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fcd0c5fe1093cdcb3291d007a187a02f","title":"irish readers citizens assembly worked brexit","story":"Ireland’s assembly of 99 citizens found consensus on emotive issues – a model readers think could help the Brexit processWhile the Brexit debacle rumbles ever on, several outcomes are on the table, including the possibility of a second referendum. Some, including this newspaper, have suggested that if a second referendum were to happen, a way forward could be for the UK to follow the model adopted by Ireland to try and break the stalemate over an emotive issue that had dogged its politics for decades: abortion.We wanted to find out from Irish citizens why they felt the assembly helped to bring about consensus. Here’s what some of them said.Dee, works in education, County Louth Abortion has long been considered politically toxic in Ireland, with our elected representatives loth to touch it in case it alienated their constituents and risked their political careers. The Citizens’ Assembly took the debate out of this realm of fearful self-interested calculation and into a forum where evidence and experience could take centre stage. Interest in the workings of the assembly meant that the media could report on this evidence, leading to a better-informed public and lessening the hysteria that circulates around debates based on dogma. It led to a growing realisation that the 8th amendment affected people in a wide variety of ways even during wanted pregnancies, and revealed the chilling effect it had on medical professionals’ ability to provide necessary healthcare. The members of the assembly were faced with expert testimony on medical and legal matters but also testimony from their fellow citizens whose lives were deeply impacted by the 8th.It meant that there was a long lead-in to the referendum during which debate was reasoned and detailed, before the inevitable agitation of the campaign itself. The fact that it was citizens who recommended the terms of the referendum and informed the proposed legislation introduced greater clarity, and meant voters did not just have to trust politicians since a representative body of their fellow citizens had carefully reflected on the matter and recommended these changes following significant education and deep reflection on the situation. I think the success of the Citizens’ Assembly is evidenced by the fact that the proportion in favour of repeal mirrored so closely the final vote.I was initially very sceptical. The previous discussions on abortion were rife with emotion, and the country was very ided. I was dreading the decisive nature of what I thought was a cop-out. However, I was completely wrong. Issues were discussed logically and with complete transparency and fairness. The result was a revelation in many ways. The extreme for and against arguments were shown to be just that: extreme arguments. The plain, simple facts were what mattered and brought logic to an apparently intractable issue.It is an unbeatable process. I think it would have helped the whole Brexit process had it been followed. However, Ireland had to go through years of hell to finally use it. A shame that our friends and neighbours did not follow it, but then a nation has to have its own learning curve.The Citizens’ Assembly meant the discussion about our abortion laws was led by the people rather than politicians. It’s interesting to see international interest in it, as at the time a lot of people felt it was set up as a way of kicking the can down the road. An awful lot of people against the 8th amendment were calling for the assembly to be scrapped and wanted an immediate referendum. The sentiment was understandable but I personally felt it would have been incredibly irresponsible and undemocratic to hold a referendum on revoking the 8th amendment without having proposed legislation as to what would go in its place. It is absolutely critical that people understand what it is they are voting for.Crucially, a citizens’ assembly is non-partisan and so it creates a people-led discussion and understanding of an issue. I think this also helps create a debate that isn’t dominated by black-and-white mantras from political parties but a more nuanced discussion of the issue in question. Furthermore, politics can feel far removed from the average person and so the discussion and findings can feel far more relatable.There was no trouble accessing the assembly findings as every time they met, the national TV channel, the newspapers and online-only news forums comprehensively reported the assembly’s activities. Unless you chose to stick your head in the clouds, you could not avoid hearing or reading about the assembly. This was not done in an overbearing way, as initially the assembly met once a month, so you were content to tune in to update yourself. I feel this was very important for people who never would have considered voting in favour of abortion. It motivated young people to vote for a subject very important to them, and opened up debate among people in general. The greatest thing the assembly did was get balanced and truthful information out among the people of Ireland.A citizens’ assembly has revealed itself to me to be a vital tool in a democracy – it takes the debating of a contentious issue right back down into the hands of people on the electoral roll. This is great as our politicians are so often tied into a certain viewpoint based on political agenda, party politics or personal gain. I feel a citizens’ assembly would be a very helpful tool in the Brexit dilemma.The assembly facilitated the presentation of a whole range of views and insights on the topic. The media coverage of presentations triggered a lot of discussion. Expert input at the forum informed public opinion and thus facilitated greater understanding of the issues at play in crisis pregnancies. For many, the revelation that abortion pills could be bought on the internet was a game changer. Clearly, women taking such pills without medical supervision are seriously imperilled. The realisation that abortion was already reasonably prevalent in our society led people to see that it is best for society to accept its reality and provide for safe provision under medical care.The Citizens’ Assembly, with due thanks to its chair, provided a forum where the real story was told. The broad spectrum of experience, case histories and moral viewpoints was set out for evaluation and consideration. Misrepresentation was not an option, for proponents or opponents. There was no “bluster bus”. If there is a second Brexit referendum, it should be preceded by a citizens’ assembly, chaired by an experienced judge and supported by an expert team of fact checkers.It felt very democratic. All sides were addressed. It very much helped me – not to decide as I already knew how I was voting, but to listen, understand and develop empathy for those who planned to vote the other way. The issue was a very complex and isive one, and the Citizens’ Assembly helped the issue be seen from all sides. This is not a simple issue of right or wrong. Interpersonal discussions on the issue often became emotional, leading to them becoming deadlocked. The Citizens’ Assembly kept information flowing whether we liked to hear it or not. The fact that it was made up entirely of my peers, and that through the assembly we the voters were exposed to the thoughts and opinions of experts from both sides, very much helped to establish a belief that this was a vote of the people and that we were being given all the information available in order to make up our minds. We weren’t being preached at or lied to."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/deac47cabf1e2516296116ecac2461cae16854a0/0_99_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d27ae9078b660c9b20d11fbc2d8ad3a","title":"compromise brexit good friday agreement britain","story":"Brexit is a reminder that two connected things need to happen in order for a political compromise to stick. First, partisan leaders must decide that it is better than any other achievable outcome. Second, the public must also converge to give it their backing. One movement towards the treaty table without the other doesn’t cut it.The Northern Ireland peace process was a classic example of this dual process. It took many years before mutually antagonistic political leaders decided that a peace deal was better than an unwinnable war. But it took even longer for the two communities in Northern Ireland to begin to make the same move. The peace process only worked because the political deal was followed by referendums that endorsed it.Yet in comparison with Brexit it now looks relatively straightforward. This is partly because almost all the thinking about how to settle the Brexit argument focuses on Westminster. Seven days ago, in the wake of Theresa May’s drubbing over her deal, I wrote that it was now time for her to compromise on Brexit. I still think that’s true. But it skates over the question of whether the British people would see such a move as acceptable, and what might follow if they did not.Finding a compromise is formidably difficult, even in Westminster. The reasons are familiar. The two main leaders are at odds with their own parties. Parliament’s law-making procedures make it hard to intervene. The tribalism of politics makes cooperation fragile. There may be a majority against no deal, but there isn’t a majority – yet – in favour of anything.Parliament is getting heat for this failure, and the chorus is likely to grow louder next week. Yet broader opinion is ided too. There is almost no consensus among voters about what should happen now. Though MPs are often lambasted for being out of touch, the uncertainties at Westminster reflect those of the public.At a conference in London this week organised by The UK in a Changing Europe, called Brexit and Public Opinion 2019, it became clear how deep this problem has become. In his keynote address, the political scientist John Curtice argued that the practical problem with Brexit is that there is very little middle ground on which the two sides can make trades. If you are looking for a Brexit outcome that satisfies the two key tests – first, that it should have overall majority support, and second, that it should have majority support on both sides – then the search so far has been unavailing.May regards her own deal, not entirely unreasonably, as a compromise already. But it is not just the Commons that dislikes her deal. Twice as many voters oppose it as support it, though often for wildly different reasons. As Curtice put it this week, May has succeeded in uniting a ided country in opposition to the agreement she has made with the European Union.However, none of the other alternatives is popular either. Most remainers continue to support remaining, hence their backing for a second referendum. Most leavers, though, still want to leave, with the largest group of them wanting to leave even without a deal. Compromise efforts soon run into the fact that this is a party ide too. Labour is an overwhelmingly remain party. The Tories are equally emphatically for leave. Neither side is keen enough on the options in between.It is true that about a third of remainers say they could support a Norway-plus solution as a second-best – but leavers see this as very much a remainers’ compromise, because it accepts EU rules and regulations. For a proportion of leavers, a renegotiation is seen as the second-best option – but remainers are suspicious of that they see going back to Brussels as a hard-Brexit ploy. The much-touted second referendum option falls into the same ide. With opinion among Tory voters now so emphatically in the leave camp, there is little incentive for May to move in the direction of a softer Brexit, let alone a second vote.Curtice’s view is not unchallenged. In a Bloomberg article today, Matt Singh of Number Cruncher Politics argues, on the basis of NCP’s own polling, that May’s deal is in fact the closest thing to a consensus among public opinion. At first sight, this is a weird claim, since May’s deal is far less popular in Singh’s poll than either remaining in the EU or leaving with no deal. However, when people are asked if these other outcomes might be personally acceptable to them, May’s deal vaults into a narrow lead. This deal is “unloved, but it’s the closest thing to a compromise that most could live with,” Singh argues.He could be right, if Westminster opinion this week is any guide. The determination of MPs like Yvette Cooper and Nick Boles to prevent no deal may now be alarming hard-Brexit Tories who fear the process will be delayed and softened. Some of them may decide they could live with a form of May’s deal after all. If she is able to cobble together a majority, it is possible that public opinion, exhausted by Brexit, might also fall into line.It would not, though, be much of a compromise. The most obvious accommodation on Brexit – a soft exit along Norway lines – might have succeeded if David Cameron had decided to stay, if May had embraced it early on, or if Jeremy Corbyn had been a different kind of Labour leader. But those chances have come and gone. One of the striking aspects of the Brexit standoff since 2016 is not just the absence of a middle ground, but the absence of political leaders who speak for it. Brexit has had no John Hume to lay the ground for a pragmatic compromise, and no Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness to deliver it, either. Unlike in Northern Ireland’s, ours is a conflict which no leader has won the authority to try to resolve by consensus. And we shall pay the price for that for years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83f4f05d04e47699104a49cb58021828ccb27772/0_280_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27400fe854052542dafbd3a4b61a2ea2","title":"general election unlikely theresa may brexit","story":"And yet. May’s Brexit deal has suffered the biggest defeat in the history of British democracy. If she halved the margin of defeat in another vote, it would still find a place in the five worst parliamentary routs. How on earth is she supposed to turn a 230-vote deficit into a victory of at least one, in a matter of weeks? She won’t get a meaningful concession on the backstop from the EU: how will she get the DUP, all the hard Brexiteers of the Tory ERG and Tory remainers on side? Jacob Rees-Mogg is showing signs of surrender to May, but a hardcore would not follow him. If she is expecting mass Labour defections to back her deal, disappointment beckons. May is in an impossible situation of her own making.What of the other options? Even if the Labour leadership instructed its MPs to back a second referendum – which would immediately trigger mass resignations from its frontbench – many in leave seats would refuse to do so, as would the vast majority of Tory MPs. The numbers simply aren’t there and indeed as pre-eminent British psephologist John Curtice points out, there is no public clamour for another vote. “No deal” is not going to happen – May would face resignations, even Tory MPs abandoning the whip, if she seriously attempted it – and next week, Yvette Cooper’s amendment to block it is likely to pass.So what’s left? In our tumultuous times, things can change dramatically: perhaps parliamentary arithmetic will swing dramatically behind May, perhaps a surge in support of a second referendum will happen, perhaps a majority of MPs will somehow back a sensible compromise such as Norway plus. Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.On Brexit, Labour will face unprecedented strains on its electoral coalition. It needs to avoid disillusionment leading to abstention or substantial defection among passionate remainers but the electoral reality is that most of the Tory-held seats it needs to win voted leave. One possibility is that Labour commits to renegotiate a deal and hold a referendum on its terms, with a free vote offered to Labour ministers and MPs, just as Harold Wilson did in 1975. The other is simply to pledge to renegotiate a softer Brexit. Both have their risks.Labour will have to put pressure on broadcasters not to frame the election as being about Brexit and nothing else. Even May, upon becoming prime minister, accepted that “burning injustices” led to the referendum result. Austerity, the fall in living standards, the housing crisis, struggling public services: all must be central to the debate, not just talk of customs unions and tariff-free access. After all, the next government may last for five years: it would be a travesty not to debate the full gamut of policy.Corbynism’s success depends on being seen as an insurgent movement: Labour should be brave about picking fights with vested interests. Tory threats of Labour “chaos” will look absurd after the post-2015 turmoil, and with May dangling “no deal” as a serious prospect in an election campaign, Labour will have political space to be even bolder than last time. YouGov is alone in showing Labour significantly behind: the party should embrace such polls, casting itself as the underdog.A viral social media campaign – so critical to bypassing a hostile media in 2017 – will be even more sophisticated this time around. On the ground, Momentum is already making plans for what it believes could be the biggest mobilisation of activists in the history of British democracy. Labour’s new community organising unit, led by London Citizens veteran Dan Firth, has given organising training to hundreds of activists in key marginals, built big campaign teams for prospective Labour candidates, and focused on embedding the party in previously neglected communities. An election will put this strategy to its ultimate test.Sure, it may not happen. The fact that a senior Tory figure is leaking the party’s poor electoral prospects may be an attempt to scare backbenchers into voting for May’s deal or it may be a sign that they fear she is going to roll the dice. Civil servants are certainly getting ready for a snap poll. Labour, and more importantly its supporters, must do so too. This could be the historic election that ends a generation of Thatcherite dogma, and builds an entirely new social model based on public ownership, workers’ rights, state investment and progressive taxation. They had better be prepared."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59f8d7835bfd13b51ea3157b9021674a0f9b4e34/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4fab84e01899eb472b973a465b90d35","title":"neighbourhood project barking dagenham","story":"Since the second world war, councils and national governments have sought to change people’s lives from the top down. Their efforts, during the first 30 years of this period at least, were highly effective, creating public services, public housing and a social safety net that radically improved people’s lives.But they had the unintended consequence of reducing our sense of agency, our social skills and mutual aid. Now, in the age of austerity, state support has been withdrawn, leaving many people with the worst of both worlds: neither the top-down protection of government nor the bottom-up resilience of the community it replaced. I believe we still need strong state support and well-financed public services. But this is not enough. The best antidote to the rising tide of demagoguery and reaction is a politics of belonging based on strong and confident local communities.Those who study community life talk about two kinds of social network: bonding and bridging. Bonding networks are those created within homogeneous groups. While they can overcome social isolation, they can also foster suspicion and prejudice, while limiting opportunities for change. Bridging networks bring people from different groups together. Research suggests that they can reduce crime and unemployment and, by enhancing community voices, improve the quality of government.After routing the BNP, which had taken 12 of 51 seats in 2006, Labour councillors in Barking and Dagenham saw that it wasn’t enough to target people’s needs and deliver isolated services. They wanted to move from paternalism to participation. But how?Just as the council began looking for ideas, the Participatory City Foundation, led by the inspiring Tessy Britton, approached it with a plan for an entirely different system, developed after nine years of research into how bridging networks form. Nothing like it had been attempted by a borough before. The council realised it was taking a risk. But it helped to fund a £7m, five-year experiment, called Every One, Every Day.Researching successful community projects across the world, the foundation discovered a set of common principles. Typically, they demand little time or commitment from local people, and no financial cost. They are close to people’s homes, open to everyone, and designed to attract talent rather than to meet particular needs. They set up physical and visible infrastructure. And rather than emphasising novelty – the downfall of many well-intentioned schemes – they foster simple projects that immediately improve people’s lives. The foundation realised that a large part of the budget would need to be devoted to evaluation, to allow the plan to adapt almost instantly to residents’ enthusiasm.I visited the old printers’ warehouse in Thames Road, Barking, that the scheme is turning into a gigantic new workshop where people can start collaborative businesses in areas as erse as food, clothing and renewable energy (it will be launched with a festival on 16 March). Already, the experiment has catalysed a remarkable number of projects set up spontaneously by residents.There are welcoming committees for new arrivals to the street, community potluck meals, cooking sessions and street lunches. There’s a programme to turn boring patches of grass into community gardens, play corners and outdoor learning centres. There’s a bee school and a chicken school (teaching urban animal husbandry), sewing and knitting sessions, places for freelance workers to meet and collaborate, computing and coding workshops, storytelling for children, singing sessions and a games cafe. A local football coach has started training people in the streets. There’s a film studio and a DIY film festival too, tuition for spoken-word poets and a scheme for shutting streets to traffic so children can play after school. Local people have leapt on the opportunities the new system has created.Talking to residents involved in these projects, I kept hearing the same theme: “I hated this place and wanted to move out. But now I want to stay.” A woman in Barking told me that “getting out and socialising is very hard when you’re unemployed”, but the local shop has “massively improved my social life”. Now her grandad and mum, who were also isolated, come in as well. Another explained that, before the community shop opened in Dagenham, all her friends were in other boroughs and she felt afraid of local people, especially “the young hoodies”. Now she has local friends with origins all over the world: “I no longer feel intimidated by the young guys round here, because I know them … It’s been the best year of my adult life.” Another, a black woman who had lived in fear of the BNP’s resurgence, told me: “This is hope at last. Hope for my generation. Hope for my grandchildren.”There’s a long way to go. Four thousand of the borough’s 200,000 people have participated so far. But the rate of growth suggests it is likely to be transformative. The council told me the programme had the potential to reduce demand for social services as people’s mental and physical health improves. Partly as a result, other boroughs and other cities are taking an interest in this remarkable experiment.Perhaps it’s not the whole answer to our many troubles. But it looks to me like a bright light in a darkening world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b0e1980a03d6eccda064b69ab304504b0b3e822/10_13_921_552/master/921.jpg?width=465\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7bc130533ef9505571d6dee720c78f5 465w","title":"i couldnt have gone to university without support for my disability","story":"Worryingly few disabled students are aware of the funding and support available to them. This needs to changeJust two in five disabled students at university know that there is targeted funding available for them before starting their course, according to a recent government survey. This is worrying news: Disabled Students’ Allowances (DSAs) provide vital support for many disabled students, by contributing to costs such as computer equipment or non-medical helpers support. As a visually impaired person with a mental health condition, I know how important they are first-hand. If I had faced studying without my DSAs, I simply wouldn’t have got through my course.Even with support, I struggled in those first critical weeks of student life. I would be unable to navigate my way around campus, or find myself asking disability services why a note-taker hadn’t been available for my lectures that day.Getting the right support in place took a lot of work, phone calls and appointments in the months before I got my A-level results. This meant that when I arrived at university I had a mental health mentor, funded through DSAs, who I’d chat with over coffee about my anxieties. She, along with my personal tutor, lecturers, disability staff and NHS mental health support, was there to talk through the challenges I faced as a disabled student. Working in disability teams at different universities has shown me how few students are prepared to manage their disability independently. Many expect their college to have passed on information about their condition to their university. This isn’t necessarily their fault. The problem is that too few schools and colleges teach young people how to manage their own support at university, and the importance of getting in touch early. If more prospective students were encouraged to apply for DSAs during their Ucas application, more would know about it – and more could be sure that support would be in place for them when they start their degrees.Inclusivity should be embedded in everything universities do, from booking a wheelchair accessible venue for open day sessions to having knowledgeable staff readily available to talk to prospective disabled students about support. Perhaps most important is acknowledging that the first weeks at university are crucial to ensuring students’ support is properly in place.For me, going to university was a wonderful lesson in independence while having the safety nets of the institution. Support from before the first day will help disabled people choose higher education and continue to thrive throughout their studies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000.

A decision on whether to resume the search would be made early on Thursday, police said. It is understood that a French navy vessel had been directed to the area to assist.Earlier on Wednesday, Guernsey police had raised hopes by saying searchers were focusing on the possibility that the pair had made it into a life raft. But some of those involved in the rescue said that even if this was the case, there was little chance they would have survived since Monday night in cold, choppy conditions.Sala, 28, and Ibbotson, 59, have been missing since their plane disappeared from radar over the Channel as the footballer was being flown to Cardiff having been sold to the Welsh club by Nantes for £13m.The search has focused on a 280 sq mile area north of Guernsey that is close to shipping lanes and dotted with reefs.Sala, who is Argentinian, is believed to have sent a voicemail message to his father saying he was frightened that the plane was about to break up. He said: “I’m here on a plane that looks like it’s about to fall apart, and I’m going to Cardiff … If in an hour and a half you have no news from me, I don’t know if they are going to send someone to look for me because they cannot find me, but you know … Dad, how scared am I!”Sala’s former girlfriend Berenice Schkair, 27, wrote on social media: “I want to wake up and all of this to be a lie. Please investigate because I cannot believe this accident.” In a separate post, which was later deleted, Buenos Aires-born Schkair wrote: “Investigate the football mafia, because I don’t believe this was an accident.”Ibbotson is an experienced flyer and a member of the British Parachute Association (BPA), from the small town of Crowle near Scunthorpe.Debra Middleton, the mayor of Crowle and Ealand, said Ibbotson was “very well known and very well liked” and that residents were hoping desperately for a positive outcome. “We all really do feel for his family. Everybody’s listening to the news and hoping everything’s OK.”Humberside police said: “We can confirm that north Lincolnshire man David Ibbotson is believed to be the pilot of the light aircraft that went missing near Guernsey. Specially trained officers are supporting Mr Ibbotson’s family, who have asked for privacy at this difficult time.”Guernsey police had said on Wednesday morning that rescuers were working on four possibilities:The police said the search was focusing on the life raft option.Capt David Barker, the Guernsey harbourmaster, leading the operation, said there was still a chance that the pair could be alive if they had made it into a life raft. “Nobody here, including me, is giving up,” he said.John Fitzgerald, the Channel Islands Air Search chief officer, said: “We’re out there looking for something you don’t expect to see, whether it’s a whole aircraft, a life raft or bits of whatever. We have seen lots of things in the water, but that’s not to say they’re from the plane. They could be from the ship, from the land, anywhere.”Fitzgerald suggested it was unlikely the pair would survive for days even if they were in a raft. “The sea is 8-9C. That takes your core temperature away very quickly. Unless you are in a survival suit and really know how to look after yourself, you will have severe issues.” Privately, others directly involved in the rescue said there was very little hope. The UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch said the plane was unlikely to have been fitted with a flight recorder, or black box. A vital tool for crash investigators, black boxes are mandatory on airliners and business jets, but not on light aircraft such as the Piper PA-46 Malibu that Sala was travelling in.The plane took off at 7.15pm on Monday and was flying at an altitude of 5,000ft (1,500 metres). On passing Guernsey, it “requested descent”, but Jersey air traffic control lost contact with it while it was at 2,300ft.Cardiff City said Sala had arranged the flight himself. The club chairman, Mehmet Dalman, told BBC Radio Wales: “We spoke to the player and asked him if he wanted us to make arrangements for his flight, which would have been commercial. He declined and made his own arrangements.” It is believed that a football agent may have helped him arrange the flight. Guernsey police said: “After an intensive search using multiple aircraft and one lifeboat over the last nine hours, we have found no trace of the missing plane. With the light now fading, the search will be suspended for the night. A decision about whether to recommence will be taken early tomorrow morning.”In a statement, Sala’s agent, Mark McKay, expressed his sadness at the news. “I knew Emiliano well,” he said. “He was a wonderful person and I count myself fortunate to have known him.” He made it clear that neither he nor anyone in his family owned the aircraft."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db534e347ea1047fe9dc065ca9f1726c0fecd485/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13313bcc1b8a489110d1c0dddee28cee","title":"gonzalo higuain chelsea machine profile","story":"The Argentinian striker is set to work with the ‘best ever manager’ Maurizio Sarri but can he conquer the Premier League at the age of 31?“Not even a phone call.” Maurizio Sarri could not hide his disappointment. Gonzalo Higuaín had just left Napoli for Juventus for £75.3m but had not been in touch to say either goodbye or to explain himself. For Sarri, that was inexcusable.The regret was there for everyone to see, yet in the same interview Sarri called Higuaín “the best centre‑forward in the world” and two and a half years later they have been reunited at Chelsea.It has got all the ingredients to go horribly wrong. Higuaín is not the player he was during that 2015-16 season when he and Sarri worked together and he scored 36 goals in 35 Serie A games, a joint record for the league together with Torino’s Gino Rossetti, who achieved that particular feat in 1928-29. The Premier League will also be a new experience for the 31-year-old after six years in Spain and then five and a half in Italy and it is fair to question whether he will be able to adapt. Finally, he is joining a team who have lost their way somewhat after a superb start to the season, which is not unusual when it comes to Sarri.Despite all this, Sarri has fought – and won – the battle to sign the player he wanted. Even back in October, when he had been in the Chelsea job for only a few months, Sarri admitted that he was missing Higuaín “a lot”. It is clear, despite the disappointment of how Higuaín conducted himself after leaving Napoli, that Sarri has forgiven the Argentinian and firmly believes he is the answer to Chelsea’s goalscoring problems.Both Sarri and Higuaín have fond memories from the season they spent together at Napoli. Higuaín has called Sarri the best manager he has worked with and that the Italian made him able to “express himself” on the pitch more than anyone else.Sarri, meanwhile, has talked fondly about how Higuaín treated him when he arrived at the club in 2015, when the Argentinian was already an established star at Napoli.“How can he be labelled a traitor by Napoli fans and be like a son to me?” Sarri asked rhetorically in September 2018. “Higuaín is a champion, that is without a question. When I arrived from Empoli at a point when I was a nobody coach, he was always available to me without any hesitation and with a lot of simplicity.”That season at Napoli is still Higuaín’s best in club football but that is not to say that he has been poor otherwise. He has averaged more than 20 goals a season during his time in Italy and is a natural goalscorer. His spell at Milan, whom he joined on loan from Juventus at the start of this season, has been a huge disappointment and he has at times looked unfit but Sarri would get to work on that immediately. Higuaín recalls that Sarri called him “lazy” during their time in Naples but added: “He wanted me to score like Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo and to be fair to him I scored 36 that season.”Higuaín’s fitness will be key as he sets about attempting to prove a lot of people in England wrong. The Argentinian has had a strange career in some ways, with an extraordinary amount of goals scored – more than 300 – yet so few trophies to show for them. He has been on the losing side in a World Cup final, a Champions League final and two Copa Américas. He has three Spanish league titles and two Italian ones although he was at Real Madrid at a time when they were not challenging for or winning the Champions League on a regular basis.Il Pipita, as Higuaín is frequently called, is still fiercely competitive and said in a  interview in 2017: “I want to leave my name at the highest level of this sport. To do that you need to have the humility to continue growing. Gigi Buffon always says as much: he’s almost 40 years old and he still believes he can improve. Imagine. I feel like I can as well. I’m young. I hope I’ve still got lots of years ahead of me in football.”It is too early to say whether the majority of them will be spent in west London. What is clear, though, is that he has the chance to once again team up with the manager who got the best out of him. Sarri will work Higuaín hard at the training ground and give him the freedom to go out and express himself.It is unlikely to be a straightforward journey but the mutual respect exists, and that is a good start. Sarri once said: “With him I have the same sensation you have towards a child that is driving you absolutely mad but who you still love.”And if Sarri can get Higuaín fit and up and running there is no doubt in the Italian’s mind that he has a world-beater in his squad. “Higuaín will score goals for as long as he is alive,” Sarri told Corriere dello Sport in September 2018. “He is goals. He is a goal animal, an infernal machine.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f083df1aad317218912d4ae946ddd1db201cd51/144_454_5116_3069/master/5116.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4264376fea2d2c2c1deb4d623abd0336","title":"real madrid barcelona overtake manchester united football top earners deloitte money league","story":"• Top 20 generated £7.4bn of combined revenue in 2017-18• Six Premier League clubs in Deloitte’s money league top 10Manchester United have been unseated as world football’s biggest earners after slipping to third behind Real Madrid and Barcelona in Deloitte’s annual report into club revenues. However, the underlying financial strength of the Premier League was emphasised as English clubs provided six of the top 10 in the accountancy experts’ money league, a record from a single country.Madrid, meanwhile, moved from second to first by increasing revenues by more than £85m to £665.2m off the back of a third consecutive Champions League title and a big uplift in sponsorship, merchandising and the exploitation of increasingly lucrative pre-season fixtures. They are the first club to generate more than €750m.

However, with the Premier League’s tender for the next cycle of domestic rights from 2019-20 complete and sale of overseas rights nearing conclusion, it is clear that Premier League clubs will be unable to rely on explosive growth in broadcast distributions as a source of future growth, as has been the case in recent years.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b34dc34165c231284abeacec142013efbc38b2c/0_3382_5792_3475/master/5792.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9011cede453f0ce4b2605372740e63b4","title":"young or old tell us about the major life events that shaped you","story":"We would like to hear from you as part of a project introducing readers of different generations to one anotherAs part of a new project that aims to explore major life events from different perspectives and across generational ides, the ’s Weekend magazine is looking to hear from readers.If one of the following questions apply to you, we’d like to hear from you.

What’s behind the obsessive pursuit of a flawless look?People used to call Anika the Snap Queen. Between the ages of 19 and 21, she was “obsessed with Snapchat, to the point where I had 4,000 followers”. At the peak of her “tragic” behaviour, she reckons now – a year after quitting the image-sharing app – she was taking 25 selfies a day.She liked the sense of having a platform, she says, with the average selfie getting 300 replies. “It was like, ‘Oh my God, I’m so popular – I’ve gotta show my face.’” But the filters were also part of the appeal. The Londoner had long been insecure about the slight bump in her nose. Snapchat’s fun effects, which let you embellish your selfies with dog ears, flower crowns and the like, would also erase the bump entirely. “I’d think, ‘I’d like to look how I look with this filter that makes my nose look slimmer.’”Socialising in the real world, she would choose her seat to avoid being seen in profile. She recognises that this was irrational – “but it happens. I feel like we’re in a world where a lot of people are seen to be perfect, and so we try and reach that peak.”Sometimes her followers would suggest meeting in person. “Then it would be like, ‘I have to look like my selfie.’” It was around this time, the height of her Snapchat obsession, that Anika started contacting cosmetic doctors on Instagram.The phenomenon of people requesting procedures to resemble their digital image has been referred to – sometimes flippantly, sometimes as a harbinger of end times – as “Snapchat dysmorphia”. The term was coined by the cosmetic doctor Tijion Esho, founder of the Esho clinics in London and Newcastle. He had noticed that where patients had once brought in pictures of celebrities with their ideal nose or jaw, they were now pointing to photos of themselves.While some used their selfies – typically edited with Snapchat or the airbrushing app Facetune – as a guide, others would say, “‘I want to actually look like this’, with the large eyes and the pixel-perfect skin,” says Esho. “And that’s an unrealistic, unattainable thing.”A recent report in the US medical journal JAMA Facial Plastic Surgery suggested that filtered images’ “blurring the line of reality and fantasy” could be triggering body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), a mental health condition where people become fixated on imagined defects in their appearance. Like Esho, Dr Wassim Taktouk uses non-surgical, non-permanent “injectables” such as Botox and dermal fillers to enlarge lips or smooth a bumpy nose. He recalls a client coming to see him in his cream-carpeted Kensington clinic, upset after a date made through an app had gone south. “When she’d met the man, he had been quite disparaging: ‘You don’t look anything like your picture.’”The woman showed Taktouk the heavily filtered image on her profile and said: “I want to look like that.” It was flawless, he says – “without a single marking of a normal human face”. He told her he couldn’t help. “If that’s the picture you’re going to put out of yourself, you’re setting yourself up for disappointment.”Why do we take so many photos of ourselves? A 2017 study into “selfitis”, as the obsessive taking of selfies has been called, found a range of motivations, from seeking social status to shaking off depressive thoughts and – of course – capturing a memorable moment. Another study suggested that selfies served “a private and internal purpose”, with the majority never shared with anyone or posted anywhere – terabytes, even petabytes of photographs never to be seen by anyone other than their subject.With so much of life now lived online, from dating to job-hunting, recent, quality images of yourself are also a necessity – it is no wonder that Facetune (Apple’s most popular paid-for app of 2017) and the free follow-up Facetune2 have more than 55m users between them. Stav Tishler of Lightricks, the company behind them, says making airbrushing accessible has challenged “that illusion that ‘a perfect body’ exists … and levelled out the playing field”: “Everyone knows everyone is using it, supermodels and ‘everyday’ people alike.”Even novelty filters such as Snapchat and Instagram’s, as well as adding bunny ears or specs to your selfie, plump your lips, erase your pores and lift your jowls while they are at it. (Snapchat declined to respond on the record.)The filtered-selfie look is also reflected in demand for bigger lips and taut jawlines. Such so-called “tweakments” have exploded in recent years, thanks to their relative affordability and convenience. A “liquid nose job” using fillers might cost a few hundred pounds and takes instant effect, compared with the slow, painful recovery from a surgical rhinoplasty. Marla, 29, from New York, got her “perfect nose” last year while on her lunch break. “I went back to work feeling just so much more polished and confident – like I was even writing my emails better.”Like Anika, she had always been bothered by the bump in her nose, religiously removing it from selfies but she began exploring real-world options after a painful breakup. A list of pros and cons revealed that the potential risks – of her parents’ disapproval and “necrosis of the face” (“It’s very rare, but it’s definitely a thing”) – did not outweigh the benefits of having “the nose I create for myself on Facetune”.The rise of fillers – anything from collagen and hyaluronic acid, which break down in a matter of months, to the permanent but riskier polymethyl methacrylate beads – has been accelerated by celebrity endorsements from the likes of the Kardashian clan. The removal and subsequent return of Kylie Jenner’s lip fillers have been followed with particular interest. Some doctors try to capitalise on this with “the Kylie package” for nose, jaw and lips, says Taktouk, disapprovingly. Ten years ago, his clients were deeply concerned with patient confidentiality “Now, it’s ‘Do you mind if I Insta-story this?’ It’s not taboo any more.” He has seen lips advertised for £150 and noses for £200-£300. “And that’s one of the trickiest procedures of the lot.”Fillers may be less invasive than surgery, but they are not without their risks, which range from uneven results and infection to vascular blockages and even blindness. Save Face, the UK’s largest register of accredited practitioners of non-surgical treatments, says almost 1,000 complaints were made in the year to October. Yet there is little regulation and no minimum age. “We have more protections for houses than we do children’s faces,” says Esho, who has campaigned for crackdowns. “It’s crazy.”Even Marla – who documented her follow-up nose job in a short film for Vice, and does paid promotional work for cosmetic surgeons – says she would not encourage a young girl to do as she did. “I know that I love myself – that’s why I let myself get little tweaks – but it would really bother me if a young girl told me that she didn’t.”The process is as easy as “click-click-click, look at 10 bits of his work in the space of a minute, wow, let’s contact him”, says Anika. At the age of 20, she turned up at Taktouk’s clinic with photos of noses he had done and a video of herself with a Snapchat filter. “You know the one that kind of makes your face look like an alien’s? I was like, ‘This looks great – my nose looks so much smaller.’ Dr Taktouk was like: ‘This is not what is going to happen with filler.’” She laughs. “He told me to come back with my mum.”Instead, Anika took a year out to consider her decision, weighing up fillers’ merits against surgical rhinoplasty. “Actually, I went through a phase of thinking, ‘No, I should try and love myself.’” How did that go? “I didn’t do rhinoplasty,” she says drily. “I guess that’s as far as I got.” By the time she returned to Taktouk’s clinic, aged 21, she had been brought “back down to earth”. He injected filler into the tip of her nose, evening out its line. She loved it instantly. “I feel like I just needed that to change me inside, so I could stop looking for perfection.”When the filler eventually breaks down after about a year, she will repeat the procedure. “The most beautiful thing is when someone is happy from within,” she says “as ironic as it sounds”, her new nose helped her to attain it. “I’m not itching to get anything else.”There was a moment just after the procedure, though, as she was admiring her new profile, when she wondered aloud if her lips needed filling, too. They were one of her most prominent features she had been called Fish Lips at school. Taktouk told her to stop being silly. “When you’re in that seat, it’s quite tempting,” she says. “Like, ‘What else can I do?’”It prompts the question: which are you trying to correct, the image or the reality?Anna, 40, from Malvern – another patient of Taktouk’s – admits to having once been “fixated” on her laugh lines. “The photos exacerbate it, making it look worse, then a filter can make it look amazing. You’re unsure of what you look like.”Ever since she was young, she has struggled with the discrepancy between how she sees herself in the mirror, and how others see her. Once, she downloaded an app that claimed “to show you how you really look”. “It used to horrify me, and make me feel terrible about myself. But these are conversations you can’t really have, because you do sound self-absorbed and you’re leaving yourself vulnerable.”She is more self-confident now, which she attributes both to age and the occasional self-esteem boost of Botox or filler. “I’m quite realistic now, whereas in the past I’ve driven myself crazy.”For Taktouk, referrals from social media make it harder to safeguard patients’ mental health. His background as a GP has helped him to spot red flags, such as badmouthing other doctors, insisting on flaws that aren’t there, and in-depth knowledge of treatments: “I’ve had someone come in here and draw the lines on their face themselves.” But, he adds, “I’m sure some will have slipped past without me realising” – and even if Taktouk refuses to treat them, someone else will.Over the weekend it was reported that Superdrug (which began offering Botox late last year) has agreed to introduce mental health screening for people seeking Botox, following criticism from the NHS for not conducting “medically responsible” checks. Taktouk says far more industry-wide regulation is needed, before there is a headline-grabbing tragedy and apps become even more transformative. He points to one called Retouch Me, which superimposes six-packs on to swimsuit pictures. “I saw it and thought, this is the new wave of what we’re going to get in: ‘Make me look like this.’”The onset tends to occur in adolescence, though people with the condition may not seek help until 10 years later. The general rule, says Professor David Veale, a consultant psychiatrist at the Maudsley hospital in south London, is that you can “think about your appearance for an hour a day before it becomes a disorder” – but for a diagnosis, it must be accompanied by significant distress or inability to function normally. People with BDD take selfies because they are convinced “that they are hideous”.In 2014, then 19-year-old Danny Bowman from Northumberland was reported to be “Britain’s first selfie addict” after being interviewed about his experience of BDD. His problems had begun four years before, when he was rejected by a modelling agency at the same time as he was being bullied at his new school and on Facebook. “For me, it was confirmation that I did look ugly.”Bowman was soon spending hours before the mirror, slathering himself in acne cream and moisturiser and monitoring a steady stream of selfies for real-time improvement. After three months he dropped out of school, and the selfie-taking increased to hundreds a day. “I was trying to see some gradual improvement, and take that photo that I was pleased with. I was just trying to get that relief, and I couldn’t get it. There wasn’t a perfect photo. There isn’t a perfect photo.”After six months of being housebound, consumed by his daily rituals, he tried to kill himself. “A lot of people say looking at themselves in the mirror probably makes them feel insecure, but imagine scanning through 200 pictures a day. I was just exhausted. I felt like there was no way out.” His mother – like his father, a mental health professional – found him in time and he was diagnosed with BDD. Part of his 12-week treatment involved restricting access to his phone.Now 24, Bowman is studying at the University of York and campaigns on issues related to mental health and positive body image. He has raised concerns about the impact of Instagram with friends he sees “posting photographs of themselves every other day, Facetuning themselves, making themselves look unlike the way they look. That was me, but on an amplified scale.” They have reacted defensively, he says. “It has become such a normal thing that people don’t see what they’re doing as abnormal.”He very rarely takes selfies now. “I just don’t feel the need to do it.”• The Body Dysmorphic Disorder Foundation can be found at bddfoundation.org"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7179316494d7477f0045e771b9102091849baab3/0_247_3700_2220/master/3700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00f2cb2a92be17a9584184c4953c7caa","title":"south africa lastminute refused boarding child birth certificate","story":"My daughter and her family arrived at Heathrow to catch a Virgin flight to South Africa in October. Tickets were booked via Lastminute. At the check-in desk they were asked for the children’s birth certificates, which they did not have. They were therefore refused boarding. Virgin staff said my daughter should have known because the information was on its website.The family had no alternative but to go home to fetch the birth certificates and, as Virgin was unable or unwilling to rebook their flight, had to book with another airline for the next day, which cost £3,000. They later discovered that as they were marked as a “no-show” for their outward bound flight, their return tickets had been voided and they would have to rebook that, too, at a cost of more than £2,000. Staff admitted it was common for families to be denied boarding for this reason, in which case – while ignorance is not an excuse – should they not provide better information?Always consult the Foreign Office website for entry requirements when you fly to any country outside the EU (and, if Brexit happens, any destination outside the UK). It was in June 2015 that South Africa introduced the most stringent immigration rules in the world, requiring all under-18s to present an unabridged birth certificate at the departure gate. This was intended to reduce child trafficking. But it was taking such a toll on tourism that the rules were relaxed. However, passengers are still urged to carry the documents as immigration officers may request them and, since airlines face fines if they carry inadequately documented passengers, some gate staff may still insist on them.Virgin told the Observer that there was a link to South African entry requirements on the e-tickets it sends to customers, but as you booked through Lastminute the format was different and the link not included. Lastminute says its website advises customers to check with an embassy or the Foreign Office before completing a booking. “Because we sell thousands of destinations we can’t provide country-specific information for each,” it says.If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

By  Jeremy BrownVaccination, the process of infecting a healthy person with a microbe to prevent disease, dates back at least a thousand years. But the start of vaccination as we think of it today is generally credited to the work of Edward Jenner, a British physician born in 1749. Jenner was a keen observer with a deep interest in the natural world, and found time for both serious study and artistic play. He investigated everything from hydrogen balloons to the life cycle of the cuckoo, wrote poetry and played the violin, but smallpox – or rather, the eradication of it – is his legacy. Because of Jenner, this virus is not on our list of worries today.These women then became immune to the deadlier human smallpox virus. There was something in the cowpox that protected against smallpox, and in 1796 Edward Jenner famously took material from the fresh pustules on a milkmaid’s hand and inserted it under the skin of a young boy named James Phipps. After a brief and mild illness, Phipps recovered completely. Jenner then infected him with scrapings from a smallpox lesion, again and again, but the boy never got sick. Jenner named this process “vaccination” after variolae vaccinae, a Latin term for cowpox. His technique quickly spread through 19th-century England and beyond, saving countless people, inspiring modifications to the technique and changing the course of history.Jenner’s smallpox vaccine was improved and modified over the next several decades, and was soon joined by others. Louis Pasteur developed vaccines for animal diseases such as chicken cholera and anthrax, but of these he is best remembered for his rabies vaccine. Rabies was a common and uniformly fatal disease in the 19th century. Once a victim is bitten by a rabid animal, the virus multiplies slowly and infects the brain and nervous system. Pasteur did not know of the viral cause, but this didn’t really matter. He dissected and dried out the spinal cords of infected animals and then injected the remains into test animals, which then showed immunity to rabies. What Pasteur was doing was, in fact, weakening the virus, making it a Goldilocks version. It was not strong enough to kill, and it was not weak enough to be ignored by our immune system.One hundred years ago, during the 1918 flu pandemic, there were no flu vaccines. We didn’t know precisely what was causing the disease, so we couldn’t manufacture a vaccine to protect us. But this didn’t stop scientists and doctors from doing something, anything, to combat the outbreak. In 1919 Edward Rosenow from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, isolated several bacteria from the sputum and lungs of flu patients in Rochester, formulated a vaccine that contained five different kinds of bacteria, and doled it out to 100,000 people. At Tufts College Medical School in Boston, Timothy Leary (whose nephew and namesake would also become a doctor and experiment with psychedelics) produced his own blended vaccine using strains from the Chelsea Naval hospital, a nurse’s nose at Carney hospital and the infected wards of Camp Devens. Leary mixed these samples together, grew them on plates of agar and then sterilised the mixture. His vaccine was sent to San Francisco, where at least 18,000 people were inoculated with it.These and other efforts gave hope to a ravaged nation. One health official at the time wrote that the greatest value of a flu vaccine was that it reduced “fluphobia”. Worry and fear were as quick to spread as the disease itself, and any vaccine that provided at least mental relief was welcome. There was no evidence, of course, that any of these vaccines actually worked. Today, physicians go to great lengths to be sure that vaccine trials adhere to stringent standards, but a century ago these did not exist. Many of the vaccine trials were conducted on survivors of the flu, after the initial epidemic had passed, meaning that the pool was tainted with a degree of immunity.In 1933 the flu virus was identified, and scientists could then confront the culprit rather than the mess in its wake. Russians led the field, weakening the virus by transplanting it between chicken eggs. Around one billion people in the USSR were vaccinated using the live but weakened flu virus, and it was still in use at the end of the 20th century. Although it appeared to be successful, the live-flu vaccine was never tested in a rigorous way, and it remained a constant danger. Since it used a live virus, it could cross with other strains and morph into a more virulent version.Vaccine researchers therefore turned their attention to creating a vaccine containing what they called “inactive” strains. The virus was still grown in chick embryos, but this time it was rendered inactive by dunking it in a bath of formalin disinfectant. Although a higher dose of the inactive vaccine was needed to produce an immune response, there was no concern about the virus replicating.For the first several years the influenza vaccine contained only one strain, the influenza A virus, because, as far as anyone knew, that was the only kind of influenza out there. In 1940 influenza B was identified, which kicked off the perpetual task of calibrating vaccines to deal with multiple evolving strains. By the 1950s we had a vaccine that was effective against both A and B, but the virus, as always, was outpacing us. By the late 1970s we had to make a vaccine to hit three strains. For the 2016-7 flu season, most of the vaccine doses manufactured in the US targeted four different strains. The past 100 years have been a ceaseless arms race against an enemy with whom we cannot negotiate.The key to a good flu vaccine is matching it to the strains that are in circulation during a given season. The challenge is that it takes about six months to produce the vaccine, and so the manufacturers have to base their ingredients on some clever detective work led by the World Health Organization.There are about 110 WHO flu centres in 80 countries that receive swabs from the noses and throats of patients with influenza-like illnesses. These centres identify the flu strains that are circulating, and occasionally they will find a new one. When this happens, they send it to one of five collaborating centres, in London, Atlanta, Melbourne, Tokyo and Beijing, for a more detailed molecular analysis. Twice a year (in February for the northern hemisphere, and September for the southern) the WHO convenes a meeting to collate all the information and recommend a vaccine recipe for the upcoming season. In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta provide additional domestic data, and the Food and Drug Administration makes a final decision on what goes into the vaccine. The manufacturers then have about six months to get the recommended flu vaccine to market.Even if the vaccine hits the bullseye, different demographics have different reactions to it. Children have a very good response to the vaccine. The situation is more complicated with elderly patients, who have weaker immune systems overall but also have a lifetime buildup of natural immunity. After withstanding many flu seasons, their immune systems are wiser, you might say, than those of the young.If flu vaccines are indeed mankind’s greatest weapon against the flu, why are they used in wildly different capacities?When my colleagues gave one another the influenza vaccine at the George Washington University hospital, we were following the advice of the CDC. When patients with influenza started to roll into the emergency room a few months later, I would ask if they had received a flu shot. Many had, and yet here they were in the hospital. I knew how they felt. My only visit to the emergency department as a patient – the year I got a nasty case of the flu – was after I had been given the flu vaccine.Despite the regular failure of the vaccine, Americans are bombarded every year with reminders and opportunities to get a flu shot. By the end of August, pharmacies are posting signs and doctors’ offices are gearing up. The vaccine is offered at many workplaces and houses of worship, and hospitals require all their health care providers to be vaccinated.Behind this effort is the CDC, which recommends the flu vaccine for everyone over the age of six months. One CDC poster that caught my attention asked: “Who needs a flu vaccine? a) You, b) You, c) You, d) All of the above”. (In case you were wondering, the correct answer is d.) The poster reminded us that “even healthy people can get the flu, and it can be serious”. The message then got more explicit: “Everyone 6 months and older should get a flu vaccine. This means you.”Recommendations about the use of vaccines in the US are made by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (Acip), a group of more than a dozen experts with backgrounds in vaccination research, public health and health policy. It meets three times a year to review any new evidence and provide advice and guidance to the director of the CDC about the use of vaccines. As recently as 2006, the committee recommended the flu vaccine only for those at high-risk for complications of influenza and adults over the age of 50. But a couple of years later it expanded its recommendations to include everyone over the age of six months. And that recommendation has remained in place ever since.The public health campaign by the CDC to vaccinate everyone is not shared by other countries. Europe and Australia recommend the vaccine only for the very young, the elderly and those with underlying illnesses. Healthy adults are simply not targeted. It’s very difficult to compare death rates from influenza across different countries because the definition of an influenza case varies, as does the way in wahich a country collects its own statistics. Often, deaths from viral influenza and bacterial pneumonia are listed together. It is challenging, therefore, to compare the data we have from the US and the UK. However, in the UK, the death rate from influenza in 2014 was 0.2 per 100,000 people. And in the US, it was 1.4 per 100,000. That is seven times higher than in the UK, a country that vaccinates far less of its population. These numbers must be interpreted with caution, but they do at least suggest that the approach in the UK is reasonable.How can we properly determine whether a “vaccination for all” programme, such as the one in the US, saves more lives and protects more people than the English “vaccination for some”? Perhaps for one flu season we could encourage everyone to get vaccinated, and for the next we would encourage only those at increased risk. We could compare the influenza death rates between the two groups and get our answer. Of course, it’s more complicated than that. Because the mortality rate from influenza is so low, we would need to enroll hundreds of thousands of patients in order to see if the vaccine made a difference. However, an experiment like this might be undermined by the strains of influenza that were circulating in each year. If one year’s strain was more contagious or deadlier than the next, our experiment would tell us nothing.We could instead collect evidence from small trials and look for trends. This method was used by the Cochrane collaboration, an international group of 37,000 medical contributors, in 2014, when they reviewed all the studies that evaluated the effects of the flu vaccine in healthy US adults. It was a large undertaking there were 90 studies that compared giving the vaccine to withholding it, and a total of 8 million patients were involved.It comes down to language. The CDC describes the flu like this in a poster intended for use in doctors’ offices: “The flu may make people cough and have a sore throat and fever. They may also have a runny or stuffy nose, feel tired, have body aches, or show other signs they are not well. The flu happens every year and is more common in the fall and winter in the US. People of all ages can get the flu, from babies and young adults, to the elderly.”Not so bad. But then this is on the homepage of the CDC’s flu site: “It can cause mild to severe illness. Serious outcomes of flu infection can result in hospitalization or death. Some people, such as older people, young children, and people with certain health conditions, are at high risk of serious flu complications. The best way to prevent the flu is by getting vaccinated each year.”At most, according to the British, influenza can be a bit of a nuisance: “Most people will make a full recovery and won’t experience any further problems, but elderly people and people with certain long-term medical conditions are more likely to have a bad case of flu or develop a serious complication, such as a chest infection.” There’s no mention of death as a complication. It’s all very “keep calm and carry on” – just like it was during the 1918 pandemic.Is the flu a killer or an irritant? We know with certainty that each year it kills many people in both the US and Britain. And we know with equal certainty that for almost all healthy people the flu is nothing but a minor annoyance. Both are correct. That’s the nature of influenza. It’s tricky and mysterious, causing discomfort in some of its victims and death in others. It’s just that the US and the UK quantify them in different ways.The British version of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee is called the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). It meets three times a year, reviews the scientific evidence and makes recommen-dations to the secretary of state for health if there is a need to change the vaccination policy. Andrew Pollard, the head of the JCVI, trained as a paediatrician and is now professor of paediatric infection and immunity at the University of Oxford. Pollard is extremely cognisant of the numerous effects of the flu, but for the JCVI, the biggest measure is cost-effectiveness.It may seem cold or callous to fixate on costs when lives are at stake, but money and resources are limited, and reckless or misdirected spending can lead to poor medical practices or greater harm. For example, spending $1m on medications for those who have had a heart attack might save 1,000 lives each year. That same $1m might have been spent instead on screenings for cervical cancer, which would save the lives of 60,000 women each year. What’s more important: saving 1,000 lives or 60,000 lives? It often comes down to who is asking (and which disease it is that you have).Andrew Pollard and his team at the JCVI looked at studies that measured the cost-effectiveness of the influenza vaccine. They concluded that given the vanishingly small number of young, healthy adults who become severely ill or die from the flu, it is not cost-effective to vaccinate this section of the population.Pollard’s committee measures the cost to the health system itself: how much the vaccine costs and how much it decreases the number of days that patients spend in hospital or in intensive care. They also estimate the vaccine’s effect on the number of flu-related visits to doctors’ offices. What they don’t measure is the wider cost to society, which includes lost labour, lost wages or the time a parent must spend taking care of a child. These, too, are burdens on society, but they do not enter into the deliberations of the JCVI. The vaccine is cost-effective to the healthcare system when it is given to children, older people, those with medical conditions and pregnant women. It is not cost-effective when given to young, healthy adults.In the US, the cost-effectiveness of the vaccine is less important. What is more important is whether or not it works. This approach has resulted in another difference in vaccination policy between the US and the UK, this time over the vaccine for chickenpox. The varicella vaccine can prevent both chickenpox and shingles, a later complication of the disease. In the US, the varicella vaccine is recommended for all children the first dose is given at 12 months of age, and a booster shot four years later. In the UK, varicella is not on the list of vaccines for children. In the US, if a vaccine has been shown to work safely, the CDC generally recommends it.At the beginning of the 1976 flu outbreak, President Gerald Ford had to choose between two perfectly sound recommendations. One was to quickly vaccinate as many people as possible, while the other was to stockpile the vaccine and wait to see whether things got worse. Ford rejected the wait-and-see approach. “We cannot afford to take a chance with the health of our nation,” he said. “Better to err on the side of overreaction than underreaction.”This is the overriding approach to healthcare in the US. They are always ready to do more, to try the latest medications or surgical procedures, because, well, why take a chance? Compared with other western countries, the US does more invasive studies of the heart for patients with chest pain, without actually improving their outcomes. We in the US put more of our patients into the intensive care unit, even though they are, on average, less sick than their counterparts abroad. We give more chemotherapy to cancer patients near the ends of their disease, even though it improves neither the quality nor the length of their lives. We do these things because we can, because to do otherwise would be considered giving up – even if doing less would be an extremely sensible and kind decision.Influenza is not cancer, and it is not heart disease. But the US approach to it is emblematic of the way it treats most diseases: doing more is better. If there is an unexhausted option, exhaust it. And because many vaccines have had spectacular success in preventing and eradicating some ghastly infectious diseases, the expectation is that the influenza vaccine will do the same. It’s another hi-tech solution. To most people, the word “vaccine” is tantamount to a guarantee that a disease will leave you alone.It’s hard to make a catchy public service announcement that reflects the subtleties therein. “Vaccinate everyone over six months old” is the current message. It is easy to understand and easy to remember. A more accurate message is much clumsier: “Vaccinate school-aged children and pregnant women and probably elderly people (but the evidence is mixed) and those with chronic conditions, but no need to vaccinate young, healthy adults.” That wouldn’t really fit on a billboard. In this case, nuance may invite danger.The quest for a better influenza vaccine continues. The holy grail would be a vaccine that covers all possible strains of influenza (so there would be no problem of mismatched vaccination) and that needs to be given only once, not every year as is now the case. Dozens of research labs across the world have worked to create this so-called universal vaccine, but so far without success. The influenza virus is just too adept at changing its disguise, remaining one step ahead of our efforts to neutralise it with a one-shot-fits-all vaccine. Although influenza is a common illness, finding an effective vaccine to prevent it remains an exceptionally challenging endeavour.Adapted from Influenza: The Quest to Cure the Deadliest Disease in History by Jeremy Brown, published by Text on 31 January at £12.99.

Ceredigion farmer Wyn Evans fears trouble aheadWyn Evans’s family has farmed in the hills of Ceredigion, west Wales, for five centuries. This is a remote, wet and often cold corner of the UK, a tough place to live and work but the biggest threat at the moment comes not in the shape of the winter storms.“Brexit is what’s worrying us at the moment. This is a very difficult time for farmers,” said Evans, 55, who rears sheep and cattle with his wife Nicole and son Gwynfor. “It’s a job to plan because nobody knows what’s going to happen. We’re on the cusp of lambing just now. I can’t tell you if I’ll have a lucrative market for our lambs or not. You have to carry on even though you don’t know what’s around the corner.Evans’s lambs initially go to an abattoir across the hills in Llanidloes. The prime cuts – the legs and shoulders – end up on supermarket shelves in the UK. However, the European market is vital for so-called “carcass balance” – the bits of lamb that are not so popular in the UK are exported. The meat from lighter lambs produced by Evans and his colleagues is also popular in Portugal and Italy.Brexit has already prompted Evans to reduce his flock – from around 400 to 370. “We’ve cut down on the sheep slightly,” he said. To try to compensate he has boosted the number of beef cattle he rears. “There’s a lot of young cattle around the place,” he said. The UK is a net importer of beef so Evans is calculating that the beef price may hold up. Brexit follows a difficult 12 months weather-wise for farmers such as Evans. Last March it was cold – the beast from east bit viciously here – and was followed by a hot summer. “Our spare bales went last spring. Then we had that horrendously dry summer. The grass didn’t grow well, the crops were light. We’ve got nothing to stockpile. We are struggling this winter for forage.”The longevity of his family in this area, just south-east of Aberystwyth, means Evans can put Brexit and its possible impact on farming on this spot into a historical perspective.Age-old maps and records make it is clear that grain was grown here in the 19th century when the corn laws imposed tariffs on imported food. When the corn laws were repealed by Tory Sir Robert Peel (overcoming the opposition of most of his party), it was deemed unviable to grow grain on this soggy, steep land.“What we can do very well is grow grass,” said Evans. “The most efficient way of using the land is to graze animals. That is the best way of producing a world-class protein.”Evans voted to stay in the EU. “I was an avid remainer. I’m very frustrated over how things have gone. I would have thought by now we would have had clarification. Are we going to have unfettered access to that very important market that gives my business security moving forward? We need to know. Parliament and so many iniduals within it are so indecisive. Party politics has played too much of a role. We should have had a coalition, a collaboration at the start of this process.”Evans, who votes Plaid Cymru or Liberal Democrat, said he had backed the doomed deal that Theresa May put before parliament. “For agriculture and manufacturing in Wales it was the best deal. It was a good job of a bad job. I’ve got qualms about a second referendum. If it went the same way as the previous one, I don’t know were we’d go then. We’d be in total chaos – ungovernable. No politician would know what to do. At the moment I like the look of a Norway plus deal. I don’t know if she would get that through parliament.”Evans, who is chairman of the NFU Cymru livestock board, says that if the farmers struggle, the rural economy will be harshly hit. “I spend all the money from the farm within a 20-mile radius. The feed merchants, the builders, the mechanics are all local.” The farm is run by the three family members but they also employ outside contractors to shear the sheep and cut hedges. “There are lot of people out there relying on the farmers,” he said.Evans is optimistic the farm will survive whatever Brexit brings. “We’ve been here a long, long time,” he said. “As a boy I remember following my grandfather around the farm as he did his chores. From an early age I wanted to be a farmer. Within this area this is what we do, this is who we are. Farming and the rural community is my passion. We should be proud of what we do and what we produce.”“Last winter when the beast from the east was hitting hard, most of us were about to start lambing. We looked after our animals to the highest standard even though the elements were horrific and within our communities we helped out clearing roads for no monetary gain. We did that because we’re passionate about the communities we live in. Rural communities gel when there’s a crisis. Long may it last.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1453972616579252c1150ddd959af093d18ede77/1593_825_1880_1128/master/1880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=804e207c4a08dff1bae58b355484ec43","title":"how ukip embraced the far right podcast","story":"With Brexit talks stalled and some of its supporters pushing a betrayal narrative, the ’s Peter Walker charts how Ukip has begun rising in the polls again.

Even Ireland’s usually understated head coach, Joe Schmidt, is warning his players to brace themselves for a “brutal” first-round collision with England, with the visitors intent on easing the hurt of their fifth-placed finish last season.With Wales and Italy heading for Paris and Edinburgh in no mood to be pushed around, this year’s competition launch in south‑west London almost had the feel of a pre‑fight weigh‑in featuring six knuckle‑cracking boxers. As Schmidt put it when invited to describe the threat posed by Eddie Jones’s side: “He said he was going to bring some brutality and he has some players who can bring that. They are going to be physical and we need to be primed for it.”Among the reasons for the heightened anticipation is that 24 years have passed since England last visited Dublin on the opening weekend. This is also the first time in Six Nations history they have had to tackle an Irish side placed second in the world rankings. With the squads based just a few miles apart in the Algarve this week, the rival Portuguese men o’war both know a slow start will spell big trouble.Jones, having joked about “buying a pair of binoculars” at the airport for spying purposes, clearly believes a softly, softly approach will get England nowhere. “I’ve never seen a Six Nations game that was not brutal,” he said, in no doubt where this season’s title will be won and lost. “Traditionally, if you look at Six Nations history over the years, it’s a big gainline contest. Ball-in-play time is also higher in the Six Nations than any other tournament in the world. You’ve got to be prepared for it and we’ll be prepared, I’m sure Ireland are not over in Portugal sunbathing. They’ll be preparing for a tough old contest.”Ireland’s captain, Rory Best, does not disagree, confirming his side are anticipating a “monster” test against opponents who could easily throw a major ner in the works. “If you don’t perform well, England have the firepower to beat you well. But that fear’s a good thing … it drives you on.”Mixed in with all the big bang theory is the small matter of the looming Rugby World Cup, which means all involved will have to box clever. With Ireland and Scotland occupying the same World Cup pool, their round‑two meeting at Murrayfield has extra resonance and Wales’s Warren Gatland has suggested his team may keep some of their Japanese cards hidden during the Six Nations. He also believes, even so, that victory in Paris on the tournament’s opening Friday night will set Wales on the road to winning the title for the first time since 2013.Italy, whose captain and totem Sergio Parisse is poised to beat Brian O’Driscoll’s record for the most Six Nations appearances by any player, are also making bullish noises, arguing their 66-3 autumn defeat by New Zealand in Rome does not reflect the progress Italian rugby has made at both Test and provincial level over the past 12 months. With two Scottish representatives in the last eight of the European Champions’ Cup and France also showing signs of perking up, the tournament – now backed by Guinness, the third different title sponsor in as many years – has rarely been more eagerly awaited.Even Jones, who has been around umpteen blocks in both hemispheres, sounds more excited than at any stage in his England tenure. “There’s a sign outside saying it’s the greatest tournament in the world. Four years ago I wouldn’t have said that but having been involved in it there’s nothing like this tournament. The intensity, the contest, how much it means to people, it’s a real honour to be involved in it.”As for the looming Irish challenge, he is well aware England will need to be on top form to win in Dublin for the first time since 2013. “There are two contests against Ireland, one in the air and one on the ground and you have to win both of those to win the game,” said Jones, confirming that the former England captain Will Carling would once again be offering leadership guidance to players during the coming months. “We’ll pick a side to win those battles.”There is also the associated issue of which coach emerges as the favourite to coach the 2021 Lions in South Africa. Gatland has expressed an interest but Schmidt, for now, is playing down his chances, reiterating that he may well take a break from coaching completely rather than make himself available to coach the Lions or the All Blacks. “I’m an incredibly accidental coach. It’s not that I don’t love the game, it just wasn’t my intended career. I’ve had an unbelievable time in the game, whether it be with Bay of Plenty, with Leinster, and now with Ireland. I think you’ve got to run out of luck at some stage.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0728d1b5156d5407e9a8ffc37c101e58abf2c20b/0_124_4088_2453/master/4088.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f939a0df811ae55cee634974a57c031e","title":"australia v sri lanka first test day one live","story":"The upside for Sri Lanka is they’ll probably be bowling at the best time in the match when they’re thrown the new ball under lights on a day one Gabba track. Four for Cummins, three for Richardson on debut, two for Starc - taking him beyond 200 in Tests, and one for Lyon. A very happy 56.4 overs for Australia in Brisbane.Chameera’s 20-ball stay ends on 0. He’s not good enough to attack Cummins but he tries anyway, the ball skewing in the air to the safe hands of Patterson at fourth slip. One slog too many for Dickwella and his enterprising knock comes to an end. Length from Cummins invited Dickwella to swing across the line but the ball lobbed gently off the bat to the debutant Patterson at midwicket. The end is nigh. 56th over: Sri Lanka 144-8 (Dickwella 64, Chameera 0) If some of Dickwella’s batting to the pacemen has been a tad graceless, his form against Lyon has been much more aesthetically pleasing. A reverse sweep deserved better than to find the field, a beautiful lofted drive over the covers was worth more than two, while the conventional sweep to rotate the strike was executed with authority. As is becoming a pattern, Chameera has no problem blocking his complement to advance the partnership. 55th over: Sri Lanka 141-8 (Dickwella 61, Chameera 0) Dickwella continues to tee off to maximum effect with the minimum of technique. A wild larrup to Cummins’ first ball skims off the toe of the bat, over Paine, and away for four. Further hoicks are aimed with varying degrees of success until he relinquishes the strike to Chameera for two deliveries. Again the man with an average of five holds up his end, despite being beaten all ends up by a Cummins conker in the corridor of catastrophe. 54th over: Sri Lanka 134-8 (Dickwella 54, Chameera 0) This is already the highest partnership of the match, despite Chameera contributing nothing off his own bat. However, in the circumstances that is fine, and he enhances his reputation by playing a straight bat to a Lyon maiden. 53rd over: Sri Lanka 134-8 (Dickwella 54, Chameera 0) Dickwella is compelling viewing. A missed ramp precedes a mistimed hook which is followed by a top edged drive, all of which advances the scoreboard by two runs. A couple of play and misses and a bunted drive to the ring field end the six with Chameera on strike for the start of Lyon’s next over. If this is not used in an end-of-play montage by one of the broadcasters I will eat my hat*.*I have a miniature novelty chocolate hat for just these purposes. 52nd over: Sri Lanka 132-8 (Dickwella 52, Chameera 0) Nathan Lyon continues his work from the Stanley Street end, and again Dickwella declines an easy single before finding the boundary, this time with a firm sweep that just beats the fielder on the square-leg rope. That stroke brings up a very entertaining 50, Dickwella’s 11th in Tests. A single brings Chameera on strike but the tailender does his bit, blocking three balls with the minimum of fuss. Channel Seven referencing the recent blackout at the Gabba during the BBL. 51st over: Sri Lanka 127-8 (Dickwella 47, Chameera 0) Pat Cummins begins the action in this awkward twilight spell where natural night and the floodlights are competing for dominance. Dickwella is on strike and he tries to smack the pink pill to Ipswich just about every delivery. A French cut results in a declined single and after a couple of whoosh and misses he connects with a firm cut for four through point. The piece de resistance is a single through gully from the final delivery to retain strike. Ok, play will resume after Dinner shortly. Just the small matter of 40 (forty) overs to squeeze into the next two-and-a-half hours. Channel 7 and Fox Sports will be delighted. On that subject, Jon Coghill (ex-Powderfinger drummer), might even be reading this blog. He definitely keeps in touch with the .

Be like Gary:And our own Adam Collins captured the moment beautifully. That said, that doesn’t mean there’s an absence of entertainment. Far from it with Niroshan Dickwella at the crease. Shortly before Dinner he unfurled one of the most outrageous shots even seen in Test cricket. “Evening Jonathan,” evening Phil Withall. Pleasure as always to have you on board. “I confess to being slightly disappointed in the Sri Lankan performance so far. After a fairly competitive showing against England, although in a series defeat, they seem to have struggled significantly on their travels. The New Zealand tour was underwhelming and today’s efforts aren’t much better. I hope I’m wrong but this series is already looking a little bit grim”. I hope you’re wrong too Phil, but I don’t think you will be. I know it’s tempting fate to say Australia are going to win this Test inside three days, but I’m going to. How Tim Paine must have wished he had the chance of leading his team out against India at the Gabbatoir. It really is a graveyard for touring sides. Here’s some archival footage of the St Lawrence Lime in action over a century ago. One of the figures captured in this extraordinary scene (as an umpire) is the 1899 Wisden cricketer of the year, Albert Trott. The Melbourne-born allrounder represented both Australia and England, and legend has it he’s the only batsman to smite a ball over the pavilion at Lord’s. He is also one of only two players to take two hat-tricks in the same first-class innings.It’s always a pleasure to follow in your blogsteps Mr Lemon, easily my favourite contributor to cricket with a name that misleadingly implies citrus fruit since the St Lawrence Lime. Thanks very much Geoff. Slipping into the chair like... Australia’s day, despite a little comeback there from Dickwella. The home team have bowled accurately and let the conditions do the work. Richardson has three wickets, Starc and Cummins two apiece, and Lyon one. For Sri Lanka, only Dickwella has been able to muster resistance on a pitch with a touch of swing and seam movement when the ball is in the right spot.Of course, the evening session can be tricky to bat if the ball is moving, so Australia might not love their chance with the bat once they knock over these last two wickets.That’s it from me, it’ll be Jonathan Pheasant Howcroft to accompany you through the evening, give you a bath, sing you a song, and put you to bed.50th over: Sri Lanka 122-8 (Dickwella 42, Chameera 0) Last over before the dinner break. And humming Moloko, Dickwella decides that the time is now. He backs away outside leg and slaps the ball over cover for four! Gave it a clout, and Head can’t haul it in. Next ball Dickwella punches the gap at backward point and gets back for a second run. Then to complete the set, Dickwella steps across and ramps him waaaaaay over the keeper for six! Perfect contact, that extravagant shot, falling to the off side, toppling over, ending up flat on the ground, but having got his angled bat under the ball to trampoline it dead straight behind the batsman and into the sightscreen behind Tim Paine. Glorious. Glorious. Then a single to fine leg, giving Chameera one ball to block out, which he does. So Sri Lanka reach the break with Dickwella ready to resume, on strike, to try and clout them some more much-needed runs.13 from that over.49th over: Sri Lanka 109-8 (Dickwella 29, Chameera 0) Richardson bowling and Dickwella wants to get him away. Tries a ramp shot over fine leg but doesn’t connect. Pulls through midwicket and gets back for the second run. Then plays a short-arm swat to midwicket, just dinked that ball away deliberately for a single, giving Chameera one ball to survive. The bowler (who is currently batting) sways away from the ball outside off. 48th over: Sri Lanka 106-8 (Dickwella 26, Chameera 0) Edged into the gully by Chameera first ball, on the bounce. Then a big appeal for an edge, and Starc gets Paine to go upstairs, but DRS finds daylight between ball and edge. Dickwella will have strike for the next over, and it’s time for him to have a dip. The field drops back aside from four in the cordon. Only a matter of time. Perera was struggling, of course, so he decided he wanted to thunk something. Had a big drive at Starc, but was yanking his hand off the bat handle even before the outside edge had reached third slip.47th over: Sri Lanka 105-7 (Dickwella 25, Perera 1) Cummins streaming in from the Vulture Street end, long fluid run-up, striding along next to his lengthening shadow. Dickwella drives three runs through cover, exposing Perera to the bowling. The wounded man blots out four balls.46th over: Sri Lanka 102-7 (Dickwella 22, Perera 1) Perera may not want an X-ray, but he yanks his hand off the bat handle as soon as he plays his first defensive shot. Not encouraging but he’s brave to come back out. Plays and misses at the next.There it is! Starc’s 200th Test wicket is restored to him, after a DRS review earlier took it away. Lakmal slashes a boundary through backward point, then edges the next into the cordon. It was a full ball speaking in at the stumps from around the wicket from the left-armer, and Lakmal’s defensive prod took the thick edge low to third slip.Starc’s 200th wicket in his 50th Test, nice round numbers. And what’s this? Dilruwan Perera is coming back to bat on. No trips to hospital, no X-rays, straight back to the middle.45th over: Sri Lanka 97-6 (Dickwella 21, Lakmal 3) After a drinks break, Cummins continues and he’s bashed Perera in the glove! That really hurt. The batsman dropped his blade immediately as he was hit, and the ball lobbed away to land safely despite the attentions of short leg. But of more concern might be his broken thumb. That hit Perera on his bowling hand, and the off-spinner is Sri Lanka’s only slow bowler. If it’s broken, Sri Lanka are in even more trouble.And he’s going to come off. He retires hurt, unable to carry his bat off the field. Big trouble. Suranga Lakmal replaces him, and plays a lovely flick off his pads first ball to pick up three through midwicket. That’s a nice start. “How’s he going to go with the short ball?” asks Stuart Clark on the radio. “Not good,” answers Roshan Abeysinghe without hesitation.44th over: Sri Lanka 93-6 (Dickwella 20, Perera 1) Dickwella might be well advised to play some shots and harvest a few runs while he can. The way Australia has batted lately, anything over 200 against them could be enough. But that’s a long way away. Dickwella takes a single first ball of the over and lets Perera face Starc. The lower-order batsman plays into the cordon twice, three times, squeezing the ball away as Starc gets his line right. Then Perera finds a single to cover."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3e97e67d6c4d55cc39681a26e2ffeb9052c89fc/0_67_5070_3043/master/5070.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28591ad1ffc9fb0f5bee187b5477b9d8","title":"petra kvitova v danielle collins australian open womens semi finals live","story":"So, it ends on the narrowest of calls, but with a consistent quality of tennis that you’d expect from two semi-finals.It loomed for the merest of moments as a potential all-Czech final as Karolina Pliskova threatened to back up from her heroics last night in defeating Serena Williams during a pulsating second set in which she was nearly flawless, levelling the ledger against Naomi Osaka. But it was the Japanese who found an extra gear in the third, returning to some of the aggressive, fine-margin tennis that saw her power through the opening set - one break proving enough to grind out a three-set thriller in just shy of two hours. 56 winners and 15 aces from the world No 4 who could leap to world No 1 with a win here in Melbourne.Her opponent in the final Petra Kvitova also has eyes on that prize, after she progressed in relatively easier fashion against the unseeded American Danielle Collins. In sweltering Melbourne heat, where the temperature rose to 40 degrees centigrade, the Czech had to battle heat as well as the determined outsider Collins. Kvitova looked there for the taking in a tough first set, but the decision to close the roof with the match poised at 4-4 seemed to help settle the Czech, who closed down the match superbly 7-6 (7-2), 6-0 with powerful serving and clever ground strokes.That’s all for now - we’ll be back later tonight with the first of our men’s semi-finals. Don’t miss it, as Rafael Nadal faces the Federer-slayer, Greece’s Stefanos Tsitsipas, live from Rod Laver Arena. Thanks for your company!Serving for the match, Osaka puffs out her cheeks and draws a deep breath after she finds the net with an unforced error to make it 15-15. Is the pressure showing? Another unforced error sees Pliskova level again at 30-30 but the Japanese keeps her cool to bring up match point! She aces, or at least she thinks she does, but the call is out. She challenges, naturally, and would you believe it, she’s bang on! The ball clipped the line and Osaka is in the semis!We said it was a game of margins, and a brave Pliskova bows out - game, set, match Osaka!Third set: Pliskova* 4-5 Osaka (*denotes server): And under huge pressure the Czech holds on dramatic tennis, as you’d expect in a semi-final, with a shot at becoming world No 1 for both women also on the line. Osaka pushes for the match, but Pliskova hangs in. The Japanese to serve for the match.Third set: Pliskova 3-5 Osaka* (*denotes server): A key third point as Osaka offers up a second serve with the score 15-all. But Pliskova drags her shot long. The Czech then misses a winner by millimetres, but returns well to force 30-40. Another strong return draws the Osaka error for deuce - here we go?And another excellent deep return at the feet of Osaka draws a shot that drifts long. Break point - and she fires an ace to the corner! Her 14th of the night. Pressure tennis, this. And Osaka holds.Third set: Pliskova* 3-4 Osaka (*denotes server): Pliskova again finding joy with the pinning serve she’s not enjoyed too many aces tonight (still just the one?) but she’s targeting her opponent well. Osaka pounces on a weak second serve and fires a cross-court forehand, but Pliskova holds well. She still trails the one break though.Third set: Pliskova 2-4 Osaka* (*denotes server): The crowd very much behind the young Japanese, despite the quality tennis from both players, and they squeal with delight as she rattles off another service game to love. An interest patch here, with both players holding well, almost for the first time all match.Third set: Pliskova* 2-3 Osaka (*denotes server): Solid service game, and she kicks wide and curling to evade Osaka. Important steadying game for the Czech.Third set: Pliskova 1-3 Osaka* (*denotes server): Just what the doctor ordered as Osaka flies to 40-0, a run of nine consecutive points. Pliskova fires one back, but it’s a relatively comfortable service game for the Japanese. Now to try and turn the screws on her opponent’s serve.Third set: Pliskova* 1-2 Osaka (*denotes server): Wowee. This match is see-sawing dramatically. Osaka with a big winner, before she digs out a tough cramping serve to open up three break points. She wins to love - could that be the decisive break?The way the last fifteen minutes has played out you wouldn’t bet on it. But a big service game from Osaka here could spark a run.Third set: Pliskova 1-1 Osaka* (*denotes server): A big winner fires the Japanese after dropping the opening point. She follows with a curling ace and the crowd respond to lift. A big return from Pliskova earns a break point, but Osaka saves it with a fiercely struck forehand, and fires off a big “Come on”!She drags a forehand just long and Pliskova looks at a second break point - again though it’s a bigger winner down the line from Osaka to save. Pliskova earns a third break chance with a big winner of her own, but she just clips the tape of the net on the next and slams her racquet in frustration. Osaka eventually holds - what a marathon game!Third set: Pliskova* 1-0 Osaka (*denotes server): Pliskova pins her opponent again with the serve that’s the risk when standing so close while receiving, I guess. The radar is looking better tuned now from Pliskova and she opens the third set with a hold.Just three errors in that entire second set - she may have started it a woman looking like she’d played her final yesterday (against Serena Williams) but Pliskova finishes it like a woman who means business.It’s a shot dragged long from Osaka to open, before a powerful forehand clips the tape and drops fortuitously over for Pliskova. She offers the customary apology, but it can barely conceal her pleasure. What a time of the match for a moment like that! An error from Osaka offers up three set points, and Pliskova is good enough to take the first. Well, this is a turn about. One set a piece: game on!Second set: Pliskova* 5-4 Osaka (*denotes server): It starts comfortably for the Czech, but a big Osaka forehand in the corner and then a double fault open a small window. Pliskova looking much stronger in this second set though, and she holds to put the pressure on Osaka.Second set: Pliskova 4-4 Osaka* (*denotes server): Pliskova with a big forehand winner down the line off a looping second serve, but Osaka punches a sharp jabbed backhand winner in return. They trade blows like two heavyweight boxers as Pliskova slogs a winner down the line for deuce. Osaka survives a break point, and rattles off a big winner to hold. A huge game. Pliskova was almost serving for the second set.Second set: Pliskova* 4-3 Osaka (*denotes server): A terrific rally on the second point, as Pliskova again forces her opponent to cover a stack of ground. A first ace of the match - remarkably - takes the Czech to 40-15 and she closes out the game well.Second set: Pliskova 3-3 Osaka* (*denotes server): Booming ace down the T to open - a seventh of the match so far. She drops a solitary point through a double fault, but it’s a temporary blip as the Japanese closes with an ace.Second set: Pliskova* 3-2 Osaka (*denotes server): First look at a second serve and Osaka monsters it from a metre inside the baseline. Pliskova comes to the net next point, but Osaka fires a cross-court winner past her. Pliskova then pins her with a well-directed serve, before the Japanese reels off another powerful forehand winner. A real battle, but she holds the Czech - a big game.Second set: Pliskova 2-2 Osaka* (*denotes server): Osaka fires some near perfect shots, deep and under the feet of the 6ft+ Czech, before serving well, to round out a first game of the match to love.Second set: Pliskova* 2-1 Osaka (*denotes server): It’s advantage the returner as Osaka races to bring up three break points, 0-40. Pliskova saves the first, and the second, and then the third after a hard-fought rally. Three big first serves to dig her way out of a hole, and that’s a great service hold, and perhaps a big morale boost too.Second set: Pliskova 1-1 Osaka* (*denotes server): Pliskova with a strong winner down the line, before Osaka punches one wide. The Czech brings up two break points, Osaka saves the first with an ace, but she can’t prevent the second. A break straight back - this is more positive from the world No 7.Second set: Pliskova* 0-1 Osaka (*denotes server): She’s creating angles from nowhere, Osaka, as she fires a sharp cross-court forehand winner to start the game, before firing a winner down the line. She misses the overhead smash, to allow Pliskova a foothold back in the game. But Osaka pounces once again - a set and now a break it’s a blistering start for the Japanese.Pliskova draws the error on the opening point as she mixes her pace on returns, but Osaka fires an ace in response. Osaka challenges an out call and is proved correct by a few millimetre, and turns round a crucial point for 40-30. Then closes with a big ace. Upon such fine margins championship matches can turn!First set: Pliskova* 2-5 Osaka (*denotes server): Terrific rally on the fourth point, Osaka like an spring ready to uncoil on every groundstroke. Pliskova works her well to the edges, but the Japanese punches a winner. The Czech saves a break point with a fine backhand winner, but Osaka forces her through two deuces. A double fault hands her younger opponent a second break, and a chance to serve for the set.First set: Pliskova 2-4 Osaka* (*denotes server): Few chinks in the armour on that service game, as Osaka drops just one point. She serves well to the edges, and attacks each shot with verve, rattling off several winners.First set: Pliskova* 2-3 Osaka (*denotes server): Far more comfortable on serve from the Czech, and she makes short work of that game. Now to put pressure on Osaka’s serve.First set: Pliskova 1-3 Osaka* (*denotes server): Osaka looking really sharp, and she drops just one point during a pretty comfortable service game. But it’s her speed across the court that’s worrying Pliskova. What can the Czech come up with over the next few games?First set: Pliskova* 1-2 Osaka (*denotes server): A huge return of serve from Osaka gets Pliskova on the run before a double fault brings up two break points. She saves the first with a well worked rally, before cramping Osaka on the next with a clever serve. Osaka works her opponent well after a blistering winner down the line though, and she grabs the first break of the match!First set: Pliskova 1-1 Osaka* (*denotes server): Osaka drops the opening two points but builds her way into the game. A big ace at 30-30 helps steady the early nerves but again it goes to deuce. Pliskova also pouncing on the early second serves, but she can’t quite fashion the break. Osaka holds, as Pliskova makes any early unsuccessful challenge to a line call.First set: Pliskova* 1-0 Osaka (*denotes server): The tall Czech serves first with noticeable taping on her left knee. Hopefully that won’t affect her game today. It’s a mixed bag as Osaka looks to attack the second serve early and earns herself a break point. But Pliskova fires a strong serve down the T to save, before holding the game following a long rally.Both players make their way out onto the Rod Laver Arena, first Pliskova, followed closely by Osaka. A decent reception for both, but the Australian crowd leaning slightly towards Osaka in terms of support.And it’s hit 40 degrees in Melbourne. So much for a top of 36, predicted pre-game!They begin their warm ups. Pliskova with a 6cm height advantage over her opponent she’s never won a grand slam, despite making No 1 a few years back. Osaka, of course with the one grand slam victory, in that remarkable win at the US Open against Serena Williams last year.So, to find out who will be Kvitova’s opponent in the final, and on to our second semi-final, between Karolina Pliskova and Naomi Osaka.There were some shots of Osaka earlier taking a keen look at the “heat stress” index graphic just before the roof was closed. My understanding is we’ll stay with the roof closed for this second semi - not sure if that will favour anyone in particular.A relieved Kvitova talks to Jim Courier. “The first set was very tight for myself, I’m really glad it came (together) in the tie-break.”“I’m glad the roof closed, I prefer to play indoor.”Certainly it was something that seemed to change proceedings, with the game tight at 4-4, and Kvitova’s serve getting noticeably better in the controlled environment. Still, her ground game proved too strong for Collins, and surely nobody would malign the Czech a finals appearance.A big volley from the net, a strong serve down the T, a forehand from Collins dragged wide, and she finishes with a big forehand winner! And so ends the brave run of the unseeded Danielle Collins - but it’s a return to a grand slam final for Petra Kvitova!Second set: Kvitova 5-0 Collins* (*denotes server): She won’t go down without swinging, however Collins. After some shaky serves she runs Kvitova from corner to corner, winning a long baseline volley before smashing a high double-backhander cross-court. Kvitova steels herself with a punchy return of serve, before Collins misses a drop shot. And the Czech leaps on yet another second serve to break for a third time this set.Second set: Kvitova* 4-0 Collins (*denotes server): She has arguably the best service game of the four remaining women, and in the controlled conditions the tall left hander begins to consistently hit her strides. Collins no chance on a sliding serve out wide, but she anticipates an overhead volley from the net well to scramble to 30-30. Kvitova closes out the game calmly though, and holds.Second set: Kvitova 3-0 Collins* (*denotes server): A rare foray to the net from Collins, but the Czech is good enough to loop her opponent, and then comes to the net herself to line up two break points. Huge cross-court backhand to win it, and Kvitova brings up a second break.Second set: Kvitova* 2-0 Collins (*denotes server): Kvitova begins to find her groove, firing some strong first and second serves, and races through the game, dropping just one point.Collins needs to find something, including some more first serves if she’s to chase this match.Second set: Kvitova 1-0 Collins* (*denotes server): Now Collins argues the toss after a faulty let call. It’s one thing to be “feisty”, but she seems rattled here. A second mechanical let call sounds on a fault and the American is deeply unhappy in not being allowed to reserve. Trailing 15-40 she changes her racquet, and saves a break with a sharp forehand winner. But she misses one from the deep, and Kvitova enjoys an early break.We start on serve, but it’s a first mini-break to Kvitova as Collins cries in frustration as the Czech fires a forehand deep and fast to the corner. Collins clips the tape to go down 3-1, before framing a serve deep. Kvitova fires a backhand winner to race to 5-1. Collins argues the toss with the chair umpire Carlos Ramos as a serve is called wide. Kvitova fires an ace down the T, then volleys home from the net. Ice cool, from the now cooled down Czech - who fires a glowering look back over the net. First set, Kvitova.First set: Kvitova 6-6 Collins* (*denotes server): The game opens with a 17-hit rally, and it’s Kvitova who seems to expend the most energy during it. Collins races to 40-0 as Kvitova punches a wild forehand well wide. Another love hold, and we have a tie-break.First set: Kvitova* 6-5 Collins (*denotes server): Why all this temperature chat matters is of course that with the roof closed, serving conditions are now a little more comfortable. In theory that aids Kvitova, but there are plenty of permutations such as racquet tension, ball speed etc that are affected, and require adjustment.Kvitova doesn’t make light work of her second service game in the new conditions, being dragged to deuce with an unforced error. She holds on the first advantage point though, and pumps the fist.First set: Kvitova 5-5 Collins* (*denotes server): So much for that pre-game forecast of 33 it’s just hit 38 degrees in Melbourne, hence the roof closing. At least we’re not in Adelaide today, it’s 47.Collins continues to miss her first serve, but she’s defending her second serves well. Kvitova misses a straight-forward enough drop shop, and Collins holds - snarling a glare over the net at her opponent.First set: Kvitova* 5-4 Collins (*denotes server): So we recommence after a 6-7 minute break as the roof is closed. Both women are beginning to become more vocal as Collins rattles off a big “Come on” after firing a blistering forehand winner. The let cord gives Kvitova a lucky drop and she offers her opponent the customary apology. She goes on to hold, as Collins cries out in frustration after a return flies long.And, hello “heat stress” - our tournament referee has come lurking out of the shadows to announce the roof will be closed, with the on-court heat stress indicator hitting 5. Collins argues the toss, but to no avail. She presumably fancies her chances against Kvitova in the heat, but that’s moot now, the roof shuts.First set: Kvitova 4-4 Collins* (*denotes server): New balls and Collins utilises the extra pace well, racing through her service game. Big forehand down the line on route to a first hold to love of the game.First set: Kvitova* 4-3 Collins (*denotes server): A positive start for the Czech, who fires a booming ace down the T, then snaps a forehand winner down the line to race to 40-0. Kvitova then with a double fault before Collins fires a sliced return that earns the crowd’s admiration. Kvitova steadies however, and holds.First set: Kvitova 3-3 Collins* (*denotes server): Collins striding between serves with purpose but again her first serve percentage remains low. Kvitova monsters a few second serves. An errant forehand from Kvitova sees her miss a chance to break straight back, and again she fires long on a second break point. Collins saves to deuce before Kvitova snarls off her first celebratory growl of the day after bringing up a fourth break point. Collins fires back an ace to save, but it’s fifth time a charm, as Kvitova breaks straight back.First set: Kvitova* 2-3 Collins (*denotes server): Both players are retreating to the shade at the back of the court between serves, and it’s Kvitova who blinks first, allowing her opponent a look at two break points. Collins squanders the first as Kvitova fires a second serve up the T, but a terrific cross-court backhand secures the break! First blood, Collins. First set: Kvitova 2-2 Collins* (*denotes server): Kvitova prowling very much inside the baseline looking to pressurise the Collins serve, it doesn’t come off to start with, but she fires another forehand winner to bring it back to 30-15. Collins mixes up her pace to draw the error on return, but another double fault puts her under pressure. Kvitova challenges a line call but it’s long. Collins holds.First set: Kvitova* 2-1 Collins (*denotes server): Huge serve to the American’s backhand for Kvitova, who then rattles of a strong winner. Another baseline rally sees Kvitova fire long, but she snaps a forehand cross-court to take the game. A note on the heat, I was perhaps a touch blasé earlier - the new “heat index” is being looked at quite closely should it persist much higher we could see a temperature break.First set: Kvitova 1-1 Collins* (*denotes server): Collins starts brightly, racing through the first points before Kvitova launches a fine cross-court winner. A double fault and a nervy second serve brings the world No 6 to the net, but she only finds the tape. Collins settles to hold.First set: Kvitova* 1-0 Collins (*denotes server): Kvitova serves first and starts by losing the first point before blasting the second past Collins’ forehand. The American attacks the serve well to take 15-30, but a long rally sees the Czech fire a precision pass to level. Kvitova steadies and holds.Both players have headed out on to Rod Laver court and begun their warm ups so we’re not too far away with live action.Flicking through the history books re an unseeded player running deep into the tournament, here’s the seeding of the player that’s won the women’s singles over the last ten years or so:The year before that (in 2007) it was in fact an unseeded player who won, but that was Serena Williams so not exactly an unknown quantity. Before that? Christine O’Neil in 1978.Much has been made of Collins’ mental toughness, we’ll see how she fares on that front shortly.Obviously the grand slam title is the thing at this stage of the tournament, but an interesting subplot is who will be crowned women’ss world No 1 come tournament’s end?Simona Halep’s exit at the hands of Serena Williams means one of three women could claim the crown - including Petra Kvitova - with our second semi-finalists Naomi Osaka and Karolina Pliskova also in the frame.She’s never been to the summit before, Kvitova (although she climbed to world No 2 in 2011) - will that add pressure or provide extra incentive for the Czech today?It’s a crisp 33 degrees in Melbourne today, with tops of 36. So positively balmy given recent temperatures. It shouldn’t affect players too much, but we’ll watch that as the matches progress.If you’re just waking up from an extensive slumber and double checking your guides as to who Danielle Collins is, here’s a fine backgrounder from Whitney McIntosh on the unseeded American:“I’m feisty. I love making it kind of a war. If somebody wants to get in my face on my unforced errors, I have no problem getting right back”. Your move, Kvitova.Hello to all and sundry - good evening, good morning, to thee and thine from wherever you’re following  Australia’s coverage today.It’s Richard Parkin in the chair, and as ever please enlighten your fellow readers with your best insights, witticisms and general observations. Fire me an email or tweet to join the coverage.First up, who do you fancy to win today, and why?And so to the day after the night before. With the dramatic late capitulation of Serena Williams the women’s draw at the Australian Open has been blown wide open. Today we find out who will capitalise on that space.Danielle Collins has had a fairytale run at the tournament, as the scourge of both Julia Goerges and Angelique Kerber looks to continue her remarkable run. Standing her way is Petra Kvitova who must certainly be eyeing a third grand slam with the biggest guns in the women’s draw falling before the semi finals.We’ll have first action shortly, so put your kettle to the metal and clear your evenings, it’s women’s semi-finals action, live from Melbourne."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b52adc1fd9ad71c0d0c0b28fdf121f2f235358d9/128_126_3621_2172/master/3621.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=556248201b5b43cc97c4f3ab33a90313","title":"stefanos tsitsipas rafael nadal australian open semi final live","story":" The head-to-head doesn’t make great reading for Tsitsipas – he was blown away on the Barcelona clay last May 6-2, 6-1 and also lost to Nadal a few months later in the Rogers Cup final – but that’s not putting him off. “I felt very close to beating him in Toronto, though the score was 6-2, 7-6,” he says. “I remember coming back to the locker room and promising to myself I’m going to do much better against him next time. “It felt like I understood a bit better what he was doing on the court after that match, and especially on hard court. It’s going to be interesting. I feel like I can do something good against him.” Nadal, meanwhile, appears slightly wary. “They can wait a little bit,” he says of the young challengers. “But looks like they don’t want to wait. They’re here. “Stefanos is one of the best players of the world. He’s ready to win against anybody. To have the chance to be in that final, I need to play my best, and that’s what I am looking for.”They’re raising the roof! Nadal will be happy with that. His powers are slightly weakened indoors, and wasn’t too happy playing under the roof in the Wimbledon semi-final against Novak Djokovic last year.“There is a considerable fanbase growing around the charismatic Greek player with the single-handed backhand and the multi-layered brain. He is different, a relaxed and attractive thinker who says there is more to life than tennis, yet gives the impression he would drive himself to the extremities of collapse to win a big match. Nadal might force him to go to that place.” These are the words of our man in Melbourne, Kevin Mitchell. You can read the rest of his thoughts on the semi-final here.Meanwhile there will be no grand slam final for Britain’s Neal Skupski. He and Spain’s María José Martínez Sánchez lost 6-0, 6-4 to the third seeds, Barbora Krejcikova and Rajeev Ram, in the mixed doubles semis.As I try to thaw out after my icy walk into  Towers this morning in temperatures of minus one, the news that it’s still more than 40 degrees in Melbourne is making me feel slightly warmer. It means the roof is closed, as it was during the women’s semi-finals, when Petra Kvitova ended the run of the unseeded American Danielle Collins 7-6, 6-0 and Naomi Osaka held off a comeback from the inspired conqueror of Serena Williams, Karolina Pliskova, 6-2, 4-6, 6-4. What a final that should be on Saturday. Kvitova will be playing in her first grand slam final since nearly losing fingers in a knife attack just over two ago and her first since Wimbledon 2014, while Osaka is going for back-to-back major wins after her breakthrough triumph at the US Open. And there’s more than just the title on the line the winner will take the world No 1 ranking from Simona Halep.Good morningafternoonevening depending on your worldly whereabouts and welcome to our coverage of the first men’s semi-final between the man of the week and the man of the fortnight.While the 20-year-old sensation Stefanos Tsitsipas caused a major Melbourne earthquake on Sunday by ending Roger Federer’s title defence for the win of his life, Rafael Nadal has created few tremors because his progress has been so smooth. He’s won all his matches in straight sets, hasn’t been broken since the first round and, having already dismissed two Next Gen talents in Alex de Minaur and Frances Tiafoe, appears to be in the mood to show another young upstart who’s boss.The 32-year-old was underestimated coming into the tournament because of his wretched run of injuries since Wimbledon last year, but every time you think the end credits on his career may be about to roll, the stubborn and superb Spaniard keeps. Coming. Back. And tennis is all the better for that.If one of Nadal’s assorted ailments flares up today, whether it be his taped abdomen, the thigh strain that forced his withdrawal from Brisbane this month, the ankle that was operated on last year or his perennially creaking knees, Tsitsipas can take full advantage. The long-haired, bandanaed Greek with the look of Bjorn Borg, the competitiveness of Andy Murray and the one-handed backhand of Federer has wowed the Melbourne crowds with his bold play, skill at the net and unwavering self-belief. He showed little fear against Federer in the last 16 and will be determined to do the same today, even though this is his first grand slam semi-final and he’s facing a man appearing in his 30th.For some time Alexander Zverev has been the undisputed leader of the Next Gen, widely regarded as the player most likely to break tennis’s established order and shake up a sport that has become an old man’s game at the very top level but now, suddenly, another young challenger with the X-factor has come along.

I was about 15 and desperately wanted to be an actor. Here was this strange, cryptic play. But it was written in my language. It was the first play I ever read where I felt the dialogue could just roll off my tongue.There were veins of paranoia running through this man, Stanley, who is hiding out in a seaside resort when these people come to torture and interrogate him. I loved the fact that nothing is explained. It’s mysterious, but sort of everyday. It’s like a puzzle. I still haven’t quite worked it out.People overdo the importance of the Pinter pauses. Because the dialogue is all packed with meaning, you just have to let it breathe. The pauses kind of tell you how to do it.I’ve seen The Birthday Party staged, but not for a few years. There’s a curious thing with plays you love and want to be in. It’s somehow difficult to go and watch them – I sit there green with envy. This is the first time I’ve done Pinter. Normally, in acting, you’re looking for a backstory and a through-line and asking, where does the character come from? You can’t really apply those rules to Pinter. You have to sort of stand it up, do it moment to moment and see how it comes out. It’s a particular, peculiar challenge, which is very refreshing.There’s an underlying danger in Harold’s plays, and he certainly embodied that. He was a magnificent actor. I did The Hothouse with the great man himself in 1995. My God, there were sparks flying. I played Miss Cutts, and got to do a scene in my nightie and kiss him every night, which was an enormous thrill. He was a wonderful kisser. I have very precious letters from him, always beginning: “Dear Miss Cutts.”In The Hothouse, there is a feeling – also prevalent in Party Time, part of our season – that something very worrying is going on in the next room. It was all like a dream, really, and there are dreamlike sequences in the play that remain in my memory. It’s miraculous to be back in the very theatre where we did The Hothouse, surrounded by marvellous pictures of Harold on the walls.At one matinee of The Hothouse, the casting director of Star Wars was in the audience. So I was cast as a fighter pilot in The Phantom Menace. It’s bizarre but true. I got the part in Star Wars by doing a Pinter play – two things you wouldn’t imagine going together.Jamie Lloyd, our quite brilliant director, is sort of channelling Harold. We joke about it. If we come across a question in rehearsals, he puts his hand to his ear and channels Harold and asks him if it’s OK. Harold once told Jamie that all his plays are comedies, which is not what you’d first think. But there are hilarious moments among the menace."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdcc8e1dc88b6c552c0d8d27a0501581d9607353/0_0_4628_3162/master/4628.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a160f491f65c928bf81251cea4afa929","title":"the slumflowers guide to peckham londons coolest neighbourhood","story":"We spoke to blogger and author Chidera Eggerue (AKA the Slumflower) as part of our Tales of the everyday extraordinary series – where innately curious people reveal the ‘ordinary’ places and things that inspire them. All images captured on the Google Pixel 3 by Stephanie Sian SmithVibrant, arty and home to one of London’s most erse communities, Peckham has cemented itself as a true cultural hotspot – with creative hub Peckham Levels, the legendary Bussey Building and no shortage of galleries and cafes just a few of its draws. But long before SE15 was named by Time Out as one of the world’s coolest neighbourhoods, it was the stomping ground of blogger and best-selling author Chidera Eggerue.With 187,000 Instagram followers, Eggerue is now known globally by her online moniker, the Slumflower – a name borrowed from Street Etiquette’s concept of a rose growing from concrete. Her debut book, What a Time to be Alone: the Slumflower’s Guide to Why You Are Already Enough, is now in its third print run and she has recently published her second, Scribble Yourself Feminist. Growing up in south-east London, Eggerue mirrors the Slumflower message of growing, glowing and flourishing in an urban environment. Here, she presents her very personal guide to Peckham, reflecting on the everyday extraordinary places that fire up her imagination …Taste some proper Nigerian foodI live with my mum and two brothers and I don’t really eat out much as my mum is an amazing cook. She makes jollof rice, egusi (a type of melon seed) soup, beans and yam. She also shops local and buys her meat and vegetables from the market in Peckham.But if you want to know a good Nigerian restaurant in the area, I would suggest 805 Restaurants – I get plantain and jollof rice. Afterwards, stop by Cafe Spice, a small, yellow shop opposite the Bussey Building. Look out for a Nigerian snack called a puff puff, which is very sweet and like a fried doughnut.Kick back with a drinkJohn the Unicorn is really nice, or Prince of Peckham – it does great chicken, and has really good DJ sets and there’s a party room upstairs. It’s quite new but it’s where I’d go with friends now.

I’ve been going there since I was born and it’s still the only cinema I go to – at a fiver a ticket, you can’t go wrong. I saw the new Incredibles film recently, which I loved it was so cute. Going there and having time to myself is important. What is now above it – the creative workplay hub that is Peckham Levels – used to be a multi-storey car park. My dad used to park there before we went to the cinema and he’d whizz around the levels, it was so much fun. Frank’s Cafe is there now, on the rooftop, but it’s not really my thing.Look out for inspiring wall artWhen I was younger, there was a wall by Peckham library with photos of famous black actors, who I very much aspired to be. The bus I took to secondary school went past it, so I’d see them every day from age 11 to 16. Now the murals are on the walls of the Peckhamplex, which I love.Hit up my beauty go-tosPaks Hair and Cosmetics is where I get my hair treatments, conditioners and extensions. I also go to Anna’s nail shop once a month to get my nails done. (Find it in Ali Baba’s barber shop on 127 Rye Lane.) It’s £25 and quite expensive. I always get pointy nails shellac all the way. I get the brightest, neon colours I can. My tip? Get Anna’s son to do them – he’s the best.Get a coffee fixI get my coffee at the Costa on Rye Lane every day, but it’s not very Peckham! It used to be a Mothercare. My mum would always go in there with me and just the other day I was looking at an old film of me in there, which we still have on tape.

As part of our Tales of the everyday extraordinary series, we’re taking a look at a new cohort of influencers determined to use their devices for more than just selfies. All images captured on the Google Pixel 3 by Laura McCluskeyThey’re often the first thing we look at when we wake up, the last thing we see before we go to bed, and most of us couldn’t go a few hours without thinking about them. No, not our loved ones, but our phones. According to data from Ofcom, people in the UK now check their smartphones – averaged out of a waking day – every 12 minutes. But instead of seeing that as bad, throwing our devices in the sea and going to live in a cave, a new movement suggests that it’s time to re-evaluate our relationship with social media. Instead of seeing it as a time-sucking temptation that turns us into head-down zombies, used in the right way our smartphones might actually be our best tool for enabling memorable real-world moments and making every day more extraordinary.Ironically, it’s social media influencers who are leading the charge for sustainable use of the medium and the beauty of sharing more meaningful content, even if that means sharing less. Author and broadcaster Emma Gannon is the author of Ctrl Alt Delete, which examines the millennial phenomenon of growing up online and balancing the demands of being an influencer with having a private life.“I started to use social media when I was 11 or 12,” she says. “People say the dopamine rush from social media is like having a hug, so we shouldn’t feel bad when someone retweets us 100 times because that feels amazing. But I think it can be a dangerous cycle if that’s the only way to feel good.“I think the more someone is sharing, the more they need validation. As I grow up, I share less because I feel more confident. I don’t need everyone to know what I’m doing all the time because I just feel happy doing it.”Just as the idea of slow living is gaining popularity, so too is slow social media. Fashion journalist Pandora Sykes describes herself as an “accidental influencer” and recently wrote a blog post about conscious sharing. “Call it selfish (I prefer self-protection), but I’ve recently drawn some parameters in the sand,” she writes.Someone who knows only too well the importance of balancing mental health and social media is Katherine Ormerod. With 49.5k followers and a steady income from Instagram posts, her life online looks like an endless stream of sunset selfies and glamorous parties. “I spent years putting on a great show that my life was pretty perfect, and it was exhausting. Then my husband left me when I was 29 and I couldn’t fake it any more,” she says.In her book Why Social Media Is Ruining Your Life, she speaks to influencers who reveal what their lives are really like away from the glossy hair and chia seed smoothies. “At times, I’ve legitimately loved taking pictures, felt creatively challenged and fulfilled, genuinely happy that I’ve finally found somewhere to express myself,” she says. “But I’ve also dealt with the full gamut of emotion that social media can generate. It’s made me want to buy things I can’t afford, made me feel like I’m lazy in comparison to other people and, at times, made me feel very low. It’s also made me feel overweight, unattractive, poor, unstylish, lonely, left out, unpopular and seriously devoid of a sense of humour.”But by realigning our thoughts about our online lives, Ormerod says it is possible to find your digital happy place. “Social media is here to stay, as are our phones, and while ‘off-gridding’ for a certain amount of time is gaining popularity, for most of us it’s really a matter of conscious, mindful consumption,” she says.“We can carve out a new path for a healthy and beneficial relationship, one where we are in the driving seat, controlling our intake and uptake of these digital platforms so they work for us. Instead of wasting any more time ‘comparing despairing’ or zooming in on our saggy knees.”Similarly, Catherine Price, author of How to Break Up With Your Phone, spent 18 months researching mindfulness and neuroplasticity to develop a comprehensive strategy for how to consciously uncouple with her device from time to time. “I still wanted to use social media, but I wanted a new relationship with it – one with better boundaries, and over which I had more control,” she says. “The goal wasn’t to never use my phone again it was to create a sustainable relationship that felt healthy.”Ormerod agrees and says that it’s not just about unfollowing people who make you feel insecure, it’s about seeking out those who educate and illuminate – the people who inspire you to see the everyday world in a different way. “Find content that is going to inspire you and you’re going to have a far, far better experience.”Find out more about the Google Pixel 3 here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e75ace068a76be2c12679dc5bce942d8956c7c1/697_556_698_419/master/698.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e585baefee96e764e01762b4c080e734","title":"power mentors the community activists inspiring young londoners","story":"Anyone’s surroundings can inspire them to change their life – you just have to be willing to see the world with fresh eyes. As part of our Tales of the everyday extraordinary series, we meet a new breed of activists, such as ex-gang member Karl Lokko, who demonstrate just how important this is. Images captured on the Google Pixel 3When Karl Lokko was 12 years old, his life took its first swerve towards danger. He saw someone shot for the first time, on Brixton’s Myatts Field estate, the south London housing block he called home. For years, the estate had earned a reputation as a place where families and children lived in the crossfire of local conflicts. And for a time, it seemed as though Lokko would commit his life to the gang culture that seemed to thrive in his area. Now, though, he considers that estate one of the most meaningful places in his life.“It had a terrible reputation – branded at one point by the press as the ‘Devil’s Den’,” he says. Even then, it was still the backdrop for the childhood games he remembers playing with friends: “Knock down ginger, 4040 home, run outs and park-swing Olympics.” It’s also where Lokko met Pastor Mimi Asher as a young adult – the woman who would eventually turn his life around.And that’s where Lokko’s story leaps from the everyday into the extraordinary. He didn’t follow a route carved out for him, leading away from school and into life on the streets. Instead, the 28-year-old found himself – and a new focus – as close to home as the gangland distractions. He’s grown into one of several inspiring Londoners who’ve used their combination of experience and personal knowledge to turn well-known spaces and activities into life-changing sites of positive change.In Lokko’s case, that came down to how Asher refocused his energy, leading him to a very different life. As in giving TEDx Talks, striking up a friendship with Prince Harry and working as a charity ambassador. By grabbing his life by the lapels and steering it in a new direction, the poet, activist and influencer has matured into someone who’s able to see the mundane in a new light. Lokko credits Pastor Asher for nudging him away from criminality. She would open her flat on the estate to him and other vulnerable young men. And inside, she ran a Christian faith group, which she described to the  as being less about God and scripture and more “about helping to give young men identity, value and something to believe in”.Other innovators similarly use their surroundings as a springboard for community work and making a positive impact. Fellow poet Momtaza Mehri takes inspiration from her London upbringing and Somali heritage to write forceful works that vibrate with the capital’s energy. As this year’s young people’s laureate for London, she tackles everything from gentrification to race, street violence and the living, breathing history of her city. Mehri says her writing is invested in “questions or ideas around disruption or movement, whether it’s movement of people or places, movement between different ideas, between how things change over different generations, and in themes of migration and urban spaces”.Elsewhere in the city, Tanya Compas and Charlie Dark work in separate disciplines but both help their communities see themselves in newly affirming ways. Compas is a youth worker, who – through workshops, events and education – empowers young women of colour to see their worth. She’s won several awards, and is one of the Evening Standard’s 1,000 most influential Londoners. Dark founded Run Dem Crew, a running group that began to help inspire young men of colour that has now turned into a city-wide phenomenon in London.Finally, groups such as Muslim Girls Fence – using the sport of fencing to break down stereotypes about Muslim women – and the Big House, bringing isolated care leavers into theatre production, show what can happen when collectives help amplify marginalised voices. As Sarah Saaed, a teenage Muslim Girls Fence mentor put it, the programme “gives me power. It makes me feel like I have strength and I am powerful, and I’m strong and resilient.” Both programmes excel at allowing their participants to see themselves anew.As for Lokko, he’s developed his poetry and songwriting around the city since Asher demonstrated how Myatts Field estate and the wider community could provide inspiration rather than stir up fear. Take the underground, for example: specifically, the Victoria line’s southernmost stop. “As a Brixton boy, any commute across the city started from this point. But what became apparent to me after a while is that poetry was always a by-product on these trips,” says Lokko.And so he wrote the majority of his first poetry collection, The Butterfly Effect, zooming along in tube carriages, he says. “The underground was where people made contact but rarely connected. The British reserve gave way for silence on crowded carriages that would usher, for me, creativity.” Anyone’s surroundings can turn into sites for new potential – you just have to be willing to see your world with fresh eyes.Find out more about the Google Pixel 3 here "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da22c2d97abb78fa84079c25154eb6dd387da884/193_105_1194_716/master/1194.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86c498a7c0126c8f5b84185440829a69","title":"can i buy a monitor for photo editing that shows colour like print","story":"Pa wants the screen image to be true to the print image, but his budget is only £300I read your answer about the best computer monitor for under £200. I’m looking for a monitor for serious photo editing. I want to get as true to what the print will be like (when printing via online printers). My budget is about £300. PaSad to say, prints can never look like screen images. Screens are bright and display colours using combinations of red, green and blue pixels (RGB). Prints don’t light up so they can’t have the same brightness or contrast range, and they’re printed using cyan, yellow, magenta and black inks (CMYK).Colours are also affected by the light under which you view things, which is why smart buyers take clothes and materials to shop doorways to see what the colours look like in daylight. Do you do the same thing when viewing prints? A print viewed under warm room lighting should not look the same as it does on a monitor set to the standard daylight colour temperature of 6500K, even though your brain will automatically try to compensate for the difference.Nonetheless, photographers can learn from experience of how colours are going to be reproduced, as long as the process is consistent. I was obliged to do this in the days before personal computing, when I edited photography magazines. Today’s DSLR cameras produce images that are much like the colour slides we used to view on lightboxes, so happily this skill has transferred. However, the more variables you can eliminate, the better your guesses should be. This is where colour gamuts, screen calibration, printer profiles and, yes, standard light sources can help.I’ve never actually tried this, but I imagine the monitor display would be disappointing. You’d have reduced the brightness and contrast range, and most people like bright, contrasty screens.I’m also not sure how well this would work when using an online printer rather than your own ink-jet. If they do their own colour profiling, their software might try to compensate for yours. You could certainly ask if their printer will respect your colour management profiles (there are “preserve embedded profiles” settings for RGB and CMYK in Adobe Photoshop), but affordable colour printing is based on a high level of automation.If your monitor produces accurate colour and the printer produces accurate colour, then the results ought to be predictable, even though the images are not identical. This is the device-independent solution that underlies the traditional answer, which is to buy a monitor with an accurate colour profile. The main ones are standard sRGB and Adobe RGB. Of course, for this to work, the whole reproduction chain must follow the same standard.The argument for using Adobe RGB is that it’s wider and includes most of the colours that a CMYK printer can print. That should be better. The argument for using 8-bit sRGB is that practically every device supports it well, and some devices don’t support anything else.If you’re producing images for internet distribution and on-screen viewing, I think you are better off sticking to sRGB. If you’re producing images for some form of printing, there’s an argument for using Adobe RGB, as long as you can be sure it will be printed that way. You’d have to check this with your online printing service. The websites I looked at all requested sRGB.Another advantage of using sRGB is that it sets a lower standard that cheap monitors can meet, though better Adobe RGB scores generally indicate a better quality monitor.It’s well over budget, but you could spend several hours a day looking at it for the next five years, or more. The price difference is only £30 a year.DisplayMate Technologies is an industry leader in the business of evaluating, calibrating and optimising displays, and Raymond Soneira – founder, president and CEO – benchmarks some flagship products for colour accuracy. His tests show that the Apple iPhone X and XS Max, Google’s Pixel 3 XL and Samsung’s Galaxy S9 and Note 9 smartphones “all provide close to textbook perfect calibration accuracy and performance that is visually indistinguishable from perfect”. They’re almost certainly better than any TV or monitor you own.Colour-accurate tablets include the Samsung Galaxy Tab S and the Apple iPad Pro 9.7 (2016). The Microsoft Surface Pro 4 also impressed: it was the best ever tablet display when tested, though since surpassed.Today, the simplest way to check a photo’s colour rendering is to view it on one of DisplayMate’s top-rated smartphones or tablets, preferably on an OLED or AMOLED screen. This is great news if you already own one, but not a cheap option if you don’t.Have you got a question?

It’s the perfect fodder for our tech-craving times ... and also oddly charming“I don’t know if you want me to talk about that picture,” rugby lad Shaquille asks politics student Demi. “You’ve got something in your mouth …” His date looks mortified. And so begins Phone Swap, a new dating show in which two singletons exchange phones with potential partners.Now I know what you’re thinking: if you were going on a programme where someone had to look through your phone, wouldn’t you clean it up a little? Check your camera roll, add some things to make you look like a better person – meditation sounds, language apps? But alas, it really does appear that the show-makers stopped their charges having a quick blitz … or perhaps Demi just forgot to bin her nudes.Because, really, the phones are just another gimmick in what are effectively a set of blind dates. The fact that Shaquille and Maisie get on in the BBC series isn’t because she doesn’t have an album full of other peoples’ nudes, but because of a shared interest in musicals. If anything, trawling through each others’ phones is little more than a drawn-out icebreaker.While these twin shows do seem perfect fodder for our constantly tech-craving times, swapping phones may well prove too repetitive a conceit to underpin a long-standing dating programme. Besides, you get the feeling that participants of such hyper-social shows are probably as motivated by finding fame as they are finding love: Shaquille repeatedly mentions his “secret” interest in performing arts, while Steven Brandon from the US Phone Swap has featured on another, equally self explanatory show named Dating Naked. However, as a short, sharp social media experiment it is charming in its way.

It started off unpleasant, but can end in a dream!”It was unclear whether Trump intended to echo King, who delivered his “I have a dream” speech at the very site of the clash, on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.Trump’s sure intent, however, was to vindicate the racist and mob-like conduct of some students in the affair by pointing out, as Fox News had already done, that early video of the incident did not capture a previous war of insults at the scene between the Covington students and a small group of confrontational African American evangelists called the Black Hebrew Israelites.Opinions erge – along ideological lines, of course – on whether full-length video of the scene casts the students’ conduct in a different light. The video does capture a moment in which a student takes off his shirt and leads his classmates in a chant, which they heartily join, in the style of a football cheer, or a Trump campaign rally.“In this case the facts happened to support the rightwing tribe,” wrote the conservative New York Times columnist David Brooks.On the contrary, wrote Josh Marshall of Talking Points Memo, watching every available video “doesn’t greatly change the substance of what you see on the video, which is a middle aged Native American activistelder beating a ceremonial drum in the face of what appears to be a bemused and cocky teenager while his classmates surrounding them, mostly wearing Maga caps, jeer and taunt the man with chopping motions.”Maga: Make America Great Again. The northern Kentucky county where Covington Catholic is located voted for Trump by a 26-point margin. It is also in the heart of a region on the radar of the Southern Poverty Law Center for its proliferation of hate groups, including white supremacist and radical Christian identity groups.After originally censuring the students and vowing consequences, Covington has in recent days deployed media surrogates to defend itself, to argue that the students were not at fault, and their actions on video had been misunderstood.In a strong indicator of the political undertones of the argument taking shape, the school’s public relations firm is closely tied to Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader from Kentucky, noted the Democratic strategist Adam Parkhomenko.In a national television interview broadcast on Wednesday morning, the student at the center of the spectacle, Nicholas Sandmann, repeated a claim he made Sunday, that he was trying to defuse the situation, wearing a smile of silent prayer, not a condescending smirk, as he stood nose-to-nose with Omaha tribe elder Nathan Phillips.The forensic, and remarkably sharp, debate over what the video exactly shows is another typical feature of the national moment. Trump began his presidency by asking people not to believe photographs showing that his inauguration drew a relatively small crowd. More recently, Trump claimed that he had never said that Mexico would pay for a border wall, despite miles of video evidence to the contrary.The loud disagreement between the political camps over whose side the evidence is on seems unlikely to resolve itself soon. But after a presidential election in which the pernicious influence of imposter social media accounts has been widely documented, the question of exactly who is goading the two sides to battle seems worthy of examination.The original viral Covington video was spread by a Twitter account called @2020fight, a new account with tens of thousands of followers that specialized in incendiary but ideologically inconsistent political content and was attributed to a “teacher” from California, despite using the photograph of a blogger from Brazil.Twitter suspended the account on Tuesday. While there are currently no solid indications of who was behind the account, said Clint Watts, a research fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, the account’s tactics and patterns are reminiscent of the 2016 social media election tampering campaign.“It still shows the power of inauthentic social media manipulation,” said Watts. “It’s iding us. It doesn’t bode well for 2020.”Bernice King, daughter of the civil rights icon, was among the Twitter users to post the viral video.“We are not a post-racial or post-racism nation,” she wrote. “Courageous people, like this Native elder, face overt racism and racist ideologies and systems each and every day. This is ugly, America. Truth, education and corrective action matter.”“America has cowered in the drudgery of racism and bigotry for 400+ years,” she continued.“Colonialism and white supremacy have violently shaped systems, including education, across the globe. What we teach NOW matters. Our children are influenced by the hate OR the love we give. Choices.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/437b3cd8520cd4c8e9be5db4609ce43e27fdb022/0_12_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ef336b3b2937e671a42d66cbeacf8a6","title":"china blocks microsofts bing search engine","story":"Company says service – the only major foreign search engine available inside Great Firewall – is inaccessibleMicrosoft’s Bing search engine has been blocked in China, the company says, making it the latest foreign technology service to be shut down behind the country’s Great Firewall.“We’ve confirmed that Bing is currently inaccessible in China and are engaged to determine next steps,” the company said in a statement. It is the US technology giant’s second setback in China since November 2017 when its Skype internet phone call and messaging service was pulled from Apple and Android app stores. A search performed on Bing’s China website – cn.bing – from within mainland China directs the user to a page that says the server cannot be reached. The Financial Times reported on Wednesday that China Unicom, a major state-owned telecommunication company, had confirmed the government order to block the search engine.  Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), a government watchdog, did not respond to faxed questions about Bing’s blocked website. Bing was the only major foreign search engine accessible from within China’s so-called Great Firewall. Microsoft censored search results on sensitive topics, in accordance with government policy.Microsoft also has a partnership with Chinese data center provider 21Vianet to offer its products Azure and Office 365 to clients in the country. Alphabet’s Google search platform has been blocked in China since 2010. Google CEO, Sundar Pichai, said in December it had “no plans” to relaunch a search engine in China though it is continuing to study the idea amid increased scrutiny of big tech firms. President Xi Jinping has accelerated control of the internet in China since 2016, as the ruling communist party has sought to crack down on dissent in social media. In a statement on Wednesday, CAC said it had deleted more than 7m pieces of online information and 9,382 mobile apps. It also criticised technology company Tencent’s news app for spreading “vulgar information.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e34fae9df1a9644579efe68679c942763748599f/0_317_4830_2898/master/4830.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27979b9670c7f475f4025aa53e5c3869","title":"diplomatic missions tobacco industry ideas thinktank","story":"British high commission in Malaysia and US foreign aid organizations funded the Ideas thinktank as it argued against plain packaging and tobacco taxesThe British high commission in Malaysia gave tens of thousands of pounds to a local thinktank while it argued against tobacco controls already enacted in the UK. At the same time it was funded by the British foreign office, the thinktank received substantial funding from three multinational tobacco companies.The actions of the high commission raise questions about whether diplomats went against guidelines to “limit interactions” with the tobacco industry, following previous criticism of diplomatic support for the tobacco industry abroad. Both British and American diplomatic missions funded the thinktank, the Kuala Lumpur-based Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs (Ideas), while it argued against tobacco taxes and plain packaging. The UK enacted plain packaging in 2014. The news follows a  analysis of free-market thinktanks around the world which have taken position aligned with the tobacco industry. Many thinktanks argued they recognize the risks of smoking, were independent and opposed ineffective regulation, not all tobacco regulation. The analysis revealed at least 106 free-market thinktanks around the world took positions aligned with the tobacco industry in the last decade, accepted donations from the tobacco industry or both. Reporting by the Observer last year has also shown how how the Foreign Office championed British American Tobacco’s interests abroad.A spokesperson for the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) told the : “The British high commission in Malaysia has not and does not co-finance or partner in any way with tobacco companies, or support projects which promote tobacco use.“All FCO-led programmes follow the standards set out by HM Treasury. They receive robust scrutiny to ensure that all spend represents value for money for UK taxpayers and advances the UN’s sustainable development goals and our foreign policy objectives.”Mary Assunta, senior policy adviser at the Southeast Asia Tobacco Control Alliance (Seatca), said: “Ideas jumped into tobacco control only recently and was making policy statements that echoed the tobacco industry’s position.“When a group or a consultant uses certain familiar buzz words and pushes anti-health proposals, look deeper, and you will find the link to the tobacco industry.”In response to questions from the , Ideas said it followed “a strict policy of editorial independence”, and “thus no donations influence our research and analytical outputs”.In 2016, Ideas started commenting on tobacco control in Malaysia. In one example, the group’s then executive director, Wan Saiful Wan Jan, wrote a column in the national newspaper the Star criticizing the Malaysian health department’s push for plain packaging.“I don’t smoke and I get annoyed if people smoke near me,” he wrote. “But notwithstanding my attitude towards smoking, paternalistic government behaviour is more dangerous and must be rejected when we see it.”Plain packaging laws remove advertising from cigarette packs to encourage smokers to quit and deter young people from starting. The laws are part of a broader movement to control tobacco use.\u0026nbspAustralia first enacted plain packaging in 2012\u0026nbspand immediately found itself in the crosshairs of the tobacco industry, which argued plain packaging violated international trade agreements, infringed on commercial speech and is\u0026nbspineffective at reducing smoking. This analysis shows tobacco companies also funded free-market thinktanks, many of which opposed plain packaging.Tobacco taxes increase the price of cigarettes, meant to encourage smokers to quit and make cigarettes unaffordable to young people. Taxes are the most effective, yet least utilized, tobacco control tool. The biggest hurdle to enacting taxes, experts say, is the industry’s well-funded opposition.Cigarette makers argue taxes fuel black market smuggling and counterfeit production. In turn, cigarette companies and their allies say increased taxes cause violence, revenue loss and lead to more harmful cigarettes. Tobacco control experts have found companies exaggerate smuggling evidence, and groups such as the Fraser Institute often echo those concerns.In one study, an International Agency for Research in Cancer expert panel found tax avoidance does not wipe out the public health benefits of increased tobacco taxes. Researchers from the International Union Against Cancer also suggested “tobacco manufacturers are the chief beneficiaries of smuggling.Clean indoor air laws ban smoking inside, because secondhand smoke can cause smoking-related illnesses. Tobacco companies oppose these laws on the grounds they negatively impact businesses, infringe on inidual rights and are based on junk science. Although bars, restaurants and workplaces ban smoking indoors in the US and Europe, many developing countries have not.  found several thinktanks used these arguments to oppose clean indoor air laws in places such as Ghana and Hong Kong.\u0026nbspIn June 2016, Seatca warned the British high commission in Malaysia that Ideas was “mouthing the same arguments used by the tobacco industry in the UK”. Nevertheless, the high commission increased funding in 2017. The British government’s contribution grew from £46,552 ($60,299) in 2016 to £72,820 ($94,324) in 2017. That nearly made the British high commission the group’s largest funder, second only to the philanthropic arm of the Malaysian transportation conglomerate Sime Darby.At the same time, Ideas received donations from Philip Morris Singapore, Philip Morris Malaysia and Japan Tobacco International. Between 2016 and 2017, the three tobacco companies donated £42,411. British American Tobacco also said it “supports” Ideas.The British high commission provided funding to Ideas just a few years after British diplomats were criticized for aiding BAT in Pakistan and Panama, according to the Financial Times.As a result, rules established in 2013 forbade diplomats from lobbying “against any local administration’s policies that are aimed at improving public health, or engage with foreign governments on behalf of the tobacco industry”.The new rules stated diplomats “should limit interactions with the tobacco industry, including any person or organization that is likely to be working to further the interests of the tobacco industry”.Ideas received donations from the US National Endowment for Democracy (Ned) and the International Republican Institute (IRI), both groups which receive most of their funding from the American government.Ned, which gave Ideas $80,000, said it was “unaware of the funding from tobacco groups” or Ideas’s “comments on tobacco related policy in local Malaysian media”. Ned no longer funds Ideas. Ned said it provided funding to a number of other free-market focused thinktanks as recently as this year. At least four opposed plain packaging of cigarettes, including the Policy Research Institute of Market Economy in Pakistan, the Samriddhi Foundation of Nepal, the Libertarian Club Libek in Serbia and the Free Market Foundation of South Africa. Ned and IRI said its donations were not related to tobacco policy.In the US, foreign donations to American thinktanks have come under scrutiny as a form of potential lobbying.While Ideas disclosed its donors, many free-market thinktanks do not, including some which received funding from western diplomats. For example, the influential Ghanaian thinktank Imani Centre for Policy and Education argued so vociferously against tobacco control that the nation’s health department quoted local activists as saying Imani was an organization which “fronts for the tobacco industry” in an official report to the WHO. Imani told the  the last tobacco industry donation it received was roughly four years ago.In one 2012 editorial, Imani’s leader argued the link between lung cancer and smoking has “yet to be empirically established”. Imani told the  it no longer denies smoking causes lung cancer. Nevertheless, the Danish embassy made Imani a key partner in an effort to modernize the Ghana Revenue Authority, providing it with more than £656,000 ($849,716).The authority of thinktanks, Barrington said, “lies in, ‘You can believe me, because I have independent research here.’ If that is compromised, people stop listening to you. You might as well go straight to the tobacco company.”In large part, tobacco companies told the  they supported like-minded organizations, like many other businesses.A spokesperson for Philip Morris International said: “We have worked, and will continue to work, with carefully selected organizations around the world who share our desire to promote policies that produce meaningful public health improvements. It is absolutely ridiculous to imply that supporting an organization would result in a group taking action they otherwise would fundamentally oppose.”Sam Cleverly, group head of corporate affairs at BAT, said: “Like many other companies, we support like-minded organizations on issues that are important to our business and our consumers.“We believe publicly elected officials should be allowed to hear all sides of any debate when formulating policy and should be trusted to make informed decisions once they have heard and considered all the arguments.”Jonathan Duce, head of external affairs for Japan Tobacco, said: “It is clear to everyone that there are health risks associated with smoking – we are fully transparent about this.” He continued: “We are not alone in our thinking and various groups across the world share our view that any regulation, tobacco-related or not, if untested and unproven, could have seriously negative knock-on effects.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/372945a89074db936141667904a522cc51394ac9/0_135_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2bf9ec9ef0bd9d5110f94b955891358b","title":"we want an end to tyranny venezuelan diaspora call for maduro to go","story":"From Mexico City to Hong Kong, exiles take to the streets in support of regime change One year ago Albert Molina and his family joined the historic exodus from Venezuela, fleeing to Mexico after his ailing father fell victim to the collapse of its health service.On Wednesday night – after a day of intense political drama in his crumbling homeland – he stood outside the Venezuelan embassy in Mexico City with a placard reading “No more dictatorship” and suddenly rekindled dreams of a homecoming.“The thing Venezuelans most want is to go back to our homeland,” said Molina, a 33-year-old business administrator from Anzoátegui state.Molina was one of thousands of newly energised exiles who turned out to protest outside their embassies on Wednesday, from Mexico City to Hong Kong, each hoping their country stood on the cusp of a new era.“We want the dictatorship out out and an end to tyranny – it is more than possible,” said Jhonny Garcia, a 32-year-old accountant from Caracas, who said he had fled to Mexico City two years ago as Venezuela’s economic collapse accelerated.Jessica Solano, who abandoned her home in the city of Los Teques five years ago, carried a poster that read: “Maduro. Murderer. Usurper. Free Venezuela!”“He’s illegitimate. He’s an impostor,” the 28-year-old civil engineer of Maduro, who has accused the “gringo empire” of conspiring to overthrow him in order to steal Venezuelan oil.Solano called the decision of countries including the United States, Brazil and Colombia to recognise opposition leader Juan Guaidó as Venezuela’s interim president “a step towards the hope that the government will change … and we can be with our families again”.“We have been away for so long. All we want is the hope of a change … If Venezuela truly changes and the economy improves I think the best thing will be to go back,” she said.Molina, who was at the demonstration with his mother, son and heavily pregnant wife, said it was time for the curtains to come down on Maduro’s regime. Chavistas were stashing millions of dollars overseas, he claimed: “And Venezuela broken, with no medicine, no food, as if it were a country at war, or perhaps even worse.”Behind him dissenters had plastered the entrance to their embassy with posters that said: “Out Maduro! Down with the Dictatorship!”One couple held a banner that read: “Operation freedom”.Felix Maradiaga, an exiled Nicaraguan activist who was also among the crowds, said he was also rooting for change: “Maduro is not only a problem for Venezuela. He’s a problem for the world.”“The Maduro dictatorship has been a disruptive force for many other countries,” Maradiaga added, pointing to its role in supporting Nicaragua’s embattled president Daniel Ortega, one of its few remaining regional allies.In Colombia’s capital, Bogotá, there were protests too as thousands gathered outside Venezuela’s embassy to celebrate the day’s developments by waving flags and beating drums.“The clamor of the people is felt in every corner of Venezuela and the world: End the usurpation and free elections!” tweeted the exiled opposition leader Julio Borges, who attended the march.As the crowd outside the Mexico City embassy swelled, protesters unfurled a giant Venezuelan flag and began to chant the national anthem of their decaying nation.“Glory to the brave people, who shook off the yoke,” they sang. “Let’s cry out aloud: ‘Down with oppression!’”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3768406.1548276583!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"revenue braces for brexit deluge of paperwork","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the European Research Group (ERG),  speaks above a photograph of former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, during a meeting of pro-Brexit think tank the Bruges Group in London on Wednesday. Photograph: Facundo ArrizabalagaEPAThe Revenue Commissioners is anticipating a deluge of customs paperwork from traders after Brexit as it accelerates the hiring of staff to prepare for the possibility of the UK leaving the EU without a deal. In testimony before an Oireachtas committee on Thursday, Revenue chairman Niall Cody will estimate that the number of import and export declaration forms that traders will have to file because of the UK leaving the EU could surge from almost 1.7 million last year to as much as 20 million, a 12-fold increase. In his opening statement to the committee, the country’s most senior tax official says the number of companies that will have to deal with customs after Brexit could surge from 17,000 to as much as 100,000 because they are dealing with the UK as a non-EU country, outside the customs union.Some 84,000 businesses traded with the UK in 2017, including about 45,000 on a regular basis, which currently do not have to engage with customs, he says. Some 70,000 were small and mid-sized companies.Mr Cody will rule out setting up Border posts for customs checks on goods crossing into the State after the UK’s departure from the EU on March 29th, in line with the Government’s plan to avoid a hard border.“Revenue is not planning for customs posts,” Mr Cody says in his opening statement, seen by The .His appearance comes two days after European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said that it was “pretty obvious” that no deal would lead to a hard border.Downing Street said UK government officials “stand ready” to start direct talks with Dublin as the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier conceded there would be checks on goods coming into the State under no deal. The EU will “do everything possible to enforce them unobtrusively”, Mr Barnier told a Luxembourg newspaper, but added that it would “not be possible with everything”.Britain’s prime minister Theresa May’s official spokesman said the UK government “will do everything we can” to prevent a hard border and “would look to have discussions with the Irish Government about steps that we could take”.The Government, however, again ruled out the possibility of direct talks with London before or after a no-deal exit.It said the best way to avoid a hard border is through the Withdrawal Agreement, the result of two years of detailed negotiations. In the event of a no deal scenario further detailed discussions may be required, but that would take place through the medium of the European Union and the Task Force, it said.Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said Ireland’s anxiety about what a no-deal Brexit would mean for the Border showed a greater willingness to compromise and to reopen the orce deal rejected by Westminster.Mr Cody will tell the Oireachtas finance committee on Thursday that in the event of a no deal, the Revenue would help the Government with “whatever technical expertise and assistance may be required” in “intensive” discussions it was planning with the Commission and other member states to avoid a hard border.The Revenue’s overarching approach to achieve this would be to conduct customs checks “to the greatest extent possible” away from the “point of importation” at the State’s frontiers with the UK. At just 64 days until Brexit, Revenue is now planning to have more than 400 additional staff in place by the end of March, almost 50 per cent more than it had planned by that date in November. Mr Cody says the Revenue will have its full 600-strong complement of additional staff to be hired to deal with Brexit in place by the end of this year, 12 months earlier than planned.In addition, it is reassigning existing staff and preparing for “any necessary further redeployments on a temporary basis”, Mr Cody states. The Revenue intends to be “strongly focused” on the efficient and timely movement of goods while complying with customs controls after Brexit, Mr Cody says in his opening statement.“Revenue will be as ready as we can possibly be, to deal with the outcome of unfolding political and policy developments,” he states.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Meath. Video: BirdWatch IrelandClare Tuffy\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMurmuration: starlings at dusk.  Photograph: Cyril Byrne The light at this time of year has a particular ethereal quality. Dim and hazy, struggling to reach us, it sometimes seems to illuminate only shadows. While beautiful in its own bleak way, it – combined with the post-Christmas slump and the long slog until payday – can play havoc with our minds, making the end of January feel like the darkest time of the year.It’s not, of course (we’re on the right side of the winter solstice now), but despite the crocus bulbs sprouting up defiantly in the pots outside my front door, spring still feels a lifetime away and the energy required to get outdoors into the fresh air is difficult to summon.But according to the science, it’d be worth it: spending time in green spaces can lift our mood and reduce stress, among other psychological and emotional health benefits. Studies have measured cortisol in people who walk through parks versus those who don’t, and others have measured the physical and mental wellbeing of hospital patients with a window looking out on to a green area.A whole industry has sprung up around the findings of observations like these: fields of inquiry with names like ecopsychology, diagnostic terms like nature-deficit disorder, remedies like ecotherapy. The scientific evidence is on their side.For nature lovers, though, it can be more of a challenge. There are no studies that show a correlation between wilder, more natural, bioerse green spaces and higher mental health benefits, though some of us might argue – unscientifically, on the basis of personal experience – that there should be. Can you compare the constricted, manicured rows of geraniums and neatly trimmed lawns in an urban park to the unbounded joy of a hay meadow bursting with flowers, grasses and insect life? Can you heck.Nor are there studies that I’m aware of that show the negative impact of degraded habitats on mental health. I’ve ruined many walks in the Wicklow Mountains by informing friends of the ill health of the blanket bog they were admiring, or causing them to notice the almost total lack of birdsong in a conifer forest, or pointing out a freshly scrubbed-out hedgerow that they may not otherwise have seen. Those of us who notice nature notice the lack of it everywhere we go.This has implications for people working in the field: ecologists, conservationists, wildlife rangers, people who entered this line of work to look after something that is being continually lost and eroded. “Eco burnout” is a thing. Like doctors and nurses struggling to do their jobs in an underfunded hospital, or Gaeilgeoirí watching their treasured language fade from daily use, we get weary. Solace can be hard to find. Optimism can feel naive.If it feels this way for us now, imagine what the nature lovers of the generations past might feel. The “normal” that we grew up with would be devastation to them: my father remembered the River Nore of his childhood teeming with freshwater pearl mussels, and days spent hunting in pristine waters for the pearls. When I was small, he’d pick shells out of the bed of the river – that was all there was to show me.Today, I can’t even find shells, let alone eels, or pike, or the salmon that we used to watch leaping in the rapids.It can be hard to focus on the bits of nature that make our hearts sing – it can be hard to even find them – but some are still out there: earlier this month, hundreds of people gathered at spots all over the country to witness one of the greatest natural spectacles this island has to offer. Enormous flocks of starlings wheeled and swelled in the skies, exploding like black fireworks, gliding like smoke. Murmurations are equal-opportunities captivators: you need no special knowledge or equipment, just a willingness to stand on a cold January evening, look up and be beguiled. Plenty did: young and old, urban and rural, all across the midlands.It was a life affirming experience, and one I didn’t regret driving a 150km round trip to witness. Maybe it was this kind of nourishment on a bleak day that inspired the great poet Emily Dickinson to write: “ ‘Hope’ is the thing with feathers.”Hannah Hamilton is a sustainability consultant specialising in bioersity, conservation and environmental communications @theriverfield"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3768292.1548268718!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"polish minister makes waves as coveney clings to backstop lifeline","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPolish foreign minister Jacek Czaputowicz:  had suggested   a five-year time limit on the backstop  as a compromise. Photograph: Olivier HosletEPASimon Coveney was very polite about his counterpart’s intervention in the Brexit debate. And then dismissed it, confident it wasn’t going to run.Polish foreign minister Jacek Czaputowicz had suggested that perhaps a five-year time limit on the backstop would be a compromise that could bring together the Irish and a House of Commons majority.Coveney said he appreciated that the intervention was meant as helpful, whether it was seen as such or not.“I can understand the Polish minister,” he said. The Poles have the largest foreign population in the UK. “More than even the Irish,” Coveney said, but he had “made very clear that a time limit on an insurance mechanism – which is what the backstop is – means that it is not a backstop at all”.In this regard the EU27 are completely united, he insisted. And that will probably be that.But Polish diplomacy has been making other waves that have been disconcerting fellow EU member states.An invitation went out from Warsaw recently for a surprise “Ministerial to Promote a Future of Peace and Security in the Middle East” to be co-hosted by Poland and the US on February 13th and 14th.All welcome. Well, not quite all.Iran was not on the invitation list and Czaputowicz and US secretary of state Mike Pompeo had let it be known that the meeting, despite its anodyne title, was about building support for an anti-Iran alliance. Quickly denied with a flurry of reassurances to Tehran.In the UN on Monday the US representative said the conference was really a “global brainstorming session” with an agenda that includes cyber security, humanitarian aid to Syria and Yemen, and extremism.But the Poles’ European allies have not warmed to the idea of the conference. And although most will send a representative – “after all, who wants to be seen as dissing the idea of peace in the Middle East?” was how one diplomat put it – but “ministerial”, not likely.The EU’s high representative for foreign policy, Federica Mogherini, has said she has a calendar clash. And officials expect that Coveney will also find that he is unavailable, like most EU foreign ministers. The Russians have said that they will not attend .The Polish-US initiative is a strange one. The EU, like most of the world community, is in serious dispute with the US over its unilateral repudiation of the Iran nuclear deal, the JCPOA, with Washington threatening sanctions against countries that continue to trade with Tehran.We can expect shortly the announcement of the establishment of a “special purpose vehicle”, probably based in France, to assist in routing international payments from Iran away from the US-controlled dollar system.Establishing the SPV has been difficult, as most member states who might be sympathetic fear US secondary sanctions.The EU may have serious issues with Iran, not least on its ballistic missile programme and role regionally “promoting terrorism”, but regards it as an essential partner in the search for peace in the region.It also has considerable difficulties with the US over its approach to the IsraelPalestinian problem. Washington’s recognition of Jerusalem as capital of Israel, and its cuts to Palestinian humanitarian funding, are seen as deeply out of step with the international consensus on the way forward.Suspicions of the Polish conference were inevitable given that Washington seems to have initiated the idea, which Poland is said to have taken up to curry favour with the US administration.Warsaw, preoccupied by the Russian military threat, is not unsympathetic to the US repudiation of the JCPOA and appears to see the initiative as an opportunity to press its Nato ally to establish a military base in Poland – named, it has been suggested , “Camp Trump ”.The US president is said to be considering the offer.The US administration will not be unhappy to see cracks emerge in EU solidarity over Iran, but there have been suggestions that Pompeo may well cancel the conference at the last minute if the attendance looks unlikely to meet its ambitions. Polish diplomacy would not look impressive.Meanwhile, the release of Trump’s much-awaited Middle East peace plan has been further delayed, according to press reports.Trump set a four-month deadline in September for his long-awaited plan to be made public, but his timeframe has now shifted as Israel heads to early elections in April.Certainly no prospect it will be unveiled in Warsaw.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Theresa May’s official spokesman said Britain would do everything in its power to avoid a hard Border but that Dublin and Brussels had both spoken about the issue of enforcing the EU’s single market rules.“That’s obviously a matter for the EU’s institutions and I think the Irish government have spoken about the two working together in relation to that. In terms of what we can do, the prime minister has obviously said that we don’t want a hard Border, we will do everything we can to prevent that and we would look to have discussions with the Irish government about steps that we could take,” he said.“We recognise that we’d need to take forward discussions with the Irish government in the event of no deal. As to when that happens, I have no time frame for you but we stand ready to have discussions.”Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told the Dáil on Tuesday that if there was a no-deal outcome, the British and Irish governments and the EU “would have to negotiate an agreement on customs and regulations that would mean full alignment so there would be no hard border”.Mr Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, said on Wednesday there would have to be checks at the Border in the event of a no-deal Brexit, a day after the European Commission’s chief spokesman said so. The commission spokesman on Wednesday sought to row back on his comments but in an interview with the Luxemburger Wort, Mr Barnier said checks could not be avoided.“There will be checks in case of a no-deal-Brexit. We will do everything possible to enforce them unobtrusively. However, that will not be possible with everything. How should we control animals crossing the border? There will have to be checks. Again, the problem arose from Brexit and we expect the UK to take responsibility,” he said.The EU regards the island of Ireland as a single unit for animal health but in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the United Kingdom would become a “third country” that could follow different health standards. Mrs May’s official spokesman suggested, however, that the Belfast Agreement obliged Dublin and London to facilitate North-South cooperation over agriculture.“The Good FridayBelfast Agreement does spell out certain sets of requirements. You can look at those. We are fully committed to our obligations under that agreement,” he said.Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said on Wednesday that Ireland’s anxiety about what a no-deal Brexit would mean for the Border pointed to a greater willingness to compromise. He said Mrs May could win parliamentary approval for a deal if her withdrawal agreement with the EU was rewritten and the backstop removed from it.“I think the truth is that everybody wants a deal the prime minister wants a deal, the EU wants a deal, the Irish want a deal. And if the only way to get it is by re-opening the text, that is what they will have to do. This is realpolitik,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

He has just started school in rural Oxfordshire and is eagerly learning to read. “He’s taken to school like a duck to water. He loves it. He’s very sociable and good at making friends,” says his mother, Lydia. In other words, he is a very normal, happy little boy.Yet there is something remarkable about Isaac. His early progress through life has helped to set the standard for other children across the world. Isaac is one of more than 1,300 children in five countries – Brazil, India, Italy, Kenya and the UK – whose growth and neurodevelopment has been tracked and compared from the earliest days in the womb until the age of two.Led by a team at the University of Oxford, the INTERGROWTH-21st Project is set to have a profound impact on the way we view, feed and educate our children. It has shown for the first time that children are born physically and intellectually equal, regardless of their race or ethnicity. Given good living conditions, good food and education, babies thrive, wherever they live and whatever the colour of their skin.Such is the power of the data gathered, the researchers hope it will be used alongside the World Health Organisation’s growth charts worldwide, including its Red Book in the UK. It should finally put to bed outdated notions of racial or class-based superiority.The research tracks both physical and intellectual development to age two. A child’s first 1,000 days of life (from conception to 24 months) is the most crucial because that is when the brain grows fastest, accounting for roughly two-thirds of its adult weight.Isaac\u0026#39s mother, Lydia, says her son took to school like a duck to water. To her left is her 7-year-old son, Ethan.“At every single stage we’ve shown that healthy mothers have healthy babies, and that healthy babies all grow at exactly the same rate,” says Prof Stephen Kennedy, the co-director of the Oxford Maternal and Perinatal Health Institute and co-leader of the INTERGROWTH-21st Project (with José Villar, a professor of perinatal medicine). “It doesn’t matter where you are living, it doesn’t matter what the colour of your skin is, it doesn’t matter what your race and ethnicity is, receiving decent medical care and nutrition is the key.”The assertion that healthy mothers have healthy babies – regardless of where they come from – sounds obvious but demonstrating it in terms of growth and developmental milestones is a first.Until now, it was a commonly held view that some babies were naturally smaller than others due to genetic predisposition: a healthy baby born to a Kenyan mother, say, would be smaller than a counterpart born to a British mother. America’s National Institutes for Health even produced differing foetal growth charts for babies of white, black, and Asian origin.Assumptions have also – though more controversially – been made about the intellectual ability of different races. Only last week the Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory in the US cut its ties with James Watson, the Nobel Prize-winning geneticist who, with Maurice Wilkins and Francis Crick, first proposed the double helix structure of DNA, citing his “unsubstantiated and reckless” remarks about race and intelligence. Watson, the laboratory’s former chancellor, has repeatedly suggested that genes cause a disparity in average scores in IQ tests between blacks and whites.Geneticist James Watson in 1962, accepting the Nobel prize he would later be stripped of.“There’s still a substantial body of opinion out there in both the scientific and lay communities who genuinely believe that intelligence is predominantly determined by genes and the environment that you’re living in and that your parents and grandparents were living in and their nutritional and health status are not relevant,” says Prof Kennedy. “Well, that’s clearly not the case.”The Oxford study took seven years to complete and involved nearly 60,000 mothers and babies in two stages of research, first tracking growth in the womb, before following more than 1,300 of those babies to age two. Its results show that not only physical growth but behaviour and neurodevelopmental milestones occur at the same rate among babies of differing ethnic origin. The findings echo the assertion by Craig Venter, the scientist who led the first draft of the sequencing of the human genome, that “there is no basis in scientific fact or in the human genetic code or the notion that skin colour will be a predictive of intelligence”.Previous research into gestational growth has taken ethnic origin but not living conditions into account. Where mothers of a similar social, economic and health status are compared, the Oxford team has shown, healthy West Indian babies will grow at the same rate as healthy, well-nourished Britons. The women enrolled into the second part of the INTERGROWTH-21st Project – whether in Pelotas, Brazil, or Naigpur, India – were carefully selected to achieve a like-for-like comparison: urban women of similar age with a healthy BMI who were non-smokers and living in a clean environment. “It is important to say these were not superwomen, they were simply well-educated and well-nourished,” says Kennedy. “In the centres we selected, one-third of the women met our criteria for being healthy. So this wasn’t a tiny slice of the population.”Babies were weighed and measured (including head circumference) at birth, then at one and two years of age. The team tracked fundamental motor milestones according to WHO norms, such as the age at which the child first stood or walked alone, but also developed its own, culturally neutral set of tests for visual acuity, attention  and language development.At the age of two, the children were given a series of play-related tasks. “You might build a tower using five blocks, then knock it down,” says Michelle Fernandes, the Oxford researcher who devised the tests. “Will the child respond by building another tower, completely or partially, or make no effort to do so? If you place a number of objects in front of the child – a cup, spoon, sock, shoe and cube – and ask them to put the spoon in the cup, without giving them a visual cue, are they able to do so?”Michelle Fernandes, an Oxford researcher who developed tests to measure a baby\u0026#39s visual acuity, attention  and language development.Attention  was assessed by placing a glittery string of beads under one cloth, then another, then asking the child to find it. If the child immediately lifted the second cloth, it showed they had been able to follow the sequence of moves. “There are no zero scores,” says Ms Fernandes, “because the child is always able to do something, whether it is building a tower, but with only three blocks, or searching for the beads under the first cloth.”Additional information on the children’s behavioural progress, including lavatory training, was obtained by questioning the mothers.In 1995, the WHO decided that human growth and development should be assessed and monitored using international standards. The resulting standards, published in 2006, form the basis of the Red Book familiar to families in Britain whose babies’ growth is assessed in centiles in relation to the graph.The WHO standard applied to children aged 0-5 (born at full-term) but did not study the foetus. The Oxford study fills in the gap, charting children’s progress from the earliest weeks of life. “By assessing not only growth but neurodevelopment at two years of age we have done something the WHO didn’t,” says Prof Kennedy.“Our standards for establishing gestational age, monitoring the growth of the foetus, assessing the newborn size and post-natal growth on preterm babies... all of those overlap and complement the WHO standards. Taken together, they provide a gold standard which should be used by every country in the world.”The INTERGROWTH-21st standards are likely to focus doctors’ – and hopefully parents’ – attention on the quality of food pregnant women and young infants consume. While the study shows all children should grow up equally able, it is a lack of good nutrition in the first thousand days that is likely to make the biggest difference to a child’s future.Across the world, there are estimated to be more than 150 million children (22 per cent) who have become physically and mentally “stunted” because of poor nutrition in their early years. Although largely an overseas problem, recent international data showed that 10 per cent of UK children live in conditions of “severe food insecurity”.Just as problematic, worrying numbers of babies are born overweight, putting them at risk of health problems including diabetes later in life. A report from the Royal College of Paediatricians and Child Health this week flags up concern over child poverty in the UK – a contributory factor in childhood obesity and poor mental health – and the UK’s poor rate of breastfeeding, believed to be among the lowest in the world. The UK infant feeding survey, usually carried out every five years, was cancelled in 2015.The Oxford team is now launching a new study, INTERPRACTICE-21st, to examine the growth and development of preterm babies. It has been normal practice to monitor those babies born below 32 weeks of gestation, but it is assumed those born between 33 and 37 weeks, though early, will “catch up”. It may be that any baby born early is at risk of developmental delay.The INTERGROWTH-21st Project has come to an end but its findings convey a powerful message about what can be achieved worldwide if mothers and babies have access to good food, education and a decent environment. In such circumstances, the attainment of neurodevelopmental milestones and associated behaviours “are likely innate and universal” the researchers say: and that commonality must be good news for us all.University of OxfordTheresa May\u0026#39s draft Brexit withdrawal agreement - read in fullBrexit explained: All your questions answered about the UK leaving the EU  Brexit and the Irish border explained: why the headache is not going away any time soonWhat is Article 50?

French authorities have also employed a Dassault Falcon 50 jet to search the potential crash site. Coastal areas around Alderney and off-lying rocks and islands were also examined, and yesterday, 280 sq miles of a target area after reviewing tidal and weather information. But there has still not been any debris discovered which can be linked to the plane. Guernsey harbourmaster David Barker said on Wednesday night: It has been a long day and covered another enormous area of sea.We concentrated the search for a life raft and two occupants but haven\u0027t found them.It\u0027s frustrating and we haven\u0027t given up hope. A lot of people have been working very hard in the air, on the sea and on the ground and done all they can.”Neil Warnock and his Cardiff City players were described as feeling “absolutely terrible” last night as English Channel rescue teams ­admitted there was now no chance of finding Emiliano Sala alive.The shell-shocked squad returned to training in sombre mood after it emerged how their star signing, 28, had expressed fears for his life in messages sent to close friends about the single-engined plane. In a WhatsApp voice note, he said: I\u0027m on a plane that looks like it\u0027s going to fall apart.Sources at Cardiff last night confirmed Sala had made the flight arrangements with the help of Mark McKay, an intermediary in the deal, because the club had only been able to secure him a route back to Cardiff via Paris and Heathrow.It was also claimed on Wednesday that the pilot, and father-of-three aborted three attempted take-offs and had joked with friends that he was a “bit rusty” in the days before. Aviation experts suggested the privately chartered single-engine aircraft should not have been risking the flight in the icy conditions.Alastair Rosenschein, a former pilot, said: It\u0027s already a fairly risky crossing to do in a single engine aircraft, especially in winter and definitely at night. There are icing problems too.

The move set up a high-stakes standoff with President Nicolas Maduro, who is increasingly seen as a dictator both at home and abroad.Instead of backing down, Guaido stunned Venezuelans on Wednesday by declaring himself interim president before cheering supporters in Venezuela\u0027s capital, buoyed by massive anti-government...Register for free to read this article, or log in to your  accountPlease review our commenting policySearch for Premier League striker\u0026#39s plane continues into fourth day as rescuers refuse to \u0026#39give up hope\u0026#39Speedboat killer Jack Shepherd \u0026#39may contest extradition\u0026#39 to Britain, his lawyer saysBBC\u0026#39s George Alagiah returns to the News at Six for first time after year off air for cancer treatmentUS refuses to pull out of Venezuela after Maduro dismisses diplomats amid deadly protestsComment: With courage and leadership, we can bring Brexit homeSeoul resists Trump’s demands for $1.2 billion a year to keep US troops on the peninsulaComment: What do your hair colour and your bookshelf say about your politics?

But repeated rumours have suggested that Apple was in fact working to get AirPower out much earlier, but that technical issues had got in the way of making it available to the public.Those reports chime with similar claims earlier this month that AirPower was on its way and was making its way through Apple\u0027s supply chain. The beginning of production comes after Apple solved the technical issues – thought to be problems with overheating and other challenges – according to numerous reports.When Apple revealed AirPower in September 2017, promising it would be available soon, it showed a rounded charging mat that would allow people to charge phones and Apple Watches alongside AirPods in a special new case. But there has been no sign of the new product – with major events like the release of the iPhone XS and XR passing without a mention.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And as evidenced by their dominance of the market these contracts clearly represent a convenient method of paying for a car, even for households who are otherwise adding to savings. Their growth is not evidence that people are outspending their income in aggregate.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Student debt: are you on top of what you owe?

Further, he noted that interest rates were not expected to rise sharply to pre-crisis levels.“This makes it slightly puzzling to read (as one often does) that household debt is ‘unsustainably’ high. This view is ubiquitous. My suspicion is that, at least in some cases, people come to it because they have in the back of their minds an alternative and rather attractive world in which we all have fewer debts but the same assets,” he said.Mr Broadbent also pointed to analysis suggesting that historically the growth of household debt is more important than the level when it comes to creating the conditions for a crisis.“That doesn’t mean the level of debt doesn’t matter. But it may matter only relative to some sustainable threshold, one that’s not directly observable and that can vary,” he said.“The precise terms, and therefore the riskiness of a given quantity of debt, are not exactly the same in every country.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The company reported like-for-like sales growth of 7.2 per cent for the first 12 weeks of the second quarter, while like-for-like sales in the year to date have risen 6.3 per cent. However, costs in the first half have been “considerably higher” than the previous year, particularly for labour, which is up by around £30m.

The group has opened two pubs and sold six since the beginning of the financial year, with plans to open between five and 10 this year. Wetherspoons warns of price rises as boss repeats call for hard BrexitWetherspoons bans dogs from all their UK pubs as of todayWill Wetherspoons really only sell British booze post-Brexit?Wetherspoon to replace champagne with British sparkling winesEd Monk, associate director at Fidelity Personal Investing, said: “There was more Brexit bluster from J D Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin in the company’s trading update today, but investors will be more focused on the warning that pre-tax profit will be lower in the first half of the trading year. “The margins at ’Spoons are tight so the challenge has been to grow overall sales in order to keep growing profits. Any hint of higher costs, including staff wages, is bad news so the news of another £30m in labour costs since November will hurt. With unemployment low, thanks in part to lower flows of workers from the EU, labour costs will continue to be a focus at Wetherspoon.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Boring Company has developed technologies to recycle the earth into useful bricks to be used to build structures.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Asparagine, a molecule named after asparagus where it was first identified in high quantities, has now been shown to be an essential ingredient for tumour cells to gain these migratory properties.2143 NHS nursing vacancies at record high with more than 34,000 roles advertisedA record number of nursing and midwifery positions are currently being advertised by the NHS, with more than 34,000 positions currently vacant, according to the latest data. Demand for nurses was 19 per cent higher between July and September 2017 than the same period two years ago.2243 Cannabis extract could provide ‘new class of treatment’ for psychosisCBD has a broadly opposite effect to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active component  in cannabis and the substance that causes paranoia and anxiety.2343 Over 75,000 sign petition calling for Richard Branson\u0027s Virgin Care to hand settlement money back to NHSMr Branson’s company sued the NHS last year after it lost out on an £82m contract to provide children’s health services across Surrey, citing concerns over “serious flaws” in the way the contract was awarded2443 More than 700 fewer nurses training in England in first year after NHS bursary scrappedThe numbers of people accepted to study nursing in England fell 3 per cent in 2017, while the numbers accepted in Wales and Scotland, where the bursaries were kept, increased 8.4 per cent and 8 per cent respectively2543 Landmark study links Tory austerity to 120,000 deathsThe paper found that there were 45,000 more deaths in the first four years of Tory-led efficiencies than would have been expected if funding had stayed at pre-election levels.Hours of commuting may be mind-numbingly dull, but new research shows that it might also be having an adverse effect on both your health and performance at work.  Longer commutes also appear to have a significant impact on mental wellbeing, with those commuting longer 33 per cent more likely to suffer from depression2743 You cannot be fit and fatIt is not possible to be overweight and healthy, a major new study has concluded. The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part3043 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.3143 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves3243 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.3343 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.3443 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed3543 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.3643 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.3743 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.3843 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.3943 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.4043 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4143 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4243 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4343 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 143 Cancer breath test to be trialled in BritainThe breath biopsy device is designed to detect cancer hallmarks in molecules exhaled by patients243 Average 10 year old has consumed the recommended amount of sugar for an adult By their 10th birthdy, children have on average already eaten more sugar than the recommended amount for an 18 year old. The average 10 year old consumes the equivalent to 13 sugar cubes a day, 8 more than is recommendedWhile there is not enough evidence of harm to recommend UK-wide limits on screen use, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health have advised that children should avoid screens for an hour before bed time to avoid disrupting their sleep443 Breeding with neanderthals helped humans fight diseasesOn migrating from Africa around 70,000 years ago, humans bumped into the neanderthals of Eurasia.

Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. We have found that the impact of social media is likely to be negative, it is a breeding ground for misleading information and negative messaging around vaccination.The RSPH said tech giants like Facebook and Twitter should look at partnerships to signpost reliable health sources, and work to prioritise those in newsfeeds.Anti-vaccine movement \u0027a top threat to global health in 2019\u0027 says WHOMeasles cases rise around the world \u0027because parents shun vaccines\u0027Currently, on Facebook for example, suggested groups or pages are ordered by popularity rather than credibility of the information, the report said.\u0026nbspGoogle already prioritises organisations such as the NHS or the British Medical Association, and this should be enforced across social media platforms.Headlines in traditional media which inflate rare cases of vaccines harms were also noted as a factor. The MMR scandal at the turn of the 21st century was stoked by media reporting since-discredited claims the jab could cause autism, and shows\u0026nbspthe substantial damage fear can cause.Vaccines do not just protect against diseases. They do much moreWhile vaccination rates have recovered, uptake of the first dose of the vaccine in England fell for the fourth year in a row in\u0026nbsp201718 - back to levels last seen in 2012. There was also a drop in the cervical cancer-preventing HPV jab among year nine girls.In 201718, coverage for the first dose of the vaccine was 91.2 per cent\u0026nbspin England - a small drop from the previous year (91.6 per cent) and at a similar level to 20111230.Preventing fake news about vaccination was backed by\u0026nbsp82 per cent of 2,000 people surveyed for the report, with one in four saying they had come across it on social media.The report found that among all age groups, a fear of side-effects was the number one reason why people failed to vaccinate themselves or their children.But among all parents, 91 per cent\u0026nbspagreed that vaccines were important for their children\u0027s health.The report also said that vaccinations should be offered in a more erse range of locations, including at high street pop-ups, gyms and workplaces.Despite a world leading vaccination programme in the UK, Shirley Cramer, chief executive of the RSPH, said: We should never be complacent.We have found worrying levels of exposure to negative messages about vaccinations on social media, and the spread of misinformation - if it impacts uptake of vaccines - could severely damage the public\u0027s health, she added.Helen Donovan, professional lead for public health at the Royal College of Nursing, said: Challenging misinformation is vital to reverse the decline in vaccination uptake and ensure people recognise the protection it offers.In 2017 Britain was declared free of endemic measles, with just 259 lab confirmed cases.But last year saw 913 confirmed cases of this potentially fatal yet entirely preventable disease, a three-fold increase. This has been exacerbated by myths propagated largely online.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And as evidenced by their dominance of the market these contracts clearly represent a convenient method of paying for a car, even for households who are otherwise adding to savings. Their growth is not evidence that people are outspending their income in aggregate.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Student debt: are you on top of what you owe?

Further, he noted that interest rates were not expected to rise sharply to pre-crisis levels.“This makes it slightly puzzling to read (as one often does) that household debt is ‘unsustainably’ high. This view is ubiquitous. My suspicion is that, at least in some cases, people come to it because they have in the back of their minds an alternative and rather attractive world in which we all have fewer debts but the same assets,” he said.Mr Broadbent also pointed to analysis suggesting that historically the growth of household debt is more important than the level when it comes to creating the conditions for a crisis.“That doesn’t mean the level of debt doesn’t matter. But it may matter only relative to some sustainable threshold, one that’s not directly observable and that can vary,” he said.“The precise terms, and therefore the riskiness of a given quantity of debt, are not exactly the same in every country.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The new models expected to be released in September of this year are likely to keep much the same design as the current models, and so the LCD display is likely to stick around.Apple\u0027s mysterious new charger might be about to arriveLCD displays have largely fallen out of favour in recent years because they use up more battery than rival OLED technology, which also allows for richer blacks. OLED displays can also be arranged into more unusual shapes, allowing for more radical changes in the phones\u0027 design.The new rumour came from a Wall Street Journal report detailing the concerns at Japan Display, which is being hit not only by the dropping of LCD screens but also the relative lack of demand for the new iPhone XR, which uses its screens.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Anger over poor social conditions grew so intense that it provoked a riot in the late 1990s. A local social activist who objected to youths smashing bottles on the road and handed a bin bag full of broken glass to the mother of one of those responsible\u0026nbspsays\u0026nbsphe had bricks thrown at his house and firecrackers pushed through the letterbox.Outside Westminster, people are becoming numb to the Brexit crisisWhat turned Thanington round was substantial aid from the European Union.Paul Todd, a former resident who works on housing and homelessness issues, says:\u0026nbsp“About 20 years ago it was regenerated when it got a large dose of money out of the European regeneration budget.” The funding was used to make extensive renovations such as putting new roofs on the council houses and renewing bathrooms and bedrooms so the homes of council tenants looked better than those privately owned. In addition, the\u0026nbspregeneration money funded a community centre, known locally as the Resource Centre, which provides space for sports and recreation, as well as accommodation for children doing homework which they could not do at home.Paula Spencer, who has managed the centre since it was built, adds that the EU “spent £2.5m in doing up the estate and getting rid of the rat-runs. It used to be that they would nick your video machine and disappear down an alleyway.” Crime and antisocial behaviour dropped by 50 per cent as the regeneration measures took effect. As a newly arrived council tenant, Heggie says that she had been worried by the crossbow bolt incident but “apart from one broken car window on my driveway I have had no trouble since”.Created with Sketch.

The 2,794 people who live there work mostly in low-wage jobs, often as cleaners or in supermarkets in and around Canterbury, or they are on benefits. Educational standards are low, illiteracy is high, and many single-parent families are headed by women. Nevertheless, residents and outside observers agree that Thanington retains a strong sense of communal solidarity.“It’s largely retained its village identity,” says Todd, whose relatives still live there and who has great affection for its people. “Everyone knows everyone else’s business.”\u0026nbspOver the past summer, we had a lot of guys coming down from London and selling drugs. They’d move into a house, take it over and intimidate the tenant. Then there was the shootingThe only state institution to help preserve this small and vulnerable community was the EU, so it is worth asking why so many of those living in Thanington voted Leave\u0026nbspin the 2016 referendum. At first glance, their actions, repeated in many deprived areas receiving EU funds in England and Wales, appear to be an inexplicable example of social and economic self-harm. Nevertheless, it was probably the high Leave\u0026nbspvotes in deprived white housing estates which tipped the balance towards Britain voting for Brexit. So it is important to discover why people from such places voted as they did in such overwhelming numbers. Was it a vote very much determined by opposition to immigration, or was it a more general protest by the “left-behinds”\u0026nbspand the “left-outs”? \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMost people in Thanington voted for Britain to leave the EU, and they did so because they are poor and feel neglected, according to Todd, who has known the area for 30 years. He says that there is an “assumption there that immigration has affected their prospects. I don’t think people are aware of how much Thanington did benefit from the EU. The European regeneration money certainly made a huge impact on the quality of the housing stock up there. It probably gave some of the houses another chance, otherwise they might have been knocked down. Some people want immigration cut and others think that talk of another referendum is an indicator that their concerns haven’t been taken seriously.”Bellas did not mention and may not have known about the EU regeneration effort which happened before he started living on the estate after years of homelessness and holding insecure jobs. In any case, the impact of that funding is running out and there are signs of growing decrepitude and insecurity.\u0026nbsp“It’s quite a deprived area,” he says. “There’s a lot of people with drug problems and\u0026nbspalcohol issues, and they seem to be moving families in who have already been evicted from homes because of antisocial behaviour. Everyone’s got a right to live anywhere but it doesn’t do great things for the estate.“Over the past summer, we had a lot of guys coming down from London and selling drugs. They’d move into a house, take it over and intimidate the tenant – ‘you’re going to sell this for us’\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspa lot of guys in Mercedes,\u0026nbspreal high-end saloons,\u0026nbspwho don’t fit on the estate. Then there was the shooting in the summer, which was a direct result of these guys coming down from London and that happened just around the corner from us.”Created with Sketch.

Only the sleeping bag is left as a sign of what might have been“It’s a lack of funding and a lack of police. You only ever see police when these things happen and it’s after the fact. Our kids don’t play out on the street. I know all my neighbours and I know all their kids, but it’s really difficult because there are people from off the estate come to sell their drugs that I don’t know. We had a heroin dealer set up in the house next door to us and for about six weeks, we had people knocking on our door coming to pick up their drugs up and it took 50 phone calls to the police to get them to sort it out.”The shooting Bellas refers to took place on 19 July last year when\u0026nbsptwo men in balaclavas shot and seriously wounded Danny Mobey in Thanington’s Godwin Road.Bellas voted Leave in the referendum, denying that this had anything to do with immigration and saying that his decision was more to do with democracy and resistance to power being devolved to a centralised European government and unelected officials making decisions on his behalf. He says: “I just feel that there is something quite sinister and secret about a federal government.”About the economic consequences of departure from the EU, he is optimistic, arguing that the Germans, French and Spanish will want to go on selling goods to Britain. He says that a lot of people he knows had voted Leave influenced by “the Brexiteers’ promise that there would be £350m\u0026nbspextra for the NHS”.\u0026nbspHis two biggest concerns are the lack of policing and the decline of the NHS, where his wife works as a nurse, and which he fears the government wants to privatise.Even in a place as small as Thanington, perceptions of violence vary markedly from street to street and person to person. Di Hutchinson agrees that things are getting worse: “I was ill last Christmas and I saw a drug deal going down and I was shocked because it was the first time I’d ever seen it.” Overall, however, residents and outside observers say that Thanington is no worse than other housing estates and other areas of deprivation anywhere in UK. (There are more affluent parts of the district away from the estate.)People came to me and said that there were rats in their kitchens, rats in their children’s bedrooms, running over kids’ feet, and under bathrooms so there was raw sewage seeping everywhereFinancial aid from the EU and other advantages stemming from membership had little effect on poor Leave voters in 2016. Either the EU’s achievements were under-publicised, or – and this is probably the crucial factor – whatever the EU did was not enough to counterbalance a pervasive sense among millions of voters that their lives are getting more pressured and insecure. This was as true in east Kent as it was in Cornwall, an example of ingratitude for EU largesse often cited. That county has a population of 530,000 and received €654m\u0026nbsp(£574m) from the EU between 2007 and 2013. It was due to receive another €600m before 2020, yet 54.5 per cent voted Leave.Fear of immigration was probably the most important factor in the way people voted, but so too was the privatisation and outsourcing of utitlities and services, job insecurity, decline in real wages, high rents, deindustrialisation and a lack of cheap transport. The EU and its supporters can justly complain that Brussels is being unfairly scapegoated for failings that it has\u0026nbspnothing to do with, and which\u0026nbspshould be blamed rather on globalisation, privatisation and the austerity policies pursued by Conservative governments.Yet, even if the EU is not responsible, this does not mean that the deep discontent\u0026nbsprevealed by the referendum result is\u0026nbspnot real. Simply put, Brexit is a symptom as well as a cause of the crisis which has enveloped Britain and envenomed its politics. The ill-considered Remain slogan of 2016 – “Better Together” –\u0026nbspwas never going to resonate with those whose standard of living had stagnated or deteriorated over the past decade despite Britain being in the EU. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAusterity may have driven homelessness rise, minister admitsTransport is already scarce: according to Spencer, it takes two bus trips to get to the nearest doctor, while there is only one bus every two hours in the evening. A planned new exit from the A2, which is being contested by local residents, will make Thanington even more isolated from the rest of Canterbury than it is at present. And as houses become more expensive and cost far more than the present population on their low-paying jobs can afford, the traditional community will break up as parents find that their children have to move off the estate if they want find anywhere cheap enough to live.Even more seriously, the insecure low-paid work done by many in Thanington does not provide enough to pay rent and food. The result is reliance on food banks and free school meals. Caroline Heggie says that people are becoming more and more indebted “because now you’ve got companies giving out credit cards to people with low credit ratings”.A telling sign of the growing deprivation in Thanington – and the sort of event which may explain why people there failed to endorse the status quo in 2016 – is a recent plague of rats.“People came to me and said that there were rats in their kitchens, rats in their children’s bedrooms, running over kids’ feet, and under bathrooms so there was raw sewage seeping everywhere,” says Spencer. The origin of the rat infestation is unclear: it may be that rats were disturbed by the new housing construction in nearby fields, or that the council no longer deals with rubbish that has been left to pile up. Cuts in public services of all kinds have hit Thanington hard, and services dropped include pest control.A rat catcher charges £60, which tenants must now pay themselves though there may be 10 or 12 rats to be disposed of, necessitating more than one visit.\u0026nbspHeggie says: “You used to have council ‘rat people’, but because of austerity, you don’t have them anymore.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

What was a feel-good underdog story swiftly turns into a hard-hitting drama about euthanasia.The set-up: Helping several others dodge the monsters lurking in the mist, David Drayton (Thomas Jane) leads the escape from the supermarket they’ve been holed up in. They reach a car and drive away, but soon run out of gas and realise there’s no hope. David loads a gun and, as the camera cuts away, shoots the survivors, including his young son. The twist: As he’s gearing up to put the gun to his own head, shadowy figures roll toward him. He’s devastated to learn it’s actually the military who have combatted the mist creatures. He killed his son for no reason. Talk about awful timing.The set-up: Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-sik) is kidnapped and held in captivity for 15 years.

The set-up: Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a mother who tries to protect her two children from supernatural forces in their Victorian mansion.The twist: In a spin on the ghost story, it turns out it\u0027s Grace and her children who are the ghosts: she killed them – before turning the gun on herself – in despair over the presumed death of her husband in World War II.The set-up: The film tracks the rivalry of two magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman), who go to extreme lengths to outsmart one another, each pulling off tricks the other considers impossible.The twist: It emerges that Fallon, the bearded carer of Borden’s children, is actually his twin (he’s also played by Bale) while Angier’s technique is far more disturbing: each night, using Tesla’s technology, he sends his clone plummeting into a water tank.2437 Planet of the Apes (1968)The set-up: Three scientists wake up hundreds of years after being launched into space to discover they’ve landed on a planet where primates rule over humans, who are their prisoners.The twist: As Charlton Heston’s character escapes his cell, he eventually finds the Statue of Liberty protruding from sand. Turns out it’s not just any planet – it’s Earth.The set-up: A defence attorney (Richard Gere) has a strong belief that his stuttering altar boy client (Edward Norton) is not guilty of murdering an influential Catholic Archbishop. He\u0027s later found not guilty by reason of insanity after being diagnosed with multiple personality disorder.The twist: He faked the  disorder. The film\u0027s closing moments see him drop the stutter and reveal his guilt as his attorney looks on, disturbed.The set-up: What viewers initially think is a film about a theft committed by Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) turns out to be something far more darker. On the run, she arrives at a motel owned by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and is swiftly murdered by his mother.The twist: Only, it\u0027s not his mother – it’s Norman. He killed his mother years before and has since developed a split personality.The set-up: Having been chained up by the Jigsaw killer in a dilapidated bathroom – which has a corpse lying  in the middle of the room – photographer Adam (Leigh Whannell) overpowers and kills his captor. He rummages through his pockets, looking for the key that will unlock the chain around his leg, convinced the nightmare is finally over.The twist: Instead, he finds a cassette recorder that reveals his supposed captor was, in fact, another victim of the Jigsaw killer who was merely following his rules in order to obtain an antidote for a poison in his body. Cue a corpse in the middle of the room rising to reveal himself as the real Jigsaw killer. He was there the whole time.The set-up: David Mills (Brad Pitt) and retired PI William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) have closed in on serial killer, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), who has been using the seven deadly sins as inspiration for his murders.The twist: He has one final murder left to commit – only he’s already committed it. We discover Doe has killed Mills’s wife (Gwyneth Paltrow), which prompts him to complete Doe’s plan by murdering him out of wrath.The set-up: US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner (Mark Ruffalo) arrive at a centre for the criminally insane to find an escaped killer who drowned her three children.The twist: Teddy is actually a patient, and his partner is his doctor. He killed his wife after she murdered their three children and the elaborate  ruse is an attempt to bring his repressed memories to the surface.The set-up: A young boy who can see dead people encounters a child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and attempts to discover the reason behind his disturbing ability.The twist: Crowe is, in fact, dead all along. He got killed during a robbery that we see in the film’s opening scene.The set-up: The introverted Angela (Felissa Rose) becomes terrified when a murderer wreaks destruction at the same campsite where her brother Peter was killed eight years before.The twist: Angela is the killer. She\u0027s also not Angela at all, but her presumed dead brother Peter, who was raised as a girl by her aunt following Angela\u0027s death.3237 The Skin I Live In (2011)The twist: The Vera we\u0027re seeing is not wis wife, but a young man whom Robert abducted and subjected to a vaginoplasty six years before.The set-up: Peter Parker (Tom Holland) takes a break from trying to stop the film\u0027s villain, the Vulture (Michael Keaton), to go to his school\u0027s Homecoming dance. The twist: He shows up to his date\u0027s house, knocks on the door... and comes face to face with The Vulture. He\u0027s her father.The set-up: David Dunn survives a train crash that kills 130 passengers, and begins to believe he may have special powers. His life soon collides with comic book store owner Elijah (Samuel L Jackson), who has a rare bone disorder, and helps David discover he has the ability to see the criminal acts of those he comes into contact with.

Ours is the first scenario that can explain the timing and delivery in a way that is consistent with all the geochemical evidence.Dr\u0026nbspDasgupta said the study could allow humanity to understand more about how the ingredients for life might form on other rocky planets like our own.This study suggests that a rocky, Earth-like planet gets more chances to acquire life-essential elements if it forms and grows from giant impacts with planets that have sampled different building blocks, perhaps from different parts of a protoplanetary disk.The research is published in the journal Science Advances.Additional reporting by Press AssociationOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The central rule of the club is that no country can impose tariffs on another country’s imports that are higher than those imposed on imports\u0026nbspfrom any other country\u0026nbsp– unless it has established a broad free trade agreement with that country. So if country X gives country Y a reduced tariff,\u0026nbspthat same favour must be granted to all other WTO members.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by Parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentThis is the “most favoured nation” principle. Its purpose is to prevent ad hoc discrimination on tariffs by countries and the risk of tit-for-tat trade battles.But that does not mean that, in the absence of a free trade agreement, trade between two states can be assumed to be governed only by WTO rules.Take the EU’s trade with the US.How badly could Brexit disrupt farming exports from Northern Ireland?“All 164 of them have negotiated better access to at least one market through some kind of bilateral agreement in addition to their WTO relationship.”So if the UK suddenly left the EU its trade with the US, at least initially, would still be disrupted because we would lose the coverage over those 100 sector agreements too.The point is that WTO rules are not some kind of tried and tested landing place for a country crashing out of a trade bloc.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

It looked to be a straight-forward victory for the Spaniard as he surged into a two-set lead, but Murray is not a three-time Grand Slam champion for nothing and he supremely levelled the match despite hobbling around the court from the get-go. However, in the end his hip injury just took too much out of him, and Bautista Agut clinched a breath-taking 6-4, 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 6-7 (4-7), 2-6 victory to reach the second round where he\u0027ll face Australia\u0027s John MillmanBritish Prime Minister, Theresa May and her husband Philip attend Sunday morning prayers at her local church in Maidenhead, Britain, 13 January 2019.

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.

The ‘no deal’ even more so.”At the committee the\u0026nbspchief negotiator elaborated,\u0026nbspwarning\u0026nbspthat the only way to avoid the UK crashing was to endorse another option on the table.“There appears to be a majority in the Commons to oppose a no deal but opposing a no deal will not stop a no deal from happening at the end of March”, he told the committee. “To stop no deal, a positive majority for another solution will need to emerge.”Following the defeat of her withdrawal agreement by the largest margin in the history of parliament, Ms May said she would try and secure a time limit on the controversial backstop policy.But Mr Barnier said: “The question of limiting the backstop in time has already been discussed twice by the European leaders, in November and in December 2018.\u0026nbsp“This backstop is the only one possible because an assurance is no longer operational if it is for a limited time. Imagine if it were to be limited in time and the problem arose after expiry: it is useless!”He was backed up later on Wednesday by Frans Timmermans, the first vice president of the European Commission.\u0026nbsp“We will support Ireland … the backstop is a red line we cannot negotiate with the British government,” Mr Timmermans told an event in Krakow, Poland. \u0026nbspNo-deal Brexit could force schools into ‘lockdown’ due to air qualityWetherspoon’s boss insists no-deal Brexit will help pub chainMinisters push for May to back backstop planBritons heading to EU face delays and questioning after no-deal BrexitIn the weeks since the defeat of the withdrawal agreement the EU has focused on encouraging the PM to revisit her red lines, and signalled its willingness to re-work the so-called “political declaration” that lays out the future trading relationship.Labour and other opposition parties back a much closer economic relationship with the EU, floating possibilities like common single market standards and a customs union.Mr Barnier suggested the question of the backstop would “become relative” if the future relationship was revisited – signalling that it might be a way out of the current impasse.“If the British government wishes to revisit the future relationship and be more ambitious, then it would be possible to agree on the global package and the question of the ‘backstop’ would become relative,” he said.“If I understand the British debates right there is a desire to find a way. But if the government and the MPs don’t move their lines, we are going inevitably into ‘no deal’.”The prime minister has repeatedly\u0026nbspruled out shifting her red lines on issues like a customs union and free movement.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by Parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentThe political backdrop to Mr Barnier’s comments is increasingly complicated. The Commons is considering a new amendment to rule out a no-deal Brexit – forcing the government to seek an extension or revocation of Article 50 if the UK gets too close to the deadline without an agreement.But in Ireland, the government is facing a political backlash over suggestions a hard border would return if Britain crashes out. Leo Varadkar’s cabinet was put in a tight spot earlier in the week after a Commission spokesperson said there would “obviously” be new infrastructure in the event the withdrawal agreement was not signed. Though Mr Barnier appeared to endorse this suggestion in ensuing interviews, by Wednesday afternoon he had apparently softened his tone by suggesting there could be another way around the problem.That concession itself, however, is likely to fuel opposition to the withdrawal agreement in Westminster – where Eurosceptic MPs are likely to interepret Mr Barnier’s latest comments as an admission that the backstop, which they fiercely oppose,\u0026nbspis not necessary. They may also be emboldened by a suggestion by the Polish foreign minister earlier in the week that the EU should accept a time limit on the backstop, as the MPs demand.As a result, the chances of the Commons coming around to passing\u0026nbspthe withdrawal agreement look slimmer than ever.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They are likely to back alternative motions that simply call for a public vote.\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn has so far refused to agree to\u0026nbspMPs\u0027 and party members\u0027 demands that he\u0026nbspback a Final Say vote, but said the option should be considered by MPs.\u0026nbspHe said:\u0026nbspThe prime minister is both refusing to change her red lines or take the threat of a no deal exit off the table.

Ben Bradshaw called it important progress and David Lammy tweeted: This is a big step foward. I hope this amendment can be the beginning of the end of years of argument over Berxit in this country.But while more than 70 Labour MPs have publicly called for another referendum, dozens of\u0026nbspothers are strongly opposed, including shadow ministers who would likely resign in order to vote against any proposal for going back to the public.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by Parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentSoon after the party\u0027s motion was tabled, shadow housing minister Melanie Onn announced that should would step down if she is ordered to vote for another referendum.In a letter to constituents, she wrote: I am not in favour of a People\u0027s Vote and will not vote for it. If it comes before parliament as it is expected to in the next few daysweeks, I will instead vote for a better \u0027Labour\u0027 deal.This may mean that I am required to step down from my frontbench housing role if it is a whipped vote. I would be very disappointed if this were the case, as I am very proud of the work I have been doing alongside John Healey and Sarah Jones, but recognise that I cannot vote against the frontbench and remain a part of it.Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour\u0027s\u0026nbspshadow business secretary, said the amendment would simply\u0026nbspwiden the debate and put all options on the table to avoid a no-deal scenario but that the party\u0027s priority remained securning\u0026nbspa different Brexit deal, including a customs union with the EU and a closer relationship with the\u0026nbspsingle market.\u0026nbspAsked if\u0026nbspLabour\u0027s motion\u0026nbspmakes a second referendum\u0026nbspmore likely,\u0026nbspshe told Sky News: Well, no. In line with our conference policy...our priority is to secure a deal\u0026nbspbut obviously all options need to remain on the table and that includes a public vote.She added: There\u0027s no\u0026nbspguarantee that it will pass even if our amendment passed\u0026nbspand certainly right across the Conservative Party\u0026nbspand in the Labour Party there\u0027s ided opinion as to whether a second referendum should be a preferred option at this stage.Ms Long-Bailey\u0026nbspsuggested that, even if its amendment passes, Labour would not necessarily instruct its MPs to vote for another referendum, saying: That\u0027s something that the party would need to decide at the time.\u0026nbspWith parliament still deadlocked over Brexit, former Conservative leader William Hague said a fresh public vote was now quite likely.Writing in the Daily , he said: It will probably produce only a narrow victory for either side despite a long struggle, and leave a wounded country to limp on afterwards.But it\u0027s coming, unless some extraordinary turn of events prevents it. It\u0027s coming by a process of elimination, not because it\u0027s a good idea in itself.MPs will vote on 29 January on amendments to Ms May\u0027s proposed plan.Commons home affairs committee chair Yvette Cooper has tabled a motion that would delay Brexit until the end of the year if no deal is in place by the end of February. With significant cross-party support, the motion is likely to pass if Labour agrees to support it.Hilary Benn, chair of the Brexit commitee, has put down a separate amendment calling for MPs to hold a series of indicative votes on various Brexit outcomes.And Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general, is expected to propose giving parliament to right to seize\u0026nbspcontrol of Brexit if the government cannot pass its deal.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s time to take matters out of the hands of people like David Davis and give control to the public through a people\u0027s vote.Shadow cabinet office minister John Trickett added: “What David Davis will get paid in 20 hours takes most people over two years to earn.But then again, under the Tories it’s one set of rules for the few and another for the many.“Most people when reading this will no doubt think “snouts in the trough”, and this is exactly why Labour has repeatedly warned of the damage to the reputation of parliament caused by arrangements like this and why they need to stop.”Mr Davis and Mr Johnson both resigned from the cabinet last year in protest at Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The company reported like-for-like sales growth of 7.2 per cent for the first 12 weeks of the second quarter, while like-for-like sales in the year to date have risen 6.3 per cent. However, costs in the first half have been “considerably higher” than the previous year, particularly for labour, which is up by around £30m.

Last year, the company said it would replace champagne with British sparkling wine, and would buy less beer from the EU, swapping to UK brewers where possible.

The group has opened two pubs and sold six since the beginning of the financial year, with plans to open between five and 10 this year. Wetherspoons warns of price rises as boss repeats call for hard BrexitWetherspoons bans dogs from all their UK pubs as of todayWill Wetherspoons really only sell British booze post-Brexit?Wetherspoon to replace champagne with British sparkling winesEd Monk, associate director at Fidelity Personal Investing, said: “There was more Brexit bluster from J D Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin in the company’s trading update today, but investors will be more focused on the warning that pre-tax profit will be lower in the first half of the trading year. “The margins at ’Spoons are tight so the challenge has been to grow overall sales in order to keep growing profits. Any hint of higher costs, including staff wages, is bad news so the news of another £30m in labour costs since November will hurt. With unemployment low, thanks in part to lower flows of workers from the EU, labour costs will continue to be a focus at Wetherspoon.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He also co-owns a house in Surrey.Mishcon de Reya first hired him in  as a part-time consultant for its business crime unit.He quit client work for the firm in April , but was reappointed as a consultant to its in-house academy in June this year.The MP stood down from that role after being appointed to the shadow cabinet last month.Starmer is the third key figure from the lacklustre £.m Operation Elveden witchhunt of Sun reporters to be employed by Mishcon de Reya.His former principal legal adviser at the Crown Prosecution Service Alison Levitt and former politan police assistant commissioner Sue Akers – who headed the bungled investigation – have also done work for the firm.This week Starmer refused to apologise after reporter Anthony France had his conviction overturned - meaning not one of  Sun journalists arrested were convicted.A spokeswoman for the law firm said: “Keir Starmer was a consultant to the Mishcon Academy, our in-house centre for learning and development.“The role did not involve client advice on any issue. Keir resigned as a consultant to the academy when he was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet.”A spokesman for Starmer’s office said: “MPs are required to register and declare fees received since the May  election even where those fees were earned before the election.“The register makes it very clear that in the case of Keir Starmer, the vast majority of his declared earnings represent payment for work undertaken by him as a lawyer before he became MP.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is a bid for power without a mandate.Shty Dominic Grieve fancies himself as a Remain superhero, outwitting the Government to rob .million voters.He doesn’t give a damn about the little people, of course, being a grand QC and former Attorney General.But Grieve is doing catastrophic harm to his party, to Parliament and our democracy. History won’t be kind to him.The Government he is destabilising is the only prayer Leavers have.Their betrayal by Labour is close, and inevitable.Labour’s Brexit chief Keir Starmer now admits that he aims to secure a second referendum — then campaign, and vote, for Remain.If that’s not Corbyn’s policy, why isn’t Starmer fired All the chaos brings Theresa May ever closer to an election.One in which every Tory Remainer plotting to kill Brexit must be deselected and replaced.With candidates who stay loyal to voters and make promises they intend to keep.SADIQ Khan’s “poll tax” on drivers looks like the biggest disaster of his inglorious tenure as London Mayor.We know he is a lightweight who prefers virtue-signalling to fixing the city’s problems. But this insane pollution charge could prove fatal to his prospects.Not only is his scheme, to hammer drivers in his Ultra Low Emissions Zone, vastly expensive to set up, it will barely improve air quality. All those who cannot replace their old car with a “cleaner” new model will be clobbered.Which of course hits the lowest-paid hardest. And, naturally, other left-wing councils nationwide are following suit.How very “progressive” it all is.NO ONE expects a flag-waving jamboree on the th anniversary of troops being deployed to Northern Ireland. But why would the MoD not mark it at all It is a snub of a piece with the hounding of veterans over their actions decades ago.It stems from a corrosive political correctness in modern politicians’ attitudes towards our role in the Troubles, where , troops died quelling the IRA’s campaign of slaughter.Labour may be led by pensioner revolutionaries who supported the terrorists.That’s no reason for the Tories to forget who the good guys were — and their bravery in securing the peace.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Borough of Culture is about inspiring people who might not have considered a career in the arts and unlocking their potential.“The Borough of Culture also forms part of the Mayor’s work to tackle the root causes of violent crime, as it will create cultural activities specically designed to be easily accessible to disadvantaged young Londoners."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000463397365.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"sob stories ruined sas who dares wins","story":"A political decision that was clearly designed to distract voters and get an easy round of applause.Two things that were never going to stop Channel  enforcing the same rules at its own brilliant version of selection, SAS: Who Dares Wins, evenit was the last show on television that needed any fixing.Its three series have been close to works of art, in fact, largely thanks to their breathtaking settings and four instructors, Ant Middleton, Jason Fox, Matthew Ollerton and Mark Billingham, who gave it such an air of authenticity you could suspend disbelief and imagine you were watching the real thing.As the show’s introduction would have it, though, everything’s changed and they’re a band of brothers no more.The fourth run has  female recruits including a mole called Petra who’s served, for nine years, with Swedish Special forces, on their “front line”.A place which — full ignorant disclosure — I didn’t think extended much beyond the first day of Ikea’s January sales when it all kicks off on Malmo High Street, but actually involved several tours of Afghanistan.Her job here was to spy on all the contestants, and Petra’s certainly done a better job than the production team, because I’ve been watching it for three weeks and can only name three men.First to show, in Chile, was a Muslim called Qash, who voluntarily withdrew after discovering he’d have to share bathroom facilities with the women .  There’s also been no avoiding mentally fragile Nathaniel, or Milo, who’s so camp he makes Alan Carr sound like Lee Marvin.The rest of the  blokes, though, have just become anonymous blips on the horizon while the camera fixates on the women.Among their favourites have been: Saranya, who became the first candidate ever to shout “WHEEEEEEEEEE!” during the ft abseil, tattooed Tracey, blunt Aberdonian Lou, with the voice that goes through you like a rusty bayonet, and television natural Louise, who was the only woman bold enough to challenge a man in the boxing round, and suffered an uncomfortable beating for her troubles.Standards y, but the brutal, straight-down-the-line approach of the four instructors rarely wavers on screen, no matter the gender or how much noise they make.“You having a baby ”“No staff.”“Then shut the f*** up.”This is why you’d probably trust Ant Middleton and the other three with your lives.Politicians and TV people, on the other hand, I trust about as far as I could piggy-back them up the Andes.Almost no encouragement is needed, butyou give them any they will try to reduce every show on TV to one long procession of box-ticking contestants with a crowd-pleasing, right-on ­conclusion.That’s why the most over-worked recruit on this series is the pianist on sob story duties.It may always have had an element of this, of course, but the point when the scales really fell from my eyes was Sunday’s voluntary withdrawal of Nathaniel, who left a letter for the other weeping recruits announcing: “This is just the start of my journey.”You wish him well, obviously, but use of the dreaded J-word wasn’t just the moment I could no longer suspend disbelief, it was also the moment I started to think television was turning SAS selection into Bootcamp on The X Factor.Andthat’s the case, Channel  can have my badge. I’m voluntarily withdrawing from their process.DANCING On Ice viewers can’t say they weren’t warned.“After the break,” said host Phillip Schofield, “Gemma Collins is Marilyn Monroe. Don’t go away.”A big ask.

Nor is anyone listening when they bang on about the “tiredness, sleepless nights and blah blah blah”.The only reason I kept watching this one, in fact, was to try to establish exactly how Spencer and Vogue earn a living, as they’re one of those independently wealthy couples who give very little clue as to why they’re always so “busy, busy, busy”.It took a couple of episodes, but eventually Vogue muttered some- thing about her own fake tan range and Spencer said something even less convincing about cooking, before adding: “We bring dferent things to the table.” The urge Spencer really wants to milk, it turns out though, is a creative one. So, at the climax of episode two he’s striding into London’s Soho Theatre for an audition, with the defiant announcement: “I’m going to open or shut the door on my childhood dream of becoming an actor.”And how’s that going Make sure it bangs your a*** on the way out, Spencer.TV GOLD: The Paras: Men Of War, on ITV.

Ah, oui, Dominique. Not as British as you might think, Grieve.Which may explain why he  is now doing such terrible damage to our national interest and to the future of our parliamentary system by trying to block Brexit. Over the two decades since he became an MP in , this pukka, posh-suited, punctilious figure has been a pedantic regular in House of Commons debates.He would crook one of his little fingers at an angle, give his neck muscles a creaky tweak and insist, with a shot of the cuffs and a shuffle of minimal notes, that ministers and officials must always comply with statute and precedent and time-honoured procedure.When giving these lectures — they were seldom short — he would touch the rim of his glasses, give a little mallard-style cough and allow a patronising smile to inhabit his broadening bill.He would explain that raw political instinct and passion, of the sort voiced by the Nigel Farages and Jeremy Corbyns of this world,  were not by themselves good enough in politics. He looked down on such things.Politicians whose demagogic brio reflected the public’s molten anger  Puh-lease, how vulgar. They did not accord with Grieve’s gods of logic.“With respect,” he would say — and it is one of the older truths of Westminster that when people say “with respect” they mean the sneery opposite — “with respect, we have to do things according to the rules, for that is the way this Parliament works and those are the sort of people we are.”I paraphrase him but that was very much Grieve’s position. He was a creature of propriety.He could cite legal sub-section and addendum and annex and codicil that proved, we were told, the unarguable merits of his position.With Monsieur half-French Grieve, the ancient principles of English law were our majesty. Our mainstay!Plenty of us clocked that Grieve was a bit of a prune, an oddball, the fogeyish son of privilege. His dad Percy, wouldn’t you know it, had also been a Tory MP of the gusset-and-sock-suspenders old school.Percy once worked as a liaison officer for French wartime hero Charles de Gaulle, who hated the British . It was said that Old Man Grieve agreed with de Gaulle.“The trouble with Percy  is that he likes foreigners  a great deal better than his own people,” concluded an acquaintance.Dominic, in childhood, worshipped his father and once won a school oratory contest by making an admiring speech about de Gaulle.Does “Dominique”, too, like continentals better than his fellow countrymen  It sure looks that way. In June , in one of the greatest thumpings our elite was ever given by the people, we voted to leave the EU. Dominic Grieve, newly decorated with France’s Legion d’honneur for his political work, was horried.Indignant. You could even say he was ag-Grieved. And so he touched the rims of his glasses, did some ducky quacking and set to work to block Brexit.The trouble, as has often been pointed out to him, was that the democratic vote had gone against him.At first he said, through gritted teeth , that he would respect the result of the referendum.In  he was re-elected as MP for prosperous Beaconsfield, Bucks,  on a Tory manesto which said exactly that.Every Tory MP promised to get us out of the customs union and single market.Labour MPs also promised to honour the referendum result. What lying bastards these people are. When the new Government started to get into political dficulties, the once-principled Grieve saw his chance. He stopped saying he would respect the referendum result. He wanted us to stay in the customs union. He wanted a second referendum.Most startling of all, he plotted to bypass all those rules and time-honoured procedures he used to say were so vital for our political safety.After a secret meeting with the appallingly biased John Bercow, Grieve got that anti-Brexit Commons Speaker to chuck out centuries of accepted debating rules.Propriety was smashed like plates at a Greek wedding. Legal advice was ignored.This former Attorney General’s campaign against Brexit, which will next week see him and a minority of MPs attempt to remove law-making from the elected Government, took on a wild, crazed aspect.The possible upshots for our democratic system are terrying. When MPs stop even bothering to pretend they will honour their election promises, why should anyone vote Why not just seize power by force  It’s a recipe for anarchy on the streets.At the moment, Corbyn’s Labour Party is going along with Grieve and Bercow but Corbyn will surely eventually realise that warping parliamentary rules to stop an elected Government from governing will do him no favourshe himself becomes Prime Minister.  It always takes time for the penny to drop with dozy Corbyn.Meanwhile, we are left  with the bizarre spectacle of one-time legal details nerd Dominic Grieve going back  on everything he ever stood for, overturning ancient parliamentary conventions.All along, it seems, his loyalties were not to a rules-based system but to the blue flag of a European Union that is now, increasingly, our rival and our deadly threat.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

When they cried and said sorry I forgave them. I never learnt.Now in her early s, she has had plastic surgery to recover from her injuries, but still has both physical and emotional le-long scars.The Yakuza are believed to run the Japanese sex trade, where they lure in women from around the world with promises of visas, only to take their passport and drive them into debt so they are forced to work in brothels - its thought they are capitalising on Asias growing status as a destination for sex tourism.Surveys have found  per cent of Japanese men have paid for sex and  per cent of junior and high school girls have been solicited by middle-aged men.And their network of brothels is not limited to Japan, but also Korea, Thailand and the Philippines where foreigners would fly specically to for sex parties.There has, to date, been just one female Yakuza leader, Fumiko Taoka, who briefly led her dead husband Kazuo Taokas gang until a new male leader was chosen in  As well as having heavily-tattooed bodies, the Yakuza can often be identied by their lack of a pinky finger.This is because members - who are initiated into gangs with sword-fighting and meditation lessons - have them amputated as punishmentthey step out of line, usually because they are unable to pay off gambling debts or fail to complete a task such as a killing or importing drugs.The process known as yubitsume - which translates to finger shortening - dates back to the eighteenth century when the pinky finger was key for helping to grip the Japanese Kendo sword.Without it, warriors are weaker and more reliant on their leader.Today the ritual involves the member chopping it off themselves before handing it over to their boss who keeps it as a trophy.If gang members continue to offend their bosses, they either face more yubitsume, or expulsion.The latter is the worst punishment, as those who are kicked out are unable to associate with gang members for the rest of their lives.Former Yakuza members who have since ed to non-criminal society can struggle to find work due to their associations with the gang, so often wear specially-made prosthetic fingers - costing £, - to disguise it.The practice of finger shortening is thought to have died out in recent decades because it is an easy way for police to identy possible criminals.Despite their violent ways, the gang has a white collar image, which sees them have offices, registered members, business cards, press conferences and be praised for helping the  earthquake and tsunami relief funds.They sent trucks from the Tokyo and Kobe regions to deliver food, water, blankets and toiletries to evacuation centres in northeast Japan - getting there quicker than the Japanese authorities.“Yakuza are dropouts from society,” said author Manabu Miyazaki, the son of a former Yakuza boss, toldrecently. They’ve suffered, and they’re just trying to help other people who are in trouble.In Japan, tattoos are almost entirely associated with being a member of the Yakuza - the ,-strong organised crime syndicate which has shocked the world with its ruthless illegal business dealings in drugs and firearms, organ trading and sex trafficking.Their most notorious leader Kazuo Taoka was nicknamed The Bear, as he had a penchant for clawing at his opponents eyes.He once survived being shot in the neck, and his attacker was found weeks later dead in woodland near Kobe.The Yakuza are also known for their brazen assassinations - which happen as often in broad daylight as under the cover of darkness.And in , the Mayor of Nagasaki, Itcho Ito, was shot twice in the back by a gang member, Tesuya Shiroo, over his administrations refusal to choose Yakuza firms for lucrative construction contracts.Before that, in , the particularly-violent Yakuza family, the Kudo-kai, who are based in Kitakyushu, gunned down a -year-old man who refused to give them favourable treatment for public works projects.A spate of violence will often follow funerals of murdered members, which, interestingly, members of all groups will often attend.At their height, the Yakuza had a massive , members.Infighting between gangs is often bloody -  one series of clashes left  dead and more than  injured in a matter of days in , in a country which has an extraordinarily low murder rate.The American Mafia only had an estimated , members at its peak - whereas the Yakuzas largest gang, the Yamaguchi-gumi in Kobe, alone recently listed , membersAmong the many famous illegal Yakuza enterprises - which has in the past included helping former Japanese prime minister Kakuei Tanaka secure his leadership by paying off members of a rival party, is organ trading, including kidneys and livers.In , a doctor, Toshinobu Horiuchi was arrested after it was discovered he was collaborating with the Yakuza to fake an adoption in order to obtain organs.He was suffering from kidney failure and needed a new one. He met the we of a Yakuza in a bar who promised to source him a new one for £,.They planned to help him adopt a -year-old male stranger - as organ donation is only available between family members in Japan - so the man could pass on his healthy kidney.In recent decades the Yakuza have also helped Japanese kidney patients travel to Taiwan and Singapore to purchase organs without consent from executed prisoners.The demand is exacerbated by the fact that Japanese culture doesnt believe in organ donation, and because Yakuza tattoos - so thick they block sweat from leaving the body - take a toxic toll on members livers.In , there was outrage in the United States when Tadamasa Goto, founder of gang the Goto-gumi, struck a deal with the FBI where he would give them information on the Yakuza and donate money to UCLA Medical Centre in Los Angelesthey helped arrange liver transplants for him and three of his associates.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If the man the Toyota driver hit hadnt have been an ex-racing driver, I think it could have been much worse.I noticed him in a split-second in the rear-view mirror, then the next thing I know hes in front of me. He was so quick. He came flying out of nowhere.It looks like he was trying to fly past them, but the guy in the red car had pulled into the lane he was in.The driver was an ex-race car driver, but the guy was going so fast so he didnt see him properly until he was there.He probably checked the mirror, seen nothing in and pulled out.Instead of just slamming on his brakes, the Toyota tried to cut in front of him again.As Aston approached the scene, he saw Len and his we were luckily uninjured, however the passenger door was so damaged she wasnt able to get out.Aston said: The couple he hit must have been in their sixties and luckily they were physically unharmed - just shaken up.The wheel arch was smashed up, there was damage to the passenger door which couldnt be open to get his we out.It was still drivable though because we followed the guy and tried to find him. He sped off.I was surprised that the guy managed to control the car and not end up in a ditch on the side of the road.[Len] did really well to control the car and not tip it over. He didnt actually hit the other car - I dont know how. He must have just skimmed it.The driver of that other car on the left chased him down with us because he was so angry he nearly hit him too.After ensuring the couple were safe, Aston and the driver of another vehicle that was narrowly missed followed the Toyota, finding the owner hiding at a nearby car wash.According to Aston, the reckless driver tried to blame the older couple for the collision and refused to admit fault.Aston said: He got away from us, but we knew the direction he went and saw his car hidden at a car wash.I got out my car and luckily he wasnt aggressive, but he was blaming Len in the red car.He said you see him hit me  you see him hit me I couldnt believe that hed driven like that then tried to blame the elderly couple. He wasnt sorry at all for it.He could have killed him and not known because hed sped ahead.Aston spoke to the Ford Fiesta driver after the crash to send him footage of the incident and claims he was told the police were not investigating as no-one was injured or killed.However Kent Police have now come back to confirm officers are looking into the crash.Aston said: The police are looking into it but they werent interested in first place because no-one was injured or killed.Theres been a few crashes on that bridge - its quite a steep cross-over. A quite famous one was a -car pile-up five years ago.They have an average speed camera but I think a lot of people assume theyre not turned on or working because Ive seen loads of people speeding.That whole stretch people drive really fast.A spokesperson for Kent Police said: Kent Police is investigating a collision which is reported to have taken place on the Sheppey Crossing on the afternoon on Monday  January .The incident is reported to have involved three vehicles and no injuries were reported.Officers are conducting ongoing enquiries to establish the full circumstances."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT0004617682221.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markles hunky new press secretary sets pulses racing","story":"The Duchess of Sussex, , is understood to have hired Christian Jones to handle her media affairs as she prepares to welcome her first child this spring.It comes after the pair were spotted leaving a posh Italian restaurant in Notting Hill, west London, on Friday.Jones official title is Deputy Communications Secretary and works for both Meghan and Harry - as well as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, according to E!

A new political party, which represents what a lot of us want.Because you’ve got to say — the parties in Westminster aren’t doing that, are they Whatever happens at the end of this awful Brexit mess, one thing is clear, our politics have to change.The isions between our current parties no longer reflect the isions in the country. If Brexit has told us anything, it’s told us that.And there is a growing anger out there that the views of millions and millions of people are simply not represented in Parliament.That’s obvious from Brexit — more than a third of Labour voters wanted us to leave. Including a majority in some northern constituencies. Almost two thirds of Tory voters wanted us to leave.Nigel Farage, the former leader of Ukip, has already said he fancies creating a new party. A Brexit Party.Good luck to the man — I might even join it, because I have the horrible feeling our Parliament is going to betray the people, and we’ll end up staying in. That would be a travesty of democracy.The very reasons which convinced more than million of us to vote for Brexit were the same as those which are causing isions across Europe. And as a result we’ve seen the huge rise of populist parties. In Italy, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Greece, France and even Germany. Oh — and, of course — the USA.These parties are sometimes right wing, sometimes left wing. In Italy there is an alliance between the two.What they are all, though, is dferent to the politics we have now. They are parties which listen to the people. Populist is just another way of saying popular, really.Most agree on a whole bunch of issues. We need to control immigration, number one. Especially immigration from Islamic countries.We need a bit more respect for the nation state: People feel proud of the countries in which they live. Yes, even some Belgians.A lot are socially conservative. By which I mean they do not have much time for gender neutral toilets, LGBTQI protests, political correctness and so on.Instead, they have a respect for traditional values. For the family, for the Christian faith, on which our countries were founded. For our histories. And they are sceptical of the European Union.But they also recognise that there are deep economic isions within our countries which need to be addressed. In our own country a terrible chasm between the affluence and influence of London, versus the rest of the country. Between rich and poor.We have no political party right now which covers those bases.But that is where the real ide in society lies. So, as January drags on — how about a party  One that represents US Labour MP Diane Abbott thinks that the BBC Question Time programme discriminated against her because she is:a blackAbbott got a rough ride and the audience spent most of the time laughing at her or booing.Diane, listen. It’s not your skin colour. It’s not your gender.It’s something  altogether.We are used to politicians speaking down to us.And we are used to politicians being thick.But when both occur at the same time, that’s when the rest of us decide we’ve had enough.Stuff the BBC won’t tell you.Number One – The International Monetary Fund has admitted it got its projections wrong.The UK economy is not stagnating. Economic growth for the next year will be every bit as strong as in France and Germany.And meanwhile all the other indicators – investment, employment, growth in wages – are MUCH better than those in the European Union.Someone tell Huw Edwards.Yet again I’ve accepted a Facebook friend request from a woman without checkingshe’s a proper woman, rather than a porno sock-puppet.Sure enough, within the minute, I was invited to view intimate photographs of the lady.And she ended her invitation with the words: “Slap my frog, cowboy!”Why would I want to slap her frog  I hope her frog has a long and happy le. And why am I a cowboyTheres nothing funnier than slebs making idiots of themselves while politically grandstanding.Gary Lineker, for example, does it every week. His intellect is about as radiant as a candle flame in an aircraft hangar. But he still gives it large, ranting about Brexit. And praising Europe’s worst leader, France’s Emmanuel Macron.The latest slebs to fall foul are the Spice Girls. They posed for photos in “edgy”T-shirts reading: Gender Justice. Now it’s been revealed those shirts were made in a workshop by women who are paid p per hour.There’s gender justice for you.The memorial to Bomber Command in London’s Hyde Park has been defaced by scumbags.They threw paint over the sculpture – and also vandalised statues of Winston Churchill and US President Franklin D. Roosevelt.Our pilots in World War Two won a battle against all the odds to protect this country from fascism. More than , of them died doing so.The filth who vandalised the memorial know nothing of that. Nothing of personal sacrice, of hardship, of discipline.And they know nothing of history, full stop.What kind of people are we raising in this country So, huge congratulations to Ant McPartlin.The perpetually smirking Geordie munchkin won “best presenter” at the National Television Awards, despite not having been on television for a year.People have criticised the decision, but I’m all in favour.Andhe promises to stay off the screens for another  months, I’d give him next year’s award, tooDid you see the shots of the babes turning up for the National Television Awards I call them babes because it was minus ten or something out there. And they rolled up to stand on the red carpet outside in flimsy dresses slit from ankle to lady garden.

This would be a constitutional outrage.The proper, settled arrangements between the executive and legislature have worked well for centuries.If the House of Commons undermines our basic constitutional conventions then the executive is entitled to use other vestigial constitutional means to stop it. By which I basically mean prorogation.I hope it would not be necessary for the Queen’s stay at Sandringham to be interrupted for her in person to prorogue Parliament.We do not want that sort of constitutional crisis, we want to observe the constitutional norms.The Brexiteer again hinted that he could carry out a U-turn and back Mrs Mays dealshe ditches the hated Irish backstop plan.He said: There are outbreaks of realism all around I see.I’m sure common sense and practicality will now prevail. The backstop doesn’t work for unionists in the Tory party, or the DUP.The pretence that we might ever swallow it is now over. It’s long past time to get on and just do the feasible deal that has always been there to do.”But he denied becoming a soft touch, insisting: “As long as the backstop is there, I will not vote for this deal.Tory MP Nick Boles, who has sponsored the anti-No Deal amendment, accused him of a coup, adding: The only people blocking Brexit are those like Jacob Rees-Mogg who voted against a Brexit deal last week.A No source told The Sun that officials have already discussed the idea of proroguing Parliament - but quickly dismissed it.The source said: Its at the least plausible end of about  options weve talked about.A number of Brexiteers are worried thatthey dont end up backing the PMs deal, Remainers will succeed in keeping Britain in the EU.Today Ben Bradley told the BBC: I do feel and having spoken to colleagues in the DUP, and Brexiteer colleagues, thatshe gets that movement on the backstop she will get a majority.But EU envoy Michel Barnier said preparing for No Deal is now more important than ever.He urged MPs to decide what they want to happen, saying: To stop No Deal, a positive majority for another solution will need to emerge.It would be welcomed by big business - but Brexit voters would be unhappy because it would mean Britain accepting open borders, and following European rules without a say.HOW LIKELY   HARD AS NAILSMost of the Tory Brexiteers who oppose the PMs deal want her toto Brussels and strike a tougher line.But Eurocrats currently insist its impossible to re-open negotiations.HOW LIKELY   REFERENDUM RE-RUNDozens of MPs are hell-bent on forcing Mrs May to hold a second referendum so Britain can stay in the EU.Yet without the support of the Government its unlikely the second vote could become a reality.HOW LIKELY   DEAL OR NO DEAL If Mrs May cannot pass a deal, the legal default is that we will leave the EU without a deal on March .Despite the legal position, the majority of MPs insist they will take any measure necessary to rule out No Deal.HOW LIKELY   MAY TRIUMPHS - EVENTUALLYCabinet ministers remain adamant that a version of Theresa Mays plan will eventually pass the Commons, even after losing last week.They believe sceptical MPs will lose their nerve as Brexit Day approaches - terried of either No Deal or a second referendum.HOW LIKELY   We have to give this brief period of time to the UK Parliament, to the UK Government, to have this debate and to take their decision.A new poll provided hope for Mrs May, suggesting that her deal is the most acceptable outcome for most Brits.Nearly half of voters said they could accept the deal, with only  per cent disagreeing, according to Number Cruncher Politics.But Boris Johnson appeared to strike a softer approach as he signalled he could back the dealthe PM secured the power to quit the backstop unilaterally.No is hoping the threat of the so-called ‘Cooper-Boles amendment will persuade Brexit rebels to back the PM’s deal.Leading Cabinet Brexiteer Liam Fox warned Tory rebels that the Remainer amendment was a “real danger” to Brexit because “what they really mean is not having Brexit at all”.He urged Tory MPs to “swallow” their pride and back the PM’s deal or risk losing Brexit altogether.The chances of the ‘Cooper-Boles’ amendment succeeding were given a major boost last night after Jeremy Corbyn was preparing to formally back it.Sources said Yvette Cooper had agreed to shorten the ‘delay’ to Brexit from nine months to three months in a bid to win more support from Labour and Tory backbenchers.The amendment to Mrs May’s Plan B is expected to be voted on next Tuesday. The plan calls on the PM to agree a deal by February  or extend Article  – effectively ruling out a No Deal.Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd warned No. last week that dozens of Ministers want to back it.Hardcore Remainer Lord Adonis said Mr Rees-Mogg’s plan was “appallingly reactionary” and pointed out that the last time a monarch vetoed a bill was Queen Anne in .A string of British business leaders including the bosses of JML and Wetherspoon, penned a letter to the Prime Minister urging her to pursue a managed No Deal Brexit.The letter said: “The Government’s deal is not in the best interests of business, nor is it the only option.

It is hard-nosed realism.Signicantly, it bears the ­signature of Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Angela Merkel’s chosen successor as Germany’s next Chancellor.Her appeal can be seen as a rebuke to Mrs Merkel, who rejected David Cameron’s plea for help to curb immigration, tipping ­Britain towards Brexit.Brits might have chosen dferentlyshe had responded to voters’ dismay not just in Britain but across the EU.She later signed her own political death warrant by flinging open Europe’s borders to a million Syrian migrants.But voters’ resentment towards arrogant EU leaders — recorded by their own Eurostat polling system — long predates immigration.Embattled French President Emmanuel Macron recently admitted he had dared not offer his voters a “Frexit”  ­referendum — because they would leave in a flash.Weeks later, his fears were confirmed as “yellow-vest” anarchists set Paris ablaze.French observers believe the gilets jaunes riots have their origins in another referendum crisis.In , France voted overwhelmingly against the European Constitution — only to see it renamed the Lisbon Treaty and slyly introduced against their express wishes.The European Constitution, like the disastrous euro, was a crucial but unpopular step towards a federal European superstate.Ireland and ­Denmark have also voted down EU moves to ever-closer union.They were told to vote again until they said Yes.Brussels’ arrogant contempt for ordinary voters — dismissed by one French president as “scum” — is what politicians blithely describe as the “democratic deficit”.It sowed the seeds for Brexit. Immigration simply brought it to a head.Germany’s letter to The Times reads like a plea from a deserted lover.“Without your great nation, this continent would not be what it is today — a community defined by freedom and ­prosperity,” writes Germany’s next Chancellor.“Should Britain wish to leave the European Union for good, it will always have friends in Germany and Europe.”This is precisely what British voters hoped for as they ­teetered on the brink of Remain but opted to Leave.They wanted a civilised orce between economic and diplomatic allies.This is still possiblethe border issue can be resolved.If we can persuade the IRA to decommission deadly weapons, surely we can decommission a backstop that nobody wants Theresa May’s rejected deal is not a total failure.

Government loyalist Andrew Murrison tabled an amendment to Theresa Mays Withdrawal Bill to set an expiry date on the Northern Ireland backstop.   The amendment was not chosen by the Speaker and the PMs deal was rejected by  votes.On Monday Theresa May ed to the Commons to put forward her plan B - which involves minor tweaks to her first plan.MPs are now putting forward amendments to try and seize control of the process.Mr Murrison believes his amendment, which imposes a time-limit on the backstop, could help Mrs May get her deal through the Commons by appealing to moderate MPs who just want Brexit sorted. But Mr Barnier has insisted there can be no time limit on the backstop.He told them: The backstop is like an insurance. It is not there to be used. Andso, only provisionally. However, we cannot tie the backstop to a time limit.   Asked why not, he told journalists: Imagineyour home’s insurance was limited to five years and you’d have a problem after six years... Thats dficult to justy, he replied. Its similar with the backstop. That is why it is tied to an event: as soon as there is an agreement between the EU and the UK that makes an internal border unnecessary, it will be obsolete. Let me remind you that we have negotiated the elements of the backstop with the British government and have integrated their wishes into it. On Tuesday the EU insisted that a no deal Brexit would mean a hard border on the island of Ireland.At a press conference the chief spokesman for European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, said it was “pretty obvious” border infrastructure would be necessarythere was no agreement.   But on Wednesday they backtracked. The same spokesman said: The EU is determined to do all it can - deal or no deal- to avoid a hard border in Ireland. Meanwhile the chief commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commissionsaid the Withdrawal Agreement reached between the UK and the EU left signicant gaps in the protection of human rights. Emily Logan said: I dont think the public understand that the implications... people might find themselves in a situation of being forced to assume an identy they wouldnt choose. Ms Logan said the offer of continued EU citizenship should be extended to all the people of NorthernIreland as defined by the Good Friday Agreement, given recognition of the birthright of people in NorthernIrelandto identy as Irish or British, or both. The last situation we wish to see is one where the people of NorthernIrelandfeel forced to choose their identity based on what they think their post-Brexit entitlements might be, she said.

Just % of steel, valued at poundmillion, used in government projects can be traced to firms based here, according to a UK Steel analysis of Government stats. Some %, worth poundmillion, was sourced from outside the UK. Experts were unable to say where the other %, worth poundmillion, came from.  A bombshell breakdown for   shows that while Whitehall departments bought some British steel, they also imported metals from overseas - including when they could have opted to buy British.Campaigning Labour MP Stephen Doughty said: “It is a national disgrace that despite repeated promises to buy quality British-made steel, not even half being used in key projects is home produced.”Highways England bought just a fth of the steel needed for smart motorway technology signposts on the M from UK suppliers - despite admitting it was all available from British producers. Only pound, of the pound, budget went to UK firms. It said: “% of requirement can be produced in UK. pound,was produced in UK.”  The Education and Skills Funding Agency, part of the Department for Education, bought % of the rebar needed for school buildings from UK manufacturers - even though all of it needed for the pound, contract could have been sourced in Britain.  It admitted: “% of requirement can be produced in UK. Value from UK producers not currently recorded, % was from UK suppliers.” The Ministry of Defence spent poundmillion on French steel for its new Dreadnought-class nuclear-armed submarines.  Some , tonnes of steel worth pound.million was supplied from Belgium for a Royal Navy Astute-class hunter-killer submarine. And pound.million of steel - , tonnes - including some from Sweden, was bought for Royal Navy Type  frigates. The MoD said “Not all of the required specications for Type  steel are manufactured in the UK. Thin plate steel is sourced from overseas .” For the Astute sub, it added: “This grade of steel is only available from France, due to its specialist nature.”  However, British firms have repeatedly insisted thatthey are given enough time, they could produce specialist products. Network Rail bought , tonns of steel, mainly from Austria and Spain, for two “niche projects”, together worth almost pound,million. It claimed “technical specications” were required. But Mr Doughty added: “Whether it’s roads, rail or our national defence the Tory Government is letting down the nation and betraying our steelworkers by a failure to buy British.”  Paul McBean, , a steelworker at Scunthorpe for  years, said: “We’ve had a rough few years in the industry, and steelworkers have all done their bit to help keep things afloat. “Government ministers keep saying they support British steel making, but they’ve got to put their money where their mouth it. “Publishing this information is helpful, butthey’re serious about helping our industry survive and thrive then the Government will have to do an awful lot better when it comes to buying British steel.” The figures were set out in a -page document called ‘Steel Public Procurement: Compliance with the steel procurement guidance’ published by the Department for business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Community steelworkers’ union general secretary Roy Rickhuss said: “Getting procurement policy right is crucial to developing an industrial strategy that supports UK steelmaking, and government should be leading the way.  “British steelworkers are the best in the world but we’ve always said we need to make public procurement policy work for our home industries just like they do in other countries.” The “data means we can hold government to account”, he said, adding: “There is much room for improvement.” Labour MP Stephen Kinnock accused the Government of “failing to lend support” to the fragile British steel sector. Mr Kinnock, whose constituency includes Britain’s biggest steelworks, Port Talbot, said: “The steel industry is the industrial backbone of the United Kingdom.  Mr Kinnock added: “It’s a huge betrayal to steel communities like mine in Aberavon that the UK Government are procuring less than % of their steel from British steelworks. “The fact is that this is a betrayal of British steelworkers and of their families and communities. “These decisions are made in Westminster and the Government should be putting its money where its mouth is. “There is, of course, an alternative. The Labour Party’s Build it in Britain campaign will use a mix of public procurement and a new National Investment Bank to boost manufacturing across the country, contrasting greatly with the Tories’ abject failure to back British business.” UK Steel director Gareth Stace welcomed “important and positive steps” from the Government, including publishing the data.

Jeremy Corbyn cherry picked the best questions put by his backbenchers and put them again to the Prime Minister. They were all reasonable issues to raise with Mrs May but they lacked any sense of originality. So for the second time he asked why she would not rule out a no deal. And for the second time he askedher mind was closed to a customs union.  Mrs May kindly colluded with the Labour leader by giving the exact same responses as she delivered three days earlier. Like her opposite number, she also lacked spontaneity and crowdsourced her answers from observations on Twitter. She pointed out, with a mock sense of hurt, that Mr Corbyn had been willing to talk to Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRA but was unwilling to meet with her. Mr Corbyn responded by borrowing Hilary Benn’s observation that the PM’s door may be open but the “mind was closed.” Mrs May then chose the curious tactic of following her renewed invitation to the Labour leader for talks by insulting him over his knowledge of Brexit. “I don’t think he knows what these phrases mean or what these phrases are,” she said. Mr Corbyn was on stronger ground by noting that Labour’s plan to stay in the customs union was backed by both the TUC and the CBI.  He perhaps missed an opportunity by not raising the exodus from the UK by countries such as Dyson and Sony. Brexit Kremlinologists will have noted that Mrs May did not rule out membership of a customs union in answer to Corbyn’s questions. But as whole this PMQs did not take us much further forward other to remind viewers that both leaders are wedded to intransigence. It took questions from Labours Sarah Jones on Grenfell and John Mann on mental health to remind you that Prime Ministers questions is not a completely wasteful exercise.

In fact, the average adult has less than four hours a day where they feel full of energy.   A bad night’s sleep is most likely to leave Brits feeling anything less than tip top, along with stress, going to bed too late and having an early wake up call. A bad or busy day at work, a poor diet and an argument with someone are also among the most common reasons for having days where they feel a little lousy. Worryingly,  per cent even said they have fallen out with someone as a result of not feeling completely perfect, with many respondents admitting to being snappier than usual when they are tired. Researchers also found  per cent of those polled, via OnePoll, have pulled a sickie at work because they didn’t feel in the mood to go in, and almost one in five have pretended to have an appointment to get out of having to go in first thing.   More than half have even cancelled a night out with friends because they didn’t feel up to it and  per cent have pulled out of a date. A spokesman for Vitabiotics Wellman and Wellwoman added: “It is worrying that so few Brits feel genuinely in tip-top physical condition and it goes to show how important a good diet and plenty of sleep is for the demands of today’s modern lestyle. For those wanting to stay on top, Wellman and Wellwoman provides micronutrient support with over  vitamins and minerals, plus more. “If you are having one of those days, Wellman and Wellwoman Energy is the ideal addition to tablets when you want an extra boost of energy releasing vitamins. Both make a great tasting refreshing drink with vitamins B and B, magnesium and iron which contribute to normal energy release and the reduction of tiredness and fatigue.” Top  things which cause Brits to feel less than tip top:A bad night’s sleep Stress Going to bed late the night before Having to wake up early A bad day at work A bad diet An argument with their partner Not getting in their usual amount of exercise A hefty workload Drinking too much"},{"url":null,"title":"burglar claimed moved home after","story":"NewsBurglar claimed he moved into home after popstar Cheryl donated it to himAndrew Coates, , appeared on several hours of CCTV footage with a rucksack and sleeping bag inside the Devon home of Alison Piper, a jury heardShareByStuart AbelAbigail OLeary:,  JAN NewsAppearing at Plymouth Crown Court, Coates denied burgling the property in March last year \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn alleged burglar caught inside a house claimed he had moved into the property after it was donated to him by popstar Cheryl, a court heard.

Adrian Chaplin, opening the case for the Crown Prosecution Service, said Coates was arrested after the residents ed to their home in the morning.

Mrs Piper told the jury that she ed home moments before her husband in separate cars at am the next morning. She added that she asked the defendant who he was but he replied by asking her the same question. She said: “He made me feel very uncomfortable ashe resented my presence there. He made me feel asI was intruding. “He took a step towards me and he stared at me very aggressively and assertively.” Barry White, for Coates, asked her what she thought of the suggestion that she had sold the house to Cheryl Tweedy.

Carl McConville, from Newcastle, was diagnosed with lung disease at the age of , with doctors telling his mum Lyn he may only live to see one more Christmas. But, Lyn, , said her little fighter of a son defied all the odds to reach his st birthday. Carls condition is now dramatically deteriorating and a lung transplant could save his le, reports Chronicle Live. But mum Lyn says NHS Blood and Transplant have been unable to put him on the list while the type of lung disease he has remains a mystery. Now his family are determined to make the most of their time with Carl and grant his final two wishes - to go on a cruise and to take Carl to an away match to watch his beloved Newcastle United.   Speaking about Carls diagnosis as a child, Lyn described how the original signs something was wrong was his persistent cough. She said: It was more in winter than in summer, he would just have this cough. He got put on steroids at one point which helped him at the time, but then it started all over again. Carl was checked for asthma at , which was when doctors discovered he had a far more serious lung condition. Lyn said: It was around Christmas time we found out. We cant forget that day - December .   They said take him home and enjoy Christmas because we dont know how long hes got left to live. Initially we were told he wouldnt make it to his th birthday without a transplant. But hes just turned  - I call him my little fighter. Lyn says the type of disease is still a mystery, and Carl is the only person in the world with his particular condition. She said: Hes just not breathing properly and hes now had to go on -hour oxygen. Hes been in hospital now for just over a week.   His doctor says he needs a double lung transplant but he cant go on the list yet because we dont know what disease hes got or why hes got it. Its just a catch- at the minute, we cant do anything. Its infuriating but Carls doing okay - he always just gets on with it. Family friend Emma Stockman-Brown has started to fundraise to make Carls two wishes come true. Emma said: When he got put on oxygen I thought the time was right to go ahead with it and let him do what he wants to do.   He wants to go on a cruise but with his condition we dont know how far theyll let him travel, so we were thinking just a little cruise to Paris or something - I think he wants to go on the boat more than anything. And he wants to go to see Newcastle United play away - he goes to see them all the time but hes not been to an away match. Emma is hoping to organise a fundraising event in April or May for Carl, and has set up an online crowdfunding page in the meantime. To help with the appeal visit the JustGiving page here .

Jason Hogan, a colourist at Josh Wood Atelier, said the mum-to-bes signature messy bun might be the perfect style for concealment. He explained that hairstyle can also exaggerate any ares of silver hair.   Ladies with curly and wavy hair usually get away with roots for longer than straight-haired counterparts, he told the Mail Online. For up-dos think French braids and loose plaits these mix all the colours in the hair, show dimension and can work wonders. Anything too flat, sleek or pulled off the face severely is a no go. The hair expert also said that for expecting clients he opts to keep the hair dimensional and multi tonal.

Kelley Robinson, , put on eight stone - weighing st at a size  - after giving birth to her son Kylo. She began to feel her knees buckling under the pressure of her enormous frame and even started taking diet pills. But she found that combined with working out, she could actually control her calorie intake much more effectively with the microwave meals. She now weighs a healthy st for her ft frame and is a comfy dress size , Cornwall Live reports.  Her chest and cup size also slimmed down - from a F to a more proportionate E. Kelley said: The ready meals made it so easy for me to keep track of exactly what I was consuming calorie wise. They were quick and easy too. It may not sound healthy but I chose low cal ones and it really helped me get started on my weight loss journey. It has got to the point now where people dont actually recognise me on the street. An old friend of mine did a double take the other day when I said hi as she didnt notice it was me at all. My whole outlook on le is dferent. Before all I did was sit about on the sofa and order takeaways whereas now Im super active and have tonnes of energy all the time.  Kelleywas a size  before having Kylo, now three, but after he was born she developed unhealthy eating habits. She typically had white toast for breakfast, followed by sandwich and crisps for lunch, a takeaway for dinner, while snacking on more crisps, fizzy drinks and chocolate. She piled on eight stone, but soon got fed up, and when she got desperate she tried diet pills. They were dreadful, I had no energy and couldnt stop pooing the whole time, she admitted. It was around this time that her fitness fanatic fianceacute, Ryan Lake, stepped in to help. She said: Ryan was amazing, he could see how depressed I was and just gently took control but by coaxing me to the gym. Id never have had the confidence to do it without him. At first I found it so hard, I wanted to give up, I really hated it but I kept at it and with the changes in my diet too I found that I was actually losing weight! She also started eating ready meals, which were typically between  and  calories a meal. Her favourites were Morrison’s Chicken Tikka Masala, Beef Hot Pots or Macaroni, and she started eating Weetabix and fruit for breakfast, with wraps for lunch. The new mum stopped snacking between meals and started swapping sweet drinks for water.  In the first three months of her new regime she lost a whopping three stone. Kelleysaid: It was after that when I got really strict with myself because I realised that I actually I could do it. I cut out carbs, dairy and even quit the ready meals eventually. In a year Kelley had lost NINE stone. She admitted: Im such a gym bunny now its unreal I go whenever I have a second and absolutely love it. I even get up super early before the kids wake up to go and workout for an hour. I go at least six times a week and make sure to do a mix of cardio and weights. Doing the weights have meant that the saggy skin has really toned up, which is one thing I was worried about losing quite so much. Dedicated Kelley, who is also mother to -year-old Tamzin, has noticed far more than just weight loss benefits from her new regime. Her knees are no longer a problem and her down days are well behind her. The mum-of-two said: I was quite low before as I felt so under-confident but these days I really do feel like a new person. One thing I know is that I couldnt have done it without the support of my amazing family, especially Ryan, who loved me whatever size I was but always wanted the best for me.

Shaun Dobinson, , died of complications due to untreated diabetes, an inquest heard. The electrical engineer had been looking forward to a trip to New York with his childhood pal, Matthew Folley.The pair had been planning to do some sightseeing after arriving in the city on May , , senior coroner Derek Winter said. But Shauns condition took a dramatic turn for the worse after he began vomiting in his room and telling his mum Julie he was scared for his le, Chronicle Live reported. Sunderland Coroners Court heard how GP Dr Nadu Bhatt had discovered Shaun was diabetic on May , and on May  had referred him for an urgent specialist appointment.   Dr Bhatt denied knowing Shaun planned to travel to New York but Shauns sister, Kirsty Dobinson, claimed the doctor had been told of the trip but hadnt warned Shaun not to go. He should have been seen within two weeks of his diagnosis but instead was offered an appointment on June  - a date which his doctor agreed was unacceptable. An expert said Shaun needed to receive formal diagnosis and start insulin treatment quickly.  But Dobson left for the US without specialist assessment and a vital prescription for metformin - used to treat Type  diabetes. Mr Folley gave emotional evidence as to how his best friends health had deteriorated during the trip and how Shaun had made light of his new diabetes diagnosis. Matthew said: I think he didnt know how serious it could be. He was worried it would harm his chances of getting into the RAF in the long-term, but at the time he just kept making a joke of it. Matthew noted how Shaun started drinking a lot of water and then began to feel more and more ill.   On Monday, May , the pair visited the Chrysler Building, but by the Tuesday, Shaun was vomiting in his room, the inquest heard. On the Tuesday night, a doctor was called to the pairs Manhattan hotel. The US doctor - who has not yet been identied - told Shaun he was suffering from dehydration and suggested he take over-the-counter medication. In a statement read by the coroner, Ms Dobinson told how Shaun had called his mum at am on the Tuesday, telling her he was scared and wanted to come home.  He later sent her a message saying I love you and miss you so much. In a WhatsApp call on Thursday, June , Ms Dobinson said Shaun had seemed disorientated and had dficulty speaking. And the next time Julie called, the phone was answered by a police officer - who told her emergency services had arrived and were taking Shaun urgently to hospital. She said: I had arranged a flight to New York on Friday at am.Just prior to the flight I received a call to tell me that Shaun had taken a turn for the worse. I askedthey could keep him alive until I could see him. On arrival I was brought to the front of the plane, and informed that Shaun had passed away. The inquest is expected to conclude on Thursday.

Lauren Pinhorne was confronted by investigators after flowers addressed to her were found among dumped rubbish. Officials claimed she had tossed a plastic bag containing the flowers and an old diary down at the side of a road. The -year-old vehemently protested her innocence but Test Valley Borough Council instigated an  month legal process. However, it took jurors at Winchester Crown Court just  minutes to clear Mrs Pinhorne of fly tipping after a day and a half long trial.   Mrs Pinhorne, who was granted legal aid for the case, said the council had spent at least pound, taking her to court, adding she hoped they would learn a lesson and stop wasting taxpayers money. But a spokeswoman for the council claimed they had carried out a thorough investigation, adding it is important to prosecute people they believe have been fly tipping. Winchester Crown Court, Hants, heard a bag containing flowers addressed to Mrs Pinhorne and an old  diary of hers were found on February , last year. Mrs Pinhorne said she believed the flowers could have been a Valentines Day gt from a former boyfriend, while the diary had gone missing from her home months earlier. Despite telling investigators she knew nothing about the dumping of either of the items in Andover, Hants, they refused to believe her.   Speaking after the court case, she said: I knew I had not done this, I clearly told them I had lost the diary but I was threatened with being arrested. Everything I have said has been true, so I brought it to crown court because it felt like I was being set up. None of the rubbish there was mine, I hadnt dumped it, and they went for me anyway. I have been spoken to really rudely, I actually had to request one of the investigators stop contacting me because of they way he spoke to me. Because they found my old diary, my personal le has been dragged through the court as well - diary entries about personal things were read out. That diary, which had my name inside it, went missing from my home months before it was found. The flowers they found with the diary were in a yellow carrier bag and there was an envelope with my name on in there as well.  They must have been a Valentines Day present, possibly from a former boyfriend, but I never received them. I am very pleased to have won, but the council have just spent at least pound, on the cost of bringing this case. They will now have to pay my costs as well so I would estimate it could go up to pound, - thats taxpayers money. I hope the council learns a lesson from this, this was a waste of taxpayers money. Mrs Pinhorne, of Picket Piece near Andover, denied one count of fly tipping. A spokeswoman for Test Valley Borough Council said: We took this to court following a thorough and comprehensive investigation and external counsel advice confirming that there was a case to answer. Although we are naturally disappointed with the result we, of course, respect the courts decision.  We are extremely proud of our record in tackling fly-tipping having been successful in securing a prosecution in  out of  cases since the start of . The cost to the taxpayer of clearing up fly-tips and impact on communities is signicant. That is why it is important the council continues to seek to prosecute those we believe have fly-tipped in order to discourage people from illegally dumping their waste in our beautul borough.

Scotland Yard continues to tackle the horric kne crime epidemic which plagued London, and other large cities, in . And in just two weeks, the force has seized a shocking number of weapons - including a machete and a hunting kne. It has tweeted almost  pictures of the confiscated knives, used in robberies, left in bushes and gathered in stop and searches. One terrying image, shared by the politan Police, shows a crook’s attempt to conceal a razor-sharp kne in a plastic shopping bag. Officers also discovered a discarded weapon lying by a walkway on an estate in Tottenham, north London.  Meanwhile, a machete, at least  inches long, was recovered following a moped chase in Catford, southeast London. Other large blades were seized from children as young as  over a two-week period. In one incident in Camden, north London, three knives were taken from the same thug after he decided to use a meat cleaver as a weapon.  And a sickening picture tweeted by police in Islington shows a -inch sword a suspect was allegedly carrying along with several bags of cannabis. Affluent areas like Notting Hill and Highgate - home to celebrities including Kate Moss and Jude Law - arent free from those who choose to carry blades either. One was unearthed on a Highgate street, while officers attending a disturbance in upper-class Notting Hill allegedly took a kitchen kne, baseball bat and a rolling pin from a group of three men.  And according to Kensington and Cha Police’s Twitter account, a Batman-shaped knuckle duster was discovered on an estate during a stop and search for driving offences. Last year was one of the worst in recent years for murders in London. Figures show the number of people killed hit a -year high with more than a fth of victims teenagers or children. The  homicides recorded by the politan Police included  where the victims were aged  or under. Of those,  were stabbed, five were shot and one woman was killed by a head injury. It was London’s highest homicide total since , which saw  people killed, and a  per cent rise year-on-year. politan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick had recently named street violence as her number one priority and acknowledged that  was challenging.  Kne crime campaigners have welcomed the ongoing work to remove weapons and praised police for putting the images on their Twitter accounts. Patrick Green, of the charity Ben Kinsella Trust, said: It’s really important to take knives off the streets. Some of the work the politan Police have been doing extends beyond stop and search - we know that they are now doing sweeps of parks and public areas. That’s really an important piece of work for us because we know that habitual kne carriers who are fearful of being stopped will place knives in locations so they can go to that location and retrieve them so the work being done by the police there is really welcomed. We have also seen that they are doing a lot of those searches in conjunction with members of the public or community groups so there is a sense of helping other members of the community support to them in their work.  That’s good because local people have a lot of intelligence about where things might be hidden. Targeted use of stop and search done in an intelligence led way we are happy with - it’s an important police tactic. We are really pleased to see the police take a proactive stance however as good as the measures the police take are, they will not on their own solve the kne crime problem. Part of the issue we have got to address is the step before someone carries a kne. Preventative work and early intervention is as important as everything the police do. Dr Mark Prince runs the The Kiyan Prince Foundation, which works with young people to end violence. His son Kiyan, , was stabbed to death on May , , receiving a single lethal kne wound as he intervened to stop the bullying of another teen.   Dr Prince said: Work like this does make a dference because every area has to be responsible for the part that they play and for enforcing the law. You could have been on the way to using that kne and because you’ve been caught you’ve saved a le, so there is sense behind the enforcement and we need that.

A survey polling , adults revealed we splurge thousands of pounds each year – on things which mostly go untouched – including food, beauty products and phone contracts. During a typical year, we’ll blow pound, on food and drinks - including takeaway meals, bottled water or items left in the fridge or cupboards. We’ll also spend pound on clothes which remain in the wardrobe untouched over the same period – pound will go on unused beauty products and pound on toiletries.   And on top of that pound will be wasted on TV packages they rarely or never watch, while pound will go on unused mobile phone credit. Commissioned by Lottoland, the research found one fth admit they tend to buy things and never use them again.

Further to this, a fth revealed their spending habits have caused arguments between them and their partner.   The Lottoland research carried out through OnePoll found we also tend to waste pound on CDs, DVDs and vinyl - perhaps due to the advent of smaller, more portable devices and streaming software. Entertainment-centric Brits said they spend approximately pound on gaming a year – buying the latest computer games or consoles. The research also found they will splash out on events over the year, with pound going towards having fun at gigs, concerts, shows and festivals.

Hannah Taylor grew up with “scary” stories about childbirth from her own mum and wanted a serene experience for her son Koa. The -year-old yoga teacher decided the best option for her and her son - now aged three months - was a freebirth without a medical attendant or professional present. Hannah and her partner Tyler Couchman welcomed lb oz baby Koa in an outdoor bath with no-one telling her to push, describing it as an incredible, blissful, experience. Just Tyler and best friend Shea Zamarra were in attendance. Hannah, from the US city of Sacramento, Calornia, said: “My mum had traumatic births with me and my sister and it didn’t sit well with me. “Growing up I had only heard scary stories of birth and when I heard about my friend’s experience with unassisted birth. It felt right to me.  “A unassisted birth is one without medical intervention. You give birth unhindered and without medical interference.“No one telling you when to push, you just completely listen to your own body. “During my pregnancy I did a lot of research and I read a lot of books. I listened to podcasts focused on women and their unassisted birthing stories.  She added: “I went into labour in early morning at about am on October  and my active contractions started around .am. “I was just home with my partner and my best friend Shea. I hadn’t planned to move to the outside to the tub, I just wanted to use it as somewhere to take a break during labour. “I was on the floor of my room when I decided to move outside to the tub. It is connected to the warm water mains from our house.  “It was an incredible, blissful, experience and I was ecstatic. Meeting my little boy for the first time was incredible.” Hannah and her sister, Jessica Taylor, were born by Caesarean section which left her keen to explore other options during her own pregnancy. Unassisted birth is the process of having a baby without the presence of a medical attendant or professional, which Hannah believed was the best option for her family. Hannahs partner Tyler, , a chef, added: So far it was the most amazing experience of my le. I had never heard of free birth before, but catching my son in my arms was the most amazing thing. Holding him brought tears to my eyes. It felt like a dream.  While Hannah’s birth was unassisted, the mum did attend regular prenatal appointments with a midwe to make sure her pregnancy was healthy. Hannah said she would have rethought her plans had there been a health issue or potential danger for Koa. She said: “I had a healthy pregnancy and I visited a midwe all along. I had prenatal care. “There was no sign that anything was wrong, andthere had been I would have had to think about changing my plan.  “Depending on the severity I would have had to consider a hospital birth in that case. But I really made sure I had done a lot of research. Hannah has described her first three months as a mom to be “blissful” and she will always feel blessed to have had such a serene birthing experience. Tyler said the couple feel lucky that their friend was there to capture the moment on camera.  He added: Its really special that we have those pictures. They captured the moment so perfectly. Hannah said: “The sun was out and it was beautul. I felt extremely powerful. “A few days afterwards he was checked out and everything was great. “I think all people should follow their hearts. I did what I thought was the best thing for my baby. “An unhindered birth allowed the experience to be sacred and it was incredible. I have never felt so connected to my body. I felt very blessed. “He’s so wonderful. I underestimated my capacity for love.” "},{"url":null,"title":"student phones bomb hoax parents","story":"NewsStudent phones in bomb hoax on parents easyJet flight to stop them visiting himThe -year-old student was arrested after he made a bomb threat against flight EZY, travelling from Lyon to Rennes in FranceShareCommentsByNeil Murphy:,  JAN NewsThe man didnt want his parents to join him in Rennes \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn easyJet flight was was forced to make an emergency landing after a bomb hoax was called in by a man who didnt want his parents to visit.

For him, the bottom line is Dundee should have been better than this.“It was very frustrating on Saturday. I think our performance first half, we should be thankful we are still in the cup really,” he said.“It wasn’t good enough. They’ve got the goal to go ahead and then Jesse has done brilliantly just before half-time to get it back and have us level.“It was a good time for us to score and then we did definitely play better in the second half. On the whole, though, it was not good enough.“I suppose it does happen in the cup, we saw that with some of the other results, and the big thing is we are still in there and have a replay where we can make it into the next round.“So we maybe shouldn’t be too hard on ourselves over it but we’re still not happy with the performance.”Like most players after a bad game, now the -year-old just wants to get out on a pitch again and try to put things right.That’s why he breathed a sigh of relief on Sunday when Hearts’ televised clash with Livingston produced a result.Had the Jambos not edged past the Lions, a replay would have been tonight and Dundee’s Premiership visit to Tynecastle would have been postponed.“We have another game right away and that’s good. The one thing we didn’t want was no game this week because Hearts had drawn their cup-tie.“The thing you want to do after the winter break is get back into playing regularly again right away and you don’t want to be missing games because of things like that. You want to get points on the board as soon as possible.”Turning to the subject of the new arrivals, Ralph believes they will signicantly boost the chances of top-flight survival.So far, he’s been impressed by what he’s seen.He added: “I thought the new lads looked sharp and direct. They definitely want to get on the ball, create and make things happen.“I think them coming in this month will be good for the squad and they are going to help us going forward.”"},{"url":null,"title":"one in and one out for dundee united as goalkeeper signs from hibs","story":"Dundee United have signed goalkeeper Ross Laidlaw on loan from Hibs as Matej Rakovan departs the club.The Tangerines have sealed a loan deal until the end of the season for the -year-old after releasing Slovakian goalie Rakovan with  months remaining on his contract.Laidlaw has played  times for the Hibees, winning the Championship in  in the process, and will challenge with Benjamin Siegrist for the gloves at Tannadice.Manager Robbie Neilson said: “Ross joins us to compete for the first-team goalkeeping position.#He brings important experience having won this championship with Hibs and most importantly is an excellent goalkeeper.#I have been looking to improve the competition within the goalkeeping set-up, and I am happy to see Ross here.“Rakovan played  times for the Tangerines, keeping one clean sheet."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c4852446f53b2.11606850.jpg ","title":"plans to serve dundee angus and perthshire pupils frozen school dinners instead of fresh meals","story":"Tayside schoolchildren could soon be eating frozen school dinners instead of fresh meals prepared in city schools.The council is proposing to change its school meal provision from cooking on site to cooking them at a central hub and distributing them to schools.Dundee, Angus and Perth and Kinross councils are considering the proposals, with the cuisine centre in Dundee set to undergo a multi-million-pound transformationplans are approved.Dundee City Council would contribute £, towards the refurbished centre, while Tayside Contracts would be approved to borrow up to £. million from the council’s prudential loans fund to fund the work.If agreed, the move would result in the loss of  posts across the city’s schools, although it is anticipated the centralised facility would create a total of  jobs.Tayside Contracts, which handles the distribution of school meals in the region, said it would not enforce compulsory redundancies.Stuart Fairweather of Unite the Union, which represents some affected workers, said: “There will be concern among staff that any redundancies relating to the changes are not voluntary.“More broadly there will be thoughts on the implications of the changes to the service.“We want well-supported staff with the resources to provide quality meals.

The meals are made in  production kitchens and transported to  schools.Children and families committee convener Stewart Hunter said: “If it is delivered effectively then the evidence from other areas where this system is used is that just as many pupils and service users take the meals as before the change.”"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish government secretary visits dundee for new benefits system roll out","story":"Parents at Quarry View Nursery were visited by the Cabinet Secretary for Social Security yesterday as a new benefits system gets set to be rolled out.Shirley-Ann Somerville was in Dundee to discuss the new School Age Payment which, as part of the Best Start Grant, will see families receive £ to help cover the costs of starting school.

It gave everyone with a liking for the Tangerines a lt.So, too, did a dramatic shrinking of the seven-point gap at the top of the Championship courtesy of Neilson’s team taking four points from consecutive home games, while top two Ross County and Ayr United each lost two in a row.That means, for a few hours at least, United can join leaders County on the -point markthey win the second tier’s game of the weekend at Ayr on Friday night.They would, of course, still trail the Staggies, who have a vastly superior goal dference, but just being up there would be another boost.A win would also cancel out the game in hand Ayr hold over United, though they too have a better goal dference. And whatever happens at Somerset Park, Ian McCall’s team will be above themthey beat Inverness next midweek.Perhaps, though, the biggest benefit to United this weekend can be the type of performance that, whatever the points, makes a statement that they’re the ones to beat. That, unfortunately, is something they’ve largely failed to do in three seasons down in the Championship.Past glories, some of them recent, mean United start every campaign as favourites for promotion.And any team walking into Tannadice on a Saturday sees a club geared for football in the Premiership.Too often, however, any edge that’s given United has disappeared because of performances.Even when they’ve lost, in the last two-and-a-half years sides have come out of games against them feeling reputation and expectation have not matched the sum of the parts of the team they’ve faced.Results like two defeats away to Dumbarton the season before last, a - loss at Falkirk last term and two five-goal home losses in this campaign, have led to opposition throughout the ision believing they always have a chance when facing United.In truth, even the draw with Partick Thistle this month and the win over Dunfermline that closed the gap at the top to those three points, were not as convincing as was expected.That’s repeatedly been the case during the two failed attempts to get up. In the big games, too often United have come up short.They did beat Hibs at Tannadice near the end of  but lost heavily to them soon after and quickly dropped off the pace at the top.Andthey won twice at Tannadice against last season’s table toppers St Mirren, the first time came before the Buddies were regarded as their main rivals and the second after Jack Ross’s team were out of sight at the top.This time round, the best so far came up in Dingwall in November when County were beaten -.Without taking anything away from that success, after Paul Watson’s early goal put them ahead, the three points were secured via a gritty rearguard action.Yes, it was the kind of performance that is needed at times in a successful league campaign.So, too, do emphatic victories that tell the rest of the league you are a team to be feared. There would be no better time for such a statement than Friday in Ayrshire."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c485284ee4237.76769834.jpg ","title":"unemployment on rise in dundee","story":"The unemployment rate in Dundee has risen slightly year-on-year, according to the latest UK Government statistics.The Department for Work and Pensionshas published new figures covering those who claim out-of-work benefits that it says better represents the city’s workforce.Under the new “alternative claimant count” produced by the DWP, .% of the city’s eligible workforce – or , people – aged - are not currently employed.The figure, for November last year, is a slight rise on  when .% of the city’s workforce was out of work.However, youth unemployment – covering - year-olds – has fallen by % in the last year and by more than a third since .Ministers claim the new figure is a more accurate measure of local labour markets.Under the old system, the proportion of those claiming out-of-work benefits was .% in November , rather than what the government now says is the more accurate figure of .%.The claimant count covers people claiming Jobseeker’s Allowanceand those required to look for work while on the new-style Universal Credit benefit, rolled out in Dundee in November .Jane McEwen, employment and partnership manager at the Dundee City Jobcentre, said she and her team were continuing to introduce initiatives to help those who can work find jobs.She said: “We are working with Sinclair Wellbeing to deliver an employability provision for customers that includes increasing motivation and confidence.“This employability course will also focus on health and wellbeing and how to become a ‘better version of yourself’.“It also looks at body language and other aspects that employers notice.”Dundee’s Jobcentre is also planning a number of events to support Hospitality Works, a national campaign to encourage an uptake in jobs in the service sector.The campaign launches on February .Across Scotland, unemployment has dropped below , for the first time.UK Employment Minister Alok Sharma said the government’s “pro-business policies” have boosted job prospects.He added: “There are , more people in work over the past year, almost entirely driven by full-time jobs as the government delivers an economy that works for the British people.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c48728e3113a1.44588913.jpg ","title":"virgin media closes dundee city centre store with immediate effect","story":"Phone and broadband firm Virgin Media has announced it is closing one of its two city centre stores with immediate effect.A notice outside the media giant’s branch in the Overgate shopping centre announced the store would be closed from today, meaning the loss of several jobs.The company said the closure is part of a review to ensure its stores are in the right location for future growth plans.One member of staff, who declined to be named, said jobs were being lost as a result of the closure.

Invited to join Cameron up at the Cruachan dam for the second of his two recent programmes, I was delighted to tramp the mighty mountain with Scotland’s Number one authority on outdoor pursuits.As an author and broadcaster, Cameron always has an eye on a good story, and so as well as asking me about the lack of health and safety regulations at the time the hydro project was being built, he also wanted to knowthere really was a murder during the construction. There was, as I told him, a body – but the body wasn’t identied, no arrests were made, no court case took place.It would be a shamethat construction period went down in history as an invasion of , workmen – #Tunnel Tigers# as they were dubbed – into one of Argyll#s most beautul settings and a possible murder.My book was intended to give the story of the local people whose lives were punctuated by this ambitious construction project. Quite rightly, those Tunnel Tigers had been lauded in a number of publications. The work that was done hollowing out Argyll’s highest mountain to provide electricity for the nation was amazing.The plan for Cruachan – as for the other major hydro projects of the post World War II era – was conceived by Tom Johnston, to whom I dedicated my book. Johnston was a politician who remained true to his ideals of bringing rural Scotland into the modern world. There was no power in the Highlands, and without power there could be no industry and no prosperity. The engineering genius was Sir Edward MacColl, whose biographer Norrie Fraser called him #a maker of modern Scotland#.Cruachan was the first reversible pumped-storage system in the world. During its years of construction from  to , eminent international engineers visited the project to see how the water was pumped between two reservoirs through reversible turbine generators. At off-peak hours, the water was – is # pumped back up to the reservoir you see high up in the corrie above Loch Awe, held back by a dam that is now so much a part of our landscape. The loch itself is the lower reservoir.I had imagined that the scale of such a project – using Scotland’s top engineering companies who shipped in workers from other parts of the UK and Europe – would have been a cause for resentment and protest by local people.That, of course, failed to take account of the vision of the folk of Dalmally, Lochawe, and Taynuilt. Although it took men with engineering experience to blast the  miles of tunnels, hollow out the mountain itself, and construct the dam, there was also a need for a support army. There were clerks and porters, joiners and caterers, folk willing to let out a room, a caravan, a house, serve in a pub where just occasionally it was necessary to keep a baseball bat behind the bar to maintain bonhomie. The project kick started careers, fortunes and marriages, and gave the area good roads and a tourist industry.If you haven’t visited the hollow mountain or walked Cruachan’s slopes, make  the year you do.[In bold please] Cruachan: The Hollow Mountain is available from the Argyll Book Centre in Lochgilphead and all good book shops, along with Marian Pallister#s other books of local interest.PICS:The Pass of Brander before work started. no_aCruachanLe before the project # the Loch Awe Hotel with steamers. no_aCruachanThe Queen opening the project in October . no_aCruachanWorking on the  miles of tunnels. no_aCruachanWorking on the road to the dam, overlooking Loch Awe. no_aCruachan"},{"url":null,"title":"sports club lotteries 9","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowDrawn on Monday January , Kilmory Camanachd Club#s lottery numbers were ,  and .

It was written for Count Friedrich Wilhelm, supposedly simplied for amateurs to play. However, Jamal and Jâms being master musicians showed the power of this often disregarded piece, to be immense. One of the first works to make piano and cello equal musical partners, it is full of ingenious dialogue between the instruments. The structure is unusual, but with such expert performers it delighted the audience who were moved by every turn and twist of this deeply emotional work.Jâms, from North Wales, after remarking on the three ferry crossings required to get to Ardrishaig via Bute, introduced the next piece, Ernest Bloch’s work ‘From Jewish Le’. In a style close to Jamal’s heart and heritage, having been born in Baku Azerbaijan, its three elements, ‘Prayer’, ‘Supplication’ and ‘Jewish Song’, are full of the pathos and sorrow felt by the Jewish nation and also full of the signature augmented intervals and minor key tonality of much of middle eastern musics. How beautully these pieces demonstrated the lyrical qualities of the cello. Jamal’s bow searched for all possible nuances of tone and dynamic as his instrument sang from its lowest notes to a seductive soprano register.The concert continued after the interval with a second Beethoven work. The audience may have noticed a minor kerfuffle at the piano as many pages were rapidly turned before starting. Would it be the ‘Seven Variations’ for cello and piano or the ‘Twelve’, both based on themes from Mozart’s Magic Flute  The ‘Seven Variations’ won, being on the theme from the ‘Pamina’ and ‘Papageno’ duet entitled ‘In men, who know the feeling of love’. This work exhibits Beethoven’s practised ingenuity in the iation form and brought a lighter mood to the programme.Jâms Coleman introduced the final work, Frank Bridge’s Cello Sonata. He told of the four years of torment for the composer as he struggled to express his feelings about the First World War, finally finishing the composition in . The adagio in the piece caused the composer the most dficulty as he struggled with ambivalence about his own pacist views. Jâms and Jamal dealt with the challenges of this complex work which tracks huge changes in the world of music composition that were under way at that time. Again, the lyrical powers of the cello came to the fore as did the virtuosic requirements heaped on the pianist. Despite its undoubted innovations, this piece generously reaches out to its audience. Bridge uses the new musical freedoms only when justied, being happy toto more traditional tonal stability in the lyrical sections.Fulfilled, but not overburdened by the weightiness of the final piece, the audience applauded Jamal and Jâms back to the concert room to perform the ‘Swan’ from Saint-Saens ‘Carnival of the Animals’ as encore. This piece so beautully confirmed the excellence of Jamal’s playing and the superb quality of his quite special instrument.PIC:Jamal Aliyev and Jâms Coleman. no_aJamalandJam"},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray carpet bowling club festive pairs competition","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Inveraray Carpet Bowling Club held its annual festive pairs competition.The first prize of turkeys was won by George Morrison and Alan Cameron.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13896898.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS171494552.jpg","title":"coventry city signing michael rose","story":"NewsCoventry City signing Michael Rose can be future Scotland star, says Ayr United boss Ian McCallThe Ayr United centre half has completed a pre contract switch to the Ricoh Arena and will join the Sky Blues in the summer.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsMichael Rose, left, in action for Ayr United \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIan McCall reckons Coventry have bagged themselves a future Scotland star in Michael Rose.

Everyone talks about Lawrence but, in my opinion, Michael Rose could go on to achieve just as much -not more -he wants to.  He is that good a player and Ive no doubt he can be a future Scotland international. For my money hes been the best centre half in the Championship this season. Of course wed have loved to keep him, but we have to be realistic. Rose is one of a number of players to reinvent their careers under McCall following his failure to break through as a youth at Aberdeen. And McCall said: It is further proof to boys thatthey come here and develop themselves, they will get their reward.

Gaenor Hardy,, has assumed control at Heathfield in Ayr, complete with its  pupil roll and  child nursery. And the shining star of the region’s education system confesses she is now “living in a bubble waiting for it to burst”. Gaenor, who joins Heathfield after heading up Dalmilling Primary for five years, said: “I was very happy there and only Heathfield would have pulled me away. “It is always the school I have aspired to. My twins came here and I feel that level of affinity. “All I see is potential. I’ve never been at a school where the surroundings in the community are so rich.” Gaenor cut her teaching teeth in south London before ing north after her sister suffered a severe stroke, aged just . She said: “It made me review my le and decide what was important so we relocated back up to Scotland. “I’ve been back here for  years now and always had one eye on Heathfield as I knew it was such an exciting job. “Part of that excitement is that I live in the catchment and my children went here so it feels like coming home. “But I’m also excited about making this the flagship school. “However, we also need to make this the hub of the local community.” Fitness fanatic Gaenor admits an “open and frank exchange of views” took place during the first meeting with her new parent council last week. It follows concerns over the previous management’s approach to alleged bullying within the school. But she insisted: “I’m all for honest, vibrant and lively dialogue. “None of it was a surprise to me as a parent myself. “I would hate to think I’ll be a comparison to previous management in the school. “What I can bring is my own unique experience to the role. “I want to be open and visible and have parents approach me. “This has to be us together on the journey.” And she added: “I don’t have to grow a passion for the school. It is there within me already. “I feel like I’m in a bubble of looking forward to coming to work and being so motivated – and I’m still waiting for it to be burst.” Now Gaenor, who is often seen walking to school, is planning to get her pupils into shape as part of a new physical and mental drive. She said: “If I want the children to be fit and healthy then I have to model that. “Health and wellbeing has to underpin everything we’re doing. “The local junor parkrun is an example of something I’d like to see encouraged. “We’ve also rolled out more than  after-school and lunch clubs from this month. “I’ll be doing a homework club and the clerical team are doing a running club so we’re all very hands on. “But ultimately the children are my inspiration. “We have a fantastic new building in which to work and I’ve never experienced anything like it during my career. “Now the challenge is to make the most of it and enjoy what we have.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"new super school riddled structural","story":"NewsNew super-school is riddled with structural problemsLeaks, faulty automatic doors and sensory lights are among a string of issues at Invergarven’s marquee campus in Girvan.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsInside the school \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA new pound million super-school is “riddled” with structural problems, it can been revealed.

Georgies was the first confirmed case in the Borders.Lynsay said: \"The only way that you can be sure it is Alabama rot is to have a post mortem so Georgie was then taken to the Dick Vet in Edinburgh where it was confirmed that she had had Alabama rot. My other dog was tested for it but thankfully the results were clear.\"The Kennel Club is warning dog owners to be extra vigilant at this time of year as the peak season for the disease is between November and May.Caroline Kisko, Kennel Club Secretary said: ldquoAlthough the disease is very rare, affecting an extremely low percentage of dogs in the UK, the condition is very serious and potentially le-threatening. It is therefore vital that owners understand and recognise the warning signs, especially as time plays a signicant part in successfully treating the disease.ldquoWe are asking owners to look out for any signs of Alabama rot during the winter months and to remember to take action right away. Any dogs with unexplained or concerning skin lesions which typically look like sores, ulcers, or red, swollen, bruised areas, commonly with an infected appearance should be taken to their vet as soon as possible. These skin changes are usually found on their paws or lower legs, but may also appear on their head, face or lower body. Dogs who have contracted the disease may also become tired, disinterested in food, or present other signs of illness like vomiting or diarrhoea.ldquoAlthough these signs may not necessarily mean your dog has Alabama rot, acting quickly and speaking to a vet to determine what is wrong is the best course of action to protect your petrsquos health.While large amounts of research have been carried out over the last six years, the cause of the disease remains unknown. As yet, no evidence has been found to suggest that CRGV is caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, toxins, or radiation. There is speculation that it is related to mud or water, due to the higher prevalence in winter and spring, and relatively low case numbers seen in the summer.Caroline continued: ldquoTo lower any risk of your dog contracting Alabama rot, itrsquos also advisable to keep your dog away from very muddy areas, wash wet or muddy dogs straight after a walk and regularly check your dogrsquos body for anything thatrsquos dferent.,params: .pushldquoWhile a distinct seasonal pattern is suggested, we must continue to research this deadly disease and ensure all dog owners are aware of the signs and symptoms so they are able to seek veterinary advice immediately.Despite what happened, Lynsay still s to walk Taffy along the river in Gattonside.

And so I think I shall.A story from your head is a term I use to describe a story either made up on the spot or a remembered story that was made up at an earlier time. So essentially itrsquos a story that isnrsquot written down anywhere or got from a book.Of course, reading to, and with, children is really important. But making stories together with a child is a really bonding experience and a fantastic way to encourage the child to explore and develop her or his creative imagination.This dadrsquos child is quite young but the process Irsquom about to describe can be used for any age group, and indeed yourself.Firstly, I want you to think of a mountain. You are standing at its base on one side and you want to get to the other side. In order to do so you will need to climb to the summit first. This mountain in your imagination is going to initially help you make a story, because itrsquos called a story mountain.So now you are standing at the base of the story mountain. You need a few things before you begin your journey to the summit, and the first thing is a character or characters.This is the first question to ask your child: who is in the story  Let them decide, and it can be anyone or anything: a dragon, a princess, a footballer, Spiderman, a Minion, a witch, a boy or girl, or even your child themselves.Next question is to find which place the story begins, that is what the setting is for the beginning of the tale. So you can ask where the character is.It can be an imaginary setting or a real one, perhaps even local, itrsquos up to the child for example, answers might include ldquothe dragon is hiding in a school or ldquothe princess lives in a cave.Once you have a character or characters and some kind of setting you have the beginning of the story. ldquoOnce upon a time, a dragon was hiding in a schoolhellip ldquoThere was once a princess who lived in a cavehellipYou can now help the child to add a few detailsyou wish by asking simple questions about the characters and or the settings. For example: ldquoWhy is the dragon hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the cave look like Questions like these can help direct the story towards what is going to happen, and that is the next part of your journey up the slope to the summit of your story mountain.So the child may say: ldquoThe dragon is hiding in the school because itrsquos scared of a bigger dragon. Or: ldquoThe cave is cold.Now we have the characters and setting, itrsquos time to make the climb to the summit of the story mountain. This climb represents the issue within the story: a problem, a task or quest, a desire or dream to be sought, a need for change or something to be found and so on. In other words, itrsquos the beginning of the adventure.Itrsquos at this point that beginning the process of visualisation is useful. Visualisation is a technique used by storytellers to help them remember a tale and tell it in their own words. It involves actually imagining yourself in the story, asyou are there.So before you set off on the story, imagine the dragon in the school, enter into the image in your head. Is it your old school, what does the dragon look like, where in the school is it hiding, what are its emotions Likewise with the princess, can you see her in the cave  Enter it in your imagination and look around. Is it large or small, cosy or scary  Where does she sleep and can you see the princess shivering in the cold  What is she feeling and thinking This is what story is all about, entering the world of imagination. Itrsquos not the words you need to remember but the images in your mind. Itrsquos like they become a memory which you can later describe.Your child will have his or her own visualisations, but you can help develop that by asking questions and allowing the child to describe what he or she sees.Painting vivid moving pictures in your mindrsquos eye is the key to not only remembering but developing the story.So now we may have a terried small dragon hiding in the dinner hall of your childrsquos school, and a shivering princess sitting by a small campfire in a huge cave, feeling hungry.The next step is to find out what is going to happen. This begins us on the journey to the summit of the story mountain. To give the child ownership of the story, ask him or her questions like: ldquoSo does the big dragon find the one hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the princess do to make the cave warmer and get something to eat Now we have the issue that takes us up the hill to the summit. The summit represents the transformative moment in the story, the thing or person or happening that alters the course of events. In any story, this is an important ingredient.So perhaps we will end up with: ldquoThe big dragon flies into the playground and all the children run. But the teacher comes out and is really strict and makes it go away so the children are safe, and so is the wee dragon. Or: ldquoThe princess goes fishing. And she sees a pirate ship while shersquos fishing and decides she wants to be a pirate instead.So the headteacher and the pirate ship are the transformative factors in these examples. They change the course of the story, and in doing so the journey back down the other side of the mountain can now take place, for this represents the conclusion or ending of the tale.Is it a happy, sad, funny ending  So questions like ldquowhat happens to the wee dragon  and ldquodoes the princess enjoy being a pirate and living on the pirate ship  may lead to answers that the wee dragon loves the school and becomes a part of the P class and learns to read, and that the princess becomes the pirate captain.So now the base of the other side of the mountain has been reached, with the storyrsquos ending. Now you can take away the structure of the mountain and lay down the bones of the story you have made along the journey.Here are the bones: wee dragon hides in a school from a bigger dragon, teacher chases bigger dragon away, wee dragon decides he likes the school and stays and joins P princess is in cave cold and hungry, she goes fishing by the sea and sees a pirate ship, she joins the pirate crew and becomes the captain.The visualisation technique can now be used to put flesh on the bones, giving it more detail. You can revisit the tale and develop it later, or leave it as it is.In telling the story, donrsquot think of words, think of the images created in your head, then the words will come naturally as you describe what you see.This way you will remember the story. You may tell it slightly dferently each time, but thatrsquos fine. Your child may remind you of how it was told before, as he or she will have their own visualisation of the tale.Or your child may ask you for a dferent story, in which case you are back at the base of another story mountain ready to climb it!Happy storytelling!"},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-250-more-homes-in-dunbar-to-be-revealed","story":"Members of the public have the chance to view the

of what they put in.Mrs Bell was keen for social housing and bungalows to be included within the development.She noted concerns had also been expressed about how the townrsquos infrastructure, such as medical centre and primary school, would cope with further expansion, as well as fears it would lead to wildle, such as deer, being displaced and even killed on neighbouring roads.More detailed plans

In Parkhead, it is similar with % not using the net for banking.The north and east of Glasgow are among the lowest in the country for having access to digital equipment and for a low level of digital skills.Local politicians have criticised the closure plans as ldquoabandoning customers and want to meet with Santander bosses to urge them to think again.David Linden Glasgow East SNP MP said the decision as ldquowrong-headed and a ldquohammer blow to the community.He said: ldquoThere doesnrsquot seem to have been any form of consultation or engagement with customers leading up to this announcement, which makes the reasoning for this decision dficult to understand.ldquoSantanderrsquos own factsheet about the closure suggests that customers use their closest branch in Rutherglen, which shows a complete lack of local understanding in the decision making process.

My own wish would be for MPs to seize the moment and vote to revoke Article  altogether. MPs have the power to stop the clock for good, thanks to the good works of legally-minded MPs like the SNPrsquos Joanna Cherry.Staying in the EU is the only sure way to stop the endless arguments about Canada plus, Norway plus, customs union, Irish backstop, regulatory alignment, maximum facilitation and all the rest of the gubbins thatrsquos been occupying our addled brains for the last two-and-a-half years. However, this isnrsquot going to happen.And Irsquod have to agree that it would be undemocratic for MPs to simply reverse the result of the  referendum by revoking A. It may be that Parliament has the power and the constitutional right to do so: referendums are only advisory. But it would leave so much unpleasantness that British politics would be soured for decades. There would have to be a referendum.This is where my unease turns to genuine anxiety. I have a horrible feeling that Labourrsquos Diane Abbott was right on Question Time this week when she said: ldquoBe careful what you wish for. She agrees with Nigel Farage that a repeat referendum is likely to endorse no-deal Brexit, perhaps by an even greater margin than in .Evenit left us with a mirror-image result, with say % Remain against % Leave, that would itself be a disaster because it would have no legitimacy. Yes, some opinion polls say Remain would win a comfortable majority, but they said that last time.The Brexiteers are already field-testing their slogans on social media. The frontrunner is ldquoTell Them Again, which may not be as resonant as ldquoTake Back Control but is still pretty hot. It surfs on the very widespread disgust and alienation that many ordinary people feel about the political elite. It appeals to democratic injustice: how dare the globalists ignore the result of , which David Cameron promised would be for keeps What would Remainrsquos slogan be  Itrsquos likely to be a repeat of the Project Fear line which failed dismally in . ldquoDonrsquot put your childrenrsquos prosperity at risk, perhaps, or ldquoThink Twice Think Jobs. But what many pro-Europeans fail to grasp ndash and this applied to the Unionists in the Scottish independence referendum ndash is that it ISNrsquoT the economy, stupid. Brexit voters donrsquot just make their decisions on the basis of economic rationality, as seen from the CBI and corporate Britain.People are always motivated more by emotion than numbers ndash on what they believe to be morally right. The sense that working-class people have lost control is a very potent mobiliser.As in war ndash and it is remarkable how much Brexit mythology harks back to World War Two ndash people are quite willing to sacrice some comfort for what they believe in.I may think they are mistaken. As with the people who supported Donald Trump because he promised to Make America Great Again, and bring back the jobs, I think Brexit voters have been sold a  prospectus by politicians who do not have the best interests of working people at their hearts.But that isnrsquot really the point. I can well understand the sense of injustice felt by people who have been left behind by global capitalism. They want to kick the system, and the referendum gave them a chance to do it. They need a very strong reason not to kick the metropolitans again. Only Labour can provide that reason, and Jeremy Corbyn has been singularly reluctant to do so.His refusal even to meet Theresa May was irresponsible in this climate. It may have allowed him to avoid coming off the fence, but it looked petty and weak. Corbyn should have gone in guns blazing, demanded that she drop the red lines, and then mobilised Labour for either rejoining the single market or for a referendum.Single market membership has always been the logic of Labourrsquos position, even though Corbyn usually refers to a ldquopermanent customs union. Only by joining the European Economic Area could Labour deliver friction-free trade, and protect environmental standards and workers rights. People say that Norway has blocked the UKrsquos entry to the European Economic Area, but this is not true. The Norwegian PM, Erna Solberg, has repeatedly made clear that Norway would have severe reservations ndashwho wouldnrsquot  ndash but would not block UK membership.This is because the EEA is essentially a Brussels creation. It was set up as a halfway house to membership of the EU back in  when a number of countries were uneasy about joining the political institutions of Europe. The EEA is just the European Single Market under another name.Brussels endorses British membership of the EEA, and this economic arrangement has a number of advantages over Mayrsquos deal. Therersquos no need for an Irish backstop no membership of the CAP and the Common Fisheries Policy no direct jurisdiction of the European Court and it costs less than EU membership. Of course, it does not bring the full benefits of EU membership. Britain would become a ldquorule taker on trade. But the EEA does not preclude future membership of the European Union. Norway, or any other member of the EEA, can opt for full membership at any time. And unlike the backstop, countries can leave the EEA after one year.Membership of the single market also means accepting freedom of movement, which is why it may well be rejected by Parliament. But it is the only option that has a snowballrsquos chance of getting a majority,Labour were to seriously support it. ldquoNorway plus, as itrsquos called, has more support than a repeat referendum. Fewer than  Labour MPs have called for a Peoples Vote, and only  Conservatives. The SNP has decided to throw its lot in with a repeat referendum, despite having argued convincingly for the single market for the last two years. But that isnrsquot enough.To repeat. Were it left to me, I would revoke Article  tomorrow. I just want this madness to stop. But given the metrics in Parliament, we have to look at the least worst options, as the Labour-supporting commentator Owen Jones put it last week. Mayrsquos deal is dead. MPs owe it to the country, and to themselves, to find some compromise that works. Perhaps that can only be achieved with a referendum. ButMPs fail this week, they risk destroying respect for parliamentary democracy, and opening the way for a more authoritarian form of political leadership."},{"url":null,"title":"more-than-half-of-rail-commuters-struggle-to-pay-full-fare","story":"Passenger anger has soared over recent years as rush hour services rise in cost but fall in quality and reliability.Now a survey has found  per cent of regular travellers say they find it hard to pay peak fares - and  per cent claim they struggle to find seats on trains at the most expensive and busiest times.The poll, of more than  people for CensuswideScotland, also found  per cent of passengers agreed or strongly agreed that peak hours were the worst time to travel.The new research comes after national operator ScotRail suffered a torrid winter spell of cancellations and delays.It also follows a January hike in fares of . per cent on average but . per cent on the anytime full fares and season tickets used by regular commuters working the old standard - day.Fares are rising less quickly than in England - where they remain  per cent higher - but this proved little consolation to commuters.Only one in  Scots travel by train daily but they make up a huge proportion of all journeys and are most likely to pay either full fare or buy season tickets.Dumbarton MSP Jackie Baillie, of Scottish Labour, said: \"As the poll clearly demonstrates commuters are fed up ndash they donrsquot think they are getting value for money and on current performance they are right.\"Commuters across Scotland have seen their transport fares sky rocket while the quality of their transport service has plummeted.\"In my constituency, the train service has been particularly poor for months, and characterised by delays and cancellations.\"When trains do show up, there are only three carriages instead of six, so commuters are crammed in like sardines on peak hour services.\"Ms Baillie, who is a regular traveller, urged Transport Secretary Michael Matheson to freeze fares and push for better performance.Full fares are applied on the busiest \"peak\" services - in the morning almost everywhere and in the evenings on flagship routes like Glasgow-Edinburgh.They are designed to encourage passengers to travel at less busy times and take the strain off core commuter services. Rail insiders insist this is fair - because they have to mobilise far more staff and equipment at rush hours.However, the Censusworld poll suggests passengers do not agree. Two-thirds said it was unfair to penalise those who have to travel before lower fares kick in, at am.ScotRail, which is run by Dutch firm Abellio, has been losing money. It stressed that it did not set the main full fares - that is down to the government.A spokesman said: ldquoEighty-five per cent of our revenue comes from fares set by the Scottish Government, which decides how much our customers pay.ldquoThe money generated from fares is reinvested back into Scotlandrsquos railway, including through new and upgraded trains, so that we can improve the service our customers receive.Full anytime fares can be far higher than reduced ones.A discounted off-peakfrom Bearsden to Glasgow is pound.. The full fare, allowing travel before am, is pound.. It costs pound. to travel from Edinburgh to Glasgow off-peak but pound. anytime.The Scottish Government and its quango, Transport Scotland, has rejected calls for a fares freeze, saying this would hit the public purse.A Scottish Government spokesman said: \"We are committed to ensuring that rail fares are affordable for all ndash for fare-payers and tax-payers across Scotland.\"Overall, Scottish fares are  per cent lower than the GB average and we already meet around two thirds of the cost of rail passenger services in Scotland.\"The spokesman added that the current franchise - with Abellio - foresaw total new investment of pound million. That includes efforts to boost the number of seats by  per cent by the end of this year.The spokesman added: \"More widely, we are currently undertaking a review of the National Transport Strategy, which will consider our long-term approach to ensuring the affordability of transport across Scotland.\"David Sidebottom, director at the independent watchdog Transport Focus, called for reform of fare pricing.He said: \"We know just over a third of ScotRail commuters are satisfied with the value for money of their ticket. Despite substantial investment in new trains and track, many passengers have yet to consistently experience a more reliable railway with punctual trains, accurate information and less disruption.ldquoPassengers also want a smarter ticketing system that they can understand and trust, is simpler to use, better value for money and offers choices that suit the way we travel now.\"There are parallel reviews under way of Britains railways and their fares. Unions have been campaigning for Abellio to be stripped of its franchise - and for renationalisation.Transport Salaried Staffs Association General Secretary Manuel Cortes said, ldquoThis is a chance for Scotland to lead instead of trailing. Last year Michael Matheson said that it would cost Abellio poundmillion to freeze the fares.\"Well thatrsquos pennies compared to the poundbillion over ten years that the ScotRail contract is worth.ldquoPrivatisation isnrsquot working for the economy of Scotland. On average every rail passenger is losing  hours of productive time a year. Thatrsquos time in work, or relaxing and recovering from work. Bad commutes make for tired and stressed workers.ldquoRight now Abellio is fleecing Scottish commuters. Scottish passengers know their journeys will be delayed every week, they know theyrsquore unlikely to get a seat at peak times, and theyrsquore being forced to pay far too much for they privilege. Abellio need to go.\"The SNP has promised to ensure there is a public-sector bid for the next Scottish franchise with state-owned ferry operator Calmac understood to have been teed up for this role.Jordan Ferguson, from pollsters Censuswide Scotland, said: \"As the debate around Scotlandrsquos public transport network continues, we thought it was important to understand the public opinion and attitudes towards these services.\"What this study shows is a clear concern from the public around the pricing structure at peak time.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9321649.jpg?type=article-full","title":"from-big-scottish-freeze-to-autumn-like-temperatures-in-two-days","story":"The Met Office issued a yellow weather warning valid till to at least am on Wednesday warning of further ice and potential snow showers.Forecasters predicted temperatures would plummet to -C in Braemar, Aberdeenshire at dawn on Wednesday and while expecting similar sub-zero lows later tonight.But the big freeze is expected to switch to autumn temperatures on Friday when Glasgow is expected to bask in a mild C while it will be C in Aberdeen.The Met Office latest yellow warning cover mainly the west of Scotland, with the east is largely clear.

When looking at the people who regularly consumed fried foods they generally had lower incomes, were more likely to smoke and to have a worse diet quality. Although this was taken into account when calculating the findings it is dficult to say whether the results they observed are definitely due to consuming fried chicken, fish or shellfish or whether they might be due to a generally poorer diet and lestyle.However, others did not believe the findings would deter women from getting a fish supper.Kirsty Adam, manager of Cromars Classic Fish and Chips in St Andrews, which was voted Scotlands best fish and chip shop in  and , said: \"Theres lots of stuff being published.

In no previous era of British politics could such a calamitous prime minister have survived such a weight of defeats, including the humiliating historic loss she recently suffered over the Withdrawal Agreement.In the past, losing a vote of confidence on a key piece of legislation was considered sufficient to stand down. For example, having split his party over the Corn Laws in , Sir Robert Peel resigned as prime minister after the defeat of his Irish Coercion Bill. Gladstone was also forced to resign in , again after a defeat on the Irish issue.In terms of the modern era, four prime ministers resigned and four stepped down on alleged grounds of ill-health. Indeed, two quit office even after winning key votes because their margins of victory made them seem moral defeats. Neville Chamberlain resigned in May , despite having won the ision on the disastrous Norway campaign, and Margaret Thatcher famously resigned despite her victory over Michael Heseltine in the first round of a Tory leadership contest.Realising the game was up, even David Cameron resigned after losing the Brexit referendum.It is a damning indictment of Mrs May and her party that she can even contemplate staying in office.

The uncertainty that permeates our economic and political system at present, allied to the fact that the people of Northern Ireland have been without a devolved assembly at Stormont for more than two years, provides an opportune climate that dissident factions, such as the New IRA, will exploit for their own ends.Transport and postal services have been suspended to some Republican areas of Derry as fears of terrorist violence and disruption continue to grow. Mark Hamilton, Assistant Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland , views the current terrorist attacks as \"the most signicant in recent years\". Yet Ms Bradley would have us believe that the present political climate in the UK, with the possibility of a no- deal Brexit and therefore a hard border in Ireland, does not influence the recklessness of terrorists and their ability to drag Northern Ireland back to sectarian violence and chaos.A recent Amorach poll in the Irish republic found that  percent of people asked would fear ato violence in Ireland following Brexit.

Work is due to start this year, be completed by spring  and create  jobs during the construction phase.Councillor Bremner, who represents Wick and East Caithness on Highland Council, said: \"While Im keen to see an improvement to the north brae, I still believe we cant take our focus off the south brae. We have two major long-term concerns to focus on here ndash the gradient of the brae and the fact that we are still witnessing serious accidents on the bottom hairpin bend even where there is an escape bed.\"These accidents are a risk to le, causing road closures and impacting in all sorts of ways on our local community and economy. Improvements to the north brae are very welcome and I hope that it is the start of a bigger vision to improve the entire Berriedale Braes.\"We can expect the standard lead-in period of about three months and for discussions to be held with the contractor on how they propose to physically approach the works and discussions with statutory bodies like the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds among others.\"He said that archaeological investigatory works have been completed.The award of the contract was also welcomed by Trudy Morris, chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce.She said: \"We are delighted to see that after many years of dedicated campaigning by the chamber, Caithness Transport Forum and other local organisations, this project is finally moving ahead. For too long, the Berriedale Braes has acted as a pinch point for travellers on the A north of Inverness, disrupting business and jeopardising investment in the region.\"It has been good to see other work on A improvements and repairs going to local companies in recent years, and we hope the principal contractor will engage closely with our highly skilled local supply chain as these works progress.\"Ms Morris added: \"Now that the contract has been formally awarded, we hope to see clarication on exact start dates and expectedof works very soon.

The names of the companies involved have however, not been released.Minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, said: “Issuing the Invitation to Tender marks the next stage of the process to award the new contract to operate the Northern Isles Ferry Services.“The contract will run for eight years, allowing us to build a strong working relationship with the successful bidder, and all the routes within the network are being tendered as a single bundle.“The Scottish Government remains fully committed to high quality ferry services to the Northern Isles. A key benefit of this new contract is the in-built flexibility, allowing the ferry services to be amended to reflect future changes in demand across the important sectors of the islands’ economies – tourism, fishing, food and drink, aquaculture and farming. Scottish Ministers will also retain control of all of important issues, such as fares and timetables, through the public service contract.“We are committed to a fair, open and transparent tender which aims to get the best possible deal for the communities that depend on these ferry services.”• Commenting on the issue, Northern Isles MSP’s Liam McArthur and Tavish Scott said: “The Scottish Government have finally issued the tender. The timescale is very tight indeed given the operator needs to be up and running the North Isles leline ferry services in  months’ time. It is essential that companies make constructive bids with improvements to the existing service. It must, in particular, recognise the growing freight volumes that are being exported south to the Scottish mainland.“So the tender bids must be properly assessed to ensure the service moves forward and not backwards.

OIC Leader James Stockan has notied Ministers that the council will hand over responsibility for running the service to Transport Scotland, unless sufficient funding is provided.A year ago, a similar level of support was secured, after a y campaign by OIC for fair funding. Of this, £. million was allocated to fully fund Orkney’s internal ferry service during the current financial year, with £ million awarded to Shetland Islands Council for its ferry operations.“But this time there is no specic amount allocated to Orkney or Shetland. The government recognises that it will cost £. million to operate our ageing fleet of ferries during - — and that is what we are asking the government to provide.”OIC is also looking to the government to fund the replacement of the current inter-island fleet. The council has been working with the government on this for a number of years and is currently developing a business case setting out the service levels local communities require, and the engineering options needed to achieve these.Councillor Stockan added: “We would object in the strongest possible termswe end up with a reduction in our ferries funding. This would place a wholly disproportionate and unfair burden on the smallest council in Scotland and would mean us having to make cuts to other vital services.“The ferries are a leline for remote and fragile communities across our islands. Orkney has the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — an inequality we cannot address without proper financial support from the Scottish Government.We are calling on the government to take an honourable approach to fulfilling the will of the Scottish Parliament that we should receive fair and equitable funding for our inter-island ferry service. The principle of transferring Orkney’s internal ferry service to the Scottish Government, at no net detriment to OIC, has already been approved by the council. That is a route we will have to take unless we are provided with the funds to run the service over the year ahead.”For the full story, pick up a copy of The Orcadian, this Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Set in , it sees protagonist Scott and his father James take the car ferry across the Beauly Firth to Inverness as they watch men working on the Kessock Bridge.Scott agrees to attend a farm roup with his father and feels he is being watched by a yellow eye from a dirty painting hanging amongst the lots. Unknown to his father, he successfully bids for it and his le starts to alter in remarkable ways.The action swings between Aberdeen and Florence as Scott embarks on a journey of discovery.Mr Herd, who describes himself as ldquo going on , said time spent alone working on so many films served him.He said: ldquoBy the nature of film work there wasnrsquot a typical day because all trips y. The most memorable film that I have worked on must be Swamp Tigers in the Bangladeshi Sundarbans.ldquoUsing a converted river ferry boat as a mobile base, a typical day would be, rising at four and travelling in the dark to a hide built on stilts embedded in a channel.ldquoI would stay there on my own usually for twelve hours and I did that for months. Being in a hide that long gives you plenty of time to think.ldquoLying awake in bed in the morning, plot ideas and characters nag at me and I have to get up to write about them.ldquoI am a hopeless two-fingered typist which is very frustrating because they canrsquot keep up with whatrsquos going through my head. That aside It does surprise me how easy it is for me to write, I donrsquot know where that comes from. I try to write at least a thousand words a day but quite often Irsquoll hit a brick wall.ldquoI donrsquot worry about that because I know that I will get the inspiration to carry on later.ldquoI try to write about what I know, itrsquos much more convincing and I use locations Irsquove been to. For example, in The Medusa Shield, Scott goes full moon night fishing off the Black Isle coast in a Zulu boat. While I was in India the fishermen on the east coast do that every month.The Medusa Shield is available from Amazon Kindle, Kobo and other digital publishers.Thursday  Jan  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The programme starting today will culminate with ldquomemory blankets that each participant will design and create.Evanton Wood education co-ordinator Simon Harry said: ldquoThis is a great addition to our summer dementia programme as we have secured funding to continue this programme of activities in the woods throughout the early part of this year.ldquoThe work will be focused at Evanton Community Woods utilising the woodland cabin as a base and using the surrounding forest environment to help bring to le the memories and ideas of the group.ldquoWe will be working closely with local artist Lizzie McDougal who has been a big hit with our group.He added: ldquoLizzie will lead the sessions with input from Evanton Wood staff and volunteers.ldquoThe process will start with two storytelling sessions in which Lizzie will encourage the sharing of memories and stories from each couple within the group. Lizzie and the group will then create sketches from these conversations to use as prompts for the group to aid their design of the memory blanket.The programme is supported by the UK-wide DEEP project , and the blankets will be used at a DEEP gathering to be run at Evanton Woods in the spring.

What an extraordinary situation we find ourselves in as we hurtle towards the March  deadline.This week, the Prime Minister put forward her ‘plan B’ after her withdrawal deal was comprehensively rejected last week. You may have noticed that ‘plan B’ looked remarkably similar to ‘plan A’. In fact, it was nearly identical. The only dference was the letter describing it.If the Scottish independence referendum taught us anything, it’s that politicians who fail to produce genuine plan Bs are found out by the public – as Alex Salmond discovered when he failed to outline an alternative to using the British pound in .Theresa May is treating parliament and the public like fools. That’s why she is almost certain – once again – to lose the next vote on her withdrawal deal this coming Tuesday.It’s worth reminding ourselves why there is such opposition to Downing Street’s proposal.First of all, this isn’t even about our future relationship with the EU post-Brexit. This is merely the orce agreement – the terms in which we would leave the EU.It doesn’t cover what happens after we leave and that is why there is a ‘backstop’ to the issues with the border on the island of Ireland. That explains why Number Ten appeared to be floating the dangerous idea of reopening the Good Friday Agreement, before realising that was a complete non-starter. It is an international treaty underpinned by the United Nations and ratied by referenda in the north and south of Ireland.Nobody voted for a Brexit that would see Britain giving away control and leaving people poorer. It means paying a near £ billion orce bill but getting nothing in . It is the worst of all worlds, which is why it has united both Remainers and Leavers in Parliament.: First Minister warns Theresa May must drop hardline Brexit stanceThe Prime Minister has insisted she will continue making tweaks to win over MPs, but the EU has made it clear that the withdrawal agreement cannot be renegotiated. It is a legal text.That is not the EU being intransigent – the Prime Minister’s red lines make this the only option for the other  member states. To get any movement, she would have to loosen those red lines.Her red lines include leaving the customs union and the single market, ensuring that freedom of movement can end. That’s the freedom of movement which has allowed Brits to travel freely and live and work in European countries, and allowed the British economy to grow by addressing worker shortages in key industries.So we’re in an almighty mess. As things stand, the default scenario the country faces is a ‘no deal’ Brexit. I fear the full impact of this catastrophic option is still misunderstood.It means leaving the EU with no withdrawal agreement in place, falling back on World Trade Organizationtrade rules. That comes with tarfs on imports and quotas, for example cars would be taxed at  per cent every time they crossed the UK-EU border, and dairy products would be hit with a  per cent tarf – hence the stockpiling of key goods. As the EU confirmed only yesterday, it would also mean a hard border with Ireland.: Poll: Two-thirds of Scots believe Brexit makes independence more likelyA ‘no deal’ Brexit would wipe tens of billions of pounds off the UK economy, including around £bn in Scotland, according to the CBI. A hit of that magnitude would have a devastating impact on jobs and living standards, plunging public services into crisis. And who would be the worst affected  The poorest people in society. So that’s why those of us who care about our constituents talk about taking no-deal “off the table”. The fear is that the Prime Minister runs the clock down until March, and we automatically fall off that no-deal clf-edge because time has run out or she bribes MPs to back her botched plan.There are ways to prevent that happening, however.The Article  timetable can be altered – either extended with the agreement of the EU or unilaterally revoked. That has to happen now regardless of the way forward.If the Prime Minister allows us to leave the EU without a deal, her Government will be deliberately choosing to inflict untold damage on its people. That would be unforgiveable.Fortunately, while the Government flounders, many MPs are rising to the occasion. A series of amendments have been submitted, including a Labour frontbench amendment which legislates for the holding of a People’s Vote. Others seek to extend the Article  process.There is, of course, little point in extending Article  in an attempt to tweak the withdrawal agreement, because the negotiations are over.It should, however, be extended so that we can go back to the people of the United Kingdom and offer them a vote to decide our future.I am open-minded about what should appear on the ballot paper, but the most obvious solution is to give voters a choice between the clear measurable propositions of Theresa May’s Brexit deal – which would confirm that the people of the UK still want to leave the EU – and keeping the best deal we already have by remaining a member state of the EU.The Prime Minister claims that a People’s Vote would be damaging to democracy, yet it’s the devastation her deal will inflict on the country that will irreparably damage our democracy – and a ‘no deal’ more so.It’s time to let democracy flourish and put control back in the hands of the British people. Next Tuesday gives parliament an opportunity to do that andthe Labour Party supports a People’s Vote amendment and whips to support it, we can achieve this goal.When that time comes, I know I will put our national interest first and campaign tirelessly for the UK to remain in the EU.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4861273.1548262308!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit sees scots tories mask slip over devolution joan mcalpine msp","story":"After Scottish Conservative MPs warn the UK Government not to give the Scottish Government a formal role in post-Brexit trade negotiations, SNP MSP Joan McAlpine says it shows they are putting #extreme unionist ideology# ahead of their constituents.The Scottish Tories were against the establishment of a Scottish Parliament in the first place. They stood alone, of all the major political parties, in their pig-headed opposition to Holyrood being allowed to exist. They campaigned against self-government in the  referendum and were roundly defeated. Democracy for Scotland was never their strong point.Ironically, the Scottish Parliament’s proportional representation system gave the Tories their best representation in decades. They even tried to re-invent themselves as a pro-devolution party.Many of us were unconvinced.Now the mask has slipped.

Yet the Scottish Tories believe decisions affecting our export business, and public services such as the NHS, are best left with this incompetent department.This confirms the Conservatives are as opposed to the notion of Scottish self-government as they ever were.It undermines attempts by Ruth Davidson and other Scottish Tories to detoxy their brand. : Theresa May says independence referendum the ‘last thing we want’Just look at Ms Davidson’s oscillating stance on Brexit.

Immediately after the EU referendum, she insisted that Scotland and the rest of the UK must stay in the single market.And now  Now, the Scottish Tory meekly accepts whatever chaotic and shambolic version of Brexit Theresa May proposes. Scotland will just have to lump it, despite voting  per cent against leaving Europe. In what other country would elected politicians lobby against having a say over key decisions affecting those they represent That fact alone exposes the utter bankruptcy of the Tory vision for Scotland.

The First Minister used a visit to Westminster on Wednesday to suggest details of the timetable for a second Scottish independence referendum would be revealed soon.Sir John suggested yesterday it would be “unwise” to proceed with plans for another referendum when the outcome of Brexit remained far from clear.He said: “It strikes me as extremely unlikely, even unwise, for the SNP to make any move on this until it is clear what is going to happen with Brexit. “The crucial action is what will happen to the UK government in the wake of its attempt to try and get a deal through the House of Commons. It is widely agreed there is a non-trivial risk that UK government is going to fall apart over this subject.“Given that there is no prospect of Nicola Sturgeon getting a Section  order out of the current parliament [giving permission for a referendum], and assuming she does not want to call for a referendum safe in the knowledge that she does not need to hold it, she is going to wait.“She will wait because should the UK government fall, and should we face a general election – which opinion polls suggest could lead to another hung parliament – she might find herself in roughly the same position as the DUP currently find themselves in the current parliament, but obviously dealing with Jeremy Corbyn.• : SNP MP calls for Nicola Sturgeon to ‘trigger the gun’ on IndyRef“There are no guarantees any of this will happen, butwe have another general election, all the balls go up in the air and we wait and see how they land.

A police investigation is taking place into the allegations made by two women and dating back to when he was first minister. But Mr Salmond won a legal challenge against the Scottish Government over its handling of the claims.The Scottish Government is carrying out a review of what happened and Ms Sturgeon has referred herself to independent advisers to consider whether she breached the ministerial code during meetings and phone calls with her predecessor. Mr Salmond said Ms Sturgeon’s focus should be on the drive to bring about independence. He said: “Nicola should be concentrating all her energies on the independence agenda where we will never have better circumstances. As far as I am concerned Westminster’s Brexit dficulty should be Scotland’s opportunity.” Ms Sturgeon is to give an update to the Scottish Parliament on her plans in the coming weeks. A formal request for a Section  order which would give Holyrood the authority to stage a referendum was rejected by the UK government last year, with Prime Minister Theresa may insisting “now is not the time” to revisit the Scottish constitutional issue amid the Brexit uncertainty. It is understood that a further request by the Scottish Government would also be rejected by Westminster.Writing in the Sunday National newspaper yesterday, Mr Salmond said: “One of our features in the national movement has been our inability to weigh the strengths and weaknesses of our political opponents. We have tended to concentrate on the shape we’re in.“However, right now the Westminster political establishment is at its weakest point in my letime while the national movement is in good heart. There is not likely to be a better time to force the issue.”However former SNP deputy leader Jim Sillars warned there is “no appetite” for a second independence referendum. He said: “There is no national Yes organisation in place – a prerequisite to success as many Yes activists and voters are not SNP.“No policy work has been done on the post-Brexit situation and thus we are not in a position to deploy then new policies in that post-Brexit new paradigm that will be needed to convince No voters to vote Yes next time.”Polls indicate there has been no rise in support for independence among Scots since the last vote in  and Perth and North Perthshire MP Pete Wishart said a vote should be held when it can be won.He said: “We are already making progress towards that with Brexit as the catalyst. But it will be dficult to secure the conditions to make a referendum happen before the next Holyrood election.”Alex Bell, a former SNP government adviser also called for a more considered approach.He said: “The SNP and Yes have to stop seeing independence as a sneaky prize to be won when everyone  is messing up and instead base their campaign on the reality of what Scotland can achieve through an honest understanding of the world.”Ms Sturgeon had pledged to hold a second referendum in the immediate aftermath of Brexit but “reset” her plans after the SNP suffered heavy losses in the  UK election.At First Minister’s Questions last week, she said: “Given the catastrophe that Scotland faces in our economy, our society, our living standards, the prospects for the next generation and our reputation in the world, it is essential that the option of independence is open to people in Scotland.“When people in Scotland have the ability to choose independence, I believe that the country will opt to be an independent one.”The Scottish Parliament has already voted in favour of a second referendum following the Brexit vote as the SNP combined with the pro-independence Greens.\u2028Scottish Secretary David Mundell has written to Mrs May to urge her to maintain her refusal to grant Holyrood powers for a second independence referendum.If the authority to hold a second referendum through a Section  is rejected, as expected, by the UK government, it has been suggested that the Scottish Government could make this the central issue of the next Holyrood election in , as it seeks to build the case for a independence in the years ahead.\u2028Tory constitution spokesman Adam Tomkins suggested Ms Sturgeon will seek a Section  order in the knowledge it will be rejected by in order to “stir up as much grievance and bad feeling as possible”.Scottish Liberal Democrat Leader Willie Rennie urged the SNP to abandon plans for another referendum. A Scottish Labour source added: “The last thing Scotland needs is more instability and chaos of yet another independence referendum, what our communities need are Labour governments here and in Westminster to end austerity.”An SNP spokesman said: “With the clock ticking down to Brexit date - and with the Tory government incapable of governing and Labour incapable of effectively opposing - the SNP will continue to focus on standing up for Scotland’s interests in the face of a disastrous Tory-driven Brexit and further austerity.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4861492.1548279551!/image/image.jpg","title":"psychologist reflects on apollo moon landing","story":"As a psychologist, I have spent much of my career examining why some people and organisations are especially successful. A few years ago, I became interested in the Moon landings. For most of us, mention of the Apollo landings conjures up images of white-suited astronauts carefully making their way across the lunar surface. While these brave and heroic iniduals are obviously essential to the success of Apollo, they are far from the full story. Watch any documentary about the Moon landings and you will soon see images of Mission Control # a huge room packed with consoles, giant screens and people wearing headsets. This impressive set-up lay at the heart of the space programme. The mission controllers never donned a spacesuit or travelled to a distant world. Instead, they wore everyday clothes, kept their feet firmly on the ground and often hid away from the public gaze. Nevertheless, they were central to the success of the entire enterprise.Most of the controllers came from modest, working-class backgrounds, and were often the first in their families to go to college. Perhaps most surprising of all, they were astonishingly young. In fact, when Neil Armstrong set foot on the Moon, the average age of the mission controllers was just  years. The group had few of the qualities that we commonly associate with success and yet, somehow, they managed to accomplish the seemingly impossible.I wanted to discover why, from a psychological perspective, Mission Control was such a hotbed of success, and I was fortunate enough to be given the opportunity to interview several key controllers. Now in their seventies and eighties, they were all remarkably generous with their time and thoughts. I eventually discovered that their breath-taking achievement was due to a unique mindset partly inspired by the charisma and determination of President Kennedy.In , the Eisenhower administration established the National Aeronautics and Space Administration , ploughing millions of dollars into science education. Two years later, John F Kennedy went head to head with Richard Nixon for the American Presidency. The space race took centre stage, with Kennedy pledging that he would do his best to ensure that America would be first across the finishing line. Kennedy won the day, beating Nixon to the presidency with one of the smallest margins in American history.Kennedy had energy and determination and spoke to a post-war generation that seemed to have lost its way. The young President encouraged every American to reflect on how they could help others and emphasised the value of public service. His inaugural speech ended with a phrase that beautully encapsulated Kennedy’s bold vision: ‘Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.’The President knew that he needed a vision that would engage the hearts and minds of millions of people. He wanted to think bigger and bolder. After many months of meetings, the President eventually supported an idea that resonated with his grand sensibilities: the world’s first manned mission to the Moon. Mindful of the Russians beating America to the punch, Kennedy added a tough time frame, declaring that he wanted a man to walk on the lunar surface before the end of the decade. It was an astonishingly audacious aim.On  September , Kennedy travelled to Rice University’s football stadium to announce his dream of humans reaching the Moon before the decade was out. The event attracted an audience of over , people. Sitting up in the stands that day was a -year-old schoolboy named Terry O’Rourke. Now in his seventies, Terry still remembers seeing Kennedy: “You live thousands of days in your le, but I still have a vivid memory of those few hours.” Terry remembers the stadium being energised by Kennedy’s sense of passion and enthusiasm: ‘I had  per cent confidence in him. He said we were going to go to the Moon and I totally believed him. We all believed him. You can call it optimism, or arrogance, or innocence, but it seemed aseveryone in that stadium really thought that America could pull it off.’Standing a short distance away from Terry was Rice University student and ace basketball player Jerry Woodfill. Originally from Indiana, Jerry had developed a childhood fascination with basketball and eventually won an athletics scholarship to Rice University. Jerry went along to hear Kennedy speak and, like O’Rourke, can remember the blistering heat. At the time, Jerry’s le was not going especially well. He hadn’t obtained great marks in his exams and his basketball training was proving tough. As Kennedy started to speak, Jerry felt something inside him stir. By the end of the speech, he was a changed man. Energised by Kennedy’s passionate vision of being the first to go to the Moon, Jerry ed to Rice University and dropped his basketball career, instead devoting himself to studying electrical engineering. When he graduated, Jerry applied to NASA and was invited to help develop the safety systems on the spacecraft that would attempt to land on the Moon. On  July , just seven years after seeing Kennedy speak at Rice University, Jerry was working in the Manned Spacecraft Center, and helping Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin set foot on the lunar surface.Millions of people across America were inspired and enthused by Kennedy’s vision of going to the Moon, and soon it seemed asthe whole nation was suffering from space fever. Like Kennedy, Americans believed that heading into the heavens would promote freedom and democracy, and so help create a better world for future generations. The same sense of passion motivated many of the scientists and engineers who would eventually transform Kennedy’s vision into a reality, and it was essential to their eventual success. When Flight Director Glynn Lunney was asked about how he felt about being part of the team that eventually put Neil Armstrong on the Moon, he responded: “We loved it. We loved the work, we loved the comradeship, we loved the competition, we loved the sense of doing something that was important to our fellow Americans.” Similarly, Flight Controller Steve Bales said that being part of the Apollo missions was so exciting and so much fun, that he would have worked on the programme evenhe had only been paid enough to cover his living expenses. The controllers’ comments are supported by a wealth of scientic evidence. Robert Vallerand, from the University of Quebec, has produced hundreds of academic papers on the psychology of passion. After studying the lives and minds of thousands of passionate people, Vallerand has discovered that this often-overlooked factor is one of the main secrets of success. When people do what they love, their work feels more like play and they are more likely to keep going when the going gets tough. As a result, they end up being especially productive and successful. In the same way that Kennedy energised an entire nation by announcing his intent to go to the Moon, passion has the power to propel people to incredible heights in both their personal and professional lives. Discovering and unlocking your passion is the key to finding satisfaction in all aspects of your le.

Start Grant also provides pound for all subsequent children ndash meaning there is no cap on the number of children it supports, unlike the current UK government equivalent.In addition, two additional

had no support from the UK government because they were not the first child, will be eligible to get their payment.\"With the Early Learning and School Age Payments this means that for a two child family, the Best Start Grant will provide pound to pound more than they would get under the UK legacy benefit.\"Thats a substantial investment to ensure our under s get the best possible start in le

We have been getting passage plans and times and we have been disseminating that information out to the local fishermen. I believe much of the Inner Sound gear has been cleared from the anticipated path of the rig.“I spent a whole day moving my own gear. We can only hope that the rig sticks to the route given.

So far, the fishermen and KPL are working together to minimise disruption. Hopefully,there are any issues, they can be resolved in good faith afterwards.“Considering this may become a regular occurrence and some fishermen are dedicating considerable time to moving gear clear and then once the rig is in Kishorn will have to dedicate considerable time to reinstating their gear, it would only seem reasonable in future to consider our options for some sort of compensation for the disruption.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/THAI-BOXING-PORTREE-1.jpg","title":"closure of tarbert ferry service to vehicles unavoidable say","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineCalMac’s director of service has  described a planned temporary closure of the linkspan at Tarbert ferry terminal as “unavoidable disruption”.The operator has announced the vehicle service will be out of action for five days across February and March.

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8768911.1547477230!/image/image.jpg","title":"antrim emergency department under extreme pressure","story":"The Northern Health and Social Care Trust has issued advice to residents as  people continue to wait for beds at Antrim Area Hospital.

But unfortunately it is the residents who are suffering from the impact of all of this.“Depending on the direction of the wind the smell can be so bad it makes me feel nauseous and sometimes you just want to get out of the area to get some fresh air.“You cant hang out clothes, open your windows or sit in your garden. It affects your well-being because you are always thinking how long am I going to have to live with this or will I have to sell-up, leave the home that I have put a lot of effort into and have lived in for many years  The possible health implications are also a major concern.”She continued: “It is not just me there are residents in the area who have farms or homes that have been in their families for generations.“There are other issues as well as the odour and I feel like we are the guinea pigs in all of this.“The company have told us they are working to fix the problem and we are meeting with them again on February .”One man who has lived in the area all his le but does not wish to be named, said he will have to think about movingthe situation does not improve.He stated: “The smell at times is terrible. It is a gassy smell but there is also a rotten smell to it, its hard to explain.“We cant open our windows even during the warm weather. We tried to have them open but I had to get up in the middle of the night to close them the smell was so bad.“Last summer when the weather was good everyone was out enjoying their gardens and having barbecues but we had to either sit in the house or go out to eat somewhere.”He continued: “We were told at the start that we would hear, smell or see nothing but that is not the case. “When the smell gets into the house it takes a long time for it to go. I have even had people saying they can smell it when they are driving along the Craigadoo Road and they ask me how do you stick it .“My we loves to garden but she cant because of the smell. I have lived in the area all my le andthis doesnt improve we will have to consider moving.”TUV MLA, Jim Allister, called on the company to “take urgent action”.Mr Allister led a delegation of residents to a meeting with senior management at the plant on Tuesday, January .He said: For several months these residents have been afflicted with unbearable odours from the plant which processes poultry litter.“When seeking planning permission the plant owners assured everyone they were installing state of the art technology which would ensure no smells. The supposed super efficient technology has failed and now local residents are paying the price.”Mr Allister has vowed towith the residents for a further meeting.He said he would also be pressing the Northern Ireland Environment Agency “to step up its supervision and action”.“The present intolerable position cannot continue,” he concluded.Meanwhile, the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs said the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, NIEA, was aware of odour complaints relating to the Anaerobic Digestion facility at Moorfields Road, Tully Quarry.A spokesperson for the Department said: “This facility is regulated by NIEA under a Pollution Prevention and Control Permit and the permit holder is Anaerobic Advantage Ltd.“NIEA agrees that odour management at the facility has not been acceptable and the facility is currently not in compliance with its permit. In response NIEA has been working with the operator in recent months resulting in the operator taking numerous steps attempting to mitigate and resolve the problems. “NIEA staff have visited a number of the residents during this time and we have also worked in close co-operation with the local council Environmental Health officer to obtain information on the odour impact from local residents.“As a result of investigations NIEA issued an Enforcement Notice on  October  requiring the operator to provide detailed proposals to fully resolve the odour problem. The operator has now provided their proposals for additional odour treatment and it is expected this work should be completed by end of January .“NIEA will continue to inspect the site on a regular basis, maintain pressure on the operator to take all necessary actions to minimise odour nuisance and liaise with local residents to keep them updated on progress.”In a statement Stream BioEnergy Ltd said: “We acknowledge and respect the concerns raised and we are continuing to work hard to resolve these as quickly as possible.”  "},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8771209.1547630975!/image/image.jpg","title":"coffee morning to raise funds for samaritans","story":"On Saturday January , from am to .pm, a coffee morning will take place in Banbridge#s Old Town Hall, to raise much needed funds for the Samaritans.Ian Burns, one of the organisers of the event, said: “It is very concerning that Northern Ireland has the highest rate ofmale suicides, within the United Kingdom. This is an issue which needs addressing and one which requires a Strategy, to be put in place.Whilst I like the idea of our local Assembly producing a strategy, it is vital that this statistic is reduced, drastically.”Ian’s we Beverley lost a family member over  years ago, through suicide. Beverley commented: “our family knows only too well the pain and heartache which family and friends endure, following such a tragic loss. For many years, you ask the question why.You also wonder,only they had engaged with someone, and that person had been able to offer some glimmer of hope, which resulted in them not pursuing their course of action. “There have been a number of suicides in our town recently and since the Samaritans are a wonderful organisation, who offer a tremendous telephone helpline service, we thought that it would be worthwhile to try and raise some funds, for this great charity.”The Samaritans’s vision is that fewer people die by suicide. They believe that it is time to look beyond the statistics and into the real lives of these people, so that they and others, can find ways, to reduce any unnecessary deaths. The Samaritans know that when people are in crisis, talking can help that person.Beverley added: “ the money raised at this event, can fund just one phone call to the Samaritans and the Samaritan at the other end of the line is able to provide some hope and results in one person not proceeding with their plan to take their own le,then this event will have been very worthwhile. “I would appeal to anyone who is facing dficulties, no matter what they are, to call the Samaritans on  . The Samaritans volunteers provide a listening ear,  days per year and you can call them any hour of the day, or night,”If you are able to help out in any small way, by baking a few scones tray bakes or by just coming along to have a cuppa and a scone and to give a donation, the organisers will certainly appreciate your kindness.Vintage car show celebrates th birthdayIN PICTURES: Dromore High opens its doors to prospective pupils Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8779110.1548153767!/image/image.jpg","title":"education  ","story":"Students from local schools were thanked by Action MS recently for their fundriaising efforts over the last year.

The story gives the audience a veritable look into the lives of two overworked and underpaid care workers, Francesand Loretta , who look after the housebound -year-old Davy Magee, whose sole joys in le are horse betting, reading the Daily Mirror, and the music of Frank Sinatra.What turns out to be a catastrophic Monday for the pair begins with a small personal disaster for Loretta her son has forgotten his PE gear – she has to double back home and is late for work. In her absence, Francis has already helped Davy to the bathroom. Loretta arrives at Davy’s bungalow and chats to her friend about their respective family lives – Frances lambasts the education system for failing her entrepreneurial son, who has recently found success selling knock-off DVDs, while Loretta worries about her out-of-work husband and their inability to pay for their daughter’s school trip to Alton Towers. All the while Davy hasn’t emerged from the bathroom.When their charge fails to respond to repeated knocks at the door, Francis and Loretta panic, fearing the worst. As it turns out Davy has, in fact, died. Hilarity ensues as the women come to grips with his death and are presented with a further dilemma whatthey waited a few hours before reporting his demise, allowing them to withdraw his pension from the ATM and collect his winnings from the bookies  It would surely solve their money woes.Fearing the consequences of their petty crime, Frances and Loretta scheme up more and more elaborate ways to cover their tracks. Whatthey were caught  Whatthey were blamed for his death – could they be “up there with Myra Hindley and Fred West ”Theatrical comedy often treads a fine line between being side-splittingly funny and desperately exaggerated, but Fly Me To The Moon undoubtedly falls into the former camp. Despite the unfolding madness and slapstick antics, Tumelty and McGibbon manage to retain a level of realism in their fantastic performances. These two absurd characters could easily be ordinary Belfast women.Jones has written and directed a truly magnicent piece of comedy in Fly Me To The Moon but, crucially, the humour is punctuated, at critical moments, by important social commentary. Like many pensioners, the lonely Mr Magee, whose phonebook only contains the number of his bookie, lived a le in isolation – “a le of misery” as Frances says. The protagonists struggle with the daily problems of impoverished Belfast mothers, their crimes paling in comparison to the grand-scale corruption of politicians and bankers often mentioned in pages of their charge’s Daily Mirror. Loretta’s admission that her husband “even seemed smaller” since losing his job almost presented itself as a moment of comedy on the night, drawing a few solitary laughs before its signicance sank in. The preceding paragraph should leave readers in no doubt as to the hilarity of this play – there wasn’t a person at the Grand Opera House whose cheeks weren’t sore by the end.However, audiences will also go home, having had some laughs, with something more to ponder."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"hoax device alert sees residents evacuated in sub zero temperatures","story":"A number of residents from the Springfield Road area in West Belfast have been allowed toto their homes following the discovery of a suspicious object last night.The Springfield Road and Lanark Way were closed for a time as a controlled explosion was carried out by army technical officers on the suspicious object, which was later deeclared to be an elaborate hoax.

That’s all we asked and that’s what got.“Peter Healy, Kristian Healy, Odhran Eastwood, boys like that, James McAuley, Joe Maskey – calm heads. Eoin Nagle was fantastic up front.“It’s going to take a good team to beat us. I’m so proud of the boys – that was some performance.”Naomh Éanna settled into the game quickly and a goal from the impressive Kristian Healy, following good work from Nagle and midfielder Ethan Gibson, put them into a - to - lead on eight minutes.The pace of the Naomh Éanna attack created numerous goal chances in the first half, with Liam Kelly making a last-ditch clearance to deny Odhran Eastwood, but the Ulster side didn’t have long to wait before finding the net again.On  minutes, Joe Maskey and Kristian Healy put centre-forward Ruairi Scott through on goal and, despite Manus Breathnach’s best efforts in the An Spidéal goal, the shot had too much power and trickled into the net.The Galway men were reliant on free-taker Antaine Ó Lao to keep them in touch, with the centre-forward landing four frees in the first half.Yet their defence was being repeatedly unlocked by the sheer pace of Naomh Éanna, who forced several turnovers.With  minutes played, goalkeeper Breathnach was caught in possession around midfield and dropped the ball under pressure from James McAuley and Maskey with the former gathering possession.After talking a few steps forward, Maskey unleashed a shot with the outside of his right boot which carried  yards into the unguarded net.Leading by six at the break, Naomh Éanna never looked in danger of losing the game with Eastwood unerring from frees – finishing with a haul of -, with one from play. An Spidéal’s discipline undermined any slim hopes they had of getting back in the contest, with Eoin Ó Droigheáin and Conal Ó Caoimh picking up black cards either side of Ó Lao’s dismissal as Naomh Éanna held their nerve to claim a seven-point victory.

the public understand that the implications… people might find themselves in a situation of being forced to assume an identy they wouldn’t choose.”Ms Logan said the offer of continued EU citizenship should be extended to all the “people of Northern Ireland” as defined by the Good Friday Agreement, given recognition of the birthright of people in Northern Ireland to identy as Irish or British, or both.“The last situation we wish to see is one where the people of Northern Ireland feel forced to choose their identity based on what they think their post-Brexit entitlements might be,” she said.Ms Logan appeared before the Justice and Equality Committee on Wednesday alongside representatives from the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commissionand Queen’s University to discuss the potential implications of Brexit on human rights and equality.Thank You to the Oireachtas committee on Justice and Equality for the invitation to discuss the human rights and equality implications of #Brexit https:t.co ytRNvE— Emily LoganJanuary , Brian Gormally, director of the NIHRC Committee on the Administration of Justice said thatBrexit goes ahead, it would make the status of Irish citizens born in Northern Ireland “insecure” and they would become “EU citizens living in a non-member state”.He said the first possibility is that the Home Office would regard Irish citizens as “really” British, the second possibility is that the Common Travel Area would sort the issue out, and thirdly that EU citizens living in the UK could apply for “settled status”.“None of these options is appealing as they all involve the implication that those who choose Irish identity are in some way second-class citizens,” Mr Gormally said.“Their rights as full participants in NI le would depend on either a denial of their Irish nationality, as yet unknown bilateral agreements between the UK and Ireland about the Common Travel Area, or paying to ask the Home Office to graciously allow them leave to live in the land of their birth.“The reality is that Irish citizens, born and living in Northern Ireland, have no legal connection to the jurisdiction in which they were born.”Mr Gormally told the committee the Belfast Agreement had not been effectively implemented in UK law.He said legislation was needed in the UK and Ireland to recognise the “particular status of Irish citizens born in Northern Ireland” and their “unequivocal” right to participate fully in that region and in Irish society.Committee member Clare Daly, an Independents  Change TD, described the comments as “shocking and sobering”, adding that they had highlighted “scarily” a legal deficit regarding citizenship rights which needs to be addressed.Ms Logan and her Northern Ireland counterpart Les Allamby, chief commissioner of the NIHRC, warned the committee that the withdrawal of the UK from the EU threatened to undermine the human rights of the Good Friday Agreement.Ms Logan said that since , there had been substantial progress towards a lasting resolution of the conflict in Northern Ireland, but it assumed that the UK and Ireland would continue to be members of the EU.“Although the Joint Report of December  committed to protecting the Agreement ‘in all its parts’, Brexit negotiations currently depart from that common framework creating risks for both rights and remedies,” she said.Mr Gormally said Brexit had already “damaged” and “destabilised” the peace settlement and relations across the island.“Questions of identity and citizenship have been opened up in a way not seen since well before the Agreement – those genies cannot be put back in the bottle,” he said.“We therefore need a set of measures, across the island and, where possible, on the basis of formal treaties between the two sovereign states involved.”"},{"url":null,"title":"karen bradley urged to clarify remarks on future peace funding by dup","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

How is that managed  At the minute it is distributed through the SEUPB- that may continue butBritain is outside Europe it may have some sort of separate management role.\"He added: \"We want to see it continuing because we have still some way to go yet on the peace process. \"Whatever happens around Brexit, both the European and British governments have committed to protecting the peace process.\"An SEUPB spokesman said: \"This has been a matter of ongoing discussions and detailed considerations between the SEUPB and the respective government departments as to the practical arrangements that will be required to ensure that on-going payments will be made to projects.\"The Prime Minister is set to present her new Brexit plan to the House of Commons next Tuesday.She has been in discussions with the DUP and senior Eurosceptic Tories about finding a way forward that would command a parliamentary majority.

extend Article , which would keep the UK in the EU longer, unless a deal is reached by the end of February.Leading Brexiteers have attacked such initiatives, saying they would take control of events

not extend to union leaders.The Labour spokesman said: “As Jeremy set out last week, he is more than ready to engage in talks with the Prime Minister on the basis that no-deal is taken off the table. “I think that has been vindicated by subsequent events.“Unless she makes clear that she is prepared to move and compromise and accept the reality of the position, then she is simply continuing to try

their members.“There must be a majority in Parliament for any deal, including a mechanism to rule out no-deal. “That is going to take place among the political parties.”A Downing Street spokesman said: “The Prime Minister has said that this is a process of engagement across the House of Commons but also with other interested sectors.“She has spoken to business leaders and she will be talking with union leaders.“Issues I expect to be discussed will be around employment rights, environmental standards and those sorts of things.”Unions have been warning of the impact on jobs of a no-deal

We could all learn so much from him.Cllr Walker said he hoped those who targeted Ryanrsquos cookie box would realise the error of their ways and stop again outside the young manrsquos home to pay for the food they took.ldquoWhat happened in the dead of night outside Ryanrsquos home is a sad reflection on those responsible. If they do not pay for the goods. I hope they can be identied so the authorities can have a word, he continued.Cllr Walker, who, along with his Rowallane counterpart Terry Andrews, organises several charity events each year, hopes that his  itinerary will allow him to raise some for Ryan which he can donate to a charity of his choice.He added: ldquoRyan is a shining example to us all. He works hard to help others and it is deeply upsetting that there are those in the community who would target of all things an honesty box.

The group of Independent councillors have held the balance of power on council and can swing the vote on issues vital to our community.Cllr Enright said there was a long tradition of Independent and environmentally-minded candidates winning one of the five seats in the Downpatrick and Lecale electoral area.He pointed to Independent hospital candidate, Raymond Blaney, who won a seat on the former Down Council almost  years ago, and the Green Partyrsquos Bill Corry winning a seat in .ldquoIn the  elections, Raymond nominated Bill and I acted as his election agent, while in the  and  elections, both Raymond and Bill supported my successful election campaigns, explained Cllr Enright.ldquoBoth ex-councillors will be active on my behalf for this Mayrsquos election and Bill is my election agent.Cllr Enright said at the  election to the new Newry, Mourne and Down Council, ldquoa remarkable coalition of activists from community organisations, the farming community and the environmental sector backed him to win the fourth of five seats, with an all time high of first preference votes for an independent candidate in the Downpatrick DEA.He believes the fact that he is one of the few local politicians who works full-time as a councillor has helped his support base in an area where he continues to work closely with community organisations in villages and in Downpatrick..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Family’s plea to change organ donation system  ","story":"THE family of a Downpatrick man who died before he could get a heart transplant hope that an opt-out organ donation system will be soon introduced to Northern Ireland.Tommy McManusrsquos sister has revealed that even in their grief, the family honoured his commitment to organ donation by giving the  year-oldrsquos corneas so that someone  may see one day.Roisin Taggart said that she believes a system where people choose to opt out of donating their organs in the event of the death will increase the number of organs available.The current situation in Northern Ireland, as opposed to Scotland and Wales, is that people who do not wish to donate their organs have to opt-out by registering their details. England is to introduce an opt-out system in .Mrs Taggart said: ldquoWe need to talk about the people who have lost their battle for an organ. We need to put faces to these tragedies and we all need to make sure our families know about our wishes.Mr McManus was buried last Thursday in his home town after he died from multiple organ failure at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle Upon Tyne on December .Despite being put on a ldquosuper-urgent transplant list just days before Christmas, he succumbed to his illness as he waited for a suitable heart to become available.A successful mechanical engineer who travelled the world with his career, Mr McManus became seriously ill in .After six months of investigations, doctors diagnosed that Mr McManus had suffered cardiac arrest.A heart transplant was ruled out as he was too ill at the time, but doctors did all they could for him by fitting a mechanical pump in anticipation of a new heart.Despite being born with a congenital heart defect known as Transposition of the Great Arteries, the former De La Salle High School student had already defied the odds to live a normal le up until then.Raised in the Colmcille Road area of Downpatrick, Mr McManus ed home to be close to his father Tom mdash his mother Colette had passed away earlier mdash sisters Lisa and Roisin and their families.While he waited on the standard transplant list for three years, Mrs Taggart said that her brother bore his illness well.ldquoTommy was unable to work or travel and relied heavily on us for basic day to day things like shopping, cleaning, etc, she said.ldquoHis mobility was extremely limited through fear of over-exertion. Still, he did everything he could to aid his recovery.Tommy and his family were so thankful to the medical team at the Freeman Hospital for saving his le in  that they raised over pound, in order ldquoto pay back the care they had received.Mrs Taggart says that her family know that the doctors ldquodid absolutely everything in their power to keep Tommy alive and had promised that he would have had his heart transplant before Christmas.ldquoThere is a typical wait of between - days for a heart and we just donrsquot know why one didnrsquot become available. But it didnrsquot and his lungs and kidneys began to fail as a consequence of his heart failure, said Mrs Taggart.Despite the efforts of the ldquophenomenal medical team, Tommy required dialysis and ventilation to keep him alive.The medical team were unable to get him breathing on his own again and he was taken off the transplant list.ldquoWe had seen Tommy go through some much and come out of the other side that it never crossed our minds that he wouldnrsquot get a heart, said Mrs Taggart.She and her family now know from personal experience just how hard it is to make a decision to donate a loved onersquos organs.ldquoDue to Tommyrsquos condition, he was only eligible to donate his corneas, she explained.ldquoWhen we were approached about this, my fatherrsquos immediate reaction was, lsquoNo, hersquos been cut into enoughrsquo, despite the fact that Tommy campaigned so passionately about organ donation, and we all knew his wishes.ldquoThankfully myself and my sister were able to be Tommyrsquos voice, and he was able to give one final and very precious gt to someone.ldquoWe desperately hope that the subject of organ donation can be normalised, and that a change in legislation and attitude is seen very soon. We are just so sorry that this change will come too late for Tommy.Mrs Taggart paid a loving tribute to her only brother: ldquoTommy was a fiercely independent, successful and outgoing young man. He was extremely intelligent, loved technology and was a fountain of knowledge.ldquoNo matter where he travelled, he made friends instantly.Mr McManus is survived by his father, sisters, brothers-in-law Bryon and Kieran, nephews Daniel, Paul and Matthew, nieces Emma and Erin, great-nephews Jay and Donal and great-nieces Chloe and Freya.bull To join the NHS organ donation register, go to www.organdonation.nhs.uk.register-your-details.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Finnebrogue to create 90 new jobs with new food ranges  ","story":"THE success of innovative Downpatrick firm Finnebrogue Artisan is set to continue with the opening of a new ultra-modern poundm vegan and vegetarian factory.The latest signicant investment by the award winning company mdash which is one of the districtrsquos leading employers mdash will support  new jobs with the new facility capable of turning over poundm a year.The latest investment by the company is in response to increasing demand for vegetarian and vegan alternatives, with the ersication illustrating the firmrsquos willingness to respond to changing trends across the food industry.The artisan food producer, which has revolutionised the bacon and ham market in the past  months by launching the first mass-produced nitrite-free alternatives, has invested poundm as it looks to step up its meat-free offerings.Finnebrogue has been producing vegetarian and vegan products for three years, but the opening of a brand new factory marks a signicant up-scaling of the firmrsquos meat-free production.The companyrsquos managing director, Brian McMonagle, said Finnebrogue prided itself on providing consumers with ldquodelicious, innovative products.ldquoGiven the increasing demand for vegan and vegetarian alternatives, this new factory was the obvious next step in our extraordinary growth, he continued.ldquoWe are determined not to stand still and are always looking to make food the best it can possibly be, without being bound by the way itrsquos always been done.

An engineer explained that a conductor on a transformer, which had probably been smouldering due to a layer of snow or ice, caught fire.Carryduff, the highest point between Belfast and the Mourne mountains, had falls of up to six inches and drts were reported as deep as one and two feet in some areas.Ballynahinch had several inches fall inside an hour and this worsened as snow continued to fall. Dromara got it bad yet again and Comber reported several inches.The Department of the Environmentrsquos snow ploughs were in use at Carryduff, Ballynahinch and Dromara, and gritting machines were needed on many local roads.In Downpatrick and coastal districts there was sleet and heavy rain mdash and roads were made treacherous when this turned to ice yesterday morning.

If you fail to reach agreement these terms come into effect, that constrains your negotiating power. Why should the other side give you better terms unless you are able to offer them something  inthat is better for them ”Labour MP Kate Hoey summarised his comments as meaning “we are going in with our hands tied behind our back”.The backstop, contained in the proposed EU withdrawal treaty, has been arguably the most contentious aspect of the whole withdrawal process.A transition period kicks in after March , keeping the UK under EU rules until at least the end of .However, the backstop is the set of arrangements which will kick inthe UK and EU have still not finalised a deal by the time that transition arrangement runs out.It would effectively keep the whole UK under EU customs union rules, and keep Northern Ireland in particular under rules concerning the single market. The backstop arrangement can only end with EU agreement.Barrister Isabelle Van Damme, another lawyer who gave evidence, challenged the assumption Europe is not interested in striking a deal.The barrister, who is a member of the Brussels Bar, said: “I have a bit of a dficulty with accepting that as a starting point because there are so many matters in which the EU and the  member states co-operate to the advantage of the respective economies.”After the meeting, the committee chairman Dr Andrew Murrison said: “My committee wants to ensure that the implications of the full range of Brexit outcomes for Northern Ireland, including leaving with no deal, are fully recognised and understood.“The lawyers my committee heard from today laid out the spectrum of legal positions on the backstop, assurances from the European Union and the definition of a hard border. What they made clear is that the complexities of the withdrawal agreement are not free from legal interpretation, which I suspect may lead to continued political fall out in the days ahead.”Marketing firm Fat Fish builds Newry team Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Last November, the News Letter had published a piece penned by Mr Howe shortly after the Withdrawal Agreement was published.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I canrsquot see that there is any way the council can fix this, there just isnrsquot the infrastructure.ldquoItrsquos obvious that it is not going to work, it would be a waste of money to even try it.But another Plassey Street resident, Bat Goddard, said: ldquoTo spend pound, on an experiment, which in  months they could reject, is ludicrous.ldquoWe have the widest street in Penarth here but they want to turn it in to a one-way system.ldquoWe need to stop this folly now.Vale council member Geoff Cox, who is the cabinet member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, has since said a report will be put forward that retains the roundabout and instead looks at enhancing other ideas to solve crossing issues and traffic problems.Cllr Coxsaid: ldquoAs the Cabinet meeting date approached, I became more aware of the strength of local feeling associated with the highway option being proposed, hence my decision to defer the report meaning it was not even considered by Cabinet on January .ldquoI have since reviewed the ious options further, which has included my meeting with local ward members to obtain their detailed views on all options. I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before her move to London she had worked for Paul Rankin at Roscoff’s.Mary-Anne said she had always intended to come home from London and her original intention was to open a café deli. She said the market stall was designed to be a stopgap while she looked for premises but she ended up spending ten years there until she had her twins three years ago.“I was self-employed so I couldn’t take maternity leave from the market for more than eight weeks or I would lose the pitch,” she said.“I was already doing some midweek cookery classes at home in Moy, so I decided to expand on that and convert the garage into a state of the art facility. I really enjoy it and it allows me to work from home.”Courses cost from £ and include tea coffee and scones. Mary-Anne delivers savoury cookery classes as well but explained that baking is far and away the most popular.“I wasn’t actually trained as a pastry chef but there has been such a resurgence in the popularity of baking. That is where the demand is. I would love to do more cookery classes where people can learn to do savoury foods too, however the majority of bookings are for those sweet treats we all love. I like to combine traditional recipes and new flavours. Local, seasonal and organic ingredients are key.”Each course can accommodate - people and are booked out weeks in advance. All recipes andequipment are provided and you get to take home what you make.“My style is informal, it’s all about having fun. I do hands-on and demonstration classes and cater for all levels from complete beginners to more experienced cooks. The aim is to get stuck in.

Ulster Business takes a further look A few years back, the options were fairly limited for NI firms when it came to venture capital funding.Now, between private funds, investors and those backed by Invest NI, the options have widened signicantly for companies – especially those which are high-growth – to seek a cash injection, and get to the next level.Jayne Brady is partner at the Bank of Ireland Kernel Capital Growth Fund NI.“We have been operating in Northern Ireland for five years, and in that period we have seen a growing momentum in the Northern Ireland ecosystem,” she told Ulster Business.“We have  companies in our portfolio, and have invested in eight companies in Northern Ireland as part of that.”And a lot has changed in the last few years, particularly with the sheer number of avenues in which businesses can find access to funding.“There wasn’t an availability of local funds, and it was dficult to get that level from GB, because you needed to reach a certain level.”And where is the investment now going in Northern Ireland  “It’s very strong sectors of expertise, and there is a big FDI element – medical technology, cyber-security. It’s not created in isolation, andan availability of skills.”“More recently, there has been more external investors. We would co-invest, and there is a level of investment from outside players – there are good opportunities.”Jayne says that Kernel Capital tracks investments, and the level and size of deals here has grown. A lot of that has been down to the growth of the Knowledge Economy – which has expanded seven or eight-fold in the last few years.For businesses looking towards funds like Kernel, a typical deal size is from around £m up to £m.One of the largest investments was secured by B-Secur, which has created a biometric technology which uses the human heartbeat to unlock everything from finance and healthcare through to cars and buildings.The company, based at Catalyst Inc, secured £.m from investors including Kernel Capital and ADV.For Jayne, Kernel is looking at companies with turnover of more than £m, which have the ability and scope to be scaled.“We see investment where there is a scaling potential. We look at companies where we are generating £m plus –– which you can scale rapidly, or those with a deep IPfocus. Some companies in services won’t have that level of scale.”Then, there’s the Growth Finance Fund, and Growth Loan Fund II, which provide a total of £m of funding for Northern Ireland’s SMEs.The two new funds are being managed by WhiteRock Capital Partners, a homegrown fund manager set up in  to manage the first Growth Loan Fund, which has committed £m of loans to more than  businesses over the last six years.There’s also the Growth Finance Fund. That will see loans from £, up to £m going to growing businesses. It’s also the first time the British Business Bank has invested in a fund aimed solely at supporting Northern Ireland businesses. The latest figures from the Irish Venture Capital Association, which covers businesses across the island, show venture capital funding has slumped, with a fall-off in major deals and seed funding.Investment was down by almost a third to €min the first nine months of the , confirming a signicant slowdown on .The drop-off in cash accelerated during the year, with the amount raised by tech firms and startups in the last three months just half what it was a year earlier.The figures suggested that the largest segment of funding to see a decline is in deals was above €m .But a Northern Ireland report by Catalyst Inc, published last year, showed companies raised over £m in equity capital in .Elsewhere, flying the flag for venture capital in Northern Ireland for more than  years is Crescent Capital.Run by Colin Walsh, former CBI chairman in Northern Ireland, it’s invested in a raft of the most successful and leading companies here.That includes Andor Technology and Belfast-based biotech firm Fusion Antibodies, which is based at Springbank Industrial Estate in the west of the city.According to Jayne, it’s not just about backing Belfast firms, or FDIs setting up shop in the heart of the city.“We look towards the strong sectoral focuses, and outside Belfast as well. We are very conscious to go to our customers.” That includes holding regular open events across areas such as Newry, Co Tyrone and Londonderry. “We are very open to meeting any companies, and our door is open,” she says.But will Brexit play a part in the future of venture capital funding in Northern Ireland  “We need to be cognisant of any particular indication of any change in regulation,” Jayne says.“From our perspective, because we invest in deep tech, they are somewhat removed from that direct impact.” Elsewhere, there are other revenue streams which firms can look towards, especially when it comes to working capital.That includes Upstream – an alternative finance company run by Judith Totten, which specialises in funding for SMEs.“As Northern Ireland’s largest independently owned and managed provider of working capital, Upstream works collaboratively with organisations’ existing lenders to provide additional capital in a more flexible way to help businesses thrive,” sales director Alan Wardlow says.“Businesses come to us for our responsiveness – our formal credit approvals are achieved in days rather than weeks or months. Upstream has long standing relationships with many local venture capitaland private equity providers as well as the ious Invest NI-backed loan funds and we work closely together to provide solutions for business owners across Northern Ireland“We recently incorporated a trade finance solution into our product range to bridge the gap for organisations who require additional growth funding, quickly, to deliver orders beyond their current capability. This funding is proving incredibly popular alongside our long-standing invoice finance option which gives organisations the ability to release funds against their debtor book thereby freeing up cash flow for businesses to seize growth opportunities as they become available.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/steve_web.jpg","title":"the catalyst to putting northern ireland on the global map","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by Ulster Business Ulster Business speaks to Catalyst Inc chief executive Steve Orr about his hugely ambitious plans for growth, expansion and moulding NI into a world-leader in tech ‘We aren’t going to follow anyone , and we need toto becoming leaders in the world.’It’s immediately clear that Steve Orr has big ambitions for Catalyst Inc. He’s just taken over at the helm of the internationally renowned next generation science park which is home to  innovative knowledge based companies, who are employing more than , engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs and executives, across four locations – and has his sights firmly set on making Northern Ireland a leader in two key innovative areas of tech business.Taking on the role as chief executive of Catalyst from stalwart Professor Norman Apsley OBE, just two months ago, plans are under way to build on the foundations of an organisation which has an estate of , sq ft of agile workspace filled with innovative companies. Catalyst leads the way in innovation and entrepreneurship by supporting the creation and growth of innovation companies in Northern Ireland.“We have a rightful place in leading the world. We aren’t going to follow anybody. Let’s get back to leading the world,” Steve tells Ulster Business.“I am going to take the foundation that Norman left and look at how we leverage that by a signicant factor – in terms of economic activity and dynamism for Northern Ireland.“We need deeper, more strategic partnerships with key institutions. It is through collaboration we can do something to scale and put Northern Ireland on a world map.”Catalyst is the thriving, beating heart of Northern Ireland’s booming technology sector and leading the way in educating and preparing companies and young people for the changing world of work through the impact of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is seeing the impact of new technologies impacting on le, work and society.Formerly known as the Northern Ireland Science Park, Catalyst is an independent not-for-profit organisation operating across the region. It provides agile workspace across four locations – the main site in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the Innovation centres in Londonderry, and Ballymena and most recently opened Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, a co-working space dedicated to the fintech sector in Belfast city centre, which is a partnership with Danske Bank.“The business model we have had for the first  years was the perfect model for that period. We need a new model for the next. We are identying a simple, but ambitious strategy – building on the existing foundation.”Part of the strength of Catalyst is in attracting big international firms, such as Citi, in close proximity to businesses at the very birth of existence. Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports. With % of these exports outside the EU, the Knowledge Economy is the sector least dependent on Europe and should be the key for driving growth at this time of uncertainty.”So, for Steve, his level of optimism and dynamism is clear in his new role, one which he says he is “very fortunate” to have.“It’s a position which comes around so rarely, and whoever gets the opportunity is so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to lead. We have a talented team of people who are all passionate about what is possible. It’s so exciting. The opportunities and possibilities are endless.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/323433.jpg","title":"theresa mays brexit deal voted down business reaction","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by John Mulgrew Business groups have overwhelmingly raised concerns over crashing out of the EU without a deal after Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal plan with Brussels was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs. Ann McGregor, chief executive of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry “The business communities that we represent have always had a erse range of views on what form the UK’s future relationship with the EU should take, however they do agree on the need to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit. “To achieve this we therefore need an agreement that will secure the transition period and protect jobs. As businesses wait to see what happens next in Parliament, it is crucial that those at Westminster move beyond tactical manoeuvring and look at all the options in order to avoid a ‘no deal’s scenario. “Firms are in the dark on too many aspects of le after March . This has already led to many businesses taking action – pausing on recruitment and investment, stockpiling goods, and relocating factories in other parts of the EU. In fact, a third of NI Chamber members are currently putting growth and investment plans on hold in the absence of clarity from Westminster. There is however nothing to stop government acting decisively on areas within their control, such as migration and customs procedures.”  Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “The result this evening will be a cause for concern across the Northern Ireland business community. Northern Ireland businesses desperately need certainty about the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU and will be severely disadvantaged by a no deal. A no deal Brexit means that Northern Ireland households will face higher prices and less choice on the shelves something they can ill afford. “Se need politicians  to coalesce around a workable solution that protects consumers from the costs and disruptions due to the loss of tarf-free and frictionless trade we currently enjoy with partners in the EU. We are now closer than ever to the possibility of a no-deal that will be a disaster for Northern Ireland.” “  Angela McGowan, CBI Northern Ireland director “Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer. A new plan is needed immediately. This is now a time for our politicians to make history as leaders. All MPs need to reflect on the need for compromise and to act at speed to protect the UKs economy. “No deal would immediately put Northern Irish jobs and businesses at risk and jeopardise years of positive economic development and integration across the island.  It must be avoided to protect our all-island economy.”  Glyn Roberts, Retail NI chief executive “This is a disappointing but not unexpected result. While the Prime Minister’s draft Withdrawal Bill was in no way perfect, it was definitely preferable to crashing out of the EU with no deal. “The Government now needs to work on a cross-party basis with Labour and other opposition parties to reach a broader agreement for a withdrawal deal and secure the transition period, protect jobs and a positive future relationship with the EU  Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster “Leaving the EU without a deal would damage the sustainability of the Hospitality industry and impact on the potential growth of Tourism in Northern Ireland. We appeal to our elected representatives to work together in a spirit of consensus government to ensure that a no deal scenario does not happen.”  Tina McKenzie, FSB NI policy chair “With the clock ticking down to Brexit Day in just  weeks, we are running out of time to avoid a clf-edge, no-deal outcome. “A disorderly exit from the EU would be deeply damaging for small businesses, causing disruption to supply chains, increasing costs and stling investment. “A no-deal is something which we simply cannot countenance, so it is imperative that political leaders sharpen their focus and do all they can to reach agreement in the short time available.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"no deal brexit could cost ni economy bn by ","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s economy could suffer a £bn drop in output by  in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, it’s been claimed.

The CBI calculates this could amount to an annual loss of output worth almost £bn by , based on today’s prices. It says “manufacturing activity is particularly important in Northern Ireland, and the agri-food sector, which employs thousands, is likely to be severely impacted as it is particularly exposed to the risk of higher tarfs and trade costs”. Angela McGowan, Northern Ireland director of the CBI, said: “CBI members across Northern Ireland are clear:the new approach to finding a Brexit deal continues to be a game of who blinks first, the Northern Irish economy will pay the price. “The deadlock will only be broken by a genuine attempt by all MPs to find consensus and compromise, not stick to rusting red lines and political conditions. Like the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland is not – and cannot be – ready for no deal. “The projected impact on our economy would be devastating and while business will do all it can to reduce some of the worst aspects, a no deal scenario is unmanageable. “The message from the CBI to our politicians is clear – we must see compromise or the whole country faces the unforgivable prospect of a disorderly Brexit which will affect jobs and livelihoods in Northern Ireland for decades to come.

It’s still lovingly referred to as the Swiss watch stalwart’s sister brand.From there, following the Second World War, he decided now was the time to expand and give the brand an identity of its own.The primary dference between the brands back then, was that Rolex watches carried in-house movements, and that Tudor would offer familiar watch styles, such as the Oyster and Submariner, at a more affordable cost, while its big brother would guarantee the technical, aesthetic and al characteristics, along with distribution and after sales service.But the brand back then, and the company now, has changed radically. Just a few years ago, it tore up the rulebook on its traditional line – moving away from historically similar watches to Rolex, and a few changes from its classical lines, towards a tight range of watches, bringing in the old and the new.The core model is the Black Bay. A millimetre larger than the Rolex Submariner, it’s a slightly chunkier affair, without treading into the excessive sizes of some other brand’s modern timepieces. It also offers a new ‘’ –  a smaller mm watch, which fits right in as a cheaper alternative to the Submariner, a Black Bay Chronograph and the Pelagos – a larger, more modern affair made out of titanium.The brand also comes in at a time when Rolex prices have shot up, considerably. Many of the most desirable models in the Rolex line have a waiting list – with second-hand prices outpacing the new book price.Tudor itself has also embraced this burgeoning demand, releasing its own GMT watch – with so-called ‘Pepsi’ blue and red bezel. Currently, Rolex’s own model – aside from the sizeable price dference – will mean joining a waiting list. A WEEK ON THE WRIST Tudor Heritage Black Bay Sitting as Tudor’s poster-boy or flagship in its range, the Black Bay is a e watch which melds the styling and inspiration of, possibly the most recognisable watch in the world, the Rolex Submariner, with a larger case, while adding patina on the hands and markers.There’s no crown-guard, ala Rolex. This time, it’s a larger, screw-down, with an etched Tudor rose – formerly the brand’s logo.Overall, the Black Bay’s case is brushed, including the caseback, with the finish smoothly transitioning into a polish around the sides and crown.The sapphire crystal glass is slightly domed, sitting around a millimetre off the face off the watch. Around the edge, the bezel is a solid, thick and satisfyingly sold -click version, with red triangle and lume dot.This version is on a steel bracelet, but is also available on a leather or fabric band, along with red dial and blue – the latter without the patina on the markers and hands.The bracelet is a stand-out characteristic of the piece, certainly in terms of build quality. The three-piece links have a lug width of mm, tapering to around mm. It’s brushed, but polished and riveted along the side. On the clasp, there’s a double-locking system, with a thoughtful inclusion of the Tudor shield logo into the mechanism, along with three points of micro-adjustment.This watch, available from jeweller Lunn’s, spent several days on my wrist – from the office, to out-and-about and around the house. It’s a comfortable piece to wear – balanced between a bit more heft than its more expensive sibling, but never straying into the realm of gaudy or garish.After a few hours, it felt very much like one of my own. I did miss the date, however, but those after additional complications or ality could look to the chronograph version, or the larger Pelagos.The Black Bay is a well-balanced piece – easily sitting at the centre of a Venn diagram between casual and formal.The brand itself is firing everything at the new range, with endorsements from David Beckham and Lady Gaga, aimed at a younger generation with disposable income to spare. While that may not appeal or speak to the horological purists, with the in-house movement, attention to detail, provenance and mixture of the traditional and modern, it’s likely to build a fresh reputation as a ‘watch fan’ timepiece, and for those who have no issue explaining to those admiring the chunk of steel on their wrists, that it isn’t a Rolex.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
