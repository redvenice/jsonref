It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.It said a rapid recovery should be expected next year, leading to its scenario being viewed as relatively rapid V-shaped.“This is perhaps still a V but perhaps a fairly lopsided V,” he said, referring to the shape of the economy’s downturn and recovery. “The risks to that probably … lie to the downside rather than the up and as I say, a rather more protracted recovery even than the one that I have mentioned.”Haldane’s recasting of the Bank’s outlook follows a poll of City economists last week that showed they view the downturn over the coming months as less severe than Bank policymakers.This prediction came as IHS Markit said its composite index – measuring activity in the dominant services sector and in manufacturing – rose to 28.9 in May’s preliminary from 13.8 in April’s final reading, revealing a stronger bounce back in business confidence than earlier estimates. PMIs below 50 represent a decline in activity.Speaking at a CBI webinar on Tuesday, Haldane also played down the prospect of an emergency cut in interest rates to below zero as a way to support the economy through the coronavirus crisis.It followed comments last week by Bank of England governor that the central bank would consider pushing borrowing costs below zero if it considered that the policy would help businesses stay afloat.Haldane said the key factors for the Bank to consider were the consequences of negative interest rates for Britain’s banks and lenders, which would trigger a squeeze on margins, and how such a move would affect confidence in the broader economy.“Those are the aspects that we will look at. To be clear, reviewing and doing are different things, and currently we are in the review phase and have not reached a view remotely yet on the doing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2671565d60b8a9b92e95531802fb7a6bf2c7d5c/0_0_2623_1573/master/2623.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6e75fb900a94e419b0761776bc65de7","title":"british land writes down value retail arm more than quarter","story":"Shop closures due to coronavirus lockdown push company to £1.1bn annual lossBritish Land, which owns shopping centres including Sheffield’s Meadowhall and Drake Circus in Plymouth, has written down the value of its retail portfolio by more than a quarter due to the impact of the coronavirus.The government’s implementation of a nationwide lockdown in late March helped push the company, which also owns office properties in London, to a £1.1bn loss for the year to the end of March.

The price of oil suffered an historic market crash last month when US oil prices turned negative for the first time.The IEA said the decline in investment is “staggering in both its scale and swiftness” and will impact every major sector, from fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal to renewable sources including wind and solar power.In a report, the IEA said the decline in investment in areas such as clean energy technology could undermine the transition to renewable, sustainable sources of energy.“The crisis has brought lower emissions but for all the wrong reasons,” said Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director. “If we are to achieve a lasting reduction in global emissions, then we will need to see a rapid increase in clean energy investment. The slowdown in spending on key clean energy technologies also risks undermining the much-needed transition to more resilient and sustainable energy systems.”Oil accounts for most of the decline as lockdowns and travel curbs across the globe wipe out demand, with investment due to plummet by a third, about $250bn, this year. Investment in shale, already under pressure as debt mounts among fracking companies, will fall by half this year.The IEA said this decline in demand will mark a historic moment, with global consumer spending on oil due to fall below the amount spent on electricity for the first time.The IEA said falling energy demand, lower prices and a rise of non-payment of bills will mean energy revenues going to governments and energy companies will fall by more than $1tn this year.Financially stretched energy companies are cutting costs, including in new and existing energy projects, to fortify balance sheets.Investment in renewable energy has proved to be more resilient than fossil fuels. However, the IEA said that in the first quarter the number of wind and solar projects given the financial go-ahead fell to a three-year low. Spending on rooftop solar panels by homes and businesses has been strongly affected, it said.Birol said the longer-term knock-on effect of reduced investment could threaten the ability of electricity grids to handle future supply shocks.“Electricity grids have been a vital underpinning of the emergency response to the health crisis, and of economic and social activities that have been able to continue under lockdown,” said Birol. “These networks have to be resilient and smart to ward against future shocks. Today’s investment trends are clear warning signs for future electricity security.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d9fd0744d046505b863e6b5cd7e05c6c216cce4/29_465_4522_2715/master/4522.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fcc4cceb85ff9651e599318c7112814","title":"uk corner shops and independent grocers ring up 63 per cent rise in sales coronavirus","story":"Sales at independently owned retailers, many of which trade under brand names such as Spar, Londis and Budgens, soared by more than double the pace of the fastest growing grocery chain, the Co-op, in the three months to 17 May, according to the latest grocery market data from the analysts Kantar. Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said more shoppers – 1.6 million – had switched to buying groceries online so far this year than in the previous five years.He said: “While the gains made by online shopping are unlikely to be sustained at these levels, the crisis has certainly accelerated the move towards online. The grocers have attracted a new group of customers, in particular older demographics, and we expect some of them may continue using online services and enjoying the convenience that home delivery provides.”The 75th anniversary of VE Day on 8 May was the biggest shopping day of the month, when £488m was spent on groceries as families stocked up for bank holiday barbecues.However, McKevitt said it was not all good news for the supermarkets. The figures do not include spending on takeaway sandwiches, drinks and other “on-the-go” foods sold by supermarkets, which usually add up to £1bn of sales over the three-month period. Sales of those items have sunk as commuting has been replaced by working from home or being furloughed.“While these are bumper figures, it remains true that the overall picture for some grocers will be less positive as supermarkets continue to feel the impact of a considerable reduction in on-the-go spend on meals, drinks and snacks,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/861e832f76b1ce7a6aa41ac9b473ab6a980837f1/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45a3e4064149edb143d2e67cbb957964","title":"stock market hong kong china dollar sterling yuan christine lagarde ecb covid 19 ftse 100 business live","story":"Live coverage of business, economics and financial marketsIn total the coronavirus government support for UK workers has come to £21.8bn, if you add together the money paid for furloughed employees and income support for self-employed workers.More than 10m British workers have been given some form of income support, if furlough numbers are added to those who have claimed self-employed support*.That would represent about a third of all workers being given income support, based on pre-lockdown data from the Office for National Statistics showing 33.1m people in employment in the UK.The total cost of battling the crisis will be much higher, thanks to the loans and grants given to businesses.The effects on the Exchequer will be even more pronounced because of the drops in income tax and corporation tax paid.

Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi have announced new plans to work together more closely on developing and producing cars, as they seek to move forward with an alliance that was severely dented by the dramatic arrest and flight of Carlos Ghosn.The new plan for the alliance, of which Ghosn was the architect, will see one of the carmakers leading on each type of vehicle and region where they are seen to be a “leader”, while the others follow.That will mean less doubling up on costs, long perceived to be a problem in companies that are nominally working together. Industry experts have joked that the electric cars developed by Nissan and Renault had little in common other than door handles - meaning the alliance was effectively bearing expensive development costs twice.The new plan could see them save costs during the coronavirus pandemic, which has seen carmakers close factories and threatens to severely impact sales for the next year and beyond.As expected, European shares have gained at the opening bell.Good morning, and welcome to our live, rolling coverage of business, economics and financial markets.Global stock markets rallied on Wednesday morning as the improving outlook on lockdown easing for the most part outweighed concerns over China’s imposition of new security laws on Hong Kong.Here’s the ’s report from Hong Kong this morning:Thousands of armed police have flooded the streets of Hong Kong in an unprecedented show of force to prevent protests against a law criminalising ridicule of China’s national anthem.At lunchtime rallies police fired pepper bullets into crowds, appearing to hit one reporter, and detained dozens of protesters.

It’s a good question, one we might ask of any government at any time. But it feels particularly appropriate for Dominic Cummings and the government he advises, which seems to think the rules it makes for the rest of us don’t apply to its members. The chief aide’s recent decision to flout the lockdown is a case in point: he exists on a different planet to ours, where he abides by a different set of rules.Political philosophies encompass beliefs about just a few things: equality, liberty, authority and so on. Like musical notes, this small number of ideas can be assembled in all sorts of ways. The keynotes of Conservatism are order and inequality. The song they make is about how, when everyone remains in their rightful place in the hierarchy, things are stable, harmonious and good. But the song can dramatically shift into a minor key: some bad people have messed things up they have put things in the wrong order we have to get rid of them and make everything great again.Who these bad people are depends on the moment in question. Today it’s those who work with words, ideas and rules: the “politically correct” journalists, academics and writers foisting their opinions on society the lawyers and judges subverting the peoples’ will the government bureaucrats working in “the deep state”. Disgust at such people is one of the major forces in politics, uniting flat-earth fanatics with those who think climate change is overstated, that feminism and antiracism have gone “too far”, or that government is a scam to redirect your taxes to undeserving foreigners.Johnson has often made noise about “reforming” the civil service, neutering the power of judges, starving the BBC and cracking down on humanities graduates. Some of this was a political tactic for building a new electoral coalition. But Cummings’ hostility to those he caricatures as “People in SW1 … babbling about gender identity ersity” is real. Conservatism is in part a rejection of abstract ideas such as human rights, equality and the European Union, in favour of more concrete things such as family, home and England: that’s why a “citizen of the world” is a “citizen of nowhere”. For a long time, Conservatives countered abstraction with celebrations of custom, habit and tradition. More recently, they contrasted it with the “natural” and “spontaneous” order of the market. Today, at least in Cummings’ world, abstract thinking must give way to The Data.The Data – analysed by behavioural economists and evolutionary psychologists – has confirmed what Conservatives always thought: human nature is flawed. We all try to be rational but nature overrules us. People succumb to “groupthink” and primal “chimp politics”. But salvation is at hand. With the help of computation, statistics and modelling, we have the information about social and natural systems, and the capacity to understand their laws. We can’t make things perfect, but we can identify risks and manage threats: an asteroid collision, an economic crisis or, indeed, a pandemic. In this way, the traditional Conservative belief in providence is transformed into faith in artificial intelligence.But – and this is the key thing – not everyone can make sense of the message conveyed by advanced systems such as big data and AI. In Cummings’ view, the greatest fault of those who “chat about Lacan at dinner parties” is their interest in words, interpretation and critique, when they ought to be learning about numbers, probabilities and prediction. The heroes of his political philosophy are the “super-forecasters” and the engineers able to ine meaning in The Data. It follows that the best kind of government is the one designed to find those “misfits and weirdos”, lure them off Reddit and make them over into anti-philosopher kings. In the shadow of The Data, the innumerate fools in parliament, the press and academia have nothing of value to add.From this worldview it’s natural for Cummings to think that the rules he has helped to make don’t apply to him. His actions aren’t hypocritical – they’re entirely consistent with his conservative philosophy. Conservatism has always been, at root, a defence of inequality. It aims to separate the best from the rest and ensure that the best are on top. The line iding sheep from goats can be drawn in many places: between older and younger, entrepreneurs and wage-earners, hardworking families and idle benefits cheats, natives and foreigners.Cummings draws this line between his kind of clever people who understand the world and the rest of us who are just guessing. And because of our herding behaviour and suboptimal decision-making, we the people are why Cummings thinks that people like him need to be in government. Through The Data, government can know us intimately. It can know exactly what we want, thanks to the information we freely give away online. And it can communicate back to us – unhindered by biased reporters. ‘“We’re particularly interested in deep experts on TV and digital,” said Cummings when advertising for new advisers, “people who have worked in movies or on advertising campaigns. There are some very interesting possibilities in the intersection of technology and storytelling.” The priests of The Data will work out what needs to be done, what we need to be told, and how we should be told it. Then we will do what The Data dictates.Does Cummings think he is better than the rest of us? Of course he does. Elites never believe the rules they have ined apply to themselves. We who aren’t gifted must do what The Data says. But those who lead us – people like Cummings – have to make the hard calls and decide who to sacrifice in the battle to protect us from our own imperfections. Naturally, people like that can measure their own risks and, as he insisted in his press conference, exercise their own judgment. Those who make the rules cannot be bound by them, especially in what they can declare an “exceptional situation”. We shouldn’t be so crass as to criticise them or, worst of all, “politicise” what they do.It is likely that we have at least four more years of this government. If Cummings remains in post, I want to see how his experiment plays out. I want to see what, in the end, The Data tells us. Will it show that he was its true prophet? Or will it confirm that he is just like the rest of us: vain, rash, a herd animal – another humanities graduate playing instinctive “chimp politics”? My intuition is that you don’t need to be a super-forecaster to make a good guess.• Alan Finlayson is professor of political and social theory at the University of East Anglia"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9330f08e0610f273bcb0974e44ddc92480a1efa/0_165_4188_2512/master/4188.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=893d51b134a1bcca4bcaa6ae8c91115a","title":"public health trust dominic cummings second wave","story":"If the public is no longer reassured by the government’s social distancing measures, I fear a second wave of coronavirusThirty-five years ago, when I was working as a newly qualified doctor, I extracted a sausage from a woman’s windpipe. She was, in the eyes of the ambulance crew who brought her in, probably beyond saving, possibly already dead. The woman had inhaled the sausage while laughing at a joke she’d been telling her family. I leant over her, used a laryngoscope to peer into her larynx, saw the sausage and extracted it. She took a big gasp, looked around in surprise, and after a short recovery, walked out of A\u0026ampE. I felt a surge of pride. I was a proper doctor. I’d saved someone’s life. My mum understood what I did for a living.After working as a clinician for many years, I became a public health researcher and worked on tuberculosis and emerging infectious diseases for about 25 years. I never got, with the same immediacy, the sense one gets from saving a life. But I suspect that through my research I’ve touched far more lives than I could ever have hoped to in clinical medicine – even if those lives remain anonymous, distant, opaque. In public health, the stakes of life and death are more distant – but no less impactful.Take, for example, Andrew Wakefield, whose fraudulent 1998 study falsely claimed a relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism. Though Wakefield was never charged with any criminal offence, his study led vaccination rates around the world and herd immunity to fall. Wakefield’s actions fractured trust in public health functions and institutions. His misconduct resulted in an incalculable number of deaths. Herein lies the difference between medicine and public health. One is proximal, the other distant. One is felt with raw emotion, the other has a slow and less measurable burn.In the frenzied debate around Dominic Cummings, many of us have focused on the hypocrisy of his actions and of Boris Johnson’s decision to keep him in post. And this hypocrisy is undoubtedly present. But hypocrisy is common in politics. There is something much more important happening here. Cummings’ actions have led to a loss of trust.Public health is about trust, a largely unwritten contract between all of us and the state. We need to trust that we each have our own and others’ interests at heart, that we share a sense of solidarity and will all do our best to protect the most vulnerable among us. We need to know that the state shares in this. Rules and regulations are insufficient to police this commitment. We need trust. Without trust, the state has few remaining tools at its disposal. It may, when struggling, draw on its coercive powers. After the Wakefield campaign, when measles outbreaks began to occur, discussion of mandating vaccination was seriously considered. In New York City, in the 1990s, because the state didn’t believe people would take their treatment for tuberculosis, patients were locked up on an island. The history of coercion and public health is long and ignominious.The esteemed medical historians Dorothy and Roy Porter once wrote that “the subtle art of the administratively possible” was at the heart of enforcing public health policies that compromise inidual freedoms. Where this “art” falls short, the state may attempt to compel people through other means. Provisions are almost always made when new public health threats emerge. Coronavirus is no different. New regulations from March enabled the police to compel people to stay at home and avoid nonessential travel. The home secretary, Priti Patel, explained, “The prime minister has been clear on what we need to do: stay at home to protect our NHS and save lives … That’s why I’m giving the police these new enforcement powers, to protect the public and keep people safe.” The challenge is, as always, enforcement. The police are asked to apply common sense and discretion. When discretion seems unfair and the weight of the state bears down more heavily on some of us than others, trust is eroded. And blame begins to rise.When the burden of inconvenient and often distressing measures, such as staying at home, not visiting elderly or dying loved ones or attending the burial of family members, falls on some shoulders but not all, trust begins to fray. And, in the epidemiological parlance of the day, the reproduction number of an infection, R, begins to rise. An epidemic climbs higher and faster as observance of the rules disintegrates.Back in the 1990s I wrote a book, From Chaos to Coercion, reflecting on the challenges that arise in public health and infectious diseases when we no longer trust each other or our institutions to do the right thing. In particular, I explored the outbreak of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis in New York City. What I found most striking was that the structural causes of the terrible epidemic received little attention, and the response drew on assessments of the potential behaviour of people rather than an objective assessment of the direct threat they posed. (The city’s laws were changed to incarcerate those who were assessed as potentially posing a threat in the future.)And the institutions whose principle purpose was to care for the most vulnerable, in this case often homeless people and those with Aids, were failing completely in their task. The image of the affluent Connecticut commuter feeling threatened by a contagious disease carried by a homeless man resonated through the epidemic. Fear replaced any dormant sense of solidarity. And fear was associated inextricably with blaming iniduals and institutions. Just as night follows day, blame and fear follow the loss of trust.I worry that a surge of infections and deaths will result from the public’s loss of trust in social distancing measures. And when this happens, I fear the government will slip down the slope and resort to more coercive measures. As our collective commitment to social distancing and quarantining measures waivers, we risk entering a vicious circle. Cases of Covid-19 climb, we become ever more aware of others failing to follow public health guidelines, the epidemic rages faster and chaos ensues.Epidemics are not linear. In an attempt to halt a second wave, the government would likely resort to stricter police powers and a wider imposition of existing laws. But this would be futile. Older and more vulnerable people – those dependent on our sense of solidarity – would by then have been sacrificed.The effects of Dominic Cummings’ and Boris Johnson’s actions will, to my mind, be the same as those of Wakefield. The consequences of their malign influence on trust and public health will persist for years. And the cost in human lives will likely be incalculable.• Richard Coker is emeritus professor of public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e80c23e59cebd36a24af96ff173c675025a96889/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d7a0444eff56b6f4992f911ee7ebc75","title":"great british art quiz potteries museum art gallery stoke","story":"The Potteries Museum and Art Gallery set today’s quiz, which enables you to explore the art collection of British museums closed due to Covid-19 – while answering some fiendish questions along the wayThis quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists.

With the second coronavirus peak projected to take place in autumn, many institutions are already planning to move at least their first semester online. Whatever happens, universities are not going to look how their students expect for some time.Katie Barrett, a student at the University of West England, has enjoyed her online experience so far. “I’m still getting all my lectures and seminars, so the learning itself hasn’t been disrupted much,” she says. “My lecturers are doing extra Q\u0026ampAs via Zoom, for example, so some of the material actually feels more accessible.”These positive experiences may permanently transform universities, believes Vijay Govindarajan, a business innovation professor at Dartmouth College in the US. “Universities can create high-quality multimedia experiences online. Lectures can be recorded in HD and reused, so more of professors’ time can be spent on interacting with students. This will improve the overall quality of learning,” he says. “Online learning might have been a long time coming in higher education, but it’s here to stay.”Online learning shouldn’t be seen as a quick-fix solution to the pandemic. Allison Littlejohn, director of the UCL Institute of Education’s knowledge lab, cautions that quality online courses take time and effort to create. “It’s crucial the online learning experience is well-designed and we don’t simply shift existing content from one format to another,” she says.Charles Craig, who studies music business at Leeds College of Music, worries about the lack of networking and entrepreneurship opportunities if the rest of his degree is delivered online. “Engaging with the content and tutors is more difficult online. I hate the distortion you get on video calls and the awkward sound delays make it hard to speak at the right time,” he adds.“Learning remotely isn’t the same as the visceral experience of expressing and debating ideas in a physical space,” agrees Jesper Ryynänen, a student at the London School of Economics (LSE). “I chose LSE for its public events and renowned speakers, yet there’ll be none of that this semester.”Some students may feel that paying the same fees for digital versions of their courses would be poor value. The tuition for Ryynänen’s one-year MSc at the LSE is £29,000 – far more expensive than fully online options from renowned names like Harvard University and Wharton Business School. Craig doesn’t think he would have applied had he known. “Shorter courses and masterclasses run by industry experts might have been a better option than an online degree,” he says.Craig’s view reiterates an international survey in 2019 commissioned by Pearson, which suggested that today’s learners are increasingly interested in vocational and shorter programmes, especially online. If they move online, universities will have to compete with new formats, including coding bootcamps like Le Wagon, Codeworks and Northcoders. These offer quicker, cheaper courses in subjects such as web development and data science with in-built industry connections. But moving university courses online due to the coronavirus pandemic is expected to cost the higher education sector £1bn. UK universities will be keen to ensure their investment in digital transformation is for the long term, especially after years of lagging behind universities in other countries.One barrier could be cultural change. When Times Higher Education surveyed 200 university leaders in 2018, all of them agreed that online learning could never replace the physical university experience. Kendrick Oliver, a professor at the University of Southampton, agrees. “Nothing can replace the classroom experience. Being physically together in a space means rich communication, and more energy and experimentation from everyone involved. But he acknowledges: “Habit and routine are powerful. Months of online working will make digital more of a default.”There are also reputational risks to moving online, says Jovana Karanovic, a researcher in digital platforms at VU Amsterdam in the Netherlands. “Online learning may produce a precarious gig economy to connect students and educators,” she explains. “This competitive, fragmented learning landscape could raise accountability issues, prompt a loss of academic expertise and lower teaching standards.” She adds that universities will also need to invest in proper staff training.This may echo the recent shift in the UK away from the “boarding school” model of higher education and towards more students commuting to campus. Research by the Sutton Trust highlights that the number of students choosing to live at home while they study has increased, largely to save money. Prior to the pandemic, some innovative UK universities already offered blended learning. Among these is the University of East Anglia (UEA), which introduced online modules to reach the most disadvantaged students, and plans to scale them up post-pandemic. Its crime fiction MA, for example, is delivered primarily through virtual learning but includes intensive “residencies” on campus to meet industry professionals and participate in a national crime fiction festival.Henry Sutton, designer of the crime fiction programme, says the university recognised the potential of new course approaches early on. “The MA launched in 2015 using the technology we already had,” he explains. “Students tell us they like the flexibility, they find the residential aspects valuable, and their communication with peers is more considered.”Meanwhile, other universities are following suit. A consortium of 10 universities led by Coventry was recently awarded £3.7m to develop partly online postgraduate conversion courses in artificial intelligence and data science. According to Sarah Barrow, UEA’s pro-vice-chancellor for arts and humanities, the pandemic represents “a revolutionary moment”. She expects the shift online to kickstart a lifelong learning agenda. This has already been discussed as a way to skill up employees whose jobs will become automated in the future, but which universities have been slow to implement.The challenge now is the scale and pace of change. “We’ve adapted and brought forward our plans, but this is disruption on an unprecedented scale,” says Barrow. “It normally takes two years to create a new course or module. Now we’re designing and launching online options in a matter of weeks.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f0235f2b013a2d8095220b890c31ea06afe4ca4/0_121_3748_2248/master/3748.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed00daa9f885fad2f278d7434f24d8e5","title":"hadley climate centre turns 30 the human fingerprint is everywhere","story":"Exclusively compiled data from the Hadley Centre’s supercomputer shows alarming climate trajectory The human fingerprint on the climate is now unmistakable and will become increasingly evident over the coming decades, the UK Met Office has confirmed after 30 years of pioneering study.The data highlights how a young generation has grown up in a climate unprecedented in a millennium. Future projections suggest that by mid-century a 60-year-old Briton is likely to be living in a climate 1.2C warmer than when they were born.Scientists at the Hadley Centre, which has been on the global frontline of climate monitoring, research and modelling since it opened in 1990, said early theories about fossil-fuel disruption have been proven by subsequent facts.“The climate now is completely different from what we had 30 years ago. It is completely outside the bounds of possibility in natural variation,” said Peter Stott, a professor and expert on climate attribution science at the centre.In the Hadley Centre’s early projections, he said, scientists forecast 0.5C of warming in the UK between 1990 and 2020 as a result of emissions from oil, gas and coal: “We got it spot on.” With new heat records being broken with increasing frequency, he said global temperatures were now above any level in the Met Office measurements since 1850, or indirectly calculated through tree rings going back thousands of years. Carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere are also higher than anything seen in million-year-old ice cores. “We are seeing an unprecedented climate,” Stott said. “The human fingerprint is everywhere.”The impact was less obvious in 1990, when the centre opened in conjunction with the publication of the first report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - both were overseen by the UK scientist John Houghton, who died earlier this year.At the inauguration, the then prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, said the UK needed a world-leading climate centre to assess the “serious consequences” of greenhouse gas emissions. “What it predicts will affect our daily lives. Governments and international organisations in every part of the world are going to have to sit up and take notice and respond,” she said.Thatcher, who studied science at Oxford, needed little convincing, but she had to overcome a sceptical cabinet. Atmospheric physicists had been warning oil companies and policymakers about the dangers of fossil fuels for decades, but the “greenhouse effect” was still a relatively novel concern for the broader public. Nobody felt a change. The world had already warmed by about half a degree from pre-industrial levels, but this was low enough to be within natural variation.Few people knew the difference between short-term “weather” and the “climate”, which is usually measured over a much longer period of 30 years.Back then, there was also considerable scepticism about the ability of meteorologists to forecast change, even on a daily basis. Memories were fresh of the BBC weatherman Michael Fish infamously reassuring viewers that fears of a hurricane were unfounded, just hours before the fiercest storm in generations hit the UK.“It was unglamorous” recalls James Murphy, a science fellow who was posted to the Hadley Centre from the beginning. “But the mood in the first decade was one of great excitement, because it was a chance to do a lot of pioneering research in a growing field.”As acceptance and importance grew, so did scepticism. Critics, often funded by oil firms, pushed back against climate science because they did not like its political and economic implications. Ahead of the climate summits in Kyoto (1997) and Copenhagen (2009), fossil fuel companies funded misinformation campaigns to cast doubt on climate models.The Hadley Centre remained focused on science. Researchers expanded and refined their models by incorporating new knowledge on biological carbon cycles and the likely impact of fossil fuels not only on temperature, but on Arctic ice, sea-level rise, flooding, storms, droughts and other atmospheric phenomena.Supercomputer advances enabled much greater precision. Early models mapped the impact on grid cells of 300km on each side. Today that is down to 2.2km, which allows detailed predictions of which stretches of river basins and coastlines will need the most protection.Researchers are discovering the impacts go far beyond the initial focus on average temperature. Heat records are being set with increasing frequency. Rainfall patterns are noticeably shifting beyond natural variation. Arctic ice is shrinking faster than expected. The rising seas have already left some places, such as Fairbourne in Wales, below spring-tide levels.By 2050 – the year the UK plans to achieve carbon neutrality – the direct impact on Britain will be moderated by the surrounding ocean and there may be opportunities to plant new crops, but these benefits will be dwarfed by trade disruption, migration, humanitarian disasters and shifting ecosystems.“Overall it’s bad. The negatives outweigh the positives,” said Richard Betts, a Met Office scientist who is leading scientific analysis for the next UK climate change risk assessment. “It stands to reason that if the world keeps gets hotter and hotter, sooner or later we’ll reach the point where it is first uncomfortable and then hard to function. This won’t be seen in the UK, but in parts of the world that are already hot and humid it could increasingly get too hot to function.”The Hadley supercomputer calculates myriad possible pathways depending on how much carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases enter the atmosphere. The good news is that the worst-emissions scenario, known as RCP 8.5, is considered less likely than before because the global coal industry has not grown as feared. The bad news is current emissions trends (which lie between the RCP 4.5 and RCP 6 pathways) could take the planet to 2C warmer than pre-industrial levels by mid-century, which will increase storm damage, heatwaves, sea-level rise and the already great risk that the Arctic will be ice-free in summer.The climate trends are based on multiple-year averages rather than year-on-year comparisons, which are more subject to natural variation.Even the current best-case scenario – RCP 2.6, which is roughly in line with the Paris agreement – would leave the world hotter than today.“What stands out is that even in the lowest current scenario, we get warming. We’ll need to prepare and adapt,” says Jason Lowe, the head of climate services at Hadley. He predicts extreme summer heatwaves, such as those seen in 2018, will become the norm rather than an exception.“As a scientist, I want to narrow the uncertainty so the information is as good as possible so we can plan. I think of the generations to come. I have a nine-year-old daughter. I find myself wondering which of these pathways we will be on when she is 80 or 90.”More extreme results are possible at both ends of the spectrum. The next set of climate assessments will introduce a more ambitious best-case scenario (RCP 1.9) that would mean a faster transition to zero-carbon energy and a greater chance of holding temperature rises below 1.5C. But the situation could worsen rapidly if the climate hits tipping points, such as the collapse of the west Antarctic ice sheet.“There are still dangers out there that we don’t fully understand,” said Stott. “Much of the uncertainty lies on the bad side. It could be terrifying. Can we grow enough crops to feed the population? Can we cope if some places are battered by storm after storm?”Such concerns explain why the anniversary cannot be entirely triumphant. Despite growing evidence of climate risks, governments have been slow to act. Apart from downward blips such as the 2008 financial crisis and the coronavirus lockdown, emissions have steadily increased. The Hadley Centre’s work now is not only about predicting impacts, but preparing for them.“Reality has proven that what we were saying 20 to 30 years ago was right. As scientists, that is vindication. But on a personal level, I hoped we would track a different emissions trajectory from where we are now,” Stott said.“The worry is that we are now taking risks globally that we don’t fully understand ... there will be no winners of climate change if we continue. Scientific evidence has been around for a while. It is time it was taken seriously.”Observed September Arctic sea ice extent from HadISST.2.2.0.0 (selected as single source from Met Office climate dashboard.)

Gale first got out on a shrimp boat when he was 12. “Mama wouldn’t let me go any earlier, but from 12 years on out – every weekend I wasn’t in school or summer vacation I was on a shrimp boat.” He spent the next 20 years learning from his dad, who shrimped for 45 years.“What was an average day like?” I ask.“I’d leave about 4.30 in the morning and get to the dragging grounds about 6.30, maybe 7am. I’d put out in daylight, make three or four drags that day. The latest I’d be out would be 4pm,” he says. “Look,” he tells me. “What I’m doing right here, right now, selling shrimp on this corner – it sucks. It’s way better out there on the water. It’s where I’ve lived all my life. If I wasn’t in the ocean, I was in the river running trout lines and catching catfish, or fishing for shad in winter.”Off the coast of Georgia, fishermen harvested about 2.61m lbs of shrimp in 2019, a haul valued more than $11m. Shrimping is deeply ingrained in culture there, but Georgia’s fishermen are facing significant challenges: an ageing workforce, low prices per pound, climate change, and black gill disease, leading many to wonder if the industry will survive.These days, depending on the season, Gale can get $3 to $5.50 per lb of shrimp. “Back in the 1980s and 1990s,” he says, “we were selling the same size shrimp for $8 a pound. We have good years – but most of the time we have bad years now.”Bryan Fluech, the associate marine extension director at Marine Extension and Georgia Sea Grant, uses the term “graying of the fleet” when talking about the future of shrimping in Georgia.“Shrimp are the Cheetos of the sea,” Fluech tells me. “Everything eats them. But people need to remember: that shrimp didn’t just show up in a Publix.”“The decline of the shrimping industry has been death by a thousand cuts,” Fluech says. “The cost for maintaining a boat is up, and the boats are getting older. Sustainable fishing practices are expensive to implement. The younger generation doesn’t want to work on a shrimping vessel, and captains tell me they can’t find a reliable workforce. The cost of ice and fuel might rise, but the profit on shrimp doesn’t. Plus, our guys are competing with foreign markets.”“A lot has changed,” Gale tells me. “We’re losing our infrastructure. Lost our big block ice plant that had given ice since the 1940s. Can’t hardly find anybody to build nets any more.”Fluech professes enormous respect for the shrimpers still operating in Georgia’s waters. “Let me tell you – MacGyver (the TV adventurer hero) has nothing on Georgia shrimpers. They are so resourceful. You can’t just be a good shrimper any more. You’ve got to be a welder, a businessman, and a direct marketer too.”“People love to say that they’re all about local food,” Fluech adds. “And you’ll see a shrimping boat on every tourism brochure, but commercial waterfronts have changed. People don’t like the look of a working dock. There’s only one left in Brunswick, which means the fishermen have to take those prices or go out on their own. We say we like authentic experiences, but we’re losing them.”You can see the old reverence for Georgia’s shrimpers in the Blessing of the Fleet ceremonies, which still happen along the coast in towns like Brunswick and Darien at the end of March, as the fleet readies itself for the season.Ships with beautiful names like the Lady Raven, Flying Cloud, Bernice II, Liberty Bell, and Sundown arrive at the ceremony decorated with lights and streamers. A crowd gathers, and a minister – often waving a toilet brush spray-painted gold, and flanked by the Knights of Columbus – offers a blessing into the microphone. Shrimping is a dangerous vocation, after all, and every year there are injuries, drownings, and boats that don’t return.This year’s ceremony was postponed due to the pandemic. The cancellation feels like the latest knock in a long and difficult fight.Once celebrated, many shrimpers feel vilified as they face mounting regulations aimed at preserving other species, like sea turtles. In the 1980s, before turtle excluder devices (TEDs) were prevalent, shrimp nets were responsible for more than 10,000 sea turtle deaths annually in the southeast. In 1989, when regulations tightened, shrimpers created a 500-boat blockade in the Gulf coast, raising skull and crossbones flags and even ramming Coast Guard ships.In Georgia, tension between scientists and fishermen is amplified by black gill disease, which affects a shrimp’s respiratory system. The shrimp’s immune response causes the visible blackening of the gills, and results in lethargy, potential death, and sometimes the collapse of an entire fishery.Black gill is an expensive problem. In 2019, the commerce department distributed over $1m to commercial shrimpers and researchers because of the 2013 white shrimp fishery failure.Black gill is, however, more pervasive than ever. Gale reports that it’s starting earlier in the year, beginning in May instead of August, and continuing throughout fall. Though it has been around since the 1990s, researchers believe the disease is worsening with climate change.Climate change will continue to wreak further havoc on the industry – changing the salinity of the water, shifting the distribution of shrimp – female shrimp need colder water to spawn. Warmer winters appear to predict a smaller annual shrimp harvest, and may not kill the bacteria responsible for black gill.Keeping shrimp fisheries healthy, and livelihoods possible, requires intense collaboration between fishermen and scientists. Otherwise, foreign markets with cheap labor and unsustainable practices will take over the market share entirely.“We have to look for the cooperative path,” Fluech says, emphasizing how helpful it can be when shrimpers help with data collection and reporting. He currently works with five to eight shrimpers each season the fishermen help report black gill using an online tracking app.One of the best historic examples of this cooperative path is fisherman Sinkey Boone, who hailed from a long line of shrimpers in Darien. Boone created the first turtle excluder device in the late 1960s, called the Georgia Jumper, which allowed turtles – an oxygen-breathing species – to escape trawler nets so they wouldn’t drown.Scientists and fishermen may seem at odds, but collaboration is possible, and perhaps imperative.“Me and the shrimpers may not agree on everything, but I respect the hell out of them,” says Fluech.Gale agrees with the saying that shrimpers never retire. “We fish till we fall out and die,” he says. “I’ve seen men fish right on until their 80s and 90s. I know an old man right now who’s got to be 85 and he outworks anybody I know – still climbs up in the rigging. Diabetic and still goes.”I hear stories about poisonous snakes tangled in anchor lines, boats on fire, near-sinkings, and a man in his 70s impaled by his own equipment who hardly survived, but broke out of the hospital to get back on his boat a few days later.“Once fishing’s in your blood, and you get used to it, you just don’t want to do anything else,” Gale says.“I’d still work for my daddy,” Gale tells me. “He just knew where the shrimp would be – it was absolutely amazing. He knew the tide cycles, what the weather meant. You could set your watch to it. Another fisherman could make that same pass and miss them.”In 1979, the government issued 1,471 commercial trawling licenses in Georgia – but only 253 in 2014. If the decline in Georgia’s shrimping continues, the ripple effect will be felt in the local economy, on dinner plates, during seasonal festivals, and on the horizon line, where many are used to seeing early morning trawlers. Frozen foreign shrimp and farmed shrimp – known as aquaculture – are the likely future.“Do I think there will always be shrimpers in Georgia?” Fluech asks me. “I hope so. You have to be an eternal optimist in this business.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5274312b947acca798a64e70ac6cca123ef4eac8/0_279_2726_1635/master/2726.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1c560998e80c0297cc0aee20935baee","title":"rylan clark neal i regret pretty much everything i wore on the x factor","story":"The TV presenter on finally being able to dress the way he wants to, and the importance of talking about cosmetic work I regret pretty much everything else I wore on that show.

Email feast@theI find barbecue sides uninspiring. Any tips for a good veg dish that isn’t potato salad?Dan, London E13First to get up in your grill, Dan, is live-fire cook Genevieve Taylor. But before we go any further, we must address your potato salad takedown. “Grilling potatoes on the barbecue is a really lovely thing to do,” counters Taylor, who wrote Charred: The Complete Guide to Vegetarian Grilling and Barbecue. She cuts new potatoes into wedges, grills them slowly until crisp on the outside, then adds “an Italian-style olive-oil-based dressing and basil” while they are still warm. “Pretty much every veg you can think of is boosted with a little bit of smoke and fire,” says Taylor. The beauty of cooking this way, she says, is that you can layer textures, flavours and colours in a way that you can’t with meat: “I might start with a base of root veg, such as carrots, which always benefit from a little blanch first to open up the cell walls so you can then hit them with a marinade, such as cumin, garlic and chipotle chilli. Then grill them until charred in places and nice and sticky.” Taylor layers them with herbs, spring onions, nuts and ricotta.Whole cauliflowers have become a barbecue’s best friend, but only when blanched first, then cooked slowly. “A lot of vegetables take longer to cook on the barbecue than you might imagine,” says Taylor. “My top tip is to set up your barbecue so that you have different zones of heat – only put charcoal on one side of the barbecue, so that you have the option to cook indirectly or directly over the fire.”Taylor cooks the cauliflower over an indirect heat until tender, then slides it over the fire to caramelise. Then, says Georgina Hayden, the author of Taverna, it is all about the finishing touches. She tosses her cauliflower in a mix of tahini, yoghurt, garlic, lemon and olive oil, then adds herbs andor chilli. This works well with broccoli, too.Vinegar is a useful tool to contrast that charcoal flavour, says Neil Campbell, the head chef at Rovi in London: “Try slicing white onions, mixing with apple cider vinegar, sugar and salt, then leaving to sit. Lightly grill some asparagus and green beans, then chop and toss them in the vinaigrette and throw in some basil.” Onion also makes a cracking side to meat: “Cut red onions in half (skin on), then cook face down until they are pretty much black, then slip them off the direct heat and cook skin side down so they sweat and steam.” Once they are done, Campbell removes the skin, slices the onions and adds Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper.To spice things up, look for inspiration from cultures where fire cooking is prevalent, says Taylor: “Indian tandoor cooking, Mexico or south-east Asia, for all those wonderful marinades with lemongrass, lime leaves and coriander.” And if you have some citrus fruits knocking around, toss them on to the grill, too, then squeeze over veg before serving."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d633037933e4256461fb9d8d75ea92a15a1e8dd9/0_3070_4577_2743/master/4577.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc5c8815be7639e09e6a1c1ef5211d3e","title":"from starter to loaf how to make gluten free sourdough bread from scratch","story":"Like any sourdough, a gluten-free loaf requires patience and perseverance – but dietary restrictions need not exclude you from the baking crazeSo you (along with everyone else in 2020) have decided to diligently feed a sourdough starter, and make your own sourdough bread. The problem? You can’t eat gluten.Fortunately, although there is an element of luck (and a lot of intimidating lingo), creating your own gluten-free sourdough from scratch is a relatively straightforward process.A sourdough starter is essentially wild yeast that you cultivate by mixing together flour and water. Through a daily process of feeding the active culture and discarding the waste product, you create a living, fermented yeast that can be used to make sourdough bread. Think of it as a homemade, wholesome version of packet yeast.Once the starter is fed, and you’re ready to make gluten free sourdough bread, there are a few extra elements you’ll need to consider, but the technique is not unlike the regular variety.Ingredients per feed:25g quinoa flour25g sorghum or brown rice flour50g-75g water (or more to create a thick paste)See ‘starter notes’ below for more details on the flour mix.Day 1 to 3In the morning, mix together the flours and water in a clean glass vessel. Ensure that there’s enough water to make a paste, even if this means adding more water than specified, gluten-free flours all absorb water differently. Repeat this feeding procedure at night, so you’re feeding the starter twice a day.Day 3 to 4Ideally, you’ll begin to see some bubbles start to form around this time. This is when I begin the process of discarding around half the starter, once a day. There’s no need to be super precise – eyeballing it is fine. Simply stir the starter and remove half of it from the jar. You can use this ‘discard’ portion to make crackers, pancakes or anything else where you’d regularly use a flour batter.You need to feed your starter every time you discard – this includes when you make a loaf. The discard process removes older starter (and waste product from the fermentation process) and refreshes it with new food. This is super important in keeping your starter healthy. Note that you discard once a day but feed the starter twice a day.Day 4 to 7Continue with your process of discarding and then feeding. I find the easiest way to do this is to discard in the morning, feed the starter, and then feed it again before bed. There’s no point discarding after feeding – you’ll be wasting fresh flour.You should now be getting some serious action in your starter, depending on the weather. If you’re in winter or a cold kitchen, it may take up to 11 or 12 days. If you get to day 12 without any action, it might be time to admit defeat and start again.Around this stage, your starter might have developed a smell. The smell of rotten eggs or sulphur suggests your starter is on track – the smell will mellow, so don’t panic! The smell of alcohol or nail polish remover suggests your starter is hungry – try feeding it a little more flour and water in each feed.Ideally, your starter will begin a rhythm of rising quite dramatically in the hours after feeding, and then collapsing on itself when it has run out of food. Rubber bands are a great way to track growth, but you can also see where the starter rose to by the remnants on the side of your jar. Good starters have a predictable rise and fall schedule that indicates strength. At its peak, your starter should have a slightly domed top, a little like instant yeast does when you activate it.Other things to look out for in your starter are a thick, paste like consistency and lots of popping air bubbles when you stir it. A spoonful of your starter should feel light and bubbly when you remove it from the jar. These air bubbles indicate that your starter is ready to bake a loaf of bread.Day 7 to 12 onwardsOnce your starter is bubbly, active and pleasantly mild smelling, you’re ready to bake bread!You will need to continue maintaining your starter by feeding it once a day. Replenish it with a feed after each loaf. If you’re not planning to bake often, you can keep your starter in the fridge (in an airtight container) and feed it once a week. You’ll need to let it come to room temperature and give it a little extra love a day or two before using it.Keep in mind that new starters often take a month or so to develop enough maturity for a great loaf, so be patient. The wait is worth it!There are three areas where gluten-free sourdough differs from a traditional loaf recipe.The prefermentThere are many names for this aspect of sourdough, so I settled on preferment for ease. This is a mixture of sourdough starter and extra flour and water, which is left overnight to ferment. A preferment is important in developing the flavour, texture and overall quality of your gluten-free sourdough.The psyllium husk gelBecause there is no gluten to hold the loaf together – this is where the sourdough deviates from regular bread – we need to replace the gluten with psyllium husk. Psyllium husk gives strength and elasticity to your loaf, which enables it to rise and produce a good crumb. It is also excellent in absorbing liquid, something we use a lot of to counteract the dryness of gluten free flours.Psyllium husk is often marketed and sold as a fibre supplement. It’s generally available at the supermarket, health food stores or chemists. Keep in mind that this recipe uses psyllium husk, not psyllium husk powder. They have very different absorbencies and are not a clean substitute.The flour mixtureFinally, we have the mixture of flours. A mixture of gluten-free flours is necessary to create a lighter, bread-like texture, although I’ve tried to use as few as possible for ease. Once you get the hang of the sourdough, feel free to play around with the flours that best suit you, but keep in mind that they all have different absorbencies and qualities.EquipmentLarge glass or plastic mixing bowlsBoule shaped banneton (bread shaping basket) or a bowl lined with a clean, undyed tea towelBaking paperCling filmLame (scoring blade) or sharp knifeDutch oven (please note that not all dutch ovens are suitable for high oven temperatures) or cast iron skillet and tin foilIce cubes, optionalFor the preferment (made the night before):125-150g active sourdough starter – 125g for a warm climate or 150g for winter or a more sour loaf (I use 150g)60g white rice flour150g waterFor the loaf:55g quinoa flour (see ingredient notes)100g sorghum flour75g tapioca flour60g white rice flour1½–2 tsp fine salt, depending on your taste (I use 2 tsp)¼ teaspoon ginger powder (optional, see notes)20g psyllium husk (not psyllium husk powder)250-275g water½ tbsp honey or pure maple syrup½ tsp apple cider vinegar (optional, see notes)To make the prefermentEnsure you’re using a starter that has been fed a few hours before you start. It should be on the rise and have a domed top when you measure it into the bowl. To fit this around a normal work schedule (does this exist anymore?) I’d suggest feeding your starter at 5.30pm, and then waiting until bedtime (or the peak of your starter) to make the preferment.Once the starter is ready to go, mix it with the water and then add the flour. Stir until combined and cover with cling film or a wrap. I hate recommending cling film but it does do a good job here.Leave this in a reasonably warm, draft-free place overnight. I use my oven without the light or heat on.To make the bread (the next morning)In a large bowl, combine the flours, salt and ginger powder (if you’re using it). Whisk to combine.In a medium sized mixing bowl, combine the psyllium husk and water and whisk to combine. Allow the mixture to sit until it has gelled up before adding the honey or maple syrup and apple cider vinegar.Add the psyllium husk gel to the preferment, whisking to mix. Add this wet mixture to the flours and use a spoon to combine as much as possible. Once it’s almost mixed, gently squelch the dough through your hands, picking up dry bits of flour as you go.If you’ve weighed everything diligently there shouldn’t be a need for extra water, but you can add 1-2 tbsp if it’s truly necessary. You should be able to pick up the dough and shape it, although depending on how much water you’ve used it might be a little wobbly in your hands.Once the dough is completely mixed through and formed into a rough ball, tip it onto a very lightly (white rice) floured bench. Use your hands to close any seams as much as possible. Make sure the side with no seams is the top of your loaf.When the dough is shaped, very lightly flour your banneton or bowl with white rice flour (this is particularly important if your banneton is new). Place the nice side of the dough (aka the side with no seams) down into the banneton. The base of the loaf (with the seams) should be facing upwards now.Cover the loaf with a lightly oiled shower cap or the cling you used for the preferment. Place this in a plastic bag or airtight container in a warm, draft free place for 2-3 hours, or until it’s a little jiggly – a finger-poke should spring back halfway. In winter, I like to use my oven with just the light turned on to proof my loaves halfway.To bake the loafAn hour or so before baking the loaf, place your Dutch oven in the oven and get the heat up to 250C. Making sure the dutch oven is very hot is integral to getting oven spring. Ensure you’ve checked that your dutch oven is high heat safe, or you might lose a lid handle.When the oven and loaf are both ready, take a medium-length piece of baking paper and lay it on the bench. It needs to be long enough that you can lower the loaf into the dutch oven without burning your arms. In my experience, dropping the loaf into the dutch oven results in a flat and gummy loaf.Invert the loaf onto the centre of the baking paper, leaving the edges for lowering handles. You might need to use your fingers to (very gently) encourage the loaf to detach from the banneton. Don’t use force or you’ll knock the air out of the loaf.Use a lame (sharp scoring blade) or a sharp knife to make a reasonably deep incision in the loaf. Google ‘bread scoring’ for some pattern ideas, or just keep it simple and score straight down the centre.Get all your oven gear ready to work quickly for this next step. Carefully and quickly remove the super hot dutch oven from the oven. Shut the oven door while you work. Take the lid off and quickly lower in the bread. If you’re using an ice cube for extra oven spring, add it now – the ice cube will create steam which will help the bread rise quickly when it first enters the oven. Pop the lid back on and quickly return the dutch oven to the oven. For a dark loaf, keep the oven at 250C. For a lighter loaf, turn it down to 220C.Bake the loaf with the lid on for 40-50 minutes. If you prefer a less caramelised (aka dark) crust, leave the lid on a little longer. Once the time is up, remove the lid and continue to bake your loaf for another 40 or so minutes, or until the crust sounds hollow when you knock on it and is deeply caramelised brown in colour. At a minimum, the loaf should be in the oven for 1 hour 10 minutes. Taking it out earlier will result in a gummy interior. Maximum cooking time is around 1 hour 30 minutes.Once cooked, remove the loaf from the oven and baking paper and place it on a cooling rack. Allow to cool completely (3-4 hours at least) before slicing into it, as slicing too soon can compress all the air in the loaf and result in a gummy loaf.You can store the loaf in a bag or freeze it in slices. It keeps well for a week or so and makes great toast even after it has become a little stale.Because there is a wide array of gluten-free flours, you have a lot of choice in terms of what to feed your starter. Keep in mind a few things if you’d like to experiment with different flours:There are a lot of different elements to consider and control in creating your starter.

Try pairing them with tomatoes, avocados, basil or harissa – if you dareIf you are not going to get out there and pick strawberries, the least you can do is eat them. Britain, farmers tell us, is facing a huge strawberry glut, thanks to the cancellation of major events such as Wimbledon (where 33 tonnes of strawberries were eaten last year), along with thousands of weddings and summer parties. As civic duties go, eating loads of strawberries isn’t that taxing, but they won’t sit around waiting for you to come up with new ways to serve them. Here are 17 delicious ideas to help you manage your personal stockpile.Maceration is step number one in a lot of the recipes below. At its simplest, macerating consists of hulling and halving a quantity of strawberries, tossing them in a bowl with a couple of tablespoons of sugar, then leaving them to sit in the fridge for half an hour or longer, but not long enough for them to turn into mush (meaning not overnight). Additions to the basic formula may include juice (orange or lemon), balsamic vinegar or alcohol.A basic strawberry tart, however, requires no maceration. You just make – or otherwise obtain – a shortcrust pastry case, fill it with whipped cream or pastry cream (I have had some success with this fail-safe Youtube tutorial by Thomas Joseph) and sink sliced strawberries into the top in an orderly spiral. You can get very fussy about sizing fruit for a neat look or, alternatively, not bother.Felicity Cloake’s strawberry tart is slightly more sophisticated, in that you have to be the sort of person who has rosewater to hand, but it is no more difficult to produce. It also contains a handy recipe-within-a-recipe, for an incredibly useful no-roll shortcrust pastry: you just press the mixture into the tin with the base of a cup.Yotam Ottolenghi’s strawberry and basil tart has an intriguing combination of strawberries, pistachios and basil-infused pastry cream. It also calls, thankfully, for store-bought puff pastry. Life may not be too short to make your own puff pastry, but the British summer definitely is.Strawberry shortcake is the traditional American way to keep on top of a strawberry glut, but Cloake’s reclaimed British version is excellent. As you will see, strawberry shortcakes are not cakes at all, but inidual assemblages of macerated strawberry, whipped cream and large biscuit. However, it is not uncommon in America to make one large one and slice it like a cake. The ingredients are the same, although the amounts might differ since you will probably want three layers for height. This version has the right proportions.In terms of actual cake, a strawberry and olive oil breakfast cake fits the bill, while Cassie Best’s strawberry and almond cheesecake sponge could be more accurately described as a sponge with “cheesecake blobs” in it.If you are like me, it might take you a while to get your head round the idea of using strawberries in salads, especially salads that sound as if they would be just as good without them. But let us not forget why we are here: to level Britain’s massive strawberry mountain before it collapses and buries us all.Here is what I would suggest: before you commit to a whole salad, try a few bites of the relevant flavour combinations first, to see if they work for you. Some will be delightful from the outset others may be tastes longer in the acquiring. I haven’t yet made Ottolenghi’s strawberry and tomato salad, but I did put a tomato and a strawberry in my mouth at the same time, and I can testify that they have a surprising affinity. Now I just need to convince my family.Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall recommends a strawberry and avocado salad, dressed with parmesan and a simple honey and lemon dressing. Mark Bittman’s strawberry and rocket is another rather startling combination to experiment with, as is Erin Clarke’s spinach and strawberry salad.I am always drawn to ice-cream recipes that don’t require an ice-cream maker, because I don’t own one and I don’t want one. This straightforward freezer recipe from Tom Hunt, chef at Poco in Bristol, has just four ingredients: strawberries, sugar, double cream and mascarpone. Mine didn’t turn out quite as rippled as his, but it disappeared very quickly.Jeremy Lee’s strawberry granita is simplicity itself, and should really be kept that way. As he says, cream is not required, “and the addition of a sprig of mint is absolutely forbidden.”A surplus of ripe strawberries can quickly turn into an embarrassment of overripe strawberries: bruised, soft, leaking. Compotes and preserves are the perfect way to rescue them. Strawberry jam is the most obvious route, and, as always, Felicity Cloake supplies the winnowed-down, optimal version. The major issue with strawberries is their lack of pectin, which causes jam to set. You need to add some, either in the from of other, pectin-rich fruit (lemons, say), or by using jam sugar, which already includes pectin.Strawberry compote is even simpler and keeps in the fridge for about two weeks. If you are looking for something more adventurous, try Ottolenghi’s frankly counter-intuitive strawberry and harissa ketchup, which he recommends as an accompaniment to grilled meats. After the thing with the tomato and the strawberry, I am willing to take his word for it.Strawberries are, for many people, just smoothies waiting to happen, either alone or in combination with numberless other fruits. You can begin with the basic format (strawberry, banana, orange juice) and experiment by adding elements –cranberries, chia seeds, oatmeal – until you realise you have gone too far. Then pull back a little.For something a bit stronger, Tom Hunt’s strawberry daiquiri is a respectable way to use up any final stray strawberries, or any leftover vodka. Hunt recommends macerating the berries in grappa beforehand, but if you don’t have grappa, a little more vodka makes a decent substitute. If you don’t have a proper blender, you can use a hand blender in a tall jug, although you might have to break up the ice a little first. If you haven’t got a jug, just wash out a large vase. You can see I really wanted to make this work. And it did, in the end."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4f0438df517ffc9ba3d600d2d2fc63f0789b17a/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b03906d6162e5119afbc0b1441e29bce","title":"newcastle takeover in serious doubt as wto rules pirate tv channel is saudi","story":"The controversial £300m Saudi Arabia-funded takeover of Newcastle United appears to be in serious doubt after the World Trade Organization ruled that the country is behind a pirate satellite TV and streaming service that offers illegal access to sporting events, the  can reveal.While the WTO’s 130-page final report will not be published until mid-June, it is understood that the independent ruling firmly establishes that the Saudi government is behind beoutQ. It can also be revealed that the Premier League, which received the WTO report this month, made submissions against Saudi Arabia as part of the legal process.Previously Fifa, Uefa, the Premier League, La Liga and others have tried to take legal action against beoutQ in Saudi Arabia for illegally streaming matches, but nine local legal firms declined to take on the copyright case. Subsequently a case against Saudi Arabia was taken to the WTO, the highest judicial body that could rule on the matter. It has now issued its ruling – finding that Saudi Arabia is in breach of international law as a result of beoutQ.With Saudi Arabia’s crown prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, also the chairman of the Public Investment Fund, the WTO report establishes a clear legal link between the beoutQ piracy service and the Saudi state. However, that link is denied by the country as well as Newcastle’s prospective Saudi majority owners.It is now almost two months since the consortium contacted the Premier League for approval – a process that was expected to take around 30 days. When the  reported a fortnight ago that there was likely to be further delay, the consortium insisted it was “very hopeful” the deal would be approved imminently.Saudi Arabia had previously claimed beoutQ originated in Cuba and Colombia, prompting the governments of both countries to issue firm denials. It later emerged that beoutQ was being broadcast from the Arabsat satellite, which is majority-owned by the Saudi state and has its headquarters in the country. BeoutQ has since been removed from Arabsat. However, beoutQ illegal set-top boxes which allow the streaming of major broadcasters, including Sky and BT, are still widely available widely across the region. In January, Saudi Arabia was named in a European commission report for its failure to crack down on the platform. It also remains on a US government priority watch list as one of the “notorious markets for counterfeiting and piracy”.Recently, the president of La Liga, Javier Tebas, urged the Premier League to consider the damage that beoutQ’s pirating of broadcasts had caused the sport before deciding on the Newcastle takeover.Amnesty International has also asked the league to consider blocking the takeover, saying that Bin Salman has been involved in a “sweeping crackdown on human rights”. Hatice Cengiz, the fiancee of the murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed in 2018 inside Saudi Arabia’s consulate in Turkey, has also said the takeover should be blocked over his death.The Premier League refused to comment about the latest developments when contacted by the ."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a38d73b4f25847e1085d9c7f8396db15ddecd6f9/77_96_4223_2534/master/4223.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=471d87549cb8320654b46791a8747cdc","title":"caroline weir girls drop out football manchester city scotland girls united","story":"Scotland forward and Girls United ambassador aims to highlight football’s physical and social benefitsCaroline Weir has tried to make the most of the enforced break. “A real positive of lockdown is that players have had time to reflect, take a minute and think about what’s important. It has for me anyway,” the Manchester City forward says.At 24, the Scotland international was playing some of her best football before the pandemic cut short the season. The focus of her career may have been on getting to the top but it had “always been in my head to give back. Now I feel I’m at the age where it is something I want to be more conscious of.”At a time when the grassroots game is in limbo and fragile, there has never been a more important time for players to help. “For me, growing up in Scotland, grassroots had such an important part to play in my career,” says the Dunfermline-born Weir.“It’s where kids fall in love with football and it’s such an important time. I still remember playing with the boys at five all the way through to age 10 and going down on a Saturday morning to these big grassy muddy fields.”Helping more girls enjoy football prompted the link-up with Girls United. “Lots of girls, especially teenagers, drop out of the game. I want to help highlight the many positive physical and social reasons for girls to carry on playing.”It is also about more than that. “If they want to stay in football that’s great but if they want to do something else then they’ve built up a whole host of skills that can take them to wherever they want to be, no matter where you come from.”Studying for a degree in sports writing and broadcasting is balanced alongside the lockdown training provided by her club, FaceTiming family and Netflix, but it has “definitely been a challenge” for her, too. “I have felt like a 14-year-old girl again. I would only go out running and train with a ball by myself when I was younger.”Weir is ready to play whenever and wherever but there is some relief the cancellation of the season has brought the “hardest part” – the “not knowing” and having to be constantly ready to move up a gear – to an end. “You had to train in certain ways and at a certain time because you didn’t know when you would be back,” she says.The isolation has also made a core part of the women’s game feel all the more valuable: the relationship between players and fans, something professionalism and growth must not jeopardise. “We do have to make sure we keep a hold on what’s important to the women’s game and I think as long as you’ve got players who realise that stuff is important then I think it will be OK.”By involving herself in causes that matter to her Weir has one eye beyond the game. Lockdown has “made me realise just how big a part football plays in my life and how much time is taken up by playing every single week,” she says.“It’s made me think that whatever I go into has to give me a similar buzz and be something I enjoy. There won’t be a game day one day, so there has to be something similar that I’m working towards. But hopefully I’ve got a few years yet.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e36d049327465b2c41098ad29067c3c09b78fd34/0_61_4723_2834/master/4723.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d9dbf6b677bf7379cdb0e800bbd1881","title":"lilian thuram classmates judged my skin colour football","story":" In a new book, the World Cup winner discusses growing up in France and the racism he encountered throughout his careerOne man in France’s 1998 World Cup-winning squad felt particularly affected by the sense of racial harmony that had descended on the country after that historic triumph. Ever since moving from Guadeloupe as a nine-year‑old, Lilian Thuram was confronted by discrimination. The attitudes he witnessed as a boy shocked him to such an extent that once his career ended, he decided to focus his energy on the fight against racism.For those few happy weeks after the World Cup, Thuram was delighted to see people in France treated equally regardless of race. “The black-blanc-beur symbol we created was positive and I liked it,” he says of the “black, white, Arab” motto.“It wasn’t only a reference to the football team, it was about all of society. I’m not naive. I know very well that outside football people aren’t treated the same. They are not allowed to dream about the same things. Depending on your skin colour, depending on your origins, you do not have access to the same opportunities. So this is why I’m very happy that for a period at least there was this recognition.”I am talking to Thuram at the headquarters of his association in the Odéon district of central Paris. He launched the Fondation Lilian Thuram after quitting his final club, Barcelona, in 2008, with the aim of educating young people on the roots of racism and why it is wrong. France’s most‑capped player now battles racism with the ferocious determination that made him one of the leading defenders of his generation and travels the world for talks at schools, universities and conferences.Securing a meeting with Thuram has proved difficult and not just because he is extremely busy. Thuram has found himself at the centre of a media storm following an interview he gave to the Italian newspaper Corriere dello Sport. Contacted to discuss the continuing racism in Serie A, he was reflecting on the history of the problem when he said: “It is necessary to have the courage to say that white people believe they are superior.” This sentence upset some of his compatriots and notably prompted the influential football journalist Pierre Ménès to claim: “The real problem in France, in football in any case, is anti-white racism.”The controversy made Thuram reluctant to accept another interview but a month later he has agreed to meet and seems to be more relaxed. “The fact the subject of racism is being debated more and more is good,” he says. “And if I’m being attacked then it means that in some way my actions are making certain people uncomfortable. They feel in danger, which, again, is a good sign. Don’t forget that Nelson Mandela was accused of being an anti-white racist. Martin Luther King, too.”The Frenchman does not consider himself to be the next Mandela or King but the number of books on the shelves of his office dedicated to those two historical figures suggest he is deeply inspired by them.Born in French West Indies, Thuram has been intrigued by the subject of racism ever since his mother moved the family to the greater Paris region in 1981. “What struck me when I arrived was that some of my classmates judged me because of my skin colour. They made me believe my skin colour was inferior to theirs and that being white was better,” he says.“These were nine-year-old kids. They weren’t born racist but they’d already developed a superiority complex. From that moment I started to ask myself questions: ‘Why are they teasing me? Where does this come from?’ My mother couldn’t provide me with answers. For her this was just the way it was. There are racists and it won’t change.”Unsatisfied with his mother’s response, Thuram buried himself in books to find a better explanation, studying events that had created this damaging mindset. “Historically, we ranked people. We created hierarchies according to skin colour,” he says. “We educated the white person to think he is dominant over others. Just as we educated men to feel dominant over women. These are intellectual and ideological mechanisms that were constructed in order to exploit other people.”Thuram speaks in a calm, intelligent manner. His gentle demeanour contrasts with the aggressive way he defended during his playing days. It is also very different to the stereotypical image that some iniduals in France have of black people who come from the suburbs. “People like to fantasise,” Thuram says, allowing himself a throaty chuckle. “They like to think the suburbs are full of violent thugs but they’re not. The majority of people are just like me. They try to live well in a calm, peaceful way.”Raised by his mother, who was a cleaner, in the modest council estate of Les Fougères in Avon, south of Paris, Thuram knows what it is like to struggle on the periphery of French society. Football helped him gain respect in a tough community made up of immigrants from all corners of the globe. “I played with kids from Pakistan, Lebanon, Vietnam, Congo, Algeria … the whole world was there. Football has this great strength of bringing people together and making you feel part of something.”His first club, Portugais de Fontainebleau, were founded by Portuguese expats but the players hailed from many different cultures. “At the weekends, I became Portuguese,” Thuram says. “Opponents used to insult me by calling me a ‘dirty Portuguese’, which, as a West Indian, I found pretty funny.”Like many of his peers Thuram spent every spare moment with a ball at his feet. “The best way to be good at something is to do it a lot. When you’re in the suburbs, you play a lot of football. You don’t have access to piano or violin lessons. During the school holidays you don’t go away, you stay at home and you play football all day long. That’s the reason why so many players emerge from these areas.”Thuram’s world changed when Arsène Wenger brought him to Monaco aged 17. This proved to be the start of a long, trophy-laden career. Yet, for all his success, the spectre of racism never left. At Monaco, despite being a regular in Wenger’s title-chasing team, Thuram would often be refused entry to nightclubs and exclusive restaurants. During the 10 seasons he spent in Italy with Parma and Juventus after leaving Monaco, he heard monkey chants on a regular basis.It must have been difficult to bear but Thuram had the tools to rise above it. “I was lucky that from a young age I understood the mechanism behind racism,” says the two-times Serie A winner. “So, when I heard the monkey chants, there was no doubt in my mind that the people with the problem were the ones making monkey noises, not me. I didn’t get angry, I tried to understand why they did it.”Thuram has a burning desire to share his knowledge and, much like his marauding raids forward with Les Bleus, he is difficult to stop when he gets into stride. “Racism stems from a feeling that you are superior to the other person. You think you’re ‘normal’ and they aren’t. It’s the same with homophobia. Heterosexuals were educated to think they are normal and gay people aren’t. Well, we need to explain very nicely to these people that they are not ‘the norm’. There is no norm. I understood that very early and when you understand racism you know you are not the one with a problem.”When I say that racism in football looks to be escalating because more incidents are being reported, he says the suggestion is naive. But surely the terrible scenes in Bulgaria the week before our interview, when England’s players were racially abused throughout their Euro 2020 qualifier, are evidence the situation has deteriorated?“People often try to analyse racism through their own country or through their feelings but you have to consider racism on a global scale and take on board the historical depth,” Thuram says. “European societies were built on racism. It has been integrated into the collective subconscious for centuries.”To illustrate the progress humanity has made, Thuram takes the example of his own family: “My grandfather was born in 1908, 60 years after the abolition of slavery in Guadeloupe. When my mother was born, in 1947, there was segregation in the United States. When I was born, in 1972, there was apartheid in South Africa. In France, state racism ended in the 1960s. If you’re not aware of this deep history, you may think there’s more racism today. But I can tell you there isn’t. There’s far less.”Matthew Spiro’s Sacré Bleu tells the story of France’s turbulent journey from their first World Cup triumph in 1998 to the second 20 years later.

He replaces Jennie Formby, a Corbyn supporter, who announced she was standing down shortly after Starmer was elected leader.The vote was allegedly a close run between Evans, assistant general secretary in the early 2000s, and a trade unionist candidate, Byron Taylor, favoured by those on the left of the party. Evans was Starmer’s preferred choice, and the appointment strengthens his leadership over the party.“It is an honour and a privilege to be appointed general secretary of the Labour party,” Evans said. “We face a defining period in the history of our great party, with a global pandemic, an imminent recession and a mountain to climb to win the next election. Through the strength of our movement, I know we can rise to this challenge.“I look forward to working with our party, trade unions and members to build a team that can win us the next general election and give us the opportunity to once again serve the British people in government.”The other candidates on the shortlist were Karin Christiansen, former general secretary of the Co-operative Party between 2012 and 2015 and the managing director of data polling and campaigns firm Datapraxis Andrew Fisher, former Labour executive director of policy and research under Jeremy Corbyn Neena Gil, a former West Midlands MEP and Amanda Martin, president of the National Education Union.Starmer said: “I want to congratulate David on his appointment as general secretary. He brings a wealth of experience to this crucial role and a clear understanding of the scale of the task ahead of us. I look forward to working with David to build a team that can help us restore trust with the British people and build a team that can win the next election.”Evans was also welcomed by the deputy leader, Angela Rayner.The new general secretary worked for Labour between between 1995 and 2001 and went on to set up the political research organisation The Campaign Company, of which he was director. He was a councillor in Croydon from 1986 to 1990.The website Labour List reported that there have been concerns about Evans within some ranks of the party after he wrote a report in 1999 that described local parties as “dysfunctional” and compared them to Del Boy’s “Trotters Independent Traders”.Trade unions on the left have said the report recommended a “radical overhaul” of the party that could “empower modernising forces within the party and marginalise old Labour”.Evans also co-authored a report into Labour’s 2015 general election loss which called for the party to be more fiscally prudent and “small-c conservative” on family, work and the country. A former Corbyn staffer described this as principles not characteristic of the views of the membership in 2020.The Jewish Labour Movement, a Labour affiliate, tweeted: “We look forward to working with him to ensure Labour deals with its flawed disciplinary processes and the toxic culture in local parties, including acting on the 19 steps we set out for his predecessor.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd83e70e905755991700987b9fbd10e0e181270b/0_306_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ae31c8b7bd2bc8296a2ff88f03b6f4b","title":"tory unrest increases pressure pm sack dominic cummings","story":"Extraordinary party revolt and public criticisms reflect anger over aide’s lockdown breachesBoris Johnson faced an extraordinary and growing revolt from within his own party on Tuesday over his refusal to sack his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, for breaching lockdown rules.On a day of dramatic developments, a junior minister resigned and more than 30 other Conservative MPs called for Cummings to go, many citing inboxes overflowing with hundreds of angry messages from constituents.A further eight Tory MPs were publicly critical of the senior aide’s actions, and three said privately that he should be forced out.Downing Street had hoped Monday’s lengthy statement from Cummings in the rose garden of No 10 would convince the public he had acted as any concerned father would in driving 260 miles to his parents’ property in Durham when his wife was experiencing potential coronavirus symptoms.As the number of excess deaths registered in the UK during the Covid-19 outbreak reached nearly 60,000, and an international comparison confirmed the country has one of the world’s highest rates of coronavirus deaths per capita, the Downing Street press briefing was dominated by questions about Cummings for a fourth consecutive day.It follows an investigation by the  and Daily Mirror revealing Cummings’ previously secret trips to and around north-east England in late March and early April.Douglas Ross, the MP for Moray who stepped down as a Scotland Office minister, said that although he accepted Cummings had acted with his family’s best interests at heart, “Mr Cummings’ interpretation of the government advice was not shared by the vast majority of people who have done as the government asked”.He added: “I have constituents who didn’t get to say goodbye to loved ones families who could not mourn together people who didn’t visit sick relatives because they followed the guidance of the government. I cannot in good faith tell them they were all wrong and one senior adviser to the government was right.”Cummings insisted a caveat about parents looking after young children legitimised his decision to drive to Durham, saying: “The guidance says you don’t have to just sit there.”The prime minister has staunchly defended his most senior aide, whose advice was critical in sweeping the Conservatives to an 80-seat majority, with the “Get Brexit done” slogan, at December’s general election.Significant revolts are rare at such an early stage after a thumping election victory, but Cummings was already a isive figure and his refusal to apologise for an apparent breach of the rules appears to have touched a nerve with the lockdown-weary public.Calls for him to go came from across the spectrum of the Conservative party on Tuesday.They included the former chief whip Mark Harper, who said there was “no credible justification” for the drive to local beauty spot Barnard Castle, apparently to test whether Cummings’ eyesight was good enough to make the drive back to the capital.The former health secretary Jeremy Hunt released the text of a reply to a constituent, in which he said of Cummings: “What he did was a clear breach of the lockdown rules” – though Hunt did not call for him to resign, saying: “You do make mistakes in these situations.”Four more former ministers – Steve Baker, Harriett Baldwin, Stephen Hammond and Jackie Doyle-Price – all called for Cummings to go.The veteran Brexiter Peter Bone said he had not been reassured by Monday’s statement. “The rose garden interview just confirmed to me that he had driven up to Durham when we were in a strict lockdown. He absolutely should resign,” he said.“I have 400 emails from people and I’m sitting here with my colleague going through every one, and we’d rather be doing some case work but we just have so many people to reply to.”Johnson loyalists continued to defend the embattled adviser on Tuesday, however. Cummings’ longtime political friend and former boss Michael Gove gave a series of supportive interviews, insisting the Barnard Castle side trip was wise.“I think he was wise to make sure he was comfortable before driving back down to London on the A1, an inevitably busier road,” he told Sky News.Gove also said: “It is the case it was part of the National Police Chiefs’ Council’s guidance that you could drive at that time to take exercise as well.” However, the rules on exercise were only relaxed after Cummings was back in London. is investigating how the UK government prepared for – and is responding to – the coronavirus pandemic.

Government sources later insisted he had not intended to promise a review, and it would be looked into by the Home Office.Downing Street has not yet announced a replacement for Ross – and could struggle to find another supportive Scottish Tory MP. The party’s leader in Scotland, Jackson Carlaw, who is an MSP, told the BBC on Tuesday that the Cummings “furore” was a distraction, and if he were Cummings, he would “be considering my position”.During his briefing on Monday, Cummings insisted he had not considered resigning and did not regret his various journeys – though he did concede that perhaps he should have discussed his whereabouts with the prime minister at an earlier stage. He said Johnson found out a few days later, but nothing was made public.Labour sought to pile the pressure on Johnson, with the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, writing to her Conservative opposite number, Rishi Sunak, to ask if the government has modelled the risks of declining compliance with the lockdown rules.Without mentioning Cummings by name, she said she was “deeply concerned that the last 48 hours have presented a confused picture” about whether those experiencing symptoms should self-isolate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fac50e54beadeb880432bbe76d141fc590b20a6/0_0_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f17f6b89c6209e3111d69050ac1bc21","title":"covid 19 the role of vitamin d podcast","story":"Sarah Boseley talks to Prof Susan Lanham-New about vitamin D and whether it could play a role in protecting us against Covid-19"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d193cafe03cb28e7d6b0afb142d84d7e5a1e2ecc/0_20_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da5a25c53e848dd3e8915b1f8ddcedf6","title":"lgbtq community how have you been affected by the lockdown","story":"We would like to hear from LGBTQ+ people about their experiences during the pandemicWhile the pandemic lockdown has raised significant concerns for everyone, we want to know whether it has brought additional difficulties for the LGBTQ+ community.Being able to embrace your sexuality or gender identity has a positive impact on wellbeing and resilience.

When Covid-19 hit, I suspect I wasn’t alone in anticipating that the pledge would be forgotten.But following the announcement of lockdown at the beginning of March, people realised that rough sleepers were physically unable to follow government advice to stay at home. They were not only at enhanced risk of contracting the virus, but also a huge potential risk to the rest of population. Whichever worried the government more, it resolved to act: now, to all intents and purposes, rough sleeping in England has been largely solved as a problem.Rough sleeping has certainly not been completely eradicated, but the drop has been huge. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has estimated, in meetings with housing providers, that about 6,000 rough sleepers have been moved off the streets.At the same time, the factors that often kept people on the streets in the past have largely disappeared. Many struggle with the idea that some people choose to sleep rough, but the the messy reality is that they can mistakenly believe it is in their best interests to remain on the streets. Part of this is undoubtedly linked to the generosity of the public, while there has also been a significant increase since the 2008 crash in street kitchens and soup runs providing free food. Overnight those two sources of sustenance vanished.  Covid-19 has also changed the profile of potential rough sleepers. Here in the West Midlands, we are seeing more young people come to us who were “sofa-surfing” between various friends’ houses and can no longer do so. Sadly, more people are also coming to us following the breakdown of relationships. Domestic violence, already one of the top three causes of homelessness in the UK, has seen a much-publicised increase during the lockdown.For the first time I can remember, rough sleeping is not being greeted with a collective shoulder shrug. For once, YMCA staff know that even if we can’t help someone, there is a real commitment to keeping people off the streets across all of our local authorities and, crucially, cash from central government to back it up. Most local authorities feel they have done everything they reasonably can to encourage people to take up offers of accommodation, and have rehoused people who have not accessed services for years. With a bit of political will, the end of rough sleeping is now a realistic possibility. But expenditure on achieving this result has already gone well beyond the original £3.2m funding. One local authority director of housing I spoke to said his council had spent its £17,000 allowance within two days. At some point, hotel chains will want their rooms back and homes will have to be found for people. This week the government finally announced its plan for locking in the recent gains. Crucially, the commitment to ending rough sleeping will be backed by bringing forward £160m of funding this year, to find long-term housing forthe thousands of rough sleepers currently in emergency accommodation. With huge strides having been made to eradicate rough sleeping, it would pile tragedy upon tragedy for people to be turned back out on to the street. This week’s announcement reduces the chances of that happening. But the clock is undoubtedly ticking to ensure progress already made can be maintained.

The two-hander is returning to the Old Vic theatre in London, where it had a sellout run in 2019. This time, however, it will be performed to an empty auditorium and streamed to audiences. On stage, Foy and Smith will be observing the two-metre rule to which we have all become accustomed in public. It is the first major initiative of its kind in the UK since the coronavirus pandemic closed theatres in mid-March.Each performance of Duncan Macmillan’s play will be available for up to 1,000 people to watch online, replicating the theatre’s usual capacity. There will be matinee and evening performances, and although all audience members will have the same view, tickets will be priced from £10–65 with virtual theatre-goers asked to give what they can to help support the theatre.The Lungs performances are the first in a new series of productions, Old Vic: In Camera, which will also include the streaming of rehearsed play-readings. There will be several performances of Lungs in June, and tickets will be available soon, along with further details of further events in the season. For the London theatre, it is “both an exciting creative experiment and also crucial in igniting the box office now that all our usual channels of revenue have been entirely wiped out”.The Old Vic – at 202 years old one of London’s oldest theatres – is in a “seriously perilous” financial situation, its artistic director,\u0026nbspMatthew Warchus, warned earlier this month. The theatre is a charity and receives no government funding, relying solely on ticket sales, sponsorship and donations. It has some reserve funds, but according to Warchus it is a matter of “a small number of months” before those run out. The theatre is also streaming archive productions, starting with A Monster Calls on 5 June.The Big House\u0026nbspvenue in north London has similarly announced a production with socially distanced actors and is also inviting small numbers of audiences, limited to six at a time. Its play The Ballad of Corona V, written by\u0026nbspDavid Watson and billed as a “darkly comic response” to the coronavirus crisis, will open in October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d3f16c0c6b2470b50d03cc01e4663cb1c5db59e/0_141_3508_2105/master/3508.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=4b2b288096d57a164639a980fc6e9fbe","title":"youtube investigates automatic deletion of comments criticising china communist party","story":"Video platform blames deletion of criticisms on an error in its automated systemsYouTube is investigating the apparently automatic removal of comments critical of the Chinese Communist party amid complaints of censorship.The company said the filtering appeared to be “an error” amid a greater reliance on automated systems during the coronavirus pandemic because its human reviewers have been sent home.The inquiry was sparked by media reports on complaints from technology entrepreneur Palmer Luckey. Other Twitter users responded to Luckey’s tweet that they, too, believed comments about the Communist party had been removed.Luckey, a founder of the virtual reality group Oculus who is now works for a defence tech firm, tweeted: “YouTube has deleted every comment I ever made about the Wumao, an internet propaganda ision of the Chinese Communist party,” and suggested the filtering appeared to be a new policy of censorship.The comments attracted the attention of Republican Senator Ted Cruz, who called the matter “very disturbing”.“Why is GoogleYouTube censoring Americans on behalf of the CCP? This is WRONG,” Cruz tweeted. “Big Tech is drunk with power. The Sherman Act prohibits abusing monopoly power. DOJ (Department of Justice) needs to stop this NOW.”Cruz appeared to be referring to unsubstantiated comments from the White House that large tech firms are biased against conservatives and should be hit for antitrust violations.YouTube, which is owned by Google, said in a statement it had made no policy changes and that its filters were designed to remove only “spammy, hateful or harassing comments” from the platform.“This appears to be an error in our enforcement systems and we are investigating,” a YouTube spokesperson said of the complaints. “Users can report suspected issues to troubleshoot errors and help us make product improvements.”YouTube said in March it expected to see more content removal as a result of its reliance on machine learning instead of human moderators."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1232226a5d937c7b740b4163d4e0898fce6dab0b/12_206_4921_2953/master/4921.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16ecaaa1ef4a09d0958667a6a8e0dda5","title":"a site for sore eyes how dominic cummings put barnard castle on the map","story":"Just 30 minutes from Durham, the market town featuring Bernard de Balliol’s 12th-century stone castle will be a perfect post-lockdown day tripAge: 900 years old, give or take.Location: Just 30 minutes from Durham, when visibility is good.Appearance: Picturesque, but also ruined.Is it a town or is it a castle? It’s both. The market town grew around the castle after its stone fortifications were built by Bernard de Balliol in the 12th century. The castle itself is a popular tourist destination.I guess it’s closed now, thanks to coronavirus. Yes, it is. Normally, there’s plenty to see in Barnard Castle, if your eyesight is up to it.Such as? There’s the Bowes Museum, which has an amazing silver swan automaton that preens itself.Is the museum open? Of course not. There’s a pandemic on, remember?So what would be the point of going to Barnard Castle? You can still have a lovely stroll through the town, or a dry cough by the river.And it’s only 30 minutes from Durham? That’s all – a quick day trip, as well as a great rehearsal for a longer journey to somewhere more exciting.I don’t think I should be making unnecessary car journeys just now. Yes, you carry on obeying the rules – they apply to you, after all.They apply to everyone, don’t they? It certainly can’t hurt for you to believe that.Sorry, but you’re being really confusing and contradictory. I know – I’m trying to reflect government policy in the wake of No 10 adviser Dominic Cummings’ admission that he drove from Durham to Barnard Castle after he was spotted there by members of the public.Why did he do that? He said he was testing to see if his eyesight was good enough to make it all the way to London.He drove 60 miles to check that he could see well enough to drive? Yes, but the good news is: he could! Should he not have gone to Specsavers? There’s a branch in the town, but there’s no evidence he dropped in. After his admission, TripAdvisor was deluged with spoof reviews for Barnard Castle, many purportedly from Cummings.What did they say? They’ve all been taken down now, because they “do not describe a firsthand experience”.At least non-firsthand reviews can’t be accused of violating either the letter or the spirit of the government’s pandemic restrictions. True.Is it wrong to say that I’m furious, but that I also really want to see that automated swan? I think your feelings mirror popular opinion in this case.Do say: “Remember the rule – never apologise, over-explain.”Don’t say: “Come to Barnard Castle – if you can read the road signs to find it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77647549064457408a330209c2936126dcb75440/0_0_7952_4769/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43b05cadb234e116a6eb87ec48521f8a","title":"tell us about your best holiday bar","story":"Tell us about the friendly watering hole you maybe made your local for the trip – or the bar where perfect cocktails and a gorgeous setting summed up the joy of travelA Caribbean beach shack with standout rum punch, sake and exotic snacks at a tiny izakaya in Tokyo, or a Moscow e where you drank too much vodka with the locals.

Cornfields grew between stands of cottonwood trees, and harvesters cruised down the double-yellow line spewing golden dust. Signs advertised gifts from Minnesota’s northland: moccasins, wild rice, dreamcatchers, canoes. The radio station I’d been listening to had played an entire Bruce Springsteen live concert: Rutherford, New Jersey, 1984.I was heading to the Northwest Angle – the northernmost point of the continental US – to research a book about the country’s northern border. The Angle is a blip on the boundary – an isolated pocket in Minnesota set 100 miles north of the line of the main border. It is the northland of the northland – surrounded by Lake of the Woods on three sides and Canada on the other. To get there by road, you have to drive through Manitoba. It wasn’t supposed to be that way. The Angle was a mistake, made at the time of the Treaty of Paris, the accord that ended the American Revolution in 1783. The map that the delegates used, made by a London physician-botanist and amateur mapmaker named John Mitchell, marked the source of the Mississippi, a key landmark on the proposed northern boundary, as 150 miles north of where it actually is.Negotiations continued nonetheless, and the line was drawn. When the Treaty of Paris was signed on 3 September 1783, US sovereignty was acknowledged by Britain all British influence was abolished British protection of American interests around the world was lifted confiscated Loyalist property was to be reinstated and the US’s northern border was set from the north-west corner of Lake of the Woods to … nowhere.Five miles north of Warroad, Minnesota, I pulled up to the Canadian border. A stern, blue-eyed agent asked where I was going, if I’d been there before and how I’d heard about it. I said I was going to Angle Inlet, and he handed me a piece of paper that read, “Phone Reporting from the Northwest Angle”. A map at the top of the page showed the Angle’s north–south boundary. Three bubble quotes with telephone icons on them read Carlson’s, Jim’s Corner, and Young’s Bay.I was to report in from Jim’s Corner, he told me.I followed Route 12 – known as Mom’s Way – through Manitoba to an abandoned gas station where the agent had said to take a right. I did and fishtailed onto a dirt road. Thirty minutes later, the road crossed back into US territory, and I spotted four older men huddled next to a phone booth at an intersection.“Is this Jim’s Corner?” I asked.The men looked at me, then at each other. “We’re wondering the same thing,” one said.The group watched as I picked up the phone and pushed a button with an American-flag sticker on it. After a couple of rings a voice answered, “US Customs and Border Patrol.” The agent ticked off a list of ambiguous and prying questions. “What are you doing? Where are you going? Why are you going there? What kind of fish are you fishing for? Have you ever caught one of those before? How do you cook it? What does it taste like?” Satisfied, the agent said I was checked in, and I left the old men, still huddled by the booth.Paul’s grandfather had pioneered the Angle and built three of the six cabins at the resort. The old man had also built the road I had driven in on and half of the town. Paul’s boys grew up going to Angle Inlet School, the last one-room schoolhouse in Minnesota, until the sixth grade. After that they had to commute 65 miles to Warroad. Paul had spent the past 20 years fighting US and Canadian authorities who cut off access to hospitals and schools, unfairly taxed Angle residents and changed fishing and guiding regulations on Lake of the Woods, where most residents earn a living. The town has tried to secede from the US several times. The last effort was in the 1980s. The hassle of living in the Angle has kept families from moving there, and the community is slowly dying. “You gotta think how much longer we can keep doing this,” Paul said.A deep inlet lined with tall reeds connects the resort to Lake of the Woods. A light breeze rustled the grass and cooled what was becoming an extraordinarily hot day for late September. We’d been talking for 20 minutes before Paul asked if I wanted a room at the resort. I told him I’d be there for a night, and he tossed me a key and nodded to a cabin behind the office. “The AC works,” he said.I spent most of the afternoon reading about the Angle. After British explorer David Thompson discovered the actual headwaters of the Mississippi in 1798, it took nearly a century for US and British Boundary Commissions to survey it. It wouldn’t be marked until 1912.Five years later, in 1917, Jake Colson and early settlers of the Angle arrived. Back then, the drums of the Ojibwe tribe reverberated through the forest. Jake found what he described as a Shangri-la overflowing with fish, game and wild rice, and a wilderness few non-native Americans had ever seen. He settled down with a cow, a few chickens and a garden. The Ojibwe called him Pohzhash, meaning “big Indian”. He met his wife when his sister arrived for a visit with a friend. The couple lived in a tent until they finished their first cabin. They fished, logged and harvested marsh marigolds to survive. Jake worked as a hunting and fishing guide in the summer and saved money until 1945, when he built a few guest cabins.Without a road to the Angle, business at his resort – accessed only by boat – was slow. Jake added an electric generator and running water. He helped build the town’s post office and acted as its first postmaster. Then he got permission to build a connector road to Canada’s Route 308, which runs north from Mom’s Way. When fishermen left in the summer, duck hunters arrived when the hunters left, ice fishermen came.CB radio was the only form of communication. Jake’s black-and-white Zenith television could pick up one channel, from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. To deliver a baby or have a broken bone set, the family would drive 130 miles to Winnipeg. There was often a delay at the border as customs agents tried to figure out which country Angle Inlet was in. The telephone finally arrived in 1991.Paul knocked on my door the next morning to ask if I wanted to go fishing. Lake of the Woods is 1,700 square miles, and fishermen pay Paul $500 a day to make it a bit smaller. I grabbed my jacket and we walked to his boat. Paul’s wife, Karen, came along. Paul, in camo hat and sweatshirt, sat sideways with his legs crossed, one hand on the wheel, the other tucked under his knee. He chatted with Karen about their kids’ homework. Internet could be spotty in the Angle, and one of the boys had had trouble emailing a paper to his teacher. Karen held her phone over her head trying to get service and eventually managed to reach the teacher and get her kid off the hook.We passed Fort Saint Charles, a French Canadian fur-trading post built on an island in 1732. A trader named Pierre La Vérendrye had built the fort with his sons, before going on to explore and claim the western half of Canada for New France. The fort, reconstructed with new logs and asphalt shingles, sits on the US side of the line now, and an American flag flew behind the log palisade.There were no boundary markers on the lake as Paul crossed into Canada. We sailed past some long slabs of granite on the shores of Bukete Island and pulled into a bay whose location he made me swear not to reveal. He handed me a fishing rod, drove a hook through the head of a minnow, and tossed my line overboard. He did the same for Karen and himself, and they cast their lines off opposite sides of the boat. Ten minutes later we had eight fish packed in a cooler.Paul looked at his watch, and said we had to get back to meet the school bus. Back at the dock, Karen hopped off and headed home to meet the kids. Paul asked whether I wanted to join the family for fish tacos but I had a flight to catch in Minneapolis that night.He was already dropping fillets on the grill as I drove out. I headed west, past road signs riddled with bullet holes, while a few commuters drove by on their way home from Warroad. The dirt road that Jake Colson had cut The road ran straight and smooth for 15 miles. I thought about the old man and his neighbours chopping their way through the dense forest. It must have taken thousands of man-hours, hauling brush and removing stumps. I figured Jake would be proud that his grandkids drove the road twice a day now, following the dusty finger from the Angle, through Canada back to the US.Porter Fox is author of Northland: A 4,000-mile Journey Along America’s Forgotten Border (WW Norton)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00e7c594977e7a6a64ed74508f481f5de703a794/0_7_1636_982/master/1636.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b89a1c207fc131578c05f431bd5ca50d","title":"fifteen years of tv dinners why come dine with me has endured","story":"The combination of cookery and snooping has revealed Brits at their best and worst: generous and gracious – or sneering and judgmentalIf we have learned anything from 15 years of Come Dine With Me, it’s this: never buy shop-bought pastry if you want to impress four strangers with your culinary skills.This year celebrates the 15th anniversary of the show in which five people in one city invite a group of strangers to have a dinner party for five nights. Afterwards, they rate their hosts (usually in the back of a taxi) and scores are tallied to crown a winner of £1,000 at the end of the week. It swiftly became a cult hit.There is a distinctly British fascination with looking inside people’s homes – just look at our current obsession over people’s bookshelves. Before the pandemic struck, we had the likes of Changing Rooms, 60 Minute Makeover, Through the Keyhole, How Clean is Your House, Wife Swap and Location, Location, Location, that allowed us to poke around strangers’ houses. The domestic nosiness that titillated us exposed our ravenous appetite to judge others.These shows also illustrated the nation’s large wealth disparity and our notions of class and taste. But in CDWM, the homes were not the main attraction, but rather an aside to psychics, lecturers and place-mat-obsessed hosts that somehow made them even more intriguing. It was about people more than it was about their possessions.There is something distinctly British about CDWM. There was a running joke that you could have predicted how Britain was going to vote in the EU referendum by watching old episodes of the show. It exposed the hearts and minds of the UK, from union-jack theme nights to the screwed-up faces at “European menus” (before those same sceptics guzzled down the fresh pasta and potatoes à la dauphinoise with gusto).Dave Lamb has consistently provided sharp and sometimes devastating voiceovers (whip-fast reviews of the efforts of hosts such as Tina: “Curry from a jar, microwaved rice and shop-bought flatbread … this should be interesting”). He is the voiceover benchmark by which all others are judged, and is always badly imitated in lesser shows.It is notable that the people of colour on CDWM are often presented as hackneyed caricatures, and that there is an instant scepticism directed towards their taste most of the time. Not just the unpalatable spice whenever a chicken is “over-peppered”, but of their “exotic” furnishings, which are all met with dollops of discomfort around the table as immigrant homes are treated with fascination and derision.It is interesting to watch the surface joviality on screen while racism is layered between courses like soggy trifles. When we finally see the ruddy-faces of puffed-out men jerkily dancing along to soca with headdresses ironically placed on their heads as “entertainment” it is all met with wink-to-camera laughs.That is not to say that the show isn’t compulsive viewing. The now viral astonishment of Peter in 2016, who, after losing, sourly quipped: “You won Jane. Oh my God, enjoy the money. I hope it makes you very happy. Dear lord, what a sad little life, Jane,” is a meme that even has its own merch. And the point it makes – about being a bad loser – is the lie uncovered by CDWM, that of British reserve and “proper” behaviour. Over 1,000 episodes later, we watch for the eccentrics, and just sometimes for the recipes.Fifteen years and counting of this reality-TV staple reveals more than we might like about British life. What we see is often joyful, sometimes stomach-curdlingly uncomfortable, but always revealing. We use too much butter at our worst, Brits are petty and bad losers, obsessed with status. But at our best, we are welcoming hosts, generous with our praise of others, and happy to laugh at ourselves.Any changes to the format have never worked so well.

He was rushed there by the Jewish volunteer ambulance service, Hatzola, after they had called at his house to check up on him. While he was in hospital, another volunteer organisation took care of Eli’s family’s shopping for Passover as they were self-isolating. Twice, a local restaurant cooked and delivered supper for the family, and when Eli’s wife wanted to send him kosher food to eat and books to read, Lecheiris, a local volunteer group, took the package to the hospital for her.Across the UK, communities have hastily pulled together in the pandemic, with leaflets posted through doors, WhatsApp groups set up and crowdfunders launched. Many people are meeting neighbours for the first time. In Stamford Hill, north London, the networks of support are well established. “Not on my fingers and toes could I count the times I’ve been helped by community organisations recently,” Sufrin said as we chatted on the street during the Jewish holiday of Lag B’Omer.Many strictly Orthodox Jewish families in the Stamford Hill community do not have access to social media and mainstream news outlets, so some were slow to grasp the severity of the situation. “Close-knit means we’re all there for each other and we keep in daily contact. But it also means we tend to congregate more, and the virus has spread much quicker,” said Mrs Davidovits, a part-time teacher and volunteer at the Interlink Foundation.Haredi men pray at least three times daily in the synagogue, and some spend six or seven hours there. So when Britain’s chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, ordered the closure of all United Synagogues, the largest network of Orthodox synagogues in the country, in the same week that schools across the UK were told to close indefinitely, the community was shaken.Sam Friedman, a local graphic designer saw what was going on and started a physical distancing awareness campaign putting notices in local magazines and on social media. He said: “For some people essential things means going to the supermarket, but for some essential means what’s ideally required by the Jewish law, and that is prayer in groups. Many people have never prayed by themselves in the house setting, with kids around. It’s very tough. These people needed an extra dose of awareness to adhere to the law.”Yoni Koppel works in property maintenance, and for the last three years he has volunteered with Chaveirim in his spare time. Chaveirim offers a free 247 service to help with breakdowns, gas leaks and other odd jobs around the area, but when I met him in April we drove to Homerton and Royal London hospital to drop off food and drink packages to the NHS staff there. Covid-19 has forced many organisations in Stamford Hill to adapt to the needs of the community. “At first my wife was worried,” Yoni said. “But we have been brought up in the same area, and here if people need help you have to put yourself in the frontline. So she does understand.”It’s not only men volunteering to criss-cross town dropping off packages and offering support. But when I reached out to some of the women, they politely declined to talk about it. Mrs Davidovits told me some Haredi women were leading organisations in Stamford Hill, but they did not want to attract attention due to tzniyut, a Hebrew word that best translates as modesty. “It’s not only about the way we dress, but it’s behaviour as well and about putting ourselves out there. It’s very central to our way of life, for men and women.”The virus has shone a light on cracks in every community, but it has also unearthed resilience. The close-knit way of life in Stamford Hill meant lockdown presented previously unimaginable challenges and many were at risk. Everybody knows people who have died. Equally, those like Eli who needed support in a moment of need have undoubtedly received it. Moses Gluck, the undertaker, echoed so many I spoke to when he told me his work was not just business “there has to be heart to it”. Hatzola hasn’t been called to a patient showing Covid-19 symptoms in two weeks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39a62aa6bb20a0bb708e1ae146956a2a41dd8344/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53effc07cc36de3c7c5724ffb801ef24","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:More than 350,000 people have now lost their lives in the coronavirus pandemic worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The current toll stands at 350,456. The number of confirmed cases is 5,589,932, after the number of declared cases doubled in a month, with more than one million new cases registered in the last 11 days. There were 500,000 cases registered in just 48 hours, between Sunday, when cases passed 5 million, and Tuesday, when cases passed 5.5 million. True death tolls and cases are likely to be significantly higher due to differing definitions and testing rates, delays and suspected underreporting. The US alone accounts for less than a third of the global toll, with 98,916 deaths.There is growing revolt within Boris Johnson’s party over his refusal to fire Dominic Cummings, his chief adviser, over his lockdown breach. A junior minister has resigned, and 30 other Conservative MPs have called for Cummings to go. Eight more Tory MPs were publicly critical of Cummings’ actions and three said privately that he should be forced out, according to the ’s Heather Stewart, Rowena Mason and Kate Proctor.The World Health Organization’s regional director Dr Carissa Etienne said outbreaks were accelerating in countries such as Brazil, where the number of deaths reported in the last week was the highest in the world for a seven-day period since the coronavirus pandemic began. The number of coronavirus infections to accelerate in Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua, she said.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Wednesday that a draft blueprint on safely starting travel between New Zealand and Australia will be presented to both governments in early June, Reuters reports. The neighbours have been discussing the possibility of a travel bubble between them as both have slowed the spread of the novel coronavirus to levels well below those in United States, Britain and some other European countries. New Zealand has also reported a fifth consecutive day of no new cases of Covid-19.South Korea South Korea has reported 40 new coronavirus cases for its biggest daily jump in nearly 50 days, causing alarm in a country where millions of children are returning to school. All but four of the new cases came from the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, where officials have been scrambling to stem transmissions linked to nightclubs, karaoke rooms and an e-commerce warehouse. Three cases were linked to international arrivals. South Korea has also jailed a man for four months for breaking quarantine rules, in the country’s first such prison sentence.Vietnam will resume issuing e-visas to citizens from 80 countries from 1 July, the government said, though it was unclear whether quarantine measures would be lifted. The country imposed a blanket ban on foreigners entering the country in March as part of its aggressive response to the pandemic, which has also involved mass quarantines and expansive contact tracing.So far, Vietnam has not reported any coronavirus deaths.President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday announced an €8bn (US$8.8bn) plan to revive France’s auto industry by making it the European leader in electric cars, boosting a sector brought to its knees by the coronavirus. Macron said the package would include one billion euros in subsidies to encourage purchases of electric and hybrid cars and set a target of France producing a million green cars annually by 2025.The “historic” intervention will aim to turn France’s rechargeable car industry into Europe’s biggest, the president said.Germany has extended social distancing rules aimed at containing the spread of the coronavirus epidemic to 29 June, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government said on Tuesday. Merkel’s government had been embroiled in disagreements with the least-affected states, some of which wanted to ditch the measures and open up entirely. Germany’s virus caseload now tops 181,200 with just over 8,372 deaths - much lower than European counterparts such as Britain, France, Spain and Italy.Starting on Wednesday, the country will mourn for the nearly 27,000 people who have died from coronavirus in the country. Flags will be hoisted to half-staff in more than 14,000 public buildings across the country and on Spanish naval vessels until 5 June. It marks the longest official mourning period in Spain’s four-decade-old democracy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e1f1f1d0a51df24bace3c89c45b1632e32dc000/0_0_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad3f8f25f6cad9dbd397ebbb775d7122","title":"uk green recovery covid 19 mps climate nature","story":"Cross-party group calls for ‘faster, further, fairer’ action to tackle climate and nature crisisThe UK needs to invest an additional £30bn a year in shovel-ready green projects to create jobs, energise the post-lockdown economy and put the country back on track to achieve its climate targets, a new cross-party commission recommends.In the most detailed blueprint to date for a green recovery from Covid-19, it also advises the government to make an initial down payment of £5bn into a national “just transition fund” that would support the regions likely to be worst affected by the shift away from fossil fuels.The 96-page dossier was unveiled on Wednesday by the environmental justice commission, which is composed of MPs, business executives, union leaders, climate activists and members of the Institute for Public Policy Research.Under the heading “Faster, further, fairer”, the paper calls for accelerated action to combat the climate and nature crisis, while rebuilding the economy and reducing the risks to livelihoods.It urges the government to set an ambitious 2030 emissions reduction target, including – for the first time – embedded carbon from imported goods. This would help make British manufacturers more competitive, the authors say.To ensure the government does not blow the remaining carbon budget, the paper recommends ending the UK’s policy of maximising the economic extraction of oil and gas in the North Sea and elsewhere and shifting more resources to job creation in construction, manufacturing, renewables, broadband rollout and electrification of the heating and transport sectors.They list nine policies that could accelerate the recovery from Covid-19 and put the UK on a healthier environmental track. Any bailouts for struggling firms should be conditional on reduced emissions, particularly in the airline industry.The stimulus would be funded by borrowing, which is cheap at present thanks to ultra-low interest rates. As well as rebuilding the economy, the spending should aim to address inequality and restore the nation’s natural wealth.Luke Murphy, the head of the environmental justice commission, said the most remarkable aspect of the report was that it united such a broad coalition of ideologies and interests. He hoped cabinet ministers would adopt the recommendations.“We know this fits with the government agenda. And officials are looking at green recovery,” he said. “This goes beyond climate and nature. It must be a wholesale change of the economy that is also good for jobs and business. It is a positive vision of the kind of society we could create.”The MPs on the commission said decarbonising the economy and restoring nature were an opportunity to fix a broken economic model that was failing the majority of people in the UK.“We can build back better – but only if we embed an agenda of rapid decarbonisation within a broader social and economic justice agenda, and ensure that those communities most affected by change have the power to lead and shape it,” said the co-chair Caroline Lucas, a former leader of the Green party.The former Conservative MP Laura Sandys, another co-chair, said the country had a “tantalising and enticing prospect” of a better quality of life, cleaner air, warmer homes, healthier diets and greater access to open spaces.“A new and green economy that is fit for the future is a real possibility if only we can grasp it quickly,” she said.Ed Miliband, who was involved in the commission before his recent appointment as shadow secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy, called on the government to act on the recommendations.“This important report shows why a green recovery is essential for jobs, tackling the climate crisis and improving quality of life,” he said. “There is real urgency for the government to respond and rise to this moment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46344ca16fab9e20d29c30200d34ac3464a51b91/0_124_1007_604/master/1007.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3b56042af4dd270cfda2c05231be89a","title":"worlds largest all electric aircraft set for first flight","story":"Nine-seater plane should take to skies on Thursday and produce no carbon emissionsThe world’s largest all-electric aircraft is about to take to the skies for the first time.The Cessna Caravan, retrofitted with an electric engine, is expected to fly for 20-30 minutes over Washington State in the US on Thursday.The plane can carry nine passengers but a test pilot will undertake the inaugural flight alone, cruising at a speed of 114mph (185kmh). Engine maker magniX hopes the aircraft could enter commercial service by the end of 2021 and have a range of 100 miles (160km).Before the coronavirus pandemic, aviation was one of the fastest growing sources of the carbon emissions that are driving the climate emergency. Scores of companies are working on electric planes, although major breakthroughs in reducing the weight of batteries will be needed before large planes can fly significant distances on electric power alone. Other power sources being tested include hydrogen fuel cells and biofuels.The aviation industry is heavily regulated to ensure safety but magniX hopes that by retrofitting an existing plane the certification process can be accelerated. A smaller seaplane powered by a magniX engine completed a short flight in December.\u0026nbspIn June 2019, another company, Ampaire, flew an aircraft powered by a hybrid electric-fossil fuel engine over California. Analysts at investment bank UBS said at the time that the aviation industry would move towards hybrid and electric engines for routes less than 1,000 miles (1,600km) long much more quickly than many think.Among the other companies developing electric aircraft are Zunum Aero, which is building a 27-seat plane with a 680-mile (1,100km) range and the engine maker Rolls Royce, whose Accel programme aims to produce the fastest all-electric plane to date. However, in April, Rolls Royce and Airbus cancelled their plans for a hybrid electric aircraft. The German company Lilium is working on a five-seater jet-powered electric air taxi.The Cessna Caravan being used by magniX is one of the world’s most used medium-range planes, with more than 2,600 operating in 100 countries.

This, it said, could results in a “quite fundamental change in the relationship between the university sector and the State”."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Rite\u0026ampReason: A healthy planet is a prerequisite for a healthy humanityProtecting wildlife: Local says this is the third year in a row hedgerows cut at wrong timeNetwork could advise government on viruses, climate change and water supply issues"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Antipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winterA new report shows no let-up in the loss of wildlife in Northern IrelandCorncrakes get major EU funding despite being of \u0026lsquoleast concern\u0026rsquo on Red List criteriaAs top marine predators, dolphins accumulate the most man-made toxic pollutantsGlobal warming presents potentially damaging cascades of impacts, new study finds"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Paul FaithAFPA Government adviser has expressed his frustration that Ireland is not taking an “easy win” in the battle against Covid-19 by making face masks mandatory.Damien Nee, who represents patients on the Expert Advisory Group to the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), said wearing masks was key to combating the pandemic in other countries.“I am speaking out of frustration that easy wins are not being taken. That anybody who wants one can wear one and they should be obligatory, especially going into any food shop, because that will ensure that the pandemic does not rise up rapidly again,” he said in an interview on RTÉ’s Prime Time on Tuesday.“When I look at all the wise countries that have coped well it’s a core element. It’s central to their successfully coping with the growth of coronavirus.”He said as far as he was aware there was no shortage in supply of medical grade masks.The Department of Health told Prime Time that such masks are vital for healthcare workers and are not intended for the public. Similarly, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has said they are not necessary for people who have no symptoms and that they can give a false sense of security.‘Not magic shield’Responding on the same programme, Minister for Health Simon Harris said there was varying expert opinion on the subject.“We have given very clear public health guidance that if you are using public transport or if you’re in an indoor space, particularly a space where you can’t socially distance, you should wear a face covering,” he said.“It is an additional hygiene measure, it’s not a magic shield.”It was the same language used by the Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan at the NPHET briefing earlier on Tuesday. He has advised the Government against mandatory use.Much of the voluntary adoption of masks by members of the public might not conform to safe and appropriate use, he explained.“And we are also concerned about the fact that use of face coverings may be seen as some kind of ... magic shield that will protect people in all circumstances and allow them to disregard all the other important parts of public health advice.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4263137.1590559220!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus ministers to question holohan over two metre rule","story":"Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan says that NPHET is looking into the possibility of easing restrictions around visits to nursing home residents and older people cocooning in their own homes. Video: RTÉThe State’s Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan is to brief the Cabinet on Wednesday on the current public health advice on two metre social-distancing rules, which some Ministers last week suggested should be reduced to one metre.At a lengthy meeting of the Cabinet last Friday, several Ministers advocated for social distancing rules to be reduced.Minister for State with responsibility for disability issues Finian McGrath was one of those to raise the issue, and a minority of Ministers were then supportive of the move, political sources said.Many businesses have said that they will be unable to reopen unless the social distancing guide of two metres is reduced to one metre.In the last press briefing on Tuesday evening, Dr Holohan said Ireland needed to move away from the “language of blame” around Covid-19 deaths and that ongoing lessons are being learned in how to respond to the pandemic.He was speaking in the context of nursing homes and rising public discourse around the disproportionate number of deaths in the sector.On Tuesday, the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) reported a further nine deaths of patients with Covid-19 in the State, one day after authorities reported no new deaths for the first time since mid-March. There have now been a total of 1,615 Covid-19 related deaths in the State.Despite a return to mortality reports, Tuesday delivered the lowest number of new confirmed cases since March 13th, at 37, bringing the total to 24,735. Of those, 13 per cent have been hospitalised.The NPHET briefing came after an Oireachtas committee examining the State’s response to the crisis heard heated exchanges around high levels of infection and death in nursing homes.There have now been 884 deaths in the facilities, some 54.7 per cent of the total.Asked to respond to the ongoing fallout, Dr Holohan appealed for society to avoid the attribution of blame. Although he was working and did not hear the Oireachtas proceedings in detail, he said “I think it’s important...that we move away from that language of blame and finger pointing.“Protecting iniduals isn’t a question of blame or identifying the source of who is responsible. And I think that language...is unhelpful.”He said the response must be about “how we pull together as a country”, solidarity and support. “There are lots of organisations involved in this response. Every organisation has things to learn.”Asked about the State’s response to the nursing home sector and whether it was left “isolated” as had been claimed by Nursing Homes Ireland, Dr Holohan said that in general there was very early and significant action taken in comparison to other countries.“A public health-led response which in the first instance had to focus on dealing with community transmission of this virus. There was simply no way of protecting nursing homes or any other institutional setting if we don’t control the spread of this infection in the community.”He said a number of measures in respect of nursing homes were implemented at an earlier point in the outbreak than other countries, including a blanket ban on visitors two weeks after the first case was identified in Ireland.However, he said there was no doubt learnings can be made here and internationally. “We are not going to say in any way that we got everything absolutely right. We are all learning,” he said.Dr Holohan also pointed out on several occasions that nursing homes would have undergone pandemic preparedness before the arrival of Covid-19 with measures including infection control.HSE’ chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henry said significant resources had been erted to the sector and that private nursing homes alone had received over €27 million worth of personal protective equipment.Meanwhile, a further 103 cases of Covid-19 have been reported in meat processing plants in the last week, bringing the total in the sector up to 925.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4263310.1590521533!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"light touch regulation raises its head again with regard to nursing homes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWe learned that Hiqa has yet to inspect a single nursing home with coronavirus casesIf any good is to come from the current crisis it should be that we give greater priority to the care of older people. We could start, for example, by getting on with providing statutory care in people’s homes so they are not “forced” into nursing homes because that is where the financial supports are.For now, though, we urgently need to find out what went wrong in our nursing homes during the pandemic. The number of unexplained deaths in these homes so far this year has jumped by over 880 compared to last year, and the vast majority are associated with Covid-19 infections. How many of these residents died needlessly because no one shut the door to stop the virus entering their vulnerable environments? Hundreds, arguably, given the inflated share of care home deaths as a proportion of overall Covid-19 deaths in Ireland. Compare what happened in nursing homes with another high-risk, enclosed setting, prisons, where temperature checks, cocooning of older inmates and quarantining were implemented. There have been no cases, let alone deaths, among prisoners.Experts have been appointed to review what happened in nursing homes, but it is not difficult to identify the many causes even now. The special committee on Covid-19’s hearings on Tuesday shed some further light, but the extent of what one TD called “pass the parcel” was depressing. ‘Isolated’Nursing Homes Ireland (NHI), whose members are paid hundreds of millions of euro every year to look after older people under the Fair Deal scheme, claimed to have been left “isolated” despite a voluminous trails of correspondence with the HSE and Department of Health officials.The emails and letters did at least show the private nursing home owners were sounding the alarm about the approaching tsunami. But given the scale of the emergency, and their distance from the levers of power, it clearly took too long for their warning to be properly heeded.HSE officials boasted about the “unprecedented level of support” it has provided to nursing homes, but were unable to provide an up-to-date figure for deaths there or a breakdown of deaths between public and private homes. Neither did they answer a question as to whether any of these deaths could have been avoided.They pleaded it was not until late March that scientific research pointed to the specific threat posed by asymptomatic transmission in care homes. NHI’s beef was that it was left out of the committees where all the big decisions were being made. The interests of older people at the National Public Health Emergency Team were supposed to have been represented by the regulator, the Health Information and Quality Authority (Hiqa) , but as Fianna Fáil’s Stephen Donnelly pointed out,there was no mention of nursing homes at the first 11 meetings of NPHET, notwithstanding Hiqa’s presence at them.And when the subject was raised at the 12th meeting in mid-March, the context was NPHET’s desire to reverse a blanket restriction on visitors that private nursing homes had just imposed. NPHET was forced to do a U-turn and impose its own visitor restrictions days later as the situation deteriorated. ‘High-risk’ homesMeanwhile, we learned that Hiqa has yet to inspect a single nursing home with cases. Imagine UN arms inspectors not wanting to go to Iraq, or radiological experts in full protective gear not visiting the site of a nuclear accident.It seems to have contented itself in the early days of the crisis by providing the HSE with a list of “high-risk” homes, though today it is unable to correlate the performance of these homes with case numbers and deaths in them.It seemed the right time to bring out the phrase “light-touch regulation”, as in our last national crisis.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"\u0026lsquoImmediate and significant intervention\u0026rsquo is required to save the Defence Forces, says officers bodyChief executive of The Wheel says position should be established to support sectorThree men have been charged with murder of Cian English (19) outside BrisbaneGarda investigating crash on Tuesday evening between Mulranny and NewportTrade union says there can be \u0026lsquono going back\u0026rsquo to economic and social situation prior to crisisDr Tony Holohan has advised against mandatory usage, following WHO guidelinesNeed to move away from the \u0026lsquolanguage of blame\u0026rsquo, says CMO after nine further deathsSome nursing homes say they had to use painter\u0026rsquos overalls due to lack of PPESchools have been directed to only retain official forms with students\u0026rsquo final gradesFF, Greens want next government to introduce ban being strongly resisted by FGConcern over two peacekeeping Defence Forces officers assigned to Goma cityNegotiating teams from FF, FG and Greens focus on finance policies in talksThousands of students left to return home during Covid-19 lockdownGovernance concerns were raised after nine people living at Clifton Nursing Home diedDepartment official tells Oireachtas committee Co Kerry facility now properly resourcedDPP reluctant to recommend charges in cases involving doubts over essential travelUL president Dr Des Fitzgerald admits virus will curtail his interactions with studentsArchaeologists discover bones in Spanish chapel where Christopher Columbus was also buriedStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4263339.1590524184!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord leo s phoenix pecs just a storm in a bag of cans","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn image shared on social media at the weekend of Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and his partner Matt Barrett meeting two friends in the Phoenix Park in Dublin.Leo Varadar is due in the chamber at midday on Wednesday for his first Dáil appearance of the week. It is likely to be his only one because the following day’s schedule has been cleared for a six hour mega-romp with Paschal Donohoe through the revised Social Protection estimates.After the usual formalities, the Ceann Comhairle, who has a nice sense of humour, will commence proceedings.In an ideal world, here’s the way it should happen:“I call the Taoiseach. Taoiseach?”And Leo will rise to his feet.A perplexed looking Seán Ó Fearghaíl will raise his voice.“I call the Taoiseach?”Leo will cough discretely into his elbow to announce his presence and the Ceann Comhairle will respond.“If it isn’t yourself, Taoiseach, sure I didn’t recognise you with your clothes on. Get it all off your chest now.”But this is no laughing matter.The switchboard in Government Buildings must have been jammed with people ringing up to complain about those photographs of Leo Varadkar and his partner brazenly showing off their Phoenix Park pecs at the weekend.When The  contacted the Taoiseach’s office on Tuesday afternoon a spokesman stated the incident “hasn’t been an issue” as far as complaints are concerned, which is a matter for concern. It seems people are so shocked and livid they haven’t even been unable to ring Joe Duffy.The snaps surfaced on social media on Monday and since then we have been doing all we can to link the Taoiseach’s relatively harmless interpretation of Ireland’s lockdown rules to the seriously shabby case of Dominic (Drive Back and Lie for England) Cummings and his boss Boris (Lockdown and Lie for England) and their blithe disregard for them.The two episodes are not remotely the same.For starters, the Taoiseach may be\u0026nbsp bare-chested but he’s in charge whereas the British prime minister is a titular head. Leo likes to remove his shirt. Boris is a martyr to his trousers.Cummings, the PM’s Special Advisor who transgressed the stringent lockdown rules he promoted, is the one in charge and he keeps his clothes on.One man flaunted.The other flouted.Leo had a picnic in the park with his partner and two friends on a hot summer’s afternoon on his day off. He took off his top and had a lie down on the grass. This was not in keeping with the stern advice issued days earlier by a Government spokeswoman recommending that people could take the air and meet in groups of four if observing social distance rules , but not linger together for picnics or that sort of thing.The Taoiseach followed the rules, almost to the letter. The picnic was questionable. It was a very public display. There was a blanket on the ground and a wicker basket. One newspaper reported that the Taoiseach held a cup in his hand. Others said he was holding a can. Perhaps there was a bag of cans in the wicker basket.He will have been well aware of curious eyes all around, watching him. Many people were similarly sunbathing, camera phones in reach. He knew somebody would take a photo of him and knew there was every chance that some of them would end up on the web.But Leo also knew that, apart from that wicker basket, he was not breaking the restrictions. He enjoying himself within the distancing requirements and showing off too. Taoiseach Leo - Little Lord Flauntleroy. Because he can.Dominic Cummings did not have a picnic in the park but he had a walk in the park, although not in the true sense of a walk because while he was putting one foot in front of the other, he wasn’t technically walking because that would have been breaking the rules.He did scarper 260 miles from his home in London with his wife and young child - both adults possibly infected with Covid-19 - driving to his parent’s farm in a lovely picturesque part of England as colleagues in Downing Street were keeling over with the virus.But he has argued that was allowed legitimately because he was acting in the interests of his child, even though that clause was expressly brought in by his government to help parents escape with their children from domestic violence situations.Cummings was spotted making little excursions in his coach and four while in Durham, including tootling like Mr Magoo to a distant beauty spot because he says he needed to gauge if his dodgy eyesight would allow him to convey his family back to London. (His wife can also drive a car which would have obviated the need for her hubby, and on her birthday as well, to possibly blunder dangerously along the public road to a popular tourist destination in the midst of a pandemic.)He flouted the rules.Then the titular PM flaunted his flouting of the rules. Crazy stuff.Nothing like that here. We’re only in the ha’penny place compared to what’s happening across the water and that’s a relief.In the meantime, the official Cabinet Handbook is being urgently reprinted to emphasise that ministers may only be shirtless for New Year, Christmas and Think-In swims.A topless Taoiseach and a provocative picnic.Will the Dáil let him away with it or will they want to discuss Leo’s al fresco fiasco when the House reconvenes?Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4263274.1590518142!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"proposed ban on israeli goods a sticking point in government talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSenator Frances Black: “We have an opportunity we can show leadership.”  Photograph: Brenda FitzsimonsThe future of a proposed ban on the importation of Israeli goods produced in Palestinian territories has emerged as a sticking point in the talks on government formation.Fianna Fáil and the Greens want the next government to promote the Bill and introduce the ban, but this is being strongly resisted by Fine Gael, according to several people familiar with the progress of the talks.It is also understood that there has been fierce lobbying by both sides, while the US embassy – which is strongly against the legislation – has also made its views known to Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, who is leading the Fine Gael team in the talks, has resisted the Fianna Fáil and Green demands to have a commitment to progress the Bill included in the programme for government.Mr Coveney has insisted that the Bill is “illegal” because trade is an EU competence, meaning that trade policy is made at EU level, not national level. One country cannot ban goods that may be legally imported elsewhere in the single market, he told the talks, adding that this was the advice of the Attorney General.However, Fianna Fáil and the Greens have cited competing legal advice, and Fianna Fáil is understood to have proposed that the new government push for controls on imports from the occupied territories on an EU-wide basis.Sources on both sides say there has been no movement and no agreement on the issue. Supporters of the Bill have compared it to the ban on goods from apartheid-era South Africa – a characterisation fiercely resisted not just by supporters of Israel but also by some critics of Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians as they fear the Bill singles out Israel for special treatment. Hold strongSenator Black said that she hoped that Fianna Fáil and the Greens would “hold strong” on the Bill. She disputed the Attorney General’s legal advice, saying that she and her supporters had presented competing legal advice that the ban could go ahead. “We have an opportunity we can show leadership.”.Ms Black also pointed to the imminent Israeli annexation of Jewish settlements on previously Palestinian-held territory in the West Bank, part of the new Israeli government’s programme. A spokeswoman for the Israeli embassy described the Bill as “the most extreme anti-Israel piece of legislation in the western world” .“It is a blatant example of the manipulation and cherry-picking of international law to further an anti-Israel political agenda. “Should it become law in Ireland it would certainly diminish any opportunity which Ireland may have to constructively contribute to the promotion of peace in our region.”"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Police fire pepper balls at protesters as US threatens sanctions over proposed security lawMove to impose security law illustrates Beijing\u0026rsquos increasing tendency to flex its muscleProtesters get ready for more demonstrations against proposed Beijing lawsCommissioner in territory says contentious new security law aimed at \u0026lsquotroublemakers\u0026rsquoPM has made most of her communication skills and the country\u0026rsquos political cultureCian English (19), from Carlow, died following fall from Gold Coast apartmentChina proposes path to imposing rules used against dissidents on the mainlandPolice fire tear gas in popular shopping district as protesters take to the streets\u0026lsquoThere is a political virus spreading in United States,\u0026rsquo says China\u0026rsquos foreign ministerWinds gusting up to 210kmh expected near iron ore producing heartland of the PilbaraInvestigation begins into cause of Pakistan International Airlines crash that killed 97Officials confirm two survivors after PIA aircraft crashes in residential area of KarachiOutrage among pro-democracy legislators at security law put forward at National People\u0026rsquos CongressRescue teams hampered by torn-down power lines and flooding over large tracts of landPro-Beijing politicians are pushing contentious laws in the face of intense oppositionCyclone Amphan moving inland with gusts of up to 185kmh, says India met serviceSuper cyclone Amphan, with winds up to 160kmh, expected to hit India\u0026rsquos coast on WednesdayRules to be relaxed in areas with low numbers of infection, according to governmentIf Travis McCready\u0026rsquos US event goes ahead, it will look very different from typical rock gigsCity looks asymptomatic carriers after confirming first Covid cluster last weekend since release from lockdownStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Former cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationRival Gantz to take over as prime minister of Israeli unity government after 18 monthsAshraf Ghani to lead country as rival Abdullah Abdullah oversees Taliban peace process, sources sayCeremony will end political deadlock that has dragged on for more than 500 daysArab and foreign jihadis ambush military convoys and assassinate officials as Baghdad and Damascus try to contain coronavirusThree men captured west of Caracas are the latest \u0026lsquoterrorists\u0026rsquo arrestedAt least 24 killed by suicide bomber in separate attack in Afghanistan on TuesdayAccident in which 15 wounded takes place during training exercise in Gulf of OmanFormation of coalition to proceed after supreme court clears way for PM to remain in officePolitics and ision facilitate virus in country with just 208 ventilators and scant testingPresident fears country\u0026rsquos 44 cases and three deaths could \u0026lsquosuddenly spike in few days or weeks\u0026rsquoResidents in Mosul, still traumatised by violence, fear a resurgence of the terror groupRuling against Likud chief would likely trigger snap election, the fourth since April 2019Accelerating economic meltdown has left country\u0026rsquos poorest without work and incomeStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus.

A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates.

Last year I wrote about the possible threat of coronaviruses and the urgent need for planning.However, Mr Cummings\u0027 claim to have predicted the pandemic was not strictly true, Downing Street admitted on Tuesday night.In fact, sources confirmed that the Prime Minister\u0027s top aide secretly edited a year-old post on his personal blog last month to add a warning about coronaviruses.MPs immediately accused Mr Cummings of misleading the nation by falsely making it appear that he had long warned about coronaviruses, and had always taken Covid-19 seriously.Downing Street defended the Prime Minister\u0027s chief adviser, however, pointing out that he had previously drawn attention to the threat from pandemic diseases.Mr Cummings\u0027 claim began to unravel within hours of his Rose Garden appearance. Social media users quickly found online clues strongly suggesting that he had quietly edited a year-old blog post to insert a reference to coronavirus at 8:55pm on April 14, the day he returned to work at Downing Street and two days after he visited Barnard Castle with his wife and child.The blog post, published on Mr Cummings\u0027 WordPress blog on March 4, 2019, cited research by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists on how security flaws in scientific laboratories working with dangerous pathogens could lead to a global pandemic. However a section from the same paper – only added last month – discusses an incident in which two Sars coronavirus researchers in China accidentally triggered a small breakout of the virus in 2004. Two researchers conducting virus research were exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) coronavirus samples that were incompletely inactivated, Mr Cummings\u0027 article now says. The researchers subsequently transmitted Sars to others, leading to several infections and one death.The post goes on to suggest that the UK Government should explore the use of honey traps to improve security at British labs.No other mentions of coronavirus appear on Mr Cummings\u0027 website. Other blog posts later re-edited by him show Updated in the title. This one did not.MPs accused Mr Cummings of deliberately misleading the British public by pretending he had warned of the threat of coronavirus before it arrived in the UK.This is another lie that Cummings told to the British people at the press conference, said Wera Hobhouse, the Liberal Democrat MP for Bath.Downing Street would not elaborate on Mr Cummings\u0027 reasons for inserting the new section on April 14. Three weeks earlier, he had been accused of  cheerleading the controversial herd immunity strategy adopted in the early stages of the outbreak and certain to be a focus for any public inquiry.An anonymous source quoted in the Sunday Times on March 22 summarised Mr Cummings\u0027 thinking as: Herd immunity, protect the economy and, if that means some pensioners die, too bad.The story caused a sensation on social media, despite being furiously denied by Downing Street, which claimed the quotes were invented.During his Monday press conference, Mr Cummings repeatedly insisted he had always taken coronavirus seriously and had long warned of the need to plan for a pandemic.His decision to insert a warning about lab accidents in China also came on the day that a group of senior Tory MPs accused the Chinese government of a cover-up over Covid-19. That week, US government sources also claimed to have evidence that coronavirus had escaped from a Wuhan lab.Mr Cummings has long used his personal blog to criticise the bloated machinery of government. Last year he posted an advert for weirdos and misfits with odd skills to work in Number Ten.A Downing Street spokesman said his original post did include a link to an article which discussed coronaviruses and from which the added quote was taken.Mr Cummings has warned about the dangers of pandemics for years and the urgent need for planning, the spokesman said. In his blog post of March last year, he drew attention to an important story in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists about natural and engineered pandemics including coronaviruses. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"introducing planet normal new telegraph podcast talks normal","story":"Sick of gotcha political coverage?

They both have older children and, unlike so many London-centric journalists, live outside the M25.Subscribe now on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or Pocket Casts and listen to the trailer belowWhat unites them, above all, is that Pearson and Halligan are staunchly and proudly “normal” – both hailing from unflashy, proletarian, non-professional backgrounds, the first in their respective families to go to university. That’s one reason they share a reputation for shrewd political analysis and trend-spotting - knowing in their bones, often before the Westminster crowd, how “ordinary people” think.“You know that moment when you’re watching a TV panel discussion and finally – finally! – someone says something you agree with,” says Pearson. “That’s what Planet Normal is all about!”Pearson and Halligan have between them spent almost forty years penning national newspaper columns, winning countless awards for their writing and broadcasting. They both feel strongly that the media is now far less representative of the broader UK population than when they started out.“It’s become much harder in recent years for people from ordinary backgrounds to break into high-end journalism,” says Halligan. “We\u0027ve made progress in terms of gender and ethnic ersity, but there’s now far less ersity in terms of opinion – with much of the broadcast media, in particular, dominated by privileged insiders holding the same approved views”.Planet Normal is a small but spirited attempt to counter that. In their 30-minute weekly podcast, Pearson and Halligan will review the news in the same sharp, irreverent, down-to-earth style they bring to their writing. The emphasis will be on calling out pomposity, lifting the lid on reality and countering political spin.And, on their trips to Planet Normal, Pearson and Halligan will be bringing along fabulous guests for the ride, representing all parts of the news cosmos – from politics to showbiz, from finance to culture – while responding to questions from Planet Normal listeners.Planet Normal - because some journalists are normal people too.The first episode will appear here at 6am on Thursday, May 28.To make sure you never miss an episode, subscribe on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocket Casts, or search \u0027Planet Normal\u0027 on your podcast app.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"madeira reopen july 1 free tests tourists","story":" Travellers will soon be welcome to return with no obligation to self-isolate on arrivalComment:  One way or another we will have a summer holidayWhat is an air bridge and why is the Government considering them?Can I go on holiday in the UK?

MPs insisted they should be revisited every three weeks. The next review day is today.But the 21-day  is a maximum, not a specified length of time that has to be rigidly adhered to. There is nothing to stop the Government conducting weekly or daily reviews for that matter and adapting to changing circumstances. With the virus abating, now is the time to accelerate the timetable out of the lockdown, regionally if necessary.The Government has become fixated on dates that were set weeks ago. The decision to open some schools on June 1 was set out by Boris Johnson on May 10. In that speech he said secondary schools would begin to open on June 15, the same date that non-essential shops can start up business once more. These are welcome but they are still almost three weeks away.Could this not be done more quickly? Will the review committee look at the data to see if it can be? Under the strategy, bars and restaurants will not be allowed to open for possibly another six weeks and maybe not even then, with a requirement to stay half empty because of the social distancing measures.This will make it impossible for many of these establishments to survive because their overheads will not be covered by the custom. To help them out, the review should give serious consideration to reducing the two-metre rule to one metre and not delay a decision on that for another three weeks.The rules surrounding families are baffling. One member can meet one other relative but only outside and not in their own gardens. Why on earth not? If no one is displaying any symptoms of the disease, why should they be kept apart?If the aim is to stop large gatherings of youngsters, that seems to be happening anyway. But why should people prepared to behave “responsibly and reasonably” in exercising their own judgment not be allowed to meet up in their gardens when outside transmission is negligible?The situation regarding how the Government will pursue the idea of social “bubbles” of friends and relatives is still unclear.

The object was studied from scientists across the world who were unable to explain why it looked something like a supernova explosion but had some strange differences.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe object was incredibly bright initially, for instance, but then faded away in just a few days.Researchers then began to look at another two blasts, from 2016 and 2018, which showed similar unusual characteristics. Researchers found themselves struggling to explain those two explosions, too.Earth’s magnetic field weakening, causing chaos for satellitesOne of the objects became so bright so quickly that the scientist studying it thought she had made a mistake. The other threw out an unexpected material through space at more than half the speed of light, leading researchers to puzzle over the discovery.“It took almost two years to figure out what we were looking at just because it was so unusual, said Raffaella Margutti from Northwestern University, the co-author on one of a number of studies examining the new kinds of explosions.The researchers then realised the three unexplained objects had characteristics in common and that they appeared to be a new class of explosion, different from any others. They named the phenomena Fast Blue Optical Transients, or FBOTs.The material being thrown out of those FBOTs is some of the fastest outflows ever seen in nature. While other explosions have ejected material faster, they tend to throw out a much smaller amount of mass, and so the new explosion represents a whole new kind of extreme phenomenon.“We thought we knew what produced the fastest outflows in nature,” said Margutti. “We thought there were only two ways to produce them – by collapsing a massive star with a gamma-ray burst or two neutron stars merging. We thought that was it.With this study, we are introducing a third way to launch these outflows. There is a new beast out there, and it’s able to produce the same energetic phenomenon.”Astronomers say that the FBOTs probably begin in the same way as other dramatic supernovae and gamma-ray bursts, when a massive sun explodes at the end of its life. But it is after that explosion that the differences become clear.Normally, a supernova sends a spherical blast of material out into space, and when a disc forms around it then it may send a gamma-ray burst across the universe, with that disc working as an engine. The FBOTs are different because their disc is made up of thick material that was probably shed by the star just before it exploded.As the blast hits that material, it causes the emission of bright light that first allowed scientists to see the objects.The researchers describe their findings in new papers published in Astrophysical Journal Letters and the Astrophysical Journal.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There will be hand sanitiser readily available and arrows on the floor directing us which way round to go. Ikea and John Lewis are among retailers to have said they will introduce “social distance wardens” to ensure people are kept apart and obeying the rules. High streets are also likely to be a lot quieter than we’re used to. Only a relatively small percentage of shops are likely to open their doors on 15 June as most retailers have said they will take a gradual approach, testing out the new way of doing things on their most spacious and easily adapted stores.Johnson urges Britons to return to the shops and spend next monthNext, for example, says it will open just 25 of its 500 UK stores on the first day. John Lewis has also said it will take a cautious approach to reopening. Richard Lim, chief executive of consultancy Retail Economics, forecasts that shopping centres will be even slower to reopen than high streets because people will prefer to shop in local, familiar, open-air environments, rather than travel to large complexes.He points out that shopping centres often attract consumers looking for a day out by offering an array of food options and other leisure experiences, nearly all of which will remain closed.Some chains have simply stopped paying rent on stores that are closed and will be reluctant to reopen shopping centre locations (which tend to be the most expensive) when they don’t know how many shoppers will come through the door.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some people, particularly those most vulnerable to Covid-19, will still not feel comfortable heading to the shops to be exposed to large numbers of people.Others will have grown used to the ease of online shopping while many more may have lost their jobs or be concerned about their financial position.“There is potentially a big gap between what people expect the experience of shopping will be like and the reality of that experience when retailers reopen,” says Lim.“Shopping is all about having a social experience, it’s supposed to be enjoyable. It might be a shock to some people, being met with a shop-floor worker wearing a mask, being asked to sanitise your hands, and have a social distancing warden walking around telling people to stay in certain areas. “It could really undermine that experience and just push people even more towards online shopping.”Which non-essential shops are reopening and when will it happen?Millions of garment workers facing destitution as demand dries upShoppers return to UK high streets after dire 2019 tradingLim believes the impacts of the guidance will be felt very unevenly across the retail sector depending on a number of factors.Value clothing retailers like Primark are likely to find things tough because their stores need a lot of people coming through to make a profit. People also pick up and put down items often and the stock is normally densely packed, something that will have to be reconsidered in a socially distanced era.Footwear retailers will find things even tougher as the way we buy shoes is forced to change. The new guidelines require a shoe shop to take any shoe that has been tried on by a customer and store it for 72 hours before putting back out on the shop floor. That will make storage impractical and could leave stores unprofitable.“We are likely to see a step change in retailers’ efforts to merge online and offline shopping experiences,” says Lim. That will be through more click-and-collect services, and more inventive ways to get people in stores and excited by what they see. If they then buy online after that it doesn’t matter.Lim points to the example of Zara in Shanghai which is “like an art exhibition”. “You then go to a changing room and the items are waiting there for you in your size or you just press a button and get it delivered to your home.”Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?This model of the shop as more of a showcase is one that many retailers have been moving towards, but it requires significant investment at a time when many will be tightening their belts.Whatever happens, retailers need a significant turnaround in their fortunes or there will almost certainly be large-scale store closures, job losses and collapses into administration.Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, sums it up: “Lockdown has cost non-food stores £1.8bn a week in lost revenues and with sales expected to remain weak, even as shops begin to reopen, many retailers will still be in a fight for survival. “Government must act to ensure that retail rents take account of the ongoing crisis in the industry. Swift action would protect jobs and businesses – helping retail to play its part in restarting the UK economy.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The rocket and capsule that will carry the astronauts has been built by Elon Musk\u0027s SpaceX, and the mission represents the final test of both.Nasa and SpaceX launch could be delayed by weatherIt will also be the first time a private company has attempted to send astronauts into space.Here\u0027s everything you need to know about this mission, which will launch at 9.30pm UK time.The mission, known as Demo-2, will allow the US to once again send humans into space.According to Nasa, this is a demonstration mission to show SpaceX\u0027s ability to ferry astronauts to the space station and back safely.It is the final major step required by SpaceX\u0027s astronaut carrier, the Crew Dragon, to get certified by Nasa\u0027s Commercial Crew Programme for more long-term manned missions to space.Mr Behnken, 48, and Mr Hurley, 53, are experienced Nasa astronauts who have been involved in testing of the Crew Dragon capsule.Mr Hurley, who was a fighter pilot in the US Marine Corps, was on the final flight of the space shuttle Atlantis in 2011 before it was discontinued.Mr Behnken was a flight test engineer with the US Air Force before joining Nasa, and has spent just over 29 days in space, which includes 37 hours of spacewalking time.He will serve as the mission\u0027s joint operations commander and take responsibility for the rendezvous, docking and undocking of the Dragon capsule, while Mr Hurley will be in charge of the launch, landing and recovery of the vehicle in his role as the Crew Dragon spacecraft commander.The two men will be wearing spacesuits designed by SpaceX with help from Hollywood costume designer Jose Fernandez.The Falcon 9 rocket will take off from launchpad 39A at the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida, carrying the Crew Dragon spacecraft with Mr Behnken and Mr Hurley strapped inside.Shortly after lift-off, the rocket will separate into what is called a first stage and a second stage.The first stage will return to a SpaceX landing ship which will be stationed in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Florida, while the second part of the rocket continue the journey with the Crew Dragon.Once in orbit, the Crew Dragon will then separate from the second stage and travel at around 17,000mph before being in a position to rendezvous, and dock, with the space station 24 hours later.Mr Behnken and Mr Hurley will test the Crew Dragon\u0027s environmental control system, the displays and controls, and the manoeuvring thrusters.They will also monitor the autonomous docking system during the approach to the space station, according to Nasa.The duo will become members of the Expedition 63 crew and perform further tests on the Crew Dragon along with other tasks related to the space station.But the pair\u0027s main mission is to conclude the validation process that is required by Nasa to ensure the spacecraft designed to carry astronauts can operate safely.The Demo-2 mission is expected to last anything between one and four months. But Nasa said the duration of this mission would be determined by when the next commercial crew will be able to travel to the space station.The spacecraft will be capable of staying in orbit for at least 210 days.When it is time to return, the Crew Dragon will autonomously undock with Mr Behnken and Mr Hurley on board and depart the space station.Shortly after firing up its engines to re-enter the Earth\u0027s atmosphere, the spacecraft will deploy four parachutes to slow its descent and splash down in the Atlantic Ocean, just off the coast of Florida.SpaceX\u0027s recovery ship, called Go Navigator, will be waiting nearby to retrieve the duo and ferry them to Cape Canaveral.In 2010, the US started to wind down its space shuttle programme which had carried astronauts into orbit for three decades with the aim of focusing on building technology for Moon and Mars missions.Nasa asked private companies such as Space X and Boeing to design the technologies which would allow passengers to travel to space, while opting to pay Russia to send American astronauts to the space station as an interim arrangement.If Demo-2 is successful, SpaceX will be allowed to go ahead with more manned missions to the space stations as part of their 2.6 billion US dollar (£2.1 billion) contract with Nasa.Boeing also has a similar deal with the space agency, worth 4.2 billion US dollars (£3.4 billion), to send astronauts to the space station in its CST-100 Starliner crew capsule, although its vehicle is not expected to be ready until next year.Both Nasa and SpaceX will be hosting live streams of the events, which will begin a few hours before launch. Tune in earlier to get a look at the astronauts as they are driven to the spacecraft before they set off, as well as for discussions about the mission with experts.Nasa\u0027s live coverage will be hosted on Nasa TV, which can be watched here, via YouTube, as well as on the space agency\u0027s official site:SpaceX\u0027s coverage will be hosted on its own website too, on a launch page that currently gives a full rundown of how the day will play out.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And it is the first time Nasa has been able to send its astronauts into space from their home soil, since it has been forced to borrow seats from the Russian space agency to go to the International Spacae Station.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe mission, known as Demo-2, is officially the final test of SpaceX\u0027s craft, the Crew Dragon capsule, which will be mounted on top of one of its Falcon 9 rockets. It is intended to demonstrate that Elon Musk\u0027s space company is able to ferry astronauts up into space and then bring them home again.Nasa hopes that such collaborations with private companies will help power its ambitious plans for the coming years, which include a return to the Moon as well as planned trips on to Mars.SpaceX raises $350 million of funding a day before launchElon Musk\u0027s\u0026nbspSpaceX\u0026nbspsaid on Tuesday that it raised $346.2 million in a new round of funding, a day before it launches two American astronauts to the International Space Station.The private rocket company\u0027s launch of its first crewed mission on Wednesday from NASA\u0027s Kennedy Space Center in Florida will put an end to the U.S. space agency\u0027s nine-year hiatus in human spaceflight.The launch, which will be attended by President Donald Trump, is crucial for Musk,\u0026nbspSpaceX\u0026nbspand NASA.A successful flight will mark a milestone in the quest to produce reusable spacecraft that can make space travel more affordable. Musk is the founder and chief executive officer of\u0026nbspSpaceX\u0026nbspand CEO of Tesla Inc.Including the latest round, the company has raised more than $567 million and is valued at about $36 billion, according to a CNBC report.SpaceX to become first ever private company to put people in space – beating almost every countryIf SpaceX is successful today, it will be the first private company ever to put humans into space. Such a feat has only been achieved by three countries: the US, Russia and China.The company has been sending cargo to the International Space Station since 2012. But it has said that sending humans is an entirely different proposition.It\u0027s a huge step, obviously, going from cargo ... to launching two people that are dads as we call them and have families, kids, wives., said\u0026nbspHans Koenigsmann, a\u0026nbspSpaceX\u0026nbspvice president.\u0027I will stop in a heartbeat if you\u0026nbspwant me to\u0027Yesterday,\u0026nbspNasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine said from Kennedy Space Center that both the space agency and SpaceX have been diligent about making sure everyone in the launch loop knows they\u0027re free to halt the countdown if there\u0027s a concern.President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are expected at Kennedy for the planned 4:33 p.m. liftoff, but our highest priority will remain the astronauts\u0027 safety, according to Bridenstine.Bridenstine said he texted the two astronauts Monday and told them, \u0027If you want me to stop this thing for any reason, say so. I will stop it in a heartbeat if you want me to.\u0027 They both came back and they said, \u0027We\u0027re go for launch.\u0027 Hans Koenigsmann, a SpaceX vice president, said Monday evening that he and other company workers have imagined themselves in the astronauts\u0027 shoes on launch day — or their helmets.That changes the equation pretty dramatically, he said.\u0026nbspPlease allow a moment for the live blog to loadBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Researchers found 70 per cent of parents do not have any type of external support in providing care and education for their children.The study, which polled 3,055 working parents in the UK, America, France, Germany, and Italy, found similar gendered patterns in other countries too.Researchers found women with children across these countries now spend an average of 65 hours a week on unpaid labour around the house — with this figure having almost doubled since the Covid-19 crisis. This is almost a third more than fathers, who are doing an average of 50 hours a week.It comes after a study by the London School of Economics recently found coronavirus is exacerbating the gender gap as women bear the brunt of childcare responsibilities and homeschooling during lockdown — whether they’re working or not.I founded the Wages for Housework campaign – little has changed sinceThe report found women are more likely to deal with homeschooling, childcare and chores around the house even if they are juggling this with working at the same time.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Together with the way we are adapting our working lives to cope during the lockdown, this gives me hope that in the long term, a more equal society will emerge.”The report found women are more likely than men to lose their jobs in the forthcoming recession because a larger number work in sectors — such as hospitality, leisure, tourism and the arts — that are forecast to be hardest hit.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Should people touch them?“If people have washed their hands properly, you might argue that there shouldn’t be a transmission risk onto the fabrics.UK announces plan for ‘local lockdowns’ for future outbreaks – live“But people are now suggesting if you try on a garment and you don’t want it, that garment should be put into quarantine for several days before it’s then being put back onto the shelves.”The Independent has approached Public Health England for comment.In April, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) released guidance asking businesses to consider closing or limiting access to changing rooms in shops under strict social distancing measures.Helen Dickinson, the BRC’s chief executive, said at the time: “Retailers are closely following developments from government on when restrictions might be eased and are starting to plan accordingly. “The safety and wellbeing of colleagues and customers remains the highest priority and these guidelines aim to support everyone in the industry.”Coronavirus: Should you be wearing a face mask?Prof Keevil, principal investigator at Southampton’s microbiology unit, also warned that thorough hand-washing regimes would need to become part of every day life on the high street to help stop the spread of the virus.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This trend, combined with people\u0027s own changing attitudes toward social events and large gatherings, resulted in travel dropping by more than 50 per cent before the lockdown began, according to requests made on Apple Maps for car and public transport directions.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRequests on Apple Maps for car directions began to fall on 11 March, while requests for public transport directions began to fall even earlier on 9 March.Many activities and behaviours that were considered normal before coronavirus also remain taboo regardless of the government\u0027s guidelines.The recently relaxed rules mean that cleaners and nannies are now permitted to visit people\u0027s homes, but a recent survey found that the majority of people found this very unacceptable.The poll by Ipsos MORI, which was carried out between 8 and 11 May, also found that having non co-habiting friends, family members or loved ones visit was also considered socially unacceptable.​Public opinion about exercise and driving is more greatly ided, ​though the poll demonstrated that government rules may not be a defining influence on people\u0027s behaviours.Companies\u0027 decisions to keep work from home policies in place show that lockdown measures are not necessarily enforced by government policy decision.The figures also suggest that the impact of coronavirus on travel habits, socialising and other pre-lockdown habits could continue long after lockdown officially ends.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She did not want to risk a nearly 300-mile drive with our child given how ill I had been.“We agreed that we should go for a short drive to see if I could drive safely, we drove for roughly half an hour and ended up on the outskirts of Barnard Castle town. We did not visit the castle, we did not walk around the town.”Mr Cummings said he had felt a “bit sick” so they had walked about 10 to 15 metres to the riverbank where they sat for about 15 minutes until he felt better.Claimed he had previously warned of coronavirus pandemicMr Cummings used the briefing to insist he, contrary to some reports, had not resisted the introduction of lockdown measures and had in fact previously warned of the dangers of a coronavirus pandemic.“For years, I have warned of the dangers of pandemics. Last year I wrote about the possible threat of coronaviruses and the urgent need for planning,” he said.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

silence at Guy\u0027s HospitalMr Cummings did in fact write an entry on his blog in March 2019, which more specifically examined the possibility of a deadly outbreak being triggered by a coronavirus accidentally released from a laboratory during scientific experiments. However, there have been suggestions that the reference to coronavirus was actually added to the blog in April 2020.Scientists currently believe Sars-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19, jumped from animals to humans as the product of natural evolution.Described his family’s farm as ‘sort of concrete blocks’The PM’s senior adviser insisted that his trip to Durham to isolate was not because the property on his family’s farm was a “nice place to be”.“The point about it was not that it was some nice place to be. If you have been there, you would see that it\u0027s sort of concrete blocks,” he said.“The point about it was not that it was a nice place to be, but that it was the safest place to be in the circumstances – and it meant that I didn\u0027t have to expose other people to risk unless I absolutely had to in a critical emergency.”Didn’t make inquiries about childcare in London before making tripMr Cummings used the briefing to insist the journey had been necessary because he and his wife had no reasonable childcare options in London if they both fell ill with coronavirus.“I suddenly got a call from my wife who was at home looking after our four-year-old child,” he explained in a prepared statement.“She told me she suddenly felt badly ill, she vomited and felt like she might pass out, and there would be nobody to look after our child. None of our usual childcare options were available.”However, in subsequent questioning from journalists, Mr Cummings later admitted he did not make inquiries about potential childcare in London.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He should understand that public mood one now: one of fury, contempt and anguish.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“He made those who struggled to keep to the rules feel like fools, and has allowed many more to assume they can now flout them.”Mr Cummings has been under scrutiny for his movements in April during the UK’s national lockdown, which included driving 260 miles from London to Durham, and a journey to Barnard Castle in the northeast.Does Covid-19 affect eyesight as Dominic Cummings described?Dominic Cummings has trashed the public’s trust in government advice How the Dominic Cummings scandal changed the political landscapeThe chief advisor to Boris Johnson said he had travelled north to isolate in a property on his father’s farm because of concerns over care for his four-year-old son if both he and his wife were incapacitated by coronavirus.In a televised speech following public outrage, Mr Cummings said the trip to Barnard Castle was to test his eyesight before driving back to the capital.Following on from her comments about public anger and people feeling they can now ignore lockdown rules, Ms Maitlis said: “The prime minister knows all this, but despite the resignation of one minister, growing unease from his backbenchers, a dramatic early warning from the polls, and a deep national disquiet, Boris Johnson has chosen to ignore it.”The presenter said Newsnight would discuss what this “blind loyalty” shows about how No10 operates.Created with Sketch.Newspapers react after Johnson stands by Cummings Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.She has been praised for the “brilliant” introduction to the BBC show, with one person on social media saying her comments were “most definitely needed”. “Emily Maitlis has summed it up perfectly,” another Twitter user said.

Michael Anthony Gray Sr., aged 63, and Shirley Ann Gray, aged 60, were charged on Monday with multiple crimes including child abuse, child neglect, kidnapping and abuse of a corpse.Investigators say the couple had confined their daughter to a basement with nothing but bread and water for months, before her death in 2017. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe child’s body, which appeared to have been buried behind the property, was located on Saturday. Authorities believe the child, who Mr Gray admitted was buried when investigators arrived at the home on Friday, was around 10 years old when she died.

One son, aged around 15, was allegedly discovered living in the basement after Mr Gray admitted this to authorities. “The house was filled with urine smell, faeces throughout the house, partially flooded basement,” said the Roane County court on Monday. Investigators searched the address over the weekend after someone told police that the youngest child was walking alone near the family home. Whilst his parents were unaware, Roane County authorities located the child who allegedly told them about the basement and the other child buried in the backyard, reported WVLT News. Detectives then arrived at the house to investigate.The couple also admitted that the children had not received medical or dental attention for at least six years prior to the investigation. At the same time, authorities said the children had “stunted growth” and that the parents had withheld food from them as punishment. The couple could face further charges.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailMr Terzi said the prayer held particular significance because the coronavirus pandemic forced many worshippers into isolation during this year’s Ramadan.The holy month of fasting usually has families coming together each night to break their fasts and carry out charitable works.He told the BBC: “It was a completely different Ramadan month, without contacts, without visits, without breaking the fast together.”Photos of the prayer were shared widely on social media, with many praising Ikea for allowing the local Muslim congregation to mark the occasion.Asim Chaudhry, star of BBC sitcom People Just Do Nothing, retweeted a photo and said: “Big up Ikea. Even the Mosques are DIY.”Max Kerman, frontman of the band Arkells, said: “This is the kind of news I want in my feed. Goodness begets goodness. And if nothing else I am a more hopeful human.”The mosque said in a statement: “We would like to express our gratitude to the Wetzlar police, the Wetzlar public order office, management of Ikea Wetzlar, brothers and all that made this extraordinary prayer possible. Thank you so much.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Iran, for example, has deployed a similar strategy.For years, we have known China censors what its people read and say online. Now we know authorities began censoring keywords and discussion of the outbreak weeks before its severity was acknowledged.Already in late December, doctors in Wuhan began to see patients suffering from an unusual pneumonia.Dr Li Wenliang,  who reported it to colleagues, was forced by police to sign a confession denouncing his communication as “illegal behaviour”.Dr Li later “died of the outbreak”.A number of critical journalists then went missing, along with Ren Zhiqiang, a well-known property tycoon critical of the regime.A month after his disappearance, China announced his official detention and investigation.Beijing is now saying that it will allow the WHO to visit for an investigation — but “not yet”.So how should we deal with China going forwards — especially since an inept, repressive officialdom has responded to international criticism with an aggressive misinformation campaign, completely misjudging the mood around the world China, as the world’s second-biggest economy, will remain an important export market for our goods and services.Even the Trump administration in the US does not want to close off a lucrative market for American farmers.It needs to abide by global rulesAs Trade Secretary, I tried to build a constructive relationship with my Chinese counterparts to help our businesses sell more to them and support jobs here.ButChina wants to be a partner in the global trading system, it needs to abide by global rules.This will be a major challenge as we face the inevitable task of reforming the World Trade Organization. When it comes to our national security, as The Sun on Sunday so clearly set out in recent weeks, we cannot afford to have it linked to other economic or political considerations.That is why I, along with a number of fellow MPs, voted against the Government’s plans to include Chinese tech firm Huawei in our G data network.China is at a crossroads and needs to decide whether it truly wants to become a partner in the global community or take the path to becoming a pariah state.That choice is in their hands.

He has been proved right.“The problem with epidemiologists is that they feel their job is to frighten people into lockdown,” says Levitt. “I think lockdown saved no lives.”Indeed, this outbreak of ­coronavirus does not even rate officially as an epidemic.Just as many died in  from severe winter flu.

Public sector workers reckon they are better off furloughed. Plenty in the private sector do too.Many parents, despite official scientic advice saying it is safe, say they will refuse totheir kids to school even though the PM has announced the first welcome reopenings on June  .Most people think the economy will right itself in a year or two and few seem bothered.They are more fixated on the furore over whether Dominic Cummings bent the lockdown rules to look after his child than with the looming catastrophe unless they are soon lted.This suicidal delusion is the result of a highly effective Government campaign about the Covid- threat, combined with generous bailouts, a promise of no new austerity and some great weather.Millions, including many Sun readers, have worked through the crisis. Millions more are itching to go back.Too many others, though, have been lulled into a disastrous  sense of security.We face an unprecedented recession. The economy has imploded.The Government had to borrow £billion in April, not far off half what Labour borrowed in a YEAR during the global financial crisis, leading to a decade of austerity.The initial trickle of job losses is already a flood and will soon be a tsunami.It falls to the PM or Rishi Sunak to explain to the nation in the starkest terms that unless we swtlyto near-normality, with public opinion onside, millions may never have a job toto. That this colossal new debt will take a generation to pay off.When the bailouts end and hardship bites, those who backed endless lockdown will not rue their own complacency. They will blame the Tories who failed to warn them how bad it would get.The Government also needs far more urgency over reopening shops, restaurants, pubs and travel — with social distancing — and a more realistic assessment of the tiny Covid risk to most people.The daily death toll, as heartbreaking as it still is, is falling fast. So are infections. The “R” rate, a virtually meaningless average distorted by care homes and hospitals, will be at or near zero in many places. One in  has the virus.Politicians and scientists are of course terried of causing new deaths. But over-caution could do so too, by impoverishing millions.

They want Dom’s head on a skewer.In the last  weeks, nothing exemplies The Blob better than its handling of Coronavirus, the non-epidemic which has been allowed to drag this country into destitution.A public inquiry will examine precisely how this country stumbled unprepared into a predictable - and predicted - health emergency.The blame game is already under way.But it is already clear the NHS bureaucracy was caught flat-footed.Along with its blundering sidekick, Public Health England, it failed to provide frontline health staff - and likely Covid victims with the protection they deserved.Under pressure, the NHS panicked and made the decision to clear all beds for incoming coronavirus victims - while disastrously shunting elderly infected patients into care homes.PHE, the vast qango whose mission goal is to protect the nation from pandemics, failed abysmally to provide the testing needed as a first line of defence.Neither of these two bodies thought fit to build the necessary stockpile of Personal Protection Equipment, leaving frontline medical staff exposed to the virus.Meanwhile, along came Bonking Boffin Neil Ferguson who created Lockdown panic with fantasy claims of half a million likely dead - a figure no other scientist has supported.Indeed, highly qualied professionals including a Nobel prize-winning Stanford Professor of Chemistry, Michael Levitt, insist NO lives were saved by lockdown.Sunetra Gupta, Oxford Professor of Theoretical Epidemiology, says the UK death rate from Coronavirus is -in-a-, with Lockdown an unnecessary “luxury”.“I think there’s a chance we might have done better by doing nothing at all,” she says.Prof Gupta echoes a growing view that Britain couldto normal tomorrow, opening pubs, nightclubs and festivals, without putting lives needlessly at risk.“It is very dangerous to talk about lockdown without recognising the enormous costs that it has on other vulnerable sectors in the population.“The truth is that lockdown is a luxury, and it’s a luxury that the middle classes are enjoying and higher income countries are enjoying at the expense of the poor, the vulnerable and less developed countries.“It’s a very serious crisis.”Prof Gupta is describing those Sun readers who will bear the brunt of the looming economic crash.It is fair to say that but for “experts” like Ferguson - who has a long and costly history of disastrous predictions - Lockdown would have been lted sooner and with less economic pain.It is also true that while most people - including me - stuck rigidly to Downing Street rules, countless thousands have broken them by leaving home and visiting relatives.Yes, Cummings and his we - both hit by Coronavirus - broke the letter of the Lockdown law by driving their -year-old son  miles north to self-isolation in Durham.In the same circumstances I would have done the same and so, I suspect, would many readers whatever their political views.Some will rightly insist our leaders should do as they preach.Others will be appalled by the curtain twitching informers who raced to spill the beans.To his credit - and now his cost - Dominic Cummings has never worried about upsetting his critics.He has given his many enemies, some inside the Tory Party, the perfect stick to beat him with.We should be careful before joining in this vendetta against a man who in his own unique way has spoken so effectively for the British people.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m not.Eventhe enforcement is far from being perfect, it will still have a tremendous effect.According to the British Pub Association, four out of ten pubs are likely to cease to exist at the end of the crisis.Unlike many restaurants that can stay afloat selling takeaway food, pubs cannot generate income in lockdown.Anyone who says that short-term rationing of alcohol in pubs is not a price worth paying to get them to open up fast must have had one pint too many.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We want the government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. The think tank said Universal Credit had managed the first hurdle of the coronavirus crisis - but the Government needed to bolster the system to ensure it could look after Brits as the UK looks set to plunge into the worst recession in  years, with record unemployment.Senior economist at The Resolution Foundation Karl Handscomb said: Universal Credit has been on the frontline in fighting the UKs economic shock.More claims have been processed in the four weeks of the coronavirus crisis than in the first nine months of the financial crisis.The benefits system has proved remarkably resilient in the face of such demand, with three quarters of claimants satisfied with the process.

Secretary said this evening that signicant progress has been made on securing enough vital equipment to help keep Brits protected on the front line in hospitals and care homes.Boris Johnson has said five tests must be met in order to move into the next stage - including making sure there is enough PPE.Stockpiles of protective equipment are back-up to safe levels – with a week’s worth of kit now in warehouses.The Health Secretary claims three months of stock has now been ordered to help protect frontline NHS and social care staff.Mr Hancock says UK production has also been ramped up, with  billion pieces of kit set to be made in Britain.Nearly . billion items of PPE have so far been delivered to the frontline during the Covid crisis.We are not simply keeping up with demand, we are now able to replenish our stockpiles, he said tonight.We have made signicant progress.He admitted that there were some issues with stockpiled goods of PPE did not fit requirements and the Government has done the very best we can to tackle that.At the very start of the pandemic ministers struggled to get enough PPE to people on the frontline in NHS settings.A global scramble for PPE meant Britain was fighting with countries around the world for access to enough protective equipment.Some pieces of PPE can only be used once.And gloves, masks and other equipment had to be flown in from overseas to get enough to keep running.Some even failed UK safety tests and were unable to be used.He has already confirmed that three out of five tests have now been met.This is an area that has already largely been met around the country, as hospitals begin to feel an ease of strain.Field hospitals were set up to help them deal with this pressure, like the Nightingale Hospital at the London ExCel Arena, but these have mostly now all been stood down.The UKs daily death toll hit its peak on April  when nearly , people died in and out of hospital due to coronavirus.But today just  people were reported to have died, a steady decline over the past few weeks.Ministers and health experts have used the national briefing to say that the numbers of deaths and cases is continuing to fall.As long as that continues to be the case, tweaks can be made to lting the lockdown from June .This is one of the most pressing concerns at the moment with hospitals still looking to get their hands on Personal Protective Equipment .NHS staff around the country have been pushing for the government to bring in more PPE, with some even needing to hold their breath and wear bin bags in their attempts to prevent from catching the virus.But Mr Hancock now says that stockpiles are starting to be built up again, and enough equipment is in the bag to meet future demand.The final test is that the government and medical professionals must be certain that there will not be a risk of a second wave of infection, similar to that in Germany.Professor Van-Tam said on May : We have to be confident that the adjustments we contemplate are not going to risk a second peak of infections and this is really a matter of deep scientic discussion.Its one we are keeping under detailed scientic review as the days and weeks go by.Terried NHS staff had told how they had to wear scuba masks, bin bags, kitchen aprons and even holding their breath to treat patients thanks to the utter shambles of the PPE crisis.Nurses and doctors also use swim and ski goggles, out-of-date masks and put clinical waste bags on their heads and feet as they risk their lives to help virus victims.Nearly half of doctors have had to find their own protective equipment or rely on donations, says a survey by the British Medical Association.One health worker said the PPE shortage was an utter shambles from start to finish.But over time production has been ramped up and hospitals are now starting to build up stocks again. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads

Dr Jean says you should also try and dry your washing outside rather than using racks and heated dryers in the home.If you hair is long pollen can be trapped on it and in turn the pollen can then end up on your pillow. While its not advisable to wash your hair every day, you should at least rinse it with water to get the pollen spores out.During high pollen seasons its advisable to wash your pillowcases twice a week.To try and combat the effects of hay fever, you can try a number of things:In times of high pollen, do not cut grass or walk in grassy areas, do not keep fresh flowers in your home, smoke or dry clothes outside as they can catch pollen.Its important to keep your home clean at all times, but Dr Jean says you should clean regularly, by wet dusting and vacuuming, ideally using a special HEPA filter.You should avoid using feather dusters, as ultimately, they just lt dust particles into the air which then circulate before settling again on your surfaces.By using a damp cloth the pollen can be collected and then disposed of completely.If you are using a hoover around the house and need to empty the contents of the hoover bag, you could wear a dust mask or face covering to prevent any of the particles getting into your airways.It may also be advisable to de-clutter the spaces you spend most time in. Ornaments, cushions and throws can be stored away as they collect both dust and pollen, when these are moved around then can release the pollen into the air.We love our pets, but they can wreak havoc with your allergies.During pollen season its important to make sure they are as clean as you are, and this includes keeping on top of cleaning any bedding or furniture they may sleep on.Dr Jean says: Wipe pets with a damp cloth or grooming brush after their walks to remove pollen from fur.If your pets have long fur it is likely that it will collect pollen when they go outside.You should also try and keep your pets out of the bedroom in order to minimise the spread of pollen and to make sure you get a good sleep.Theres an app for everything these days which makes it even easier for you to keep up to date with the pollen count in your local area.This week the pollen count is ied across the country.Northern parts are set for low pollen counts the midlands will have a mild amount, while the south, including London, is set for high pollen counts this week.Dr Jean says: Monitor pollen forecasts daily and keep a trigger diary during the hayfever season. Avoid going outside in the garden or for a walk outside when the pollen count is high to limit your exposure.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m good at what I do.”Do  DO  I wasn’t aware, until this series started, that Joey DID anything, but it turns out he’s spent half a letime ­prepping for SAS: Who Dares Wins.For as well as being surprisingly likeable, the guy’s also insanely fit — to an extent that clearly tormented professional athlete Lauren Steadman and suggested Joey could’ve had an amazing military careerhe wasn’t, in the words of one SAS interrogator, “poncing about on TV telling everyone what he f***ing had for breakfast”.Apart from “the naughtiest blisters ever”, Joey had breezed through every section of the C show, until the finale when “escape and evasion” gave way to the interrogation phase that’s designed to “prepare the recruits for enemy capture”.Who the hell was going to want to capture Joey Essex, outside of the Celebrity First Dates booking office, wasn’t explained, and it doesn’t even do to ask such questions of SAS: WDW as the whole thing will unravelyou start pulling at those threads.It’s always best just to enjoy the entertainment, which involved giving Joey and the other five finalists the cover story that they were working for the Scottish Highland Mountain Rescue Board.The trouble with giving Joey a cover story, it emerged, was that it dislodged every other piece of information he’d ever learned from his brain.Key to surviving this task, as they’d all been instructed, was to drip-feed the truth back to “Dilksy”, the monstrous great slaphead who always appears at this point, and his fellow interrogators.Whether they locked him in a cage, dunked him in water or threatened to kiss him, though, Joey just kept denying everything and repeating the story.With the clock ticking, something had to give and eventually it did, after the entire SAS: WDW team had concluded, more in sorrow than anything : “He’s not even playing the village idiot, he’s trying hard not to be.”The end, when it finally came, was a bit of an anti-climax.Joey just sloped off, in a bit of a huff.Helen Skelton and Nikki Sanderson quickly followed and the winners were declared to be DJ Locksmith and Lauren Steadman.A worthy choice, even though some of us were still probably trying to work out how she made it through the drown-proofing task“no allowances are made”.If you take this show too seriously, though, you’ll miss the joy and point of SAS: WDW.It’s not offering contestants a fast-track into the SAS any more than Harry’s Heroes will form the spine of the next England squad.The reasons the show deserves to be put on a pedestal are its extraordinary entertainment value and the fact it’s proved, to my complete satisfaction, that Joey Essex isn’t putting anything on.

Another project to receive funding is Leicester’s Emerald Centre, which supports vulnerable people of all ages, including elderly residents and those with disabilities, in a deprived area of the city.  Chris Murphy , , who lives alone, says the charity has kept him in touch with friends during this dficult time. He explained: The centre has been bringing me a food parcel every week. They stop for a chat when it’s delivered and phone to check I’m okay. I love working in my garden so they’ve sent me bits for that, and there’s also been activity packs and books I’ve borrowed from them. It’s all keeping me busy! It’s great that people are playing The National Lottery and helping us. Merthyr Tydfil’s Twyn Community Hubhas also received support, with a £, grant from The National Lottery to expand their daily hot meals and weekly hamper project during lockdown. The charity helps families and vulnerable, older people, with everything from weekly food parcels to organising bingo nights and quizzes.  Jean Jonesis someone who benefits regularly from their work. The -year-old said: I’ve been going to events including bingo at Twyn Community Hub since moving here nearly six years ago, and throughout lockdown staff and volunteers have been popping round most days to deliver food, and have a chat. I’m lucky in that I phone friends and family, but other older people in the area would see no one otherwise. The meals and food they provide are fabulous. Being able to take away the worry about small, practical, everyday things is so important. Thanks to people playing The National Lottery that is happening right here in our local area. Itaposs thanks to National Lottery players, as well as the people who run these vital services, that these sorts of charities and local projects have been able to continue offering support to the most vulnerable people in our communities.

So thanks to Downing Street for taking me back to my childhood and putting on Carry On Bullsh*tting. That sketch about testing your eyes for a long drive by going for a longish one with your four-year-old in the car was cracking. But the longer this excruciating exhibition of detachedness from reality went on, the less funny it was. The interview was a Prince Andrew-style car crash. And the sight of Cummings sucking in all the political oxygen due to breaking lockdown rules we had all been sticking to, on a day when we were waiting to hear from the Prime Minister when we could start to dismantle them, was a national disgrace. His contempt for the Little People was evident from the off when he turned up more than half an hour late. It continued when he kept answering questions by saying “with great respect” when his face was sneering at the reporter he was supposedly respecting. The haughty disdain continued when he read out what sounded like an Enid Blyton story called Three Go For A Pee In The Woods. It read like a litany of excuses we’ve all heard given in school as teachers howled in disbelief.  Any moment I expected him to say he only drove to Durham because the cat peed on his satnav. It was a tale in which he admitted multiple breaches of rules he helped draw up but he could not possibly apologise because it was all the media’s fault. Throughout, I was recalling the many times Tony Blair’s senior adviser, Alastair Campbell, and Gordon Brown’s, Charlie Whelan, had said to me that once you become the story you have to go.

Mr Hancock said the ability to tighten restrictions in inidual regions will be part of the NHS test, track and trace system - which is set to begin by Monday next week, with further details to come later today. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, click here The Sun reports the scheme - which has seen the recruitment of , tracers - has been rushed forward by Boris Johnson to align with some children ing to school next week. Mr Hancock told the daily press briefing at  Downing Street that local lockdowns is now the governmentaposs preferred option to deal with spikes in new infections. He said authorities would be keeping a close eye on infection rates across the country - with huge iation across the UK. He said: We will have local lockdowns in future where there are flare-ups and we have a system we are putting in place with a combination of Public Health England and the new Joint Biosecurity Centre, along with the local directors of public health who play an absolutely crucial role in the decision-making in the system, to make surethere is a local flare-up there is a local lockdown. And so local lockdowns will be part of the future system that we put in place as part of the NHS test-and-trace system.  The Governmentaposs plan for easing lockdown restrictions set out how the Joint Biosecurity Centre would have a responsethat could address local spikes in infections, in partnership with local public health agencies.Earlier this month, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said it was the Governmentaposs strong preference that lockdown measures are lted at the same time across the country. However, he said some restrictions could be reimposed at a local levelrequired. Our strong preference is that the whole country moves as one, he said.  But , as we build up our infrastructure for testing and tracking and tracing, in time it is required for us to make interventions in smaller micro-communities where you are seeing the virus take hold again, then that will be something that we consider as other countries around the world have done when they have implemented effective track and trace systems. But that is quite dferent from making major changes to lockdown measures in one part of the country versus another. The latest figures on confirmed cases show they are relatively high in the North East, with  confirmed cases per , population in Sunderland,  per , in Gateshead and  per , in South Tyneside.

One of fury, contempt, and anguish. She added: “He made those who struggled to keep to the rules feel like fools, and has allowed many more to feel like they can flout them.” The Prime Minister knows all this, and despite the resignation of one minister, growing unease from his backbenchers, a dramatic early warning from the polls, and a deep national disquiet, Boris Johnson has chosen to ignore it. The government told the BBC no government minister was available to appear on last nightaposs programme. This morning, Housing Minister Robert Jenrick said the public should move on. Now I think is the time for us all to move on, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick told the BBC. Thataposs not to say this isnapost an important issue or that people donapost care a great deal about it but I think there is a lot more that we need to focus on now, like the virus and the economy.  The Prime Minister will be quizzed at a Commons committee meeting on the decision of Mr Cummings to drive from London to Durham during the shutdown. It comes amid a growing revolt in Mr Johnsonaposs party, with at least  Tory MPs having now publicly called for Mr Cummings to be sacked or to resign.

I wouldnapost have known what the family looked like. I found out he had a son the sort of age the child seemed to be. So I thought, that must be him. He added: And I remembered the numberplate, because it was easy to remember, and just wrote it down. I looked it up and found out it wasnapost from County Durham, I thought somebody might have bought it second hand.  When the news broke, Mr Lees said, he thought Well, goodness me, that must be the person I saw, then. And then there were these stories in the press saying that heaposd been there, and other people denying it and saying he was just stuck in his house all the time. So I just looked up online to see the history and saw that those days fitted with the time he was supposed to be in County Durham. He contacted thenewspaper to confirm the numberplate he had written down matched Mr Cummingsapos numberplate - which it did. He added: I didnapost do very much , and loads of people sort of appeared at my door and I just told them the same story, thataposs all.

The Cabinet Office Minister insisted he, like Boris Johnsonaposs aide Dominic Cummings, had got behind the wheel to seehis eyes were good enough for a long journey. Mr Cummings prompted incredulity when he tried to explain a -mile round trip to a beauty spot by saying he wanted to test his eyesight before a -mile journey from Durham to London. But Mr Gove, who as Education Secretary from  was Mr Cummingsapos boss, suggested he too had taken the unusual step of testing his eyesight through driving. Asked on LBChe would have gone on a -mile round trip to test your eyesight , Mr Gove replied: I have, on occasions in the past, driven with my we in order to make sure, whataposs the right way of putting it …   Mr Gove later admitted the point he was seeking to make was that he was not an authority on driving as someone who took seven attempts to pass their driving test”. He added: “Iaposm not going to pass judgement on other peopleaposs driving. Meanwhile, a former top officer said Mr Cummings would have been turned back by policehe had been caught on his -mile journey from London to Durham. Ex-Greater Manchester Police chief constable Sir Peter Fahy said Boris Johnsonaposs chief aide would have been sent back to the capitalan officer had stopped him on his drive north. He told the BBC: I think at that point in terms of what was the understanding of the regulations and the Government messaging I think it may well be that absolutely heaposd have been turned back, as many other people were turned back from things that they were doing. Critics of Mr Cummings have warned his actions have undermined government attempts to get people to stick by the rules. Sir Peter feared it was dficult to see the policeaposs role in controlling lockdown – particularly as pictures showed thousands of lockdown-weary families hitting beaches and beauty spots as the sun blazed over the bank holiday weekend. Thereaposs a lot of confusion and it feels like thereaposs quite a gap between the public narrative and narrative of ministers about the lockdown and whataposs happening on the street,” he warned.

During a tour of broadcast studios this morning, Tory Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick repeatedly used the phrase, suggesting there were more important things to worry about. He said: I think there’s a lot more we need to focus on” Mr Jenrick himself faced calls to resign after being caught travelling  miles from his London property to his mansion in Herefordshire. He then travelled yet further to his parentsapos house in Shropshire, where he says he was delivering food and essential medical supplies to his parents. It comes amid a growing revolt in Boris Johnsonaposs party, with at least  Tory MPs having now publicly called for Mr Cummings to be sacked or to resign.And a YouGov survey for The Times showed the Conservative lead over Labour dropped by nine points during the Cummings saga, as support for the Government fell four points to % with Labour rising five points in the week to Tuesday, to %.  Senior ministers have expressed public support for the defiant adviser but there are reports a number of Cabinet members have privately called for him to be ousted from No . But Mr Jenrick told the Radio  Today Programme: We can continue to discuss the finer details of Dominic Cummingsapos blog for as long as you want, but I think the public, now. This is not diminishing the public interest in Mr Cummings - but I think the public now would prefer us to be talking about the track and trace system that weaposre introducing next week, the PPE, the other challenges that weaposre facing as a country - or indeed my responsibilities as housing secretary. Mr Jenrick said there will not be a review of UK lockdown fines for childcare-related travel, as promised by Health Secretary Matt Hancock last night. He said: No, there isnapost going to be a formal review. Itaposs for the police to decide whether to impose fines under the law. They have the guidance that weaposve provided and the national police chiefs have provided their own guidance, which does give officers a degree of discretion to use their common sense, reflecting the fact that all of our circumstances are dferent and families, in particular, face particular challenges. They are encouraging their officers to engage in the first instance, to explain and to resort to fines only where absolutely necessary and in most cases that is whataposs happened. Mr Jenrick added: Dominic Cummings didnapost break the guidelines, the police havenapost chosen, as far as Iaposm aware, to impose a fine upon him, and so I think we have to leave it there. He said the explanation given by Mr Cummings over his reasons for travelling to Durham was reasonable. Askedhe could understand the anger of the public over the issue, Mr Jenrick said: I can and many people would disagree with the decisions that Dominic Cummings made, both members of the public and members of Parliament.  But, he added: He set out why he made those decisions and his motivations, which were to protect his unwell we and his young child, and to self-isolate at a household somewhere where he believed he could get the childcare and support that they needed. I think that thataposs a reasonable explanation and itaposs a legal one, it doesnapost look asany of the guidelines or the rules have been broken.

The Chancellor is expected to announce the ban will come into the place from the end of July, The Financial Times reports. According to the most recent figures,  million people had been furloughed since the start of the coronavirus crisis.Itaposs believed Mr Sunak will also give details of the job retention scheme where businesses will have to pay at least a fth of the wages of furloughed employees from August, despite the Government extending the scheme to October.The latest changes to the scheme are expected to include firms covering % to % of workersapos wages as the furlough scheme is wound down.  Under new terms being drafted up, employers will be allowed to take furloughed workers back part-time, and all firms using the  coronavirus  job retention scheme will be required to make the payments, eventhey remain closed, The Times reported earlier this week.A Treasury source said: We’ve got two full months of support left and afterwards the government will help to pay people’s wages, but it’s fair to everyone that businesses contribute as they get back to work. Sunak has already said the furlough scheme will be in place until at least October but asking firms to foot a higher bill could in effect force many employers consider job cuts. The Treasury will reportedly direct employers to cover between % and % of an employee’s wage, plus national insurance, at % on top. The furlough scheme pays % of a worker’s salary up to £, a month, and is supporting about a third of the private-sector workforce. The Office for Budget Responsibility has already warned the scheme could cost up to £billion. All high street businesses were ordered to close on March  after the UK went into lockdown following a surge in coronavirus cases. Employees across the UK were told to work from home where possible, leading employers who were facing signicant losses to apply for help via the Governmentaposs furlough scheme. As part of efforts to wind it down, those who are unable to work from home are now being advised toto work - though without using public transport where possible. This will be followed by schools, car showrooms and open markets reopening on June  and non-essential businesses, like retail outlets, will open their doors from June  as lockdown measures are further eased.

At least  Tory MPs have called for Mr Cummings to quit - including one minister who has resigned. As many as six cabinet ministers are thought to have privately told colleagues Mr Cummings should go.

The PMaposs top aide is under pressure to resign after the Mirror revealed he, his we and child had travelled  miles from his London home - while his we had coronavirus symptoms - to stay in a house owned by his parents in Durham. The government claimed Mr Cummings and his family isolated for  days while relatives brought him supplies. But he admitted he had left that house to go on a trip to Barnard Castle  miles away around the end of his -day isolation. At the time, Brits were advised not to drive long distances and to only take a walk, bike ride or cycleleaving the house for exercise. Boris Johnson defended Mr Cummingsapos breach of the advice to stay at home and not travel, especiallysuffering from the virus.

Here are all the Tory MPs who are calling for Dominic Cummings to resign so far - and the ministers who have yet to back him in public. What are your thoughts on the controversy  Email webnews@mirror Cabinet ministers who have publicly backed Dominic CummingsBoris Johnson - Prime Minister Rishi Sunak - Chancellor Dominic Raab - Foreign Secretary Priti Patel - Home Secretary Michael Gove - Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Matt Hancock - Health Secretary Alok Sharma - Business Secretary Brandon Lewis - Northern Ireland Secretary Oliver Dowden - Culture Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan - International Development Secretary Amanda Milling - Minister without PortfolioAlso attends cabinet:Steve Barclay - Chief Secretary to the Treasury Jacob Rees Mogg - Leader of the House of Commons Mark Spencer - Chief Whip Suella Braverman - Attorney GeneralCabinet Ministers who do not appear to have publicly backed Dominic CummingsRobert Buckland - Justice Secretary Ben Wallace - Defence Secretary Liz Truss - Trade Secretary Therese Coffey - Work and Pensions Secretary George Eustice - Environment Secretary Alister Jack - Scotland Secretary Simon Hart - Wales Secretary Barones Evans of Bowes Park - Leader of the House of LordsMPs who have called for Dominic Cummings to resign Peter Aldous At a time when the Country must move on to the next stage of defeating Covid-, of getting back to work whilst ensuring that there is not a second peak, there must be no distraction from this challenge. The Government should recognise what families have gone through and what people are thinking and saying. It is thus important that Dominic Cummings should now stand down. Steve Baker Enough is enough. I and others saved him once before when he was driving Vote Leave to implosion. Not today. Dominic Cummings must go before he does any more harm to the UK, the Government, the Prime Minister, our institutions or the Conservative Party. Time is up. It is time for Dom to resign so Boris can govern within the conventions and norms which will see us through. It is time to get competing expert advice, decent software and better decisions, end the lockdown and start a long, hard recovery.  Harriet Baldwin     Former minister Harriett Baldwin said: While I have every human sympathy with Dominic Cummings, I think there is a higher bar for members of the Government. If the Government wants people to follow the public health advice in order to protect our NHS and save lives, then members of the Government giving that advice, including the Prime Ministeraposs adviser, need to follow it too. The Government relies on moral authority to receive the consent of the people to such draconian reductions in their freedoms. Therefore, for the sake of future adherence to public health guidelines, I believe he should resign. Peter Bone The Tory Brexiteer said Mr Cummings has to go because he broke the rules and has not apologised. Speaking on Nigel Farageaposs show on LBC, he said: When an adviser becomes the story, the adviser has to go. Boris Johnson can carry on without Dominic Cummingshe goes but it will be hardhe stays. Elliot Colburn The Conservative MP for Carshalton and Wallington, said he had written to the Prime Minister calling for Dominic Cummings to resign. In his letter to Boris Johnson, Mr Colburn wrote: I have received more emails on this than on any other issue since being elected - many hundreds of messages from concerned constituents - and I join them in that view. I feel it necessary to stress the importance of continued public trust and engagement with the measures being taken to overcome this crisis.At this critical time, as we start to relax some of the measures we have asked people to live with for many weeks now, we must ensure the public feel willing and able to continue social distancing and engage positively with those that continue to be in place to avoid a second spike. I fear this could undermine that effort. Damian Collins Dominic Cummings has a track record of believing that the rules don’t apply to him and treating the scrutiny that should come to anyone in a position of authority with contempt. The government would be better without him.  Philip Davies It is admirable of the Prime Minister to be loyal to his staff and to seek to defend and support those who work for him. Dominic Cummings should now repay that loyalty to the Prime Minister by resigning his position for the good of the Prime Minister, the government and the country. Jackie Doyle-Price     The Tory MP for Thurrock posted on her Facebook page. She said: I have received a number of representation regarding the behaviour of Dominic Cummings and thought I should state my position. The Government has been very clear in its message that we have had to Stay Home and Save lives. For some of us that instruction has come at great personal cost. Some people have lost their livelihoods. Some people have lost loved ones and been unable to say goodbye. In making real sacrices in order to obey the Government’ instructions it is quite understandable that there is anger that Government figures have not done the same. When a Government is tainted with a ‘do as I say, not as I do’ attitude to the public, it loses its moral authority. Sir Roger Gale While as a father and as a grandfather I fully appreciate Mr Cummings’ desire to protect his child. There cannot be one law for the Prime Minister’s staff and another for everyone . He has sent out completely the wrong message and his position is no longer tenable. Mark Garnier It is clear to me that despite his story, despite an element of politics in this, and despite his value to the government, his remaining in Number  now causes too many problems at multiple levels. For him to stay would be to reject the valiant efforts of millions of us all who have done what we can to squash this infection. His resignation is now the only way forward. ... The guidancesick is to stay at home – not any home, or someone ’s home, or even a second home. You must stay at you own home. He admitted to, firstly, going to Downing Street when he should have been self-isolating. He then, literally, packed his car with coronavirus and drove it to an area where there was relatively little infection. When he had recovered, he embarked on a bizarre road test of his ability to drive. This is in clear breach of the Highway Code rule and rule  . Aside from that, it was just plain dumb. James Gray Unless and until he can justy what he did, he should face the consequences of it and give up his role as a government adviser. Having him continuing at the heart of government undermines our credibility and the strength of our message.” Robert Goodwill Iaposve been contacted by over  constituents who, with one or two exceptions, have been critical of Mr Cummings and his statement yesterday has done nothing to convince them otherwise.I think that the best way for the Prime Minister, who Iaposm a massive fan of, to show heaposs in charge of the situation is to relieve himself of Mr Cummingsapos services. Stephen Hammond An e-mail he apparently wrote to a constituent states: It is clear that Mr Cummings has broken the guidelines which we all were instructed to follow. I find his explanation unconvincing. I am angry that so many have sacriced so much for public safety and yet this man has decided his interpretation of doing the right thing overrode the clear instruction of Stay at Home. His selfish act has undermined our, and my, efforts to keep Wimbledon safe. Mr Cummings should of course have resigned as any honourable person would have done and not put everyone  in this wholly invidious position. I cannot defend the indefensible and I have no intention of doing so. I have always tried to do the best thing for Wimbledon and it is now served by Mr Cummings leaving his role. Mark Harper In these circumstances, as an absolute minimum, an apology should have been made and level of regret expressed. I am disappointed Mr Cummings did neither. ... I would expect an adviser who had damaged the credibility of the Governmentaposs central message so badly and had become the story to consider their position. Mr Cummings should have offered to resign, and the Prime Minister should have accepted his resignation. Simon Hoare With the damage Mr Cummings is doing to the Government’s reputation he must consider his position. Lockdown has had its challenges for everyone. It’s his cavalier “I don’t care I’m cleverer than you” tone that infuriates people. He is now wounding the PM Govt  I don’t like that Andrew Jones The Harrogate Advertiser reported he wrote to constituents saying: “It seems clear to me that Mr Cummings has broken the guidelines which we were and are all expected to follow. For that reason I think that he should resign andhe does not do so then he should be dismissed.” Simon Jupp Although I believe his actions were motivated by a father’s desire to do what he felt was necessary to protect his family in exceptional circumstances,placed in the same situation I wouldn’t have made the same decisions and would have since considered my position. Tim Loughton Told the BBC the defence of Mr Cummings is deeply damaging and is seriously compromising the governmentaposs public health advice. Saying heaposs been swamped by e-mails he condemned Boris Johnson, telling the BBC: What I wanted to hear was a proper justication of why what Dominic Cummings did was fine. “I fear I didn’t get that and what’s more worrying is my constituents didn’t get that.” Paul Maynard He said he shared peopleaposs dismay at the response, adding: It is a classic case of aposdo as I say, not as I doapos - and it is not ashe was unfamiliar with guidance he himself helped draw up. It seems to me to be utterly indefensible and his position wholly untenable. Jason McCartney He said while it was important for people to show compassion during the crisis, Mr Cummings had to go because the perceived hypocrisy of the rule makers potentially threatens the success of any future measures under a second wave of the coronavirus. We must have confidence that we are doing the right things for the right reasons and that we are all truly in it together. For that reason I believe Mr Cummingsapos position is now untenable, Mr McCartney said in a Facebook post. Stephen Metcalfe Sir Bob Neill I am in the process of responding to everyone who has emailed me concerning Dominic Cummings. I have also posted a statement on my website setting out my views on why he should now step down from his post, a message I have passed on to colleagues in Govt. Caroline Nokes I made my views clear to my whip yesterday. There cannot be one rule for most of us and wriggle room for others. My inbox is rammed with very angry constituents and I do not blame them. They have made dficult sacrices over the course of the last  weeks. Mark Pawsey On the basis of what I heard, it is clear that while he believed he was acting within the letter of the law, he did the wrong thing and acted very much against the spirit of the lockdown rules. ... As such, I believe that it is wrong that Mr Cummings remains in an important post in Government. I had hoped he that would tender his resignation of his own accord. As he has failed to do so, I now believe it is right for the Prime Minister to ask for his resignation. This is a position that I have communicated to my colleagues within the Conservative Party and the Government. His letter to constituents Andrew Percy Laurence Robertson Indeed, like many others, I have found the rules to be personally heart-wrenching. On th May, my father died of Coronavirus and the pain and guilt of my being unable to visit him as he fought for his le will haunt me for the rest of my days. I wouldnapost wish this situation on anyone, but I know that many of my constituents have suffered in the same or similar ways. However we are fighting against a world-wide pandemic and really do need to be all in this together. I have, therefore, spent yesterday and today urging the Prime Minister and all those closely connected to him, to recognise the strength of feeling which exists on this issue and to dismiss Mr Cummings without further delay. For now, I will not be playing this matter out in public, but am working on the issue through the effective channels which exist. Douglas Ross I have constituents who didnapost get to say goodbye to loved ones, families who could not mourn together, people who didnapost visit sick relatives because they followed the guidance of the government. I cannot in good faith tell them they were all wrong and one senior advisor to the government was right. Alec Shelbrooke John Stevenson Carlisle and the country have sacriced a lot over the last few weeks. People in positions of power have added responsibility-Mr Cummings holds such a position. Therefore in my view in the interests of the country Mr Cummings should resign. Bob Stewart On the face of it Mr Cummings seems to have been out of line to break lockdown instructions. Personally, I felt rather ashamed as the rest of us are all bidden to obey the rules and those directives appear to have been broken by him. Clearly there is some dispute... The truth is that, whether Mr Cummings broke or didnapost do the right thing, he certainly destroyed the spirit of the rules by what he did. It will make it very dficult for us, the rest of the population, to accept the largely voluntary restraints we have lived under for  weeks. I apologise for that because those rules remain in place and we should all still abide by them. I am afraid I believe his position is thus untenable. Julian Sturdy I donapost think this can go on much longer. It is damaging the Governmentaposs reputation. You canapost have one rule for Government advisers and one for everyone . His future does seem to look more and more untenable moving forward. The Prime Minister needs to clary Mr Cummingsapos position in a statement as soon as possible. Robert Syms The Poole MP tweeted: The Government has to explain test, track and trace and the next phase of lting lockdown next week. Whatever the merits of a Government adviser, they should never be the story or it detracts from the central message which is to get us out of this crisis. The adviser should go. Martin Vickers David Warburton Tory MP David Warburton said his own father died alone as a result of the coronavirus lockdown, and the Dominic Cummings story gives an impression of “double standards”. He told BBC Breakfast: “People have made sacrices... Instinct hasn’t really been part of it. He added: “Ideally,he broke the rules then he obviously should be subject to the same kind of consequences as anybody  who broke the rules... To me, enough is really enough, I think he’s damaging the Government and the country that he’s supposed to be serving.” Craig Whittaker I totally agree that Dominic Cummings position is untenable. Iaposm sure he took the decision in the best interests of his family but like every decision we take we also have to take responsibility for those decisions. You cannot advise the nation one thing then do the opposite. William Wragg We cannot throw away valuable public  political good will any longer. It’s humiliating  degrading to their office to see ministers put out agreed lines in defence of an advisor. This is a time of national emergency and our focus must be unrelenting. We owe it to the nation. Jeremy Wright Conservative former attorney general Jeremy Wright wrote on his website that it could be argued that Mr Cummings did not technically breach the lockdown laws, although he did call for further explanation. However, in determining what should happen now, technical compliance cannot be the only consideration, he continued. Our continued success in combating the virus may well rely on more of that and Mr Cummingsapos actions and his justication of them will, in my judgment, make it less likely that others will continue to interpret those exceptional circumstances clauses restrictively. This is more important than the position of any inidual in Downing Street and therefore, fairly or unfairly, I have concluded that it would be better for Mr Cummings to leave his position at Downing Street. Other senior figures calling for him to go Scottish Tory leader Jackson Carlaw MPs whoaposve voiced criticism but not explicitly called for him to go yet: Lee Anderson I will not accept trial by media when a persons whole future is at stake.... I suspect there will be a few more twists to this story over the next few days and I reserve judgement until I have all the facts. We cannot have one rule for one and another rule for the rest of us. Cummings should have a chance to come back on this as it is clear that he travelled to another house to live with his family but it is not clearhe came into contact with other members of his family or been out and about as suggested. If its the latter then he should go. Tracey Crouch The ex-minister Tracey Crouch posted on Facebook: “I am not sure I have felt, in my ten years as an MP, so frustrated, cross, confused or impotent as I do now.” She added: “I have had to tell people they can’t go to funerals, say goodbye to the ones they love, see the family newborns that they will grow to love, visit the graves of parents, siblings or worse, children, and visit friends who are dying. “Should Dominic resign or be sacked  This is not for me to say and I don’t recall calling for anyone in any party to go over mistakes.” Ms Crouch continued: “I am pretty peed off though... [it] leaves a bitter taste in my mouth.” George Freeman Demanded a public apology, adding: I fear this Cummings lockdown truancy saga will mark the end of public trust in and respect for the calls for unity in sacrice from Downing Street. Which in turn will undermine virus control. Meaning an extended lockdown  more sacrice  suffering.

The Radfords, who first appeared on Channel  in a documentary called apos kids and countingapos in , have since gone on to attract thousands of fans as they document their growing brood. Mum Sue Radford recently gave birth to her nd child. The family recorded a QA on their YouTube channel today, in which they revealed they are taking part in a new show, but it wonapost be shown on Channel . Sue told their , subscribers: “We’re filming for a series at the moment. Husband Noel added: “It’s a series this time, a three-part. “We started filming but everything that has been filmed has been by us. They sent all the big cameras, the tripod, the Go-Pros, everything and all the interviews have been done via Zoom. “I’ve been doing the filming, Luke’s done a bit of the filming so I think when it does go on the telly you will definitely notice it’s not been done professionally. “We’re not with Channel  anymore.” Watch this space, Sue added. We’re not sure when it will be shown. It might be end of the year, beginning of next year.” Talking about the new series, Noel added: “It’s always very weird getting back into it.  New people in the house and just getting back into it. And we’ve always saidthe kids don’t enjoy it we’ll stop. So far they all enjoy it butthey don’t want to get involved we don’t push them into it so that’s why you don’t really see, even on YouTube, some of the older boys. It’s just not their thing. They’re like ,  and they just keep themselves to themselves They can do what they like.” “They’re more interested in their xBoxes to be quite honest with you, Sue added. The Radfords recently showed off their revamped garden after they worked together to transform it during the  coronavirus  lockdown.They even created a mini water park for their children to play. A clip shows the family working together to renovate their garden - which they completed in just two days. Sue said it took a lot of hard work to complete the renovation.  Even two-year-old Archie was in his element“ and helped dad Noel together with his siblings. In just  hours, they created a water park and play area in their back garden. It includes a swing set, slide, climbing frame as well as a mud kitchen.

The symptoms of #xCMulti-System Inflammatory Syndrome in Children#xDare similar to toxic shock and Kawasaki disease, and include fever, rashes, swollen glands and, in severe cases, heart inflammation. Officially called #xCPediatric Multi-System Inflammatory Syndrome Potentially Associated with COVID-#xD, MIS-C cases have been reported in France, Italy, Spain and Britain and the United States, where more than  cases were found in the state of New York. The syndrome has raised fears that coronavirus could pose a greater risk to children than had been understood. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Preventionsaid on Tuesday it launched an investigation after two suspected cases of MIS-C involving an -year-old boy and a four-year-old girl were reported on Monday. Both had tested negative for Covid-, but further analysis was being undertaken, especially as the boy had been in the Philippines between January and March. The boy has already been released from the hospital, and the girl is expected to be discharged soon, KCDC director Jeong Eun-kyeong said.A red rash is a symptom of Kawasaki disease:Regular hand-washing will be become part of shopping on the high streetRegular and thorough hand-washing will need to become a habitual part of shopping on the high street in order to help stop the spread of Covid-, a scientist has suggested. Bill Keevil, professor of environmental healthcare at the University of Southampton, said superbug bacteria and viruses such as flu and coronaviruses can linger for a long time on certain hard surfaces, meaning cleanliness - for consumer and retailer - is essential.It comes as the Government said most non-essential retailers could reopen from June . Professor Keevil told the BBC Radio  Today programme: #xCTheyall can survive days on a touch surface, that may surprise people. #xCThat#xs why it#xs so important to wash hands and also regularly clean all touch surfaces. #xCIn terms of shops, when you go into a shop you#xre obviously careful about trolley handles, door handles, this kind of stuff, they should certainly be kept regularly clean. #xCThe issue is now coming down to things like clothes, fabrics. Should people touch them  #xCIf people have washed their hands properly, you might argue that there shouldn#xt be a transmission risk onto the fabrics. #xCBut people are now suggestingyou try on a garment and you don#xt want it, that garment should be put into quarantine for several days before it#xs then being put back onto the shelves.#xDA member of staff wears a face mask at a BQ store in Chiswick :% of parents would not have travelled for emergency childcareMore than % of parents did not and would not have travelled for emergency childcare during the lockdown, a survey suggests.

A total of % of respondents said they either did not or would not have travelled for emergency childcare, with % saying that they had found themselves in a situation where one parent was ill and the other suspected they may become ill too, whilst both were caring for a young child and did not travel for emergency back-up.Of those surveyed, % said that in their view Mr Cummings and his family broke the rules of lockdown.

The symptoms of #xCMulti-System Inflammatory Syndrome in Children#xDare similar to toxic shock and Kawasaki disease, and include fever, rashes, swollen glands and, in severe cases, heart inflammation. Officially called #xCPediatric Multi-System Inflammatory Syndrome Potentially Associated with COVID-#xD, MIS-C cases have been reported in France, Italy, Spain and Britain and the United States, where more than  cases were found in the state of New York. The syndrome has raised fears that coronavirus could pose a greater risk to children than had been understood. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Preventionsaid on Tuesday it launched an investigation after two suspected cases of MIS-C involving an -year-old boy and a four-year-old girl were reported on Monday. Both had tested negative for Covid-, but further analysis was being undertaken, especially as the boy had been in the Philippines between January and March. The boy has already been released from the hospital, and the girl is expected to be discharged soon, KCDC director Jeong Eun-kyeong said.A red rash is a symptom of Kawasaki disease:Regular hand-washing will be become part of shopping on the high streetRegular and thorough hand-washing will need to become a habitual part of shopping on the high street in order to help stop the spread of Covid-, a scientist has suggested. Bill Keevil, professor of environmental healthcare at the University of Southampton, said superbug bacteria and viruses such as flu and coronaviruses can linger for a long time on certain hard surfaces, meaning cleanliness - for consumer and retailer - is essential.It comes as the Government said most non-essential retailers could reopen from June . Professor Keevil told the BBC Radio  Today programme: #xCTheyall can survive days on a touch surface, that may surprise people. #xCThat#xs why it#xs so important to wash hands and also regularly clean all touch surfaces. #xCIn terms of shops, when you go into a shop you#xre obviously careful about trolley handles, door handles, this kind of stuff, they should certainly be kept regularly clean. #xCThe issue is now coming down to things like clothes, fabrics. Should people touch them  #xCIf people have washed their hands properly, you might argue that there shouldn#xt be a transmission risk onto the fabrics. #xCBut people are now suggestingyou try on a garment and you don#xt want it, that garment should be put into quarantine for several days before it#xs then being put back onto the shelves.#xDA member of staff wears a face mask at a BQ store in Chiswick :% of parents would not have travelled for emergency childcareMore than % of parents did not and would not have travelled for emergency childcare during the lockdown, a survey suggests.

Burly body-builder Steve Banks, , was in intensive care for a-month-and-a-half after being struck ill with  the killer virus. He was rushed to hospital on March  by paramedics when his breathing deteriorated and within hours was put into an induced coma. The next thing Steve remembers was waking up over seven weeks later in a dferent hospital with nurses and doctors standing around his bed clapping because he had finally opened his eyes.Steve says he feels lucky to be alive after suffering heart, kidney and respiratory failure as well as sepsis as he body began to shut down while battling the disease. Click here for all the latest coronavirus news and updatesThe dad-of-two was given a tracheotomy and was put on a le-support machine in a last ditch attempt to get oxygen into his body at Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford, Essex. He said his condition got so bad his family wrote letters to say goodbye and were told to prepare for his funeral as they did not think he was going to make it. But Steve, who had no underlying health conditions, started to turn a corner and is now recovering at home in East Tilbury, Essex. Steve now cannot walk unaided and has lost so much muscle mass he described himself as being half the man I was before. When he woke up, Steve said he did not recognise himself as he lost nearly four stone in weight.  He said: I donapost remember much after going into hospital as everything just crashed. When I woke up I was in a dferent hospital, I couldnapost speak, and there were lots of nurses around me clapping. It was quite a surreal moment. One minute I was struggling to breath, the next I had an oxygen mask. I went into hospital before the lockdown, only  people had died. When I came out it was over , - the country had changed beyond all recognition, it was such a shock. Itaposs been an interesting ride. Steve said he was a fit and healthy person. I was a very active person, I tried to look after myself. I was an avid gym-goer and I lted a lot of weights. But this absolutely battered me, when I woke up I looked in the mirror and didnapost recognise myself. I was around st and went down to about st lbs when I left hospital. I had suffered heart, kidney and respiratory failure and sepsis as well as pneumonia. I was put on an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [le-support] which drained the blood from my body to clean it out. It was a last chance swoop to help save me. Then to find out how close I came to saying goodbye, it was very shocking, thereaposs still things I donapost know yet. Everyone I speak to says it is a miracle that I am alive. Steve was taken to Basildon Hospital on March , then transferred to Chelmsford two days later. He said: I started to get sick around March , I had a high temperature of . degrees and a bad cough too.It got worse and I was sleeping a lot too. We called an ambulance on March  and they told me to self isolate. On March  my we got very panicky and we called an ambulance and I was taken to Basildon Hospital. My oxygen levels kept dropping. I was then put on a ventilator on March  and donapost remember much as I was out cold. I had been transferred to Broomfield Hospital and had taken a downturn and was given a one per cent chance of survival. As his condition deteriorated, Steve was given a tracheotomy on April  and discharged last week. He said his ordeal was tough on his family. The construction site manager believes he caught the virus in London where he works on busy building sites. He added: My family were destroyed and had written letters to say goodbye as they didnapost think I was going to make it home.  It was so dficult for them all. My we is caring for me and her and my children have not left my side. I came home on May  and itaposs dficult at the moment but I am getting movement back slowly. I cannot walk unaided and have lost so much muscle mass and am half the man I was before. I feel battered and canapost overexert myself and am now dreading going out because of the after effects of all this. Steve started to notice he was feeling ill on March  when he had a high temperature and cough. He said his we, Lisa and their two children were left feeling helpless as they were unable to visit Steve in hospital. Lisa said: I was so scared, I felt destroyed, I was numb with the anxiety and the stress of it all, I was just devastated. I had to have a conversation with our children about how their dad might die. I was left thinking aposhow are our children ever going to get over this and how are we going to deal with this apos. When he first came home I couldnapost look at him, it just didnapost seem real. We were so happy he was over the worst of it.

Chief executive Mark Cowie said the lting of lockdown restrictions in England had put the charity in an impossible situation - forcing them to decide whether to put leguards or the public at risk. In an open letter Mr Cowie said leboat crews had their busiest weekend of the year, despite warning that no leguards were on patrol. On Monday, a -year-old girl died after a boat capsized near Wadebridge and a man died after being pulled from the water by a member of the public in Padstow. With thousands flocking to English beaches now lockdown restrictions have been eased, we must choose between keeping the public or our leguards safe, Mr Cowie wrote. Safety advice and warnings will only go so far when people are desperate to enjoy some freedom after weeks of lockdown. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, click here As a lesaving charity, the RNLI cannot stop people going to beaches - but the Government can - before more lives are lost around our coast this summer. He said rolling out a leguard service during the pandemic was not a simple matter but the RNLI had learned of lockdown measures easing in England at the same time as the general public. The charity must work out how to do in-water rescues and give first aid, which is normally conducted at close quarters and often with people coughing up water, he said. Personal protective equipmentthat works on a beach and in the water - with items such as visors and aprons inappropriate - must also be found.

Stores are expected to slash clothes and accessories by up to % in a bid to sht stock and get the tills ringing again. Analysts say there is up to £billion worth of stock in warehouses and shops. Thousands of shops, department stores and shopping centres can open from June , while outdoor markets and car showrooms will be allowed to open from next Monday as lockdown is eased. But the shopping world will look very dferent with many stores adopting checkouts behind screens, one-way systems and a limit on customer numbers. Changing rooms, seating areas and loos will all be off limits. Items will have to be tried on at home and then put in “quarantine” before they can be put back out for sale. Shoppers are also likely to have to use hand-sanitiser stations before entry. Businesses will only be able to open once they have completed a risk assessment, with regular spot checks. Clive Black, head analyst at Shore Capital said: “There will be the mother of all sales for the next few months.  It will be a real boom for bargain hunters.” But he added: “The shopping landscape will be completely dferent to the sales frenzy we have got used to.” The bonanza could last up to  months, Mr Black predicted.  Industry body the British Retail Consortium welcomed Prime Minister Boris Johnson ’s boost for the high street but said the shutdown was costing non-food stores £.bn a week.

Marks  Spencer will launch its half-price Rainbow Sale, which has already started online. It is bringing in measures to ensure safe shopping when it fully opens  stores and  outlets. “It will be a dferent experience and more likely to one where shoppers have come to buy specic items rather than for a leisurely browse,” a spokesman said.

And they laid into the PM and Tories who again jumped to his defence – even after he claimed he drove to nearby Barnard Castle to “test his eyesight” in a clear breach of the lockdown rules. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, click here One local, Richard Mulley, , said: “He should be gone by now. He has been backed by Boris Johnson and that’s disgusting. I think Boris is not fit to run the country, saying he has done nothing wrong. Everyone  has done what they were asked to do, we were locked in for weeks, while he was coming to our town.” Judith Phillips, , added: “Get rid of him, he should have gone, it’s an ­absolute disgrace. A lot of people are angry, my family is absolutely livid thinking what would they have donetwo parents were ill.”  Another said: “I think it is disgusting. People have not seen their loved ones when they died in hospital. What he has done is just disgusting.” Durham City Labour MP Mary Foy added: “I was prepared to let Dominic Cummings say his piece before I commented, and I have every sympathy with any parent trying to look after their child during this crisis, but I have to say that was a farce. “It was incoherent, illogical and unapologetic. He appears to have ed to work while his we was showing symptoms. He went to Barnard Castle when he should have been staying at home. “The idea of driving  miles to check your eyesight is ridiculous.  “That the Prime Minister allows this circus to continue is shameful. “Right now the Government should be building trust and providing clarity, instead they’re laughing at us.” Former Durham Police chief ­superintendent Lord Mackenzie of Framwellgate, , said he found Mr Cummings’ reasons for his trip “implausible”. He added: “Wearing my policeman’s hat, it felt like he was being economical with the truth, especially when he talked about driving to Barnard Castle to test his eyes. “Then he said that he could not remember filling up at a petrol station on the way back to London. “I thinkyou had driven  miles without stopping on the way here you would remember where you stopped on the way back.  “I think he was trying to hide that. When people abide by the rules, this creates a sense of injustice. And the Cabinet ministers lining up were defending the ­indefensible. “It reminded me of Watergate. The cover up is worse than the offence.” An unnamed Barnard Castle ­resident blasted Mr Cummings after he admitted he drove his four-year-old son to hospital in the region, fearing he may have the virus. The pensioner said: “One of the messages of staying at home and not travelling was so that you did not burden the NHS. “Of course you sympathise when a child is ill, but that child should have been taken to a London hospital.” Barnard Castle’s ex-Labour MP Helen Goodman said: “People are trying to say this is a political issue but it is not. “This is an issue for the general public who have had some terrible experiences during lockdown and kept to the rules, and he has not. There is a lot of anger at his responses.” Labour MP for Washington and Sunderland West, Sharon Hodgson, added: “There cannot be one rule for Dominic Cummings and another for the British people.”  And her Stockton North colleague Alex Cunningham warned: “Tory MPs and ministers, instead of defending the indefensible, should simply shut up. They’ve lost public confidence on the Cummings thing and to stand with him can only do them more damage.” Barnard Castle mayor John Blissett, who is not politically aligned, insisted Mr Cummings should have apologised for visiting the town. The -year-old has been in isolation since March due to his age, and joked the aide’s press conference had done “a hell of a lot” for the town – adding: “Come to Barny and test your eyesight.” One man claimed Mr Cummings had clearly come to Barnard Castle on April  to celebrate his journalist we Mary Wakefield’s th birthday. He added: “I think that is why he was here. That’s why he did it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"primary school closes after pupil","story":"NewsPrimary school closes after pupil and their parents test positive for coronavirusSkerne Park Academy in Darlington has closed after a pupil and their parents tested positive for coronavirus, just days before schools in England are set to reopenShareCommentsByMike Brown:,  MAY NewsSkerne Park Academy in Darlington has closed after a pupil and their parents test positive for coronavirus \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

People have been warned to stay out of the toxic electric blue water in Buxton, Derbyshire. But yesterday people were spotted ing into the former quarry, known locally as the Blue Lagoon, Derbyshire Live reports. Itaposs believed that people travelled from Staffordshire nad Yorkshire to the site on the edge of the Peak District. However, anyone planning to go to the Blue Lagoon is being warned it is like having a aposbath in bleachapos due to the PH level. There are also old cars, animal carcasses and faeces in the water. And Derbyshire’s Chief Constable has described the pool as aposprobably the most dangerous water in the UKapos. Now people are being reminded to stay away over half-term. Danielle, aged , from Sheffield, told  DerbyshireLive : My family has been coming here for years so I thought it would be busy but I didnapost expect it to be this busy to be fair. Weaposve just come down with the kids for a picnic but I donapost think weaposll stop for long. I canapost believe how busy it is.  Iaposm amazed people are swimming. The signs make it obvious how dangerous it is. Earlier this year, Derbyshire Police faced criticism for for pouring black dye into the water to deter visitors. Lord Sumption even called it aposdisgracefulapos, saying: “This is what a police state is like, it is a state in which a government can issue orders or express preferences with no legal authority and the police will enforce ministers’ wishes.  The lake is, in fact, dyed black every year in an effort to make the site look less appealing to visitors, as the water is otherwise a lovely crystal blue colour. A Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said: “We’re aware of people continuing to visit Harpur Hill quarry, known locally as the Blue Lagoon. “Did you know it gets its blue colour from toxic deposits seeping from the quarry stone and is the same PH value as bleach! “Would you swim there    #StayAway.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk abandoned social distancing photos","story":"NewsHas England abandoned social distancing  Parks, beaches and beauty spots packedPictures of packed beaches and beauty spots - where social distancing was a challenge due to the huge turnouts - have fuelled fears that weeks of progress could be undone by a second wave of coronavirus in the UKShareCommentsByChris KitchingSenior News Reporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video brits-out-numbers-hottest-day-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news uk-abandoned-social-distancing-photos-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Beaches and beauty spots were packed on Bank Holiday Monday and popular again on Tuesday have fuelled concerns that weeks of progress could be undone by a second wave of Covid-. And it is feared Boris Johnsonaposs decision to back Dominic Cummingsapos lockdown trip to Durham could undermine the Governmentaposs safety messages and lead to people choosing to flout the rules. As pictures show packed coastal and beauty spots where social distancing was a challenge, Britons are being reminded to use common sense and do their part to prevent the virusapos spread.to get the Mirror’s daily coronavirus briefing email at mirror email -after the press conference every evening.Health chiefs, councils and police forces have said that a majority of people are complying with the emergency laws and guidelines as more fine weather tempts Britons outside. While lockdown restrictions continue to be eased, crowds flocked to beauty spots on Bank Holiday Monday, raising concerns in some areas. Beaches and beauty spots were busy again on Tuesday. Waverley Borough Council in Surrey issued a warning to those visiting the village of Frensham, tweeting: Please be aware that the car park is filling up quickly and it is very busy so social distancing will be hard.On Monday, thousands of people flocked to beaches in places such as Brighton, Southend and Bournemouth, where the local council reminded people there were other less busy but equally lovely open spaces to enjoy. Sunbathers were seen brawling on a beach in Broadstairs, Kent, and police were called to a lido in north London amid reports of one large group gathering. With schools in England, Scotland and Wales on a half-term break this week, large numbers of people are expected to emerge from lockdown amid warm conditions. A week after the relaxation of guidelines to allow people to visit beauty spots in England, the Government and the police have urged people to continue to follow social distancing guidelines. Please use common sense when it comes to social distancing, the politan Policeaposs Hillingdon branch tweeted. Apart from crowds at beaches on Monday, long stretches of traffic were also seen at the Yorkshire Dales, while walkers were also out enjoying the grounds of Windsor Castle.  Former Greater Manchester Police chief constable Sir Peter Fahy said officers are frustrated by the Dominic Cummings case, adding it is dficult to see the policeaposs role in controlling lockdown. He told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: Thereaposs a lot of confusion and it feels like thereaposs quite a gap between the public narrative and narrative of ministers about the lockdown and whataposs happening on the street. I think itaposs quite hard to see the role the police have in the future - the rules about the reasons for travel are now very confused, when you see the crowds on Bournemouth and Southend beaches and other places yesterday itaposs hard to see what role the police have in trying to control that.  While new cases and deaths from coronavirus have fallen nationally, a hospital in Somerset was forced to close this weekend due to a high number of Covid- patients. Weston General Hospital, in Weston-super-Mare, stopped accepting new admissions, including into its AE department from am on Monday. As the hospital shut as a precautionary measure, some residents in Weston reported concern over high numbers of people enjoying a day at the seaside. Locals have blamed tourists and VE Day celebrations for the new coronavirus spike that closed Weston General Hospital. On Facebook, one local said: People start flocking to Weston, then cases spike in Weston. Itaposs not rocket science to work out that cramming on the beach, not social distancing has played a big part in this. Stay in your own counties!  Many people would have gone to Weston with the virus and a lot more would have left with it and will now be spreading it around their own communities too! Another blaming VE day celebrations said: They blame it on tourists but loads got together to celebrate VE day, and this spike coincides with VE day - itaposs not always tourists! Many called for lockdown restrictions to be re-tightened and for people to use their common sense. Others called for more police presence.

RNLI chief executive Mark Dowie said the charity could not stop people going to beaches, “but the government can.” He described the charity as being in “an impossible situation”, and said it was being forced to “choose between keeping the public or our leguards safe.” Warnings are also in place to conserve water after rainfall levels slumped in the past three months with water firms asking people to think about their use at home as May’s rainfall stands at less than a quarter of normal levels. In March, the UK experienced  per cent of normal levels and April and May have been even worse, with only  per cent of the average rainfall in April and  per cent so far in May. It has led to fears that the country may face a hosepipe ban despite a wet start to the year.A Met Office spokeswoman said: “It’s been a very dry month across the board, but we do have about a week left and things could become a bit unsettled.”The Met Office has registered only mm of water fall this month compared with the mm average. One water company has applied for a drought order to manage Ennerdale Water in the Lake District. Simon Fluendy, from Southern Water, said the company was already urging more frugal water usage. He added: “We want people to use water wisely because there are big challenges. It is a precious resource. With everyone at home because of the lockdown, they’re using water dferently and there could be an issue with everyone using it at one time.” The Met Office has suggested that the UK is set for a hot summer and there are already worries about trees and plants.

Emily, originally from Livingston, Scotland, said: “I thought I was hallucinating when I saw it. “I was taking the bins out and I just saw this bed on the side of my house and I thought what the hell is going on here. “I was just laughing so much and I went into the house to tell my housemate and they were telling there was no way this was as funny as I made it out to be. “It was just strange - I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. “For God’s sake how has this happened.

Emily added: “I thought this couldn’t get funnier. But it did. “Because at night the light automatically came on and it just illuminated the whole bed.  “It became like a beacon of sorts. It’s just ridiculous.” The bed has become a bit of a local attraction in the Hyde Park area in Leeds, where Emily lives.

Is there a story we can tell  We are an educational charity so we need to find what we can teach then look at locations and see what would work best, not just for us but the people who live there.#Talks on the project have been ongoing for almost a year and the feasibility study is to be launched early next month.But Sir Tim Smit, co-founder of the Eden Project and executive chairman of Eden Project International, was clear a future project in Dundee will be entirely its own and not a replica of the Cornwall site.“We don’t like copying ourselves,” he said.“What you’re not going to get is Eden Cornwall in Dundee. That would be boring and would cheapen both projects.“We want to make a wonderfully creative exhibition of something which is unmistakeably Dundee.“The city has a very good university, a cultural background, it has become a tech hub. I’m very excited about Dundee, it has all of the ingredients to make magic sauce.”As well as running major tourist attractions, the Eden Project offers educational programmes and outreach projects and will work with Dundee City Council, Dundee University and the Scottish Government on the project.Mr Harland said: “I think it’s fair to say there are pockets of deprivation and quite dficult circumstances for a lot of people in the city.“A big part of our education and outreach is bringing hope to these people. We want to work with the people of Dundee to find out what they want and make sure they know it is their project and they’re not having it done to them.#There could be nothing worse than us just coming in and plonking something down.

There is a massive backlog and it is clearly is causing a great deal of angst for people who are perhaps contemplating going to court to give evidence.#They are sitting there in lockdown wondering what is going on.#People need to have some sort of knowledge that the judicial process is continuing and there is certainly an air of fear about the unknown.#I think it is essential fundamental parts of our democracy such as the judicial process are not to be interrupted.#Defence lawyer Alex Burn said he was not sure how -person jury trials could operate from a social distance.He said: #I don#t know how the social distancing will realistically work in Aberdeen, whether they will place the jurors in a dferent court, or have them join in virtually.#I don#t think it#s a great idea to have it virtually, I think it#s important that jurors can make their assessment when they can see the person as opposed to the picture.#If you are assessing someone it#s not just who you see, it#s the way you see it # it#s their demeanor which is important.#If we have to wait for justice, we have to wait. It will still happen at some point.#North-east MSP Lewis Macdonald said: #The current crisis has created a backlog of cases in the criminal justice system, which has led to unacceptable delays for witnesses and victims in cases which have had to be put on hold.#The announcement that jury trials could restart in July is a welcome one, but of course it is vital that all necessary health precautions are taken to protect court staff, victims and witnesses and the members of juries themselves by ensuring that physical distancing guidelines will be observed.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2017/05/P-stock-image-POLICE.xml-140x79.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"life under lockdown competition opens to north east kids","story":"North-east children are being invited to share stories of their le under lockdown, as part of a national writing competition.Generation Lockdown is seeking entries between the ages of -

Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

inAugust.The First Minister revealed this will be a \"blended\" approach, far from normality for our nations youngsters, as part of a four-phase plan to ease the lockdown.But even this is reliant on two key factors -the scientic andmedical advice confirms it can be done in a way that will not disrupt efforts to control the virus andthere is sufficient PPE and other hygiene measures in place.Following Ms Sturgeons announcement in parliament, the Scottish Government published its strategic framework for the re-opening of schools.Here, well detailwhat parents need to know ahead of their childsto the classroom.When will schools re-open Schools in Scotland are set to re-open on August .This is earlier than planned for some schools - but the universal approach is being advised by the Scottish Government.Teachers are set toto the classroom by June to plan and prepare for the new blended model of learning.Some pupils set to start P or S may also receive some in-school experience in late June, to help ensure they are supported to make the next steps in their education.Critical childcare will continue until August to ensure the ongoing provision for key worker and vulnerable children.How will the blended model work Under this approach, children will have a mixture of in-school and in-home learning.According to the framework, this is reliant on consistent and easy-to-use in-home materials which are \"intended to support and complement, but not replicate\" in-school learning.To help disadvantaged pupils, a further poundm was announced to provide laptops and other technology for the home learning.However the document notes: \"No matter how well planned in-home learning is, it is not the same as having effective learning and teaching within the school environment, led by teachers.\"The blended model will be kept under constant review.How will pupils social distance For the first phase of re-opening, schools are being asked to assess the maximum numbers they can accommodate, with guidance including:Pupils being taught in smaller groupsThese groups will not be mixed, where practicableSeating positions will be re-organised to allow for m gaps between pupilsOutdoor space will be used moreThere will be staggered arrival and departure times, so parents will avoid congregating in playground areasBreaks will be staggered by class to avoid contact from dferent classesTeachers, rather than pupils, will move around classrooms where possibleThere will be enhanced hygiene practices across all schools, including additional cleaning,params: .pushExpanding the learning estateLocal authorities are being advised to look for ways they can maximise the capacity for pupils to benefit from in-school learning as much as possible.One such way they are doing this is through expanding the learning estate.This would mean seeingclassrooms could be made fromoutdoor space,libraries, community halls, leisure centres and conference centres.It might also include taking short-term leases of vacant business accommodation.Who will be prioritised for in-school learning As set out above, there is likely going to be a finite number of daily places for in-school learning.As a result, to support NHS capacity and other essential work, a priority will be given to the children of keyworkers - but this is only in circumstances where absolutely necessary with no other option for childcare within that household.The remaining allocation is to be distributed across all year groups to ensure every pupils benefits from in-school learning where possible, according to the framework.Local authorities are being advices to use their knowledge of local circumstances to prioritise any groups where need is greatest.Speaking in the Scottish Parliament on Thursday, the First Minister said: ldquoThese arrangements will not represent a completeto normality by August.ldquoBut we judge them to be the most sensible approach we can plan for at this stage.Later in the session, the First Minister said the Scottish Government wants to ensure pupils will be back at school ldquoin a way that allows them to be children.She added: ldquoNone of us relish the prospect of seeing kids, particularly young kids, socially distancing or be as aware of these risks as we will undoubtedly have to require them to be.ldquoTrying to get, for children in

Governments across the UK moved quickly to introduce business support schemes.I know, however, that many Scottish businesses, especially SMEs, have been frustrated with the level and speed of help provided, with some even seeking a judicial review of the Scottish Governmentrsquos policy.The frustration grew from the decision to initially block retailers with multiple outlets from applying for more than one grant ndash putting small chain businesses in Scotland at a competitive disadvantage.Following a backlash, Ministers relented, but businesses with multiple properties here are still only allowed to claim  per cent of the maximum support grant for subsequent properties.But with almost half a billion pounds of business support grant finance still not having been allocated, and the allocation of funds slowing down, Scottish Labour is demanding Ministers urgently reconsider this policy and offer businesses with more than one premises their additional grants in full.Given the widely predicted long-term economic damage likely to be caused by the pandemic, it will be vital that once the public health crisis is under control we dedicate the same urgency and intervention to repairing our economy.I want this to include a jobs guarantee scheme to help tackle the looming threat of unemployment, especially for young people.Further information about the advice and support available for businesses during the pandemic can be found at findbusinesssupport.gov.scot coronavirus-advice, while the governmentrsquos Covid- business helpline number is   ."},{"url":null,"title":"day-centre-receives-holyrood-recognition","story":"Harlawhill Day Centrersquos efforts during the coronavirus pandemic were highlighted by the countyrsquos MSP, Iain Gray.The facility had to close its doors on March  due to the global pandemic but Mr Gray felt it was important to recognise the efforts being made by staff and volunteers.The centre, on the townrsquos East Loan, has continued to offer a range of support to members during the pandemic, including organising socially distanced street celebrations outside membersrsquo homes to help mark VE Day and delivering special afternoon tea packages and other food and treats to help keep their spirits up during lockdown.Mr Gray, who lodged a motion at Holyrood highlighting the facility, told the Courier: ldquoHarlawhill Day Centre has always been a special place, very much at the heart of the community in Prestonpans.ldquoIt was a very sad day when it had to close its doors to members back in March.

climbing up the Law to gasp at the view across the Forth, was mind blowing.A never-ending knickerbocker glory in Lucarsquos ice cream parlour and a served hot breakfast of juicy pork sausages, crispy bacon and grilled tomatoes with racks of hot buttered toast have never tasted so good!What a strong impression those three days made.Long before cheap flights enticed us all around the world for less than the taxi fare to North Berwick, holidays at home were a well anticipated luxury for most.Not only that, it was vital to the local economy.The Glasgow Fair brought enough hordes of workers across to the east to bring enough cash for local businesses to survive right through until spring.In recent times, as we have deserted our shores for sunnier climes, there have been hordes of overseas tourists who have been attracted to our treasures.In response to this ever-increasing demand, our holiday industry has raised its game so much that Scotland has become one of the most popular tourist destinations of the world.Last year, Edinburgh residents petitioned the council and tourist board that there were lsquotoo many visitorsrsquo and lsquowe want our city back to ourselvesrsquo.Be careful what you wish for.The tourists are not coming this year.So, letrsquos not scan the papers desperately for news of flights to whisk us away for our continental fix.Letrsquos just stay put and explore the great attractions of our beautul country, right here on our doorstep.The great food, hospitality and incredible countryside are second to none and will not disappoint.Not only that, our

they say they canrsquot sleepto think of a place to go, then close their eyes and make it happen in their dreams.So Irsquove been taking my own advice and stories are taking me to favourite places that in normal times I would be visiting in reality.One of these is Woodhall Dean.I walked through its oak wood in my imagination recently, and I realised I still hadnrsquot solved the mystery of why there is a location called Tinkerrsquos Leap by the steep sided burn.So I decided to ask Jess Smith, the renowned traveller and author.She told me that the story comes from Covenanting times but she couldnrsquot recall it from the top of her head.She will search it out in what she calls her ldquocave of books and recordings.But she immediately rolled off another tale, which comes from the same region and fits the bill.It is a tale shared by Border travellers, as they moved from place to place and in whose company she ldquospent many a campsite stick fire with.She painted a picture of the story culture she comes from. Here are her words:In the past many couldnrsquot read or write and so our history was rolled into the mind and later unravelled when the wheels stopped rolling and the horses were roped for grazing.Cars and lorries may have replaced the old methods of transport, but the importance of our cultural tales remained the same.Stories for children were about joys and adventures of the fairy folk, goblins and broonies.As they grew older, moral messages were concealed in the stories to teach the young person about moral issues.Respecting the earth and all that lived on her made for some wonderful tales about animals and birds why the snakes see all, who painted the eaglesrsquo feather tips, does a blackbird feel a storm coming at the base of his beak Is it not wise to heed the warning of a dog who does not rise to happily welcome the arrival of its master Our lives revolved around such tales, and their inner meanings. The boy who cried wolf was forever with us do not lie!You see, forests hold more than trees and rocks will whisperyou have an ear to listen.Our entire lives were, and are, stories. In my culture we had a teller in every family.In her books about the lives of traditional travellers, and her personal experience of it, she does not overly romanticise it.It could be a hard le, and one often misunderstood or discriminated against, as indeed it still is.But the legacy of stories, told and re-told over campfires, in caravans and kitchens, passed down from generation to generation is a rich and priceless inheritance.I was honoured that she shared a tale with me, albeit online rather than face to face, as these times demand.I believe it is a tradition we should all honour and can learn from.And so here is the story she shared.It has a Tinkerrsquos Leap in it and, who knows, it could refer to the place so named in Woodhall Dean.I have tried as best I can to keep the resonance of Jessrsquos voice in the telling.So sit round your campfire, real or imagined, for Jessrsquos tale:The story I am going to tell is of the Earl of Hell. Aye well that is how folk called him. Irsquom told he was a relative of the famous Jeannie Gordon.Well, he was a handsome lad, and had a roving eye. He also had a knack of walking into trouble.Well one day he was accused of stealing something. He knew he would get no fair hearing in court, and sure enough he didnrsquot.Soon he found himself before a dour judge, who donned his black cap and pronounced that he will be hanged at the light of dawn.Now the Earl had already escaped death three times. Some say he had the blood of Red Ruth in his veins.This time it seemed, he had met his fate. But this young lad was not ready to meet his maker.The hangman did his deadly job but as the Earl fell through the trap door he began a dance at the end of the rope, in which he dislocated his shoulders, threw his legs up in a circle and managed to free himself.The jailers were aghast, and disbelief momentarily paralysed their responses.This gave the Earl time to scuffle to his feet and flee up the steps. No door was locked, for nobody had expected the need of it.The lad jumped onto a horse and rode at speed. His horsemanship was, of course, a skill honed from childhood and he rode to freedom.However, a guard was likewise a skilled rider and took chase after him.Perhaps the Earl eased up on his horse for a moment, believing he was well away, but soon the sound of galloping told him dferent. The guard was closing in.The Earl made his horse fly like the wind. He headed into the trees, hoping to lose his pursuer, but to no avail.The steep sided burn lay ahead. So he rode like the devil towards the precipice.But at the last moment his horse took understandable fright, and stalled, throwing him to the ground.As the Earl stood, his horse would have no more of it and fled.His pursuer now drew a sword that glinted in the morning sun as he charged perhaps after all the Earl of Hell would die in this dawn light.But his title was well earned.He turned towards the precipice and threw caution to the wind and leapt over the edge.The pursuing guard pulled up his horse and watched as the Earl flew over the ravine and landed like a cat on the other side.The guard fumbled for his pistol, but the Earl vanished into the thicket of the wood in moments.The location became known ever after as Tinkerrsquos Leap.And as for the Earl of Hell himself, he was seen again only through the misty visions of drunk men, and the eyes of his sweetheart who did not tell his story till long after he was dead."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-council-caravan-bid-rejected","story":"Lammermuir Livery and Stables wanted to provide accommodation for relief staff for their stable manager to live at their rural base at Castlemains Farm, Gford, to run the business.And they hoped East Lothian Council would back their planthe caravans were hidden from sight on nearby land already used to store mobile homes and other vehicles.However councillor officers refused to grant planning permission and the councilrsquos Local Review Body backed their decision during an online meeting this week when they refused an appeal against it.The planning application, which was retrospective also asked for permission to have an office, already built at the entrance to to site, but that was also rejected by the review body.Making their case for the caravans, the firm said: ldquoWhen considering this we were aware of the visual impact a caravan could have on the landscapeand decided the best option would be to site the caravan in the existing storage yard in an area designated for that purpose, this area already has caravans stored, which we have permission forand therefore the caravan would not be a new thing in that area.HoweverCouncillor Norman Hampshire, review body chairperson, described the decision to let people live in a storage area as lsquounacceptablersquo.He said: ldquoI do not think residential caravans on a storage site is an acceptable place for people to be living.The stables had also argued that there was not secure space within the equestrian buildings it had at he farm for an office and one needed to be built on another part of the land, however this was also dismissed by the review body.Members carried out inidual site visits to the farm ahead of meeting todayonline.Councillor Sue Kempson said: ldquoThe caravans are in the wrong place and should not be used as living accommodation on a storage site, it sets a precedent.ldquoLooking around the equestrian site there is plenty of room to provide a secure office so I am supporting the officersrsquo decision.Fellow body member Councillor Kenny McLeod made the decision unanimous when he ruled the office and caravans were too far away from the centre itself to be of any benefit.Planning officers refused the original application for temporary planning permission for five years for the office and caravans retrospectively, stating there was no business case for the equestrian business to support the need for the additional building and that the caravans would set an ldquoundesirable precedent.The applicants had told the review body their agent, who had been asked to provide a business case, had ldquovanished and they had no knowledge of the request."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-parents-need-know-school-reopen-date-confirmed","story":"The First Minister revealed this will be a \"blended\" approach, far from normality for our nations youngsters, as part of a four-phase plan to ease the lockdown.But even this is reliant on two key factors -the scientic andmedical advice confirms it can be done so in a way that will not distrupt efforts to controlthe virus andthere is sufficient PPE and other hygiene measures in place.Following her announcement in parliament, the Scottish Goevrnment published their strategic framework for the reopening of schools.Here, well detail out what parents need to know ahead of their childsto the classroom.Schools in Scotland are set to reopen on August .This is earlier than planned for some schools -

but this is only in circumstances where absolutely necessary with no other option for childcare within that household.The remaining allocation is to be distributed across all year groups to ensure every pupils benefits from in-school learning where possible, according to the framework.Local authorities are being advices to use their knowledge of local circumstances to prioritise any groups where need is greatest.Speaking in the Scottish Parliament on Thursday, the First Minister said: ldquoThese arrangements will not represent a completeto normality by August.ldquoBut we judge them to be the most sensible approach we can plan for at this stage.Later in the session, the First Minister said the Scottish Government wants to ensure pupils will be back at school ldquoin a way that allows them to be children.She added: ldquoNone of us relish the prospect of seeing kids, particularly young kids, socially distancing or be as aware of these risks as we will undoubtedly have to require them to be.ldquoTrying to get, for children in particular, as much normality as possible in the school environment is really important.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot underestimate the challenges of that but it is absolutely central to all of this careful planning that is underway."},{"url":null,"title":"can-pubs-reopen-glasgow-plan-ease-lockdown-revealed","story":"The four-phase plan will begin as of next week, with a number of measures being relaxed on May .More outdoor activity including sportsmeeting other households and the re-opening of recycling centres are among those being re-introduced at what is being described as Phase .But these areentirely dependent on dramatically reducing coronavirusin the country and successfully implementing a ldquoTest and Protect strategy.For those of us hankering for a leisurely drink in our local, the subject of ing to Scotlands pubs has been addressed in the route map.Current lockdown restrictions mean pubs and restaurants have been forced to close.The measures introduced yesterday also reveal that pubs will be forced to remain closed during Phase  -

IBM no more, as The Proclaimers might have put it.From cradle of manufacturing le to an industrial graveyard: between those two staging posts lies the story of Scotlandrsquos recent economic history. It is a tale well worth telling, not least because many a lesson lies within, and Margaret Shanklandrsquos slick, entertaining documentary was more than up to the job.With narration from Michelle Gomez , Silicon Glen: From Ships to Microchips cantered through the early history of IBM and how it came to arrive in Greenock. Basically, an American exec became pals with a former Glasgow Uni engineer turned MP the American told the Scotsman he was looking for a UK site for a new plant, and the rest was history. All very Local Hero.The Americans had landed and soon made their mark. Any documentary stands or falls on the quality of its contributors and use of archive. Shankland lucked out with the writer Andrew OrsquoHagan and the journalist Alf Young, formerly of this parish.Young did the economic analysis, OrsquoHagan supplied the lyricismMore impressive still were the former workers, or IBM-ers as they were called. They had been brought together in small groups, Nae Pasaran-style, to look back at their time at the plant.Together, they brought the old place roaring back to le. We heard in fascinating detail what it was like to work for ldquoBig Blue. The new, trendy, American ways of working, including calling managers by their first names and wearing ID badges. All the training you wanted, foreign travel, a chance to swap jobs and stay with the firm your entire working le.ldquoIBM transformed whole family lives, said Young. ldquoIt embraced the fact its workforce were important and were to be valued.The workers, or the ones shown here anyway, loved it. ldquoGod, says one, ldquoI sound like Irsquove been brainwashed.The only time the film threw shade on IBM was when it picked up on its refusal to negotiate with unions.There might have been more criticism,only to balance things out, and there was undue haste at the end when it came to wrapping up the story. Could nothing more have been done to keep the plant going  What part did the politicians of the day play, or fail to play Delving into the politics of the story might have led to a drier film, though. Given the other material to hand you could hardly fault Shanklandrsquos choices. I had not known about the connections between Stanley Kubrick and IBM, for instance. Kubrick, as we heard from a former assistant, was an early adopter of IBM computers. He bought one to do the accounts for The Shining. It cost pound, ndash a huge sum for the time.People thought the director was mad, but the computer did such an impressive job Kubrick hired it out to other productions and the thing paid for itself.The film also picked up on the connection between the power-crazed computer in : A Space Odyssey and IBM letters that precede IBM.Other pop culture references included the use of an early IBM machine in an episode of Mad Men. Sure enough, there was the exact clip of Peggy the young advertising executive, with the machine in the background. Details like that, which can take an age to root out and are only on screen for seconds, make such a dference in pepping up a film.Ditto the interview with the secretary of Len Deighton, another early adopter. His novel, Bomber, was the first composed on a ldquoword processor.The film closed as it began, on a rousing note. ldquoItrsquos sad to see the shipyards go as well, said one IBMer, ldquobut yoursquove got to move on.

Fascinatingly, this same rhythm seems to run through our primate family tree.\"Human spoken language is sodferent to anything we find in the rest of the animal kingdom, but we have so many other ways of communicating information, such as body language and facial expressions, that are similar to animal communication.ldquoLanguage didnrsquot replace all of those other systems of communication - we still have them. All of the animal kingdom, including humans, use basic signals, body language and gestures.ldquoOne of the things wersquove never been able to do is say where language came from - this extra amazing system that gave us Shakespeare and poetry and astrophysics.ldquoThis type of signal in the primates, the monkeys and chimpanzees, has something in common with language and maybe that is one of the foundation stones on which we started to build.The paper ldquoChimpanzee lip-smacks confirm primate continuity for speech-rhythm evolution\" is published today in the journal Biology Letters."},{"url":null,"title":"prime-minister-questioned-senior-mps-top-aide-dominic-cummings","story":"Boris Johnson will be questioned at a Commons committee meeting over Dominic Cummings decision to drive from London to Durham during the lockdown.Its the latest in the growing revolt in the PMs party, with at least  Conservative MPs now publicly calling for Cummings to be sacked or to resign.It comes as a YouGov survey for The Times showed the Tory lead over Labour dropped by nine points during the Cummings saga.:Fears over lsquotest and tracersquo with more than , missing tests over two weeksSupport for the government also fell four points to %, while Labour rose five points in the week to Tuesday to %.Senior ministers have expressed public support for the defiant adviser but there are reports a number of Cabinet members have privately called for him to be ousted from No .Mr Johnsonrsquos scheduled appearance via video link at Wednesdayrsquos Commons Liaison Committee hearing has been tinged with controversy over the fact the PM will only briefly be quizzed on the Cummings affair.It is understood MPs will have a maximum of  minutes in a -minute session to probe the situation.Other aspects of the coronavirus crisis will also be discussed in the -minute slot.Asked about the situation regarding Mr Cummings, Liaison Committee chairman Sir Bernard Jenkin told the PA news agency: ldquoI have got no intention of preventing any subject any member of the committee wants to raise.The comment follows controversy over Sir Bernardrsquos appointment to the committee chairmanship, with some MPs saying he is too close to the Prime Minister.:Iain Macwhirter: Johnson is feeling the pain as the Scottish Tories develop a backbone they didnt know they hadSir Bernard insisted the format for the session has been agreed by the committee.The group includes William Wragg, who has said it was ldquohumiliating and degrading to see ministers put out agreed lines in defence of Mr Cummings, and Caroline Nokes, who has informed her party whips there could not be ldquowriggle room for some people when it comes to lockdown rules.Also among those questioning the PM will be Labour chairwoman of the Home Affairs Committee Yvette Cooper, and Tory chairman of the Health Committee Jeremy Hunt."},{"url":null,"title":"eden-project-considers-new-attraction-dundee","story":"The original Eden Project in Cornwall, known for its geodesic Biome domes, one of which houses an undercover rainforest, has welcomed more than  million visitors since it opened in .The organisation has a number of UK and international projects and is now considering creating Eden Project Scotland in Dundee.It said the attraction would be ldquotransformational and regenerative with an overarching theme of humanityrsquos connection to the natural world.:Pledge to avoid anti-tourist vibeDavid Harland, chief executive of Eden Project International, said: ldquoWe are really excited to be working in Dundee.

When so many people across the country have made such great sacrices in the prosecution of that war it is unacceptable that Dominic Cummings should be behave like this and not suffer any consequences.“Dominic Cummings’ behaviour – and the decision of the Prime Minister to support him – risks undermining public confidence in the messaging of government.  It is also clearly consuming time and energy in government that could be better spent on tackling the disease.“In all the circumstancesDominic Cummings will not resign then the Prime Minister should dismiss him.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

A Coronavirus Business Hardship Support Grant Scheme was launched earlier this month.The grant and loans schemes were created following engagement with local business representatives.During discussions with a broad range of business sectors, requests were made for the council to establish ways to ease the immediate pressure created by poor cash flow, with the curtailing of all trade in some sectors and severely limited trade in others.The council fund is intended to supplement rather than replace national support measures # and business applicants should first explore whether they are eligible for assistance from the schemes put in place by the Scottish and UK Governments.Before seeking a loan from OIC, businesses will need to have first applied for funding from the national Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme or the Coronavirus Bounce Back Loan Schemes.Councillor Graham Sinclair, chairman of the council’s Development and Infrastructure Committee, said: “We are very aware of the hardship many businesses are facing in these uncertain and challenging times.“I am pleased that the emergency loan scheme, as well as the hardship grant scheme, are now in place and open for applications.“Many local businesses are receiving assistance from the government support schemes – and these should be the first port of call for those affected by the economic effects of the crisis“But we know from our engagement with Orkney’s business sectors that the national schemes won’t help all businesses.“The new loan scheme offers a further option for those that have been unable to secure support where.“If your business is facing this situation I would encourage you to check online to seeit is eligible # and to get in touch with our economic development team or Business Gateway Orkneyyou are unsure or feel it doesn’t quite meet the criteria.”Standard loan terms are for a duration of up to six years, with an initial repayment holiday period of up to a year, followed by up to five years to repay the loan balance in full. Exceptionally, requests for a loan period of up to  years may be considered.Businesses can find guidance and check the criteria for funding here www.orkney.gov.uk CV-Loan-Guide and,eligible, apply online here www.orkney.gov.uk CV-LoanThose that are unsure about their eligibility should contact the Council’s economic development team for advice at economic.development@orkney.gov.ukcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

National media reports have suggested that Home Office staff cannot access paperwork held in offices due to inefficient home working procedures.Mr Carmichael said: “EU citizens make a massive positive impact in the Northern Isles and the coronavirus crisis has only made that impact clearer. The pandemic has demonstrated the vital contributions that workers from all over the world make in supporting our economy and keeping the NHS running under severe pressure.“The ongoing legal limbo for over two hundred EU citizens in the isles is unacceptable. Continued confusion and delay caused by administrative problems must be put right. Failing to do so puts people’s futures and lives clouded in uncertainty. They deserve better from a government that promised their right to remain.“This news comes in a week in which the government has seemed blind to the importance of immigrant workers in our health and social care sectors. I am glad that the Prime Minister backed down on plans to charge immigrants working in the NHS but it should never have come that far.

In Orkney, this currently stands at two and seven respectively.However, the Scottish Government and NHS Orkney have refused so far to confirm the number of people in each area that have been tested, partly on the basis of concerns around patient confidentiality.Mr McArthur said: “In the absence of a vaccine, any move away from lockdown needs to be backed up by a reliable regime of testing and tracing. We need to keep the virus in sight, so we can properly manage the risk.“If there are any issues in getting this set up, local areas need to know so that those problems can be raised and then fixed.“That is why it is essential that Ministers are as transparent as possible.  Being up front about the amount of testing taking place at a local health board level is a key part of achieving that transparency, keeping people informed and building public confidence.“Without knowing the extent of testing in Orkney, it is dficult to know what to make of the relatively low numbers of confirmed cases of COVID. That is a point I have been reinforcing with Scottish Ministers and NHS Orkney over recent weeks.“The First Minister has called for a ‘grown up’ conversation about how we take the dficult decisions in easing lockdown restrictions.  Grown up conversations, however, are founded on transparency and honesty. That is why we need to see detailed figures on a localised basis.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is also understandable that Ministers want safeguards in place to ensure that public funds are being allocated appropriately.“However, it is clear that requiring applicants to evidence use of a business bank account is causing real problems for many small businesses in the tourism sector.  Many were advised by their own banks to use personal bank accounts to run their operations. Having taken that advice, many now find it is denying them access to the support they desperately need.“BB owners are the backbone of an already vulnerable tourism sector in Orkney and, like other businesses, are facing an uphill challenge at this time. Yet, it is almost asthey haven’t been considered to be a viable business at all, which is deeply frustrating.“I have been raising this issue with the Finance Secretary for a number of weeks now and was encouraged by Kate Forbes’ recognition of the problem and her willingness to keep looking at how this gap in support might be closed. So far, Ministers have been willing to widen criteria and make improvements to funds where needed. I hope the same can happen in this instance so that the hardship fund can continue to target support at those businesses that it was designed to help.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

One person usually does two or three days in a row at one site, then switches with another operator. “I’m quite confident operating on site alone as I’ve been in the role for a number of years now, but we are well supported and there is always someone at the end of a phonewe need any help. As occasional lone workers, we also have safeguards in place to ensure our safety.“As well as allowing me more time to keep on top of college work, which I’m finding harder now there is no face to face teaching, the single person policy also means we can be more flexible right across the dferent teams on the islands.   “For example,a number of colleagues need to self-isolate, there is now extra flexibility that can be called upon to cover these roles, so it’s good there is that resilience in place.   “I feel very grateful that I’m working for Scottish Water just now. I think we’ve been very well cared for and supported throughout the coronavirus pandemic.”    Sweyn, who joined Scottish Water eight months ago, said: “It’s been a really useful learning experience being on site by myself. This summer I will begin standby duties responding to alarms at our two water treatment sites on the mainland, so I think this time spent working the sites alone will help prepare me for those additional duties.  “I’m getting on with the routine stuff as usual andanything comes up that I need help with, I know there’s always someone at the end of the phone so I’ve got no hesitation calling them in that instance.    “It’s a really good team here, really supportive, which is great. If there have to be two people on site, then we make sure that social distancing is in place. With the implementation of these measures, we’ve been successful in producing the high-quality drinking water our customers expect while maintaining the safety of our team and others.”  Ross, who spends a lot of his time out at jobs requiring more than one person in attendance, has found the new measures harder to implement in some aspects of his role. He said: “It is things like ensuring you are keeping two metres apart when you are both digging a hole # you are so conscious of it but you’re also trying to get on and do your job so it has been a challenge.   “It hasn’t been an issue at all in terms of dealing with customers because we wear our gloves and our masks and make sure that we are well away from themwe need to speak to them, but it does make the physical aspects of our job more challenging.“I’ve been with Scottish Water for around nine months and my days can look completely dferent week to week. I can be heading out in the van to fix a burst or fit a connection, or it can be dealing with a choke on the sewer response side of things. That iety is one of the things that I was looking for: you are never bored, never stuck doing nothing. There’s always something to get on with.”  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

His house was so large that he could let the legislature use four rooms. He was one of the wealthiest men in the town but he was not the only successful Orcadian businessman there. About a quarter of the men who formed the first Winnipeg Board of Trade, in March , were Orcadians or the sons of Orcadians: John Inkster and his son Colin, William Drever, Robert Tait, James Clouston, William Flett and George Kennedy.Three of the Board of Trade members have had roads named after them: Bannatyne Avenue, Inkster Bouled and Tait Avenue. There are two more named after Orcadian settlers: Mowat Road after Edward Mowat from Orphir and Setter Street after Andrew Setter, or Seatter. It is no surprise that Orcadians played such a prominent part in the early le of Winnipeg because they were there right from the start: in the Red River Valley.All through the th Century Orkney men went to work for the Hudson’s Bay Company. At its peak, in ,  of the  employees were Orcadian. Most of them came home but a good number settled in the Red River Valley: the colony south of Lake Winnipeg founded by the Earl of Selkirk for Highlanders displaced by the Clearances. The HBC had granted the land on condition that their men could retire there.The colony struggled through its early years but things settled down after the union of the HBC with the North-West Company in . Shetland pioneer Issac Cowie wrote:And it was these Orkneymen, with other veterans of the fur trade…, coming in sufficient numbers to defend it, who made permanent the settlement of Red River.”…Douglas Hill, in The Opening of the Canadian West , described the birth of Winnipeg, within the Red River Settlement, when warehouses and stores were built near the HBC#s Upper Fort Garry.#The collection of ramshackle log or frame buildings, with one or two solid houses, was at first called McDermotville after its leading citizen, an Irish settler-turned-trader named Andrew McDermot, who with his son-in-law, A G B Bannatyne, erected Winnipeg#s first buildings. Soon the town#s shops were thriving, and challenging the Fort as the settlement#s focal point#In  the prairie path that had been graced with the name #Main Street# was properly surveyed, graded and furnished with one or two culverts . It was a symptom of the magnicent optimism that prevailed. Yet the optimists were justied: Winnipeg and Manitoba were on the threshold of great things.  vw, px\"  The full version of this article can be found on page  of this week’s edition of The Orcadian. Patricia Long is a local tour guide based in Stenness, with a particular interest in social and family history.

The guidance stresses the need for personal responsibility when travelling and this co-operation is vital as we work to provide a safe transport system that supports the people of Scotland.“The route map offers a path away from the current restrictions, but the virus is still with us,we move too quickly or without appropriate diligence, it could rapidly run out of control again. “The level of physical distancing required as we navigate the phases of the route map will affect the available capacity of public transport. Operators estimate capacity will be between  per cent and  per cent of normal availability even with full services resumed. “A system that previously had . million journeys per day will be signicantly constrained. So today, I am urging employers, operators and the public to embrace these changes and help us all adapt to a new environment which has flexible and remote working at its core, for the immediate future at least, flattens peak travel demand and has a strong focus on active travel.“We are looking to increase the frequency of public transport. But reducing the demand for transport is vitally important. We are urging employers to show leadership and be as flexible as possible to allow earlier or later starting and finishing times for those that have to travel to work.  “Over the coming weeks and working with our local authority partners, the transport transition plan will look to manage demand and increase availability of road space and priority for walking, cycling, wheeling and bus. “We have a real opportunity to secure a positive and lasting change, one which supports sustainable travel habits. I am therefore delighted to confirm that the ‘Spaces for People’ fund for local authorities has proven so popular that it is being increased to £ million.“We all have a personal responsibility to take steps to protect ourselves and others. It is vital that we continue to keep two metres physical distance wherever possible, wash hands regularly and maintain good cough hygiene.  “Even with the measures being put in place by transport operators, it may be dficult for people to maintain physical distancing throughout their journey in some forms of public transport. I know these are real concerns of the travelling public, operators and transport staff. For that reason, people should, and are expected to, wear face coverings as an additional measure when using public transport and as a consideration to staff and fellow passengers.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I am mindful of the blind leading the blind.Let decisions be made by scientists not ill equipped dabbling politicians.That little pat on the head should appeal to you !!But never mind Nicola is letting us out exercise twice a day.

Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match.

Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.Incidentally, there is no freeze on public sector wages. Typical nonsense and  information being leaked, another left-wingPR leak from socialist civil servant perhaps I think it was the the Argntine president when speaking about Covid  said, #you can recover from a drop in GDP, you cannot recover from death#Fernández makes a good point. The Argentine economy is taking a battering and so is our own but we need to see things in perspective:Last month, Morningstar ran an article about the likely effect of the Coronavirus lockdown on share idends to be paid out by U.K. companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.It set out four possible scenarios, best-case, worst-case, and two “realistic” estimates within that range. In the best-case scenario, overall idends fall % to £. billion, and in the worst they more than halve to £. billion.More recent comments in The Financial Times suggest that we are heading towards a midway point between the best-case and worst-case scenarios while Reuterswarned of a possible % drop in idends “ the situation continues to worsen.”If the economy can afford idend payments of £ billion during the lockdown, I suspect that it is strong enough to recover. Of course, the FT and Reuters are known to be simmering cesspits of socialist subversion, so possibly more fake news.p.s.For the avoidance of any unnecessary tantrums:“The Morning Star” is three words with two spaces whereas “Morningstar” is just one word with no spaces.The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!Ian#s reply to Malcolm#s well reasoned contribution oddly fails to address it.Why I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that. Best just let nature take its course and get the economy on track with hundreds of thousands of deaths, a swamped NHS and a profoundly sick and worried population.Bo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Ian your unwavering faith in BoJo the clown, in the absence of any logical rationale or evidence for doing so, is truly astonishing.Robbie, I have no faith in any politician, but I do find Bo-Jo so much better than the other clowns in the circus. I love the way he routed the remoners, destroyed the Socialist horror of Corbyn and so antagonised, confounded and confused his opponents. Most are left with nothing by puerile and infantile comments to make, such as Bo-Jo the Clown. Is that Robbie the level of your wit and argument Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach. Elements of that thinking lingered on and are resurfacing now, not the least within the twisted outpouring of local eugenicists.Best information as of   .On that basis I think we need Nicola Sturgeon down here in England as well!Act in haste, repent at leisure seems to sum up such weakness.I am trying very hard toto see things from your perspective, but I cannot ignore the indicators and commentary that indicates that the UK economy will officially be in recession by the end of  Q.GDP has fallen by % in the first quarter of this year and predicted to be possibly as high as % in the second quarter.The Bank of England has tried to put a brave face on things by saying #the impact is likely to be temporary with activity rebounding strongly once social distancing measures are lted#. The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million. Let#s say we just let the virus take its course, albeit slowed due to some adjustments to how we work and % of the population catch it. An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s. Make of that what you will.Ali asks: # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #I don#t know Ali.I#m not a dentist.To my understanding there does not need to be an exact genetic match for vaccines to be sufficiently helpful, but as I can#t trace my male line back over countless generations maybe Ali should consult a bard or a sage instead.There is, and has been, something of a medical research race on for understanding of transmission, for patient management treatment and for vaccines.Prompter action would have kept more folk alive longer whilst progress was made. The usual suspects are welcome to argue that and which way they may like, but it won#t change matters.There has been medical research and hard work for years into a reliable vaccine for corona viruses. How are they doing on that front  You don#t need to be a dentist to find that outYes Ali, but you do need to know the dference between a Virus and Venus, RNA and DNA, a vaccine and socialist vacillation, that is where humanists and left-wing ideologues come up a little short!!As I#m not a puller of teeth its a challenge to tell Ali how this virus dfers from the common cold, or why the research may be getting more funding and focus than the industry and government gave previously.You stated that you don’t need to be a dentist to find that out but, to be fair and reasonable about this , someone with medical training is likely to be better equipped than someone without to come up with insights which could be useful. In all probability Ian will not strike gold but how thankful we would behe did !!Fake news  Trump tried to buy Moussa and replace the old stone buildingswith a shiny new tower and Miss Sturgeon will use the proceeds to building a border wall.The deal came unstuck when China claimed Shetland as part of its North Sea and Atlantic territorial waters. It is understood that Miss Sturgeon has been learning Madrin while Scotlandis locked upOwen Jones has denied that he supports Identity politics, woke culture and he is not a social justice warrior.CNNhires Greta Thunberg to appear on a  as an expert on Covid .Best not to bother with why UK has biggest obesity problem in Europe. Such inquiry requires social science, some sociological imagination and a grain of empathy.Much easier to blame those poor plebs who haven#t got a grip.No need to invest on ending intergenerational deprivation and increasing opportunity too.Playgrounds for schools in poorer parts of our cities Why bother.Simples Peter, integrate #Care# for young and old into the NHS. That would include a voucher towards joining a gym or active participation sports club for every citizen irrespective of wealth. Those who chose not to use it, be it on their heads, it is their own health and wellbeing which will suffer. Covid  is ruthless with the obese and unfit,blame and empathy are not part le and death struggle of potentially fatal illness.Ian#s suggestion does nothing to end intergenerational deprivation, aka poverty. Poverty, and other social ills, can result in obesity in ious ways.Obesity simply is not automatically a #lestyle choice#.To suggest so is to indulge in inflammatory victim blaming and victim shaming.Not all single parents on benefits, depending also on whatever the Foodbank might provide, can easily promote healthy lestyles for all of their children.Many are struggling with issues beyond Ian#s limited appreciation.Seven year olds don#t generally make lestyle choices. Fat cells, once over produced in response to whatever unwelcome stimulus, don#t simply disappear. They hang around calling to be filled.Not all parents have time or money to afford Shetland Recreational Trust#s offerings.They dont all have the ability to get their children to the leisure facilities.It is only #simples#you take an uncaring and simplistic approach. Ian knows this intellectually as it has been pointed out more than once. Yet he persists. Odd. A little more fellow feeling might stem his approach.All I am suggesting Peter is an attempt to control excessive eating of Junk foodswith integrating our NHH with free access to all to a gym or active participation sports club for every citizen irrespective of wealth. Just how can that be #to indulge in inflammatory victim blaming and victim shaming. #Where are you getting your figures on childhood obesity in Shetland from Ian  Surely not from the newspaper article you’ve linked below, which is from  and quotes figures for adults from  If Ian imagines free education and access to the NHS has equalled le chances this is going to be a walk in the park.If Ian imagines the Welfare State to be thriving why so many Foodbanks  On another planet does not just describe Boris and Dodgy Dom today.There are also undernourished children in Shetland and across the UK, and parents going without in order that their children can eat. Ian might be interested to research the number of food banks before the era of Conservstive austerity and see how well the number has grown since. Quite an achievement for his #thriving welfare state#. Soon unemployment numbers will be thriving too thanks to the ghastly response to Covid  fromBoris and chumsThirty thousand deaths a year is a pre-covid figure we now have obesity as a % factor in covid  deaths!!If we were talking drug deaths running a food bank would be an offence. Perhaps that is a little tongue-in-cheek but this year obesity will be a factor in about , people dying prematurely. Surely about time for gyms, fitness and participant sports organisationsto be granted by integrated into the NHS with a free or subsidised entry for all.Sorry Peter, Boris and his chums were working with Nicola and her chums on Covid  . All in harmony which must be a first!Covid  was away with the fairies, another socialist ideal.!It is mildly reassuring that Ian Tinkler has #no faith in politicians# presumably including BoJo the Clown. This Government has bungled it#s handling of the Covid- crisis on an industrial scale. Exercise Cygnus in October  highlighted serious shortcomings in the UK#s Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response Plan to a pandemic. Since then PPE stock levels were run down by %. Being made aware of the virus in December  no preparation was started until March when the herd immunity strategy was quickly jettisoned. Britain refused to participate in the EU procurement scheme for PPE leading to farcical attempts to obtain PPE from some guy in Turkey who made T shirts. Unsurprisingly the PPE was unusable. Rather than get ventilators from established manufacturers The Government ignored their offers of help and went to Tory donors like James Dyson who managed to produce  of the  needed. Flights bringing  people a day into the Uk without test or quarantine only stopped  months after lockdown. People being placed in care homes without being tested. Unbelievably lockdown is being eased in England without test track and trace being implemented. We have the second highest death total in the world.England does not have the highest number of deaths in Europe, and England has a far higher recovery rate than many in European nations.The Care homes in England have about half the death rate of their Scotish counterparts and the Death Rate per capita in England is considerably less than in Scotland. Just to keep you up to date, Nicola has just today,reversed her political decision on lockdown. The statistics are available online however, ferreting the Scotish records is problematic. For some reason, the SG is far less transparent with the Data than the English. Figures below are slightly out of date but show the comparison.The population of England. ,, No of deaths. , Death ratio. .So in summary, the gospel according to Ian Tinkler is that BoJo the clown hasn#t put his size  feet in it at all as the death rate is higher in Scotland than in England.Ian, I think your calculations are the wrong way round and show what you might call a #survival ratio# rather than a death ratio. There#s also a decimal place error but for the purposes of comparison that doesn#t really matter.If you work it out in deaths per million of population you can see that Scotland has a lower death rate.England:  from      per mPlease do not put words in my mouth Robbie. What is happening in Scotland is down to The SG and Nicola, as theFM and former Health Secretary. Trying to make political capital out of people dying is morally reprehensible, obnoxious and malign. Bo-Jo and Nicola have equal responsibility for any mistakes, they both shared and followed the best science they could. For once they were in harmony and agreement. The NHS was not overwhelmed, lives were saved, be thankful for that. Fortunately, the injection of disinfectant, we will leave to a real clown who is now mainlining hydroxychloroquine!!! Perhaps Darwinism will step in soon! God save America.Oh this is too funny to pass by! Mr Tinkler creates his own, entirely , Coronavirusfigures to make a political point and is immediately shot down. He then states that only an idiot would try to use coronavirus figures to make political points. Well, on that we totally agree # only an idiot would.Ray try and understand the dference between political comment and malicious point-scoring.ian seems to be using dferent measurement criteria between scotland and england and even dferent data within scottish figures. on  may he has scottish figure  but on  may it has gone up to .the lower figure is the one for deaths from positive test cases, the higher one is all deaths where covid is mentioned on death certicate.in his original calculation for england he uses positive test figuresthus for accurate comparison he should use the lower scottish figure also. this is what alan leask has done and produced an accurate comparison.The vaccine is focusing on a very small sequence in the S viral protein which enables it to bind to the ACE receptor on human cells in mucosal linings and infect them. There isn’t much room for mutation there without the virus losing its ability to bind to that receptor. Other mutations mentioned, in other parts of the virus, enable “strains” of virus to be tracked. Reproduction is subject to errorand billions upon billions of virus are being produced, so mutations will take place. However the critical site for immunity is probably conserved.I did read it Ian # that’s how I know it’s completely irrelevant. Now you’ve produced aarticle from ! So, just to be straight, your reasoning for easing the Coronavirus lockdown in  is a  year old newspaper article about obesity  I don’t think that’s the real reason is it now  Could it be that you’re putting your political prejudices first again  Not that it matters of course. Now even the FMs most recent slight adjustments to lockdown only allow five-mile car run to a place to exercise. That does not get a Glaswegian far from the centre of Glasgow. It just does exactly the worst thing, concentrates people together in highly populated areas. The counterargument regards spreading the virus into new areas is fallacious. Just in case our FM had not noticed, the virus has already disseminated widely and in the great outdoors of Scotland Social Distancing is a lot easier than in Glasgow or any other city.So, the death ratio in Scotland from Covid , according to the self-proclaimed STE expert is .. That, I believe, is patently incorrect, not to mention entirely absurd, and would mean that . people from  person had died from the disease. As an analogy, based on a notional teeth count,someone had, let’s say, ten teeth and subsequently had one removed then the ratio of teeth removed to those not having been removed would be  , or %. The “survival ratio”, as someone referred to, ie the teeth remaining, is the remainder as a proportion of the whole, in other words  out of , or %, assuming that the dentist extracts within remit. The two equations are not inter-changeable. This, however, from the statistical and other real experts acknowledged in their fields is very interesting: A good point and as always I appreciate a good dental analogy to illustrate the dference between death and survival rates. I know here we like to fight tooth and nail about such things, but it is good to see someone #filling in# the gaps here. And as for Mr. Tinkler, he certainly puts the effort in and even though we may disagree, it keeps things on here lively. He deserves a plaque.Michael Inkster, Try .Decimal point one, not  to  . Actually maths was wrong recalculation above. Simples absurdly so, evenmental arithmetic was a little rusty first time round!!Since it appears to be much more virulent and deadly than flu the future would seem to be less than rosy.In fact, depressingly gloomy and all the statistical information so diligently presented will be consignedto no more than being purely academic and capable of making not a scrap of dference.I am more intrigued into the sources of  major viruses having a global impact from China, and what is the Chinese Government doing about the health and safety of food products and the, apparent, lack of any proper procedures in which to prevent further outbreaks  What is the WHO doing in regards to monitoring potential infections from China and or limiting the movements of live animals in poorly developed hygiene conditions, allegedly We hear the origins of such viruses, but no information regarding preventative measures taking place to restrict and confine such health hazards within an area and to stop this from spreading further afield  Why has there been no ban on the sale and transport of certain foods from China Is the whole process of live animal meat production having to be totally reviewed by the Chinese government or is it a case of waiting until something even greater forces them to act Should we enforce our own standards of Health and Safety onto other countries in terms of a trade agreement or should market forces have a free for all without any restrictions, including Health and Safety  Should this be reviewed JOSEPH NIVEN has hit the nail squarely on the head. The statistics are not clearly put and blaming one UK politician, BoJo or Sturgeon is wrong. The SNP and Torie parties pretty much followed identical policies until last week.If Ian imagines free education has eliminated inequalities of opportunity he is mistaken.inequalities of opportunity frequently come down to ambition. The opportunities are there for all, not everybody wishes to take them.Sure good sound parentage and background help promote ambition, but the old adage you can take a horse to water but!!! If you wish to destroy ambition, try extreme socialism. The good old USSR and present-day Venezuela give good examples.I don#t know where to start with this statement Ian, and I#m not sure it will make any dference to youI do.There are multiple stories on just this very subject, but since you are not a big fan of the arts, you might not have read them, seen them or heard them.You can have ambition, and even a great education, but still be knocked back by the old boy network, or because you are not white or not male. These inequalities still exist.There are statistics to show that Eton boys get the top jobs still, and the only way to get a better leader for this country will be to do away with privilege and try to level the playing field. New Zealand for example have a great leader and it is refreshing to see someone lead who has her role on merit.I know nothing of the countries you mention but I am sure they still have ambitious and educated people despite your partisan viewpoint.Ian might as well say the poor are frequently to blame for their lot. Oil rich Norway does not tolerate UK levels of inequality.Neither do many other poprer countries.Quite what the USSR and Venesuala have got to do with it is likely apparent to Ian.Others will see their inclusion within what passes for his argument as a clear attempt at distraction. The possible impacts of being brought up in poverty by others who have had the same dficulties are many.The opportunities for such children are not easily compared to, say, those enjoyed by the young Boris Johnson.Ian is again indulging himself in victim blaming.UK policy has not set out to create level playing fields for socio-econmic participation. It should, but won#t for as long as #One Nation# English Conservatives like Boris Johnson continue to serve the interests of those of Ian Tinkler#s outlook over those of all. On th of May Ian described intergenerational deprivation as #relevant to Victorian times#.NY pretending ambition alone can help all children born into poverty to escape it Ian is demonstrating Victorian attitudes of his own.

The move is vital to secure a stronger future for the business which is urging politicians to support its drive to produce , hydrogen buses in the next four years.The  staff that remain would be more than a ten-fold increase in the number of employees inherited by the management team when it bought Wrightbus out of administration in October , with hopes to grow the workforce to , by the end of .“When we saved Wrightbus from administration last year, there were only about  employees, and since then we have grown the workforce to ,” said Mr Atwal.“The decision has been taken to trim the workforce to the size we believe we will need to see us through to the end of the year.”The redundancies are a necessary measure given the economic slowdown as a result of the current Coronavirus crisis. However, it has not altered the long-term vision of prosperity for the company.“Throughout the COVID- pandemic, while we furloughed a large section of the workforce, we also kept about  engineers, designers and sales staff working to make sure we can take future orders of buses and work on long-term projects, which will provide security and stability for Wrightbus in the coming years,” said Mr Atwal.The Wrightbus factory has created the world’s first hydrogen-electric double-decker bus, which emits only water and there is a great belief that in the coming years this will see a large number of orders come in.There are already strong sales for the delivery of buses in London and Aberdeen this year, with more cities due to follow suit.Mr Atwal said: “We see the future in zero-emission hydrogen and battery-electric transport and have positioned the business accordingly. Our vision is to have , people working for us by the end of  and we hope to be in a position to re-hire some of those who have been made redundant.“We believe green fuel is the future and will bring a brighter future to Northern Ireland over the coming years.”A consultation will begin with staff on Monday, May , and Wrightbus will be supporting staff throughout the process, eventhis has to be done virtually due to current Government guidelines.

The announcement by management is therefore profoundly regrettable.“Management plans to make redundant  employees and to bring forward a phased-process of reducing agency staffing affecting up to  workers.

Having grown up in the era when the river was dominated by the huge red brick edice of the Braidwater Mill, Rodney points out that its path is more exposed to public view than ever. “When you look back, it was pretty much enclosed space from McNinch Footbridge to Harryville Bridge.  “People had no reason to be in that area unless they were mill workers.“Nowadays we have great views right along this section and I personally feel that there has to be a joined up approach to making full use of this fantastic potential.“With the opening of the retail park it has now opened the area up to everyone and the nature and beauty around the river with wildle such as swans, ducks, otters, kingfishers and other wildle regularly seen on the stretch from Sainsbury’s down to Harryville bridge,” he said. But he acknowledges that not not everyone will see the beauty associated with the area. “There will always be some who will still treat it as a dumping ground and continue to put the wildle and the environment at risk by dumping their refuse into the river. “These people need to be told in no uncertain terms that this will not be lolerated by the local community - we have the ability to impose fines on those who continually flaunt regulations and I would call for such monetary penalties to be used more frequently.”But Rodney beleives the real driving force behind the naural rejuvenation of the area must comes as a united push.“ I feel that the authorities responsible for this area and the retail park owner have to take seriously the issues associated with this stretch of water and listen to the concerns of the community groups and members of the public who regularly use the pathways around the river for daily exercise.“My opinion is that things weren’t thought through properly at the outset and the environmental issues weren’t taken into account when the retail park was being planned. “The aim now should be to preserve the beauty of this stretch of the river Braid and that means taking steps to make sure this happens.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3138061.jpg--.jpg?1590480464000\n","title":"opinion moral necessity to support local business in post virus world","story":"By the Very Rev Dr Norman Hamilton OBEThese last weeks have seen contrasting trends as we battle with coronavirus. On the one hand we have come together in our communityto clap for carers on a Thursday evening, and to make ‘scrubs’ for those in the front line of care in the NHS and in care homes. But with most of our local shops, family businesses and services closed, we have also looked to multinational companies and the big supermarket chains to provide us with what we need . They have done much for which we must be genuinely grateful – perhaps best shown in the huge effort to deliver groceries to homes where people are vulnerable. And many companies have prospered. For example in mid April, Jeff Bezos who is the founder and boss of Amazon, saw his personal wealth swell by pound billionafter soaring demand for online shopping sent the firms share price to a new high. This cemented his position as the worlds richest man with a fortune of well over pound billion. As they say – it is an ill wind that blows no one any good. PATTERNSThese changed patterns of le – evident community spirit and massively increased internet shopping – will bring big moral dilemmas when the pandemic is under control and some degree of normality s. Will community spirit be relegated to the back benches by the need for so many of us to rebuild the patterns of our own everyday lives  And crucially, will we have become so content with buying on-line and having the parcel delivered to our front door, that we will be less committed to buying locally, and supporting local business  I must confess to having real fears on both questions. When the focus moves away from carers and the NHS, what community need will fill the gap  It is very dficult to think of an example which affects every one of us, and to which we can bring such loyalty. And will the obvious convenience of having that parcel delivered to our front door be set aside to go shopping locally on a cold November morning or a wet February afternoon Personally I feel that it is a moral necessity to support our local businesses and shops as best we can – evenit costs a little more to do so. They of course will be well aware of the threat from the big international companies, and must play their part in quality of service and show the ‘personal touch’ that will make it attractive to do business with them in its own right.

Paul StaffordThere#s no doubt the salon is going to look and feel dferent. It will be a completely new experience, said Mr Stafford.What people probably don#t fully appreciate until now is the fact that hairdressing is not a service, it#s an experience and there#s a social connection there, a bond and friendships, and some of that might be lost when we reopen. He believes masks, gloves, a reduced menu and longer opening hours will all be part of our new normal.According to the National Hair and Beauty Federation, there are some , hairdressing salons here employing around , staff and generating around £m annually. This does not include self-employed mobile stylists.Our industry in Northern Ireland is up there with the best in world. I#m very proud with the levels of artistry here and what we need now is the whole industry to come together and make sure that we follow the right procedures and aren#t left threatened by people who challenge our businesses by doing things illegally, added Mr Stafford.We are quite efficient and work on a tight schedule but under new guidelines there will be literally no waiting time. It will be a case of making sure clients come in on time and are taken straight through, using an efficient system.At the outset we, personally, will be expanding hours, swapping our normal eight-hour day to  or  hours with staff working shts. That could see us opening from .am and closing at pm.We have a -seater salon and we will be reducing that to four compartments with visors and enough space between.Read More Belfast#s Crossen Engineering sees demand surge for new PPE visorPreparing for such scenarios at beauty-based salons here is manufacturer Crossen Engineering, which is already making visors for the NHS.It is starting to increase its lines to accommodate hair and beauty businesses in the run-up to reopening.We are beginning to see other industries order visors for when they reopen. Places like hospitality establishments, hairdressers and beauty salons, said managing director Paul Crossen.This is all hypothetical and all we can do is plan for every scenario, Mr Stafford is quick to point out.It#s not as simple as ticking all the boxes, this has to be put into practice and it could be a case that it#s just not working, it#s not efficient and that will be problematic.I have spoken to friends in Italy and Germany where there are restrictions and guidelines, but no one is monitoring them. The worst thing that could happen is another spike in October, so I would advise clients now to sit tight. Hair is very important but there is a bigger issue out there. Paul StaffordYes, your hair might look bad and I#ll tell youit looks bad, but stick a hat on, put your hair up, go for a walk and wait until it#s ready. To keep his clients# spirits up during lockdown, Mr Stafford has created a series of #The Virtual Chair# chats with local personalities on his Instagram page.It#s me having conversations with people like Colin Davidson, author Oliver Jeffers, musician Mickey Bradley from The Undertones and broadcaster Pamela Ballantine, he explained. They#re typical of the conversations we would haveI was cutting their hair, and that has brought a great community back together. We#ve had a bit of fun and it shows people that this is what they#re missing. It keeps the brand out there and lets our customers know we are there for them and we#re getting more and more people tuning in.We understand that hair is very important but there is a bigger issue out there this virus is killing people and there have been around  needless deaths here. At our salon no one has been left untouched by it, but we should come through this pandemic in a way that shows empathy.We have been indirectly impacted at the salon and we would like to do this in a respectful way that is safe for everyone.

It may just be as good as two metres.If you then look at putting in additional guards such as face masks or a face shield, or even Perspex between workers, all these things could really help out and allow us to use the one-metre rule.We should talk about it and have things in place but I think until we have the evidence that one way is better than the other, we don#t want to go back to what it was like beforehand because we know that that was bad.

Work to prepare the building as an NHS storage facility has been carried out at cost or discounted rates by HJ Martin, CBRE, AL Goodbody, AEM, G Environmental, Thornton Roofing, JP Corry and Ballymoney Scaffolding.Nugent Hall was previously used, along with the King#s Hall, to host the Balmoral Show and other trade events, and over the years was a standalone venue for a number of legendary concerts by bands such as AC DC, The Prodigy, Ozzy Osbourne, Blondie and Aerosmith.It has lain vacant since it was vacated in  by owner The Royal Ulster Agricultural Society, which has since moved to the former Maze site.Benmore Octopus has started construction on another part of the site of the King#s Hall Health and Wellbeing Park.It is to become home to a range of healthcare providers, elderly and assisted living accommodation, and as a base for a range of precision medicine companies. HJ Martin is in the process of building Dataworks, a new precision medicine hub designed to attract data-focused medical companies to a secure and collaborative space. Local firm Diaceutics, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, has already signed up as an anchor tenant for , square feet of space and others are expected to follow suit.David Burrows, director at Benmore Octopus, said: We are delighted to be able to offer a storage facility to the NHS for such vital equipment in the fight against coronavirus.Over the years the King#s Hall complex has played its part in times of national crisis, lending itself as an assembly point for aircraft and as a shelter for soldiers during World War II. We, along with our partners from CBRE and HJ Martin, felt it was only right that we follow in that tradition by offering the Nugent Hall to the NHS so that we can play our part in this national effort.Benmore Octopus is a joint venture between Benmore Group and Octopus Real Estate.Benmore Group is an award-winning Northern Ireland-based investment and development business specialising in urban regeneration projects across all the ious property sectors.Octopus Real Estate, part of the Octopus Group, is a leading UK specialist real estate lender and investor with £. billion funds under management.

Archbishop Eamon Martin said it is sad and disappointing that the Covid- restrictions have lasted throughout the Easter season and congregations are still unable to gather physically. In a Pentecost message to clergy, the archbishop said everyone has been making great sacrices to protect health and le and to support the common good.He said: We miss meeting up as a parish community. Thankfully our sacrices are bearing fruit and the number of deaths and ICU admissions from Covid- is continuing to decline.I want to thank you for the work you are doing at local level to plan for the full reopening of parish le and worship.The Primate of All Ireland also thanked those who responded to his call for ideas to help draft a national framework document to maximise consistency across the dioceses and parishes of Ireland. The framework document will offer guidance on a number of important liturgical issues such as the distribution and reception of Holy Communion advice for concelebrants, deacons, altar servers best practice for extraordinary ministers of the Eucharist and others who assist at Mass. At the forthcoming Episcopal Conference meeting in early June the Bishops will consider extending the current suspension of the Sunday obligation, the sign of peace and use of holy water fonts. They will also discuss the celebration of baptism, marriage and the sacrament of reconciliation in the context of any ongoing restrictions.Meanwhile, two Newtownabbey churches have requested permission from the local borough council to hold drive-in services at leisure centre car parks on Sundays.Trinity Reformed Presbyterian Church is seeking the use of the theatre car park at either Mossley Mill or Ballyearl Leisure Centre, while Abbots Cross Congregational wishes to use the car park at the Valley Leisure Centre following the relaxation of Covid- lockdown rules here permitting drive-in church services.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_e-ca-ade-bc-ceece_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_e-ca-ade-bc-ceece_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_e-ca-ade-bc-ceece_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_e-ca-ade-bc-ceece_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_e-ca-ade-bc-ceece_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandReflective space set aside in Belfast church to remember virus victimsA church close to one of Belfast’s largest hospitals has created a space to remember those who have died with the coronavirus.Most ReadBBC Radio Ulster#s Nuala McKeever #saying nothing# after Dominic Cummings on-air gaffeCoronavirus: What is the future for hairdressing salons when lockdown eases in Northern Ireland  Stylist Paul Stafford ready for new way of doing things when doors reopenCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No Covid- deaths in  hours #clear sign of progress,# says health ministerWhy Derry Girls actress was in tears after Channel  staff saw her working in pub at Christmas partyLong lost family: How two foundlings, one left in Belfast, the other in Dundalk, discovered they were siblings,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It nearly sounds like a dream or a fairy tale, but it was neither. It actually happened. Two very dferent people coming together and as a result, we not only got to know each other, but amazingly, we got to like each other.Kenny Donaldson from Innocent Victims United challenged the Presbyterian Church to confirm whether or not Rev Latimer#s comments were reflective of its own policy.Mr Donaldson said he has received dozens of calls from members, including many from the Presbyterian Church, who were absolutely aghast and hurt.Rev Latimer said last night: I#m not sure those who want to point the finger at me for participating in this video tribute ever had any opportunity to talk with Martin McGuinness.As Christians maybe we have to appreciate that when we look into the Bible and read about the characters there, none of them were perfect but none of them were rejected.He added: I saw this as an opportunity to share aspects about Martin that some people don#t want to recognise, appreciate or accept. As a Christian minister I thank God for the opportunity to come to Derry Londonderry and I believe there was a plan for Martin and me to get to know each other.A spokesperson for the Presbyterian Church added: Dr Latimer is one of many retired ministers in the Presbyterian Church and his views on these issues are well known and are his own.Belfast Most ReadBBC Radio Ulster#s Nuala McKeever #saying nothing# after Dominic Cummings on-air gaffeCoronavirus: What is the future for hairdressing salons when lockdown eases in Northern Ireland  Stylist Paul Stafford ready for new way of doing things when doors reopenCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No Covid- deaths in  hours #clear sign of progress,# says health ministerWhy Derry Girls actress was in tears after Channel  staff saw her working in pub at Christmas partyLong lost family: How two foundlings, one left in Belfast, the other in Dundalk, discovered they were siblings,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There is always something  to strum their inner desire. When the euphoria subsides, satisfaction seeps in and before you know it, the mind starts to wander to the next target. In the case of World Record breaking father and son duo Tommy and Eoin Hughes, they are the perfect example. When the next Guinness Book of Records peels off the press, their time of four hours,  minutes and  seconds from last Octobers Frankfurt marathon will have etched their names into the realms of greatness. But they are not content with their lot, they are focussed on smashing it again, this time with a result that will warn off any would-be challengers. googletag.cmd.push By the time Tommy joined last Wednesday mornings zoom meeting he had his customary early morning -mile run done. Eoin has already been plotting how to put his learning from Frankfurt into another drive for the line. And, during a relaxed -minute chat, the words improve and achieve cropped up a combined total of  times. Welcome to the mindset of a winner. Michael McMullan: Tommy, I was talking to Eoin earlier about having your record officially announced and the long wait for it to be made official. Tommy Hughes: I left it all with Eoin to sort out, so I was happy enough to take a back seat and I am over the moon that this has been made official and it will be in the Guinness Book of World Records next year...its really good. googletag.cmd.push M McM: After all you have achieved in your career, where does this one sit  TH: It tops them all. Any other things I have achieved, I have achieved on my own. This is a father and son, it is above anything I have ever done. This is far better than going to the Olympics in . It is some achievement, something I never thought would ever happen or take place. M McM: Eoin, you started running later in your career, so when did you decide were going to go for this  Eoin Hughes: It was a podcast that mentioned a father and son combined , so I looked into it. I knew my Da was a decent runner and I thought we could do that … and this was before I had even ran a step. M McM: I notice you said decent... EH:I knew my Da could run : and at that time it was : or : for the combined time, so it gave me a three hour mark and felt I couldve done that back then, we wouldve broken it. But, it wasnt until I started running that I thought this isnt that easy so ithas always been in the back of mind, so when I started improving and my Da came back into running, it came back to the forefront and it was something we should aim for and should be able to beat. M McM: Was it your motivation for starting running  EH: Not to start off, but when I did, it was the factor then...to improve and try for it. M McM: What about you Tommy, did you think he was mad  TH: I definitely thought it was within our grasp and I think I cant improve. I am going over the hill and down the hill a bit. Eoin has got a lot to improve, so we can improve on the record again. If Londontakes place in October, we have a good chance of lowering it and getting a far better time, that not many people can reach for a while – to set it beyond anybody  coming along. M McM:Competition is a magical thing, isnt it  TH: Of course, I live on competition. M McM: Going back Tommy, where did running start for you  TH: I got married and moved from Lavey into Maghera and joined the local GAA cluband I had a bit of weight on and my brother in lawwas doing a bit of running for Magherafelt AC. I went out for a run with him and it ended up, as usual, a bit of a competition and I kinda beat him and thought Ill do a bit more here and I realised I was better at the running than the Gaelic football, so I dropped it and kept on improving at the running. Everything just drove from there, I got my breaks and I got obsessed with improving...like everyone does, they want to get better and it went from there. M McM: What age were you when you started the running  TH: I was  or  and I ran my first marathon when I was , in , and everything flowed into each other. That was the Derry marathon, I went back to Derry and a year later and won it again with a course record, so everything fell into place. M McM: Once you have that competitive edge, is it a constant numbers game where you are trying to beat targets  TH: You are just trying to improve all the time. I am doing that at my age, I am still trying to figure it all out and eke out any wee small things I can get a bit quicker on, but I know the older I get, the slower I get so it is a bit tougher at my age. I need more rest and at a younger age, you dont really need as much. I enjoy it, thats the main thing. If you dont enjoy it, you will just give it up. M McM: Eoin, what are your recollections of all of this  When did you realise what was happening  EH: Whenever I was younger, I can remember going to races all around the place, the whole family would be going to local races. I can remember the Belfast marathon, I knew my Da was good and that he was winning a lot of the races that we went to. He went to the Olympics, but it was not until I started running that I realised how good he was. My times are quick enough, but his times are still miles away from where I am at now. I would be rated as a decent runner now, but he was still miles ahead, sure he still takes half the young boys at races now. M McM: What age would you have been when your Da was at the Olympics  EH: I wouldve been seven, we were all at home and one thing I do remember is in the local town, there were these fridge magnets and one of them said Rock on Tommy that is one thing I will always remember. I remember watching on television, but we didnt see him because he wasnt up there going for the gold medal. M McM: Tommy, from your point of view, was it surreal being at the Olympics  TH: The problem was that I got a stress fracture on my foot at the end of January and the doctor told me I wouldnt be able to recover in time. I was on crutches for six weeks for rehabilitation, but I got there. I was glad to be there and soaking up the whole atmosphere of being there. I wanted to make sure I finished the marathon on the day and have something I will remember for the rest of my le. But, I wasnt at my peak performance and was below power. If thathadnt happened, I wouldve been up there, that is one of these things. M McM: There is nothing you can do at that point, with all that preparation there has to be frustration. TH: The doctor told me I wasnt going to be there, but I was glad to be there to run in the Olympics and be an Olympian. M McM: Running had got serious a long time before that for you. When did you really start to get into it  TH: Whenever I got good at running, thats when it got serious. I have always loved sports and to find out I was good at one sport, that was it...that was serious, I put everything into the one basket. M McM: What did the training schedule look like then  TH: It was seven days a week and twice a day. Id maybe do fivein the morning and  in the evening, do a bit of hill work, speed work and I was reading running magazines, taking what I could use out of it and try to improve. M McM: Eoin, you started a bit later. When did you really start to get into it  EH: It was probably in the last couple of years, I started to get my times down. I didnt start running until I was , I was doing local races and doing okay. I ran for Northern Ireland a couple of times last year, so it is probably within the last year, I said I am getting half decent here, I am getting better and I am at that stage where knocking on the door of getting Northern Ireland bests. M McM: Is time on your side  EH: Not really, I am . A lot of the athletes would only be finishing by now, whereas I am only starting. Well see. There are a few examples of older athletes starting late and doing very well into their early s, so there is a bit of hope there, but I am no spring chicken. M McM: I suppose you are able to tap into your father for advice on training. EH: I have him there when I need him. Even at the start, when my legs were sore - “Daddy how long are my legs going to be sore for” so from the very basic stuff like that, until now, to training and what I should do. Even before we went to Frankfurt, he said I needed to get the distance into the legs so the body would know how it feels. We went out and did  miles on a nice easy run...having that advice and knowing I have it, is great. I know a lot of people would love to have that. Anytime he is at races, I am sure people are askingwhat they should be doing...I have that any time I want it. M McM: Tommy, in all your years running, what sticks out for you above the rest  TH: Eoin crossing the line in Frankfurt and me asking him did we get it  and him not fit to speak and I am waiting for the answer and him saying yeah, we got it – that was brilliant. M McM: I remember that picture of Eoin gasping and you have your hand on his back... TH: I was asking him. Thats what we set out for and when I passed him I was thinking this is falling apart and how much is Eoin going to slow down and is he going to drop out of the race altogether, so I am going to have to go as hard as I can go now to try to stay within the realms of the record, so the pressure was on. I dont mind the pressure on myself, but I crossed the line and waited for Eoin to come. I will never forget it for the rest of my le, the sensation of waiting around and when he crossed the line, I was elated. M McM: For you Eoin, were you constantly looking at your watch  EH: Dad passed me with about three miles to go. I knew how long was gone and what pace he was doing. I knew what time he was going to run, so in my head I was doing maths of what I needed to do and what I was able to do...I was struggling to get to the line. I knewI ran a seven-minute mile from there to the finish, wed break it. The maths equation gave me the incentive to get to the finish line. M McM: Surely its hard to run, never mind having to count. EH: It was helping me though and taking my mind of the pain I was in. M McM: I remember when you told me about the achievement and about how you were going to beat it, it was the fact you said you would do it easily that jumped out at me. Do you need that as a goal, or is it something you firmly believe  EH: It is something we believe. I should be capable of running  minutes quicker and evenI run five minutes quicker, thats five minutes. I learned a lot from Frankfurt, it was my first go at a marathon and mistakes were made. Give me the next one and I will learn from them. M McM: What sort of mistakes do you mean, was it going too fast too early  EH: One of the biggest mistakes was being dependent on my own drinks. My Da said to me before the race it wasnt a good idea. We were sub elite, so I had all my personal drinks set out on the table. The elite, there was four bottles per table, but sub elite there was maybe a  bottles on a big long table and trying to get your drink, while running fast past it, that was a nightmare. It played on my mind that I missed bottles, so I will not do that again. I need to get more miles in the legs, so it is those things I need to improve on and will. M McM: Do you just colour code your bottle  EH: Some people had long sticks with flags on them to make them stand out, but my bottle was pretty basic. M McM: Is it now a case of waiting for the pandemic to end and seethe London marathon, or any of others will take place  You said that you couldnt focus fully until you got the date. EH: Once we have a certain marathon , we can put a good training block together. At the minute, for me, it is about building back as I had took a bit of time off. I do think now, we will get a marathon this year. Athletics Ireland are allowing groups of four athletes to train together. It gives hope that in two or three weeks time, we will be able to train up here in small groups. Down South, they are allowing bigger events from August, so the likelihood of Dublin going ahead could be a possibility. I think we will get something later on in the year, so it is time to build it up again. M McM: And Tommy, you have your own inidual records to beat. TH: Definitely, I have a km, a half-marathon and a marathon, I have all those to set in the over s , so I will be jumping at anything that comes along. I have broke the km in January, I have ran the World Record for k indoors, which is a bonus because I am not a track runner. I was looking forward to sweeping the board this year and then all thishappened. Whatever comes along at the end of the year, I am going to have to go for it. The marathon is what I want, it is the big one and any year, from here on in, the marathon is the one I am concentrating on, the other distances are a bonus. M McM: What is the marathon time you have in your sights  TH: The world record for over s is :, but I want to run under :. So whatever marathon comes up first, I will be trying to get into it and run it. I want to run a World Record this year and move on to next year and start again. M McM: For the father and son target, which one would you prefer  TH: London. EH: We had planned for London and the way they very the record on the day, that is our plan. That is our first choice... it goes ahead. So, well see what happens. sport@derrypost RELATED - Father and son clinch World Record. More...

There is always something  to strum their inner desire. When the euphoria subsides, satisfaction seeps in and before you know it, the mind starts to wander to the next target. In the case of World Record breaking father and son duo Tommy and Eoin Hughes, they are the perfect example. When the next Guinness Book of Records peels off the press, their time of four hours,  minutes and  seconds from last Octobers Frankfurt marathon will have etched their names into the realms of greatness. But they are not content with their lot, they are focussed on smashing it again, this time with a result that will warn off any would-be challengers. googletag.cmd.push By the time Tommy joined last Wednesday mornings zoom meeting he had his customary early morning -mile run done. Eoin has already been plotting how to put his learning from Frankfurt into another drive for the line. And, during a relaxed -minute chat, the words improve and achieve cropped up a combined total of  times. Welcome to the mindset of a winner. Michael McMullan: Tommy, I was talking to Eoin earlier about having your record officially announced and the long wait for it to be made official. Tommy Hughes: I left it all with Eoin to sort out, so I was happy enough to take a back seat and I am over the moon that this has been made official and it will be in the Guinness Book of World Records next year...its really good. googletag.cmd.push M McM: After all you have achieved in your career, where does this one sit  TH: It tops them all. Any other things I have achieved, I have achieved on my own. This is a father and son, it is above anything I have ever done. This is far better than going to the Olympics in . It is some achievement, something I never thought would ever happen or take place. M McM: Eoin, you started running later in your career, so when did you decide were going to go for this  Eoin Hughes: It was a podcast that mentioned a father and son combined , so I looked into it. I knew my Da was a decent runner and I thought we could do that … and this was before I had even ran a step. M McM: I notice you said decent... EH:I knew my Da could run : and at that time it was : or : for the combined time, so it gave me a three hour mark and felt I couldve done that back then, we wouldve broken it. But, it wasnt until I started running that I thought this isnt that easy so ithas always been in the back of mind, so when I started improving and my Da came back into running, it came back to the forefront and it was something we should aim for and should be able to beat. M McM: Was it your motivation for starting running  EH: Not to start off, but when I did, it was the factor then...to improve and try for it. M McM: What about you Tommy, did you think he was mad  TH: I definitely thought it was within our grasp and I think I cant improve. I am going over the hill and down the hill a bit. Eoin has got a lot to improve, so we can improve on the record again. If Londontakes place in October, we have a good chance of lowering it and getting a far better time, that not many people can reach for a while – to set it beyond anybody  coming along. M McM:Competition is a magical thing, isnt it  TH: Of course, I live on competition. M McM: Going back Tommy, where did running start for you  TH: I got married and moved from Lavey into Maghera and joined the local GAA cluband I had a bit of weight on and my brother in lawwas doing a bit of running for Magherafelt AC. I went out for a run with him and it ended up, as usual, a bit of a competition and I kinda beat him and thought Ill do a bit more here and I realised I was better at the running than the Gaelic football, so I dropped it and kept on improving at the running. Everything just drove from there, I got my breaks and I got obsessed with improving...like everyone does, they want to get better and it went from there. M McM: What age were you when you started the running  TH: I was  or  and I ran my first marathon when I was , in , and everything flowed into each other. That was the Derry marathon, I went back to Derry and a year later and won it again with a course record, so everything fell into place. M McM: Once you have that competitive edge, is it a constant numbers game where you are trying to beat targets  TH: You are just trying to improve all the time. I am doing that at my age, I am still trying to figure it all out and eke out any wee small things I can get a bit quicker on, but I know the older I get, the slower I get so it is a bit tougher at my age. I need more rest and at a younger age, you dont really need as much. I enjoy it, thats the main thing. If you dont enjoy it, you will just give it up. M McM: Eoin, what are your recollections of all of this  When did you realise what was happening  EH: Whenever I was younger, I can remember going to races all around the place, the whole family would be going to local races. I can remember the Belfast marathon, I knew my Da was good and that he was winning a lot of the races that we went to. He went to the Olympics, but it was not until I started running that I realised how good he was. My times are quick enough, but his times are still miles away from where I am at now. I would be rated as a decent runner now, but he was still miles ahead, sure he still takes half the young boys at races now. M McM: What age would you have been when your Da was at the Olympics  EH: I wouldve been seven, we were all at home and one thing I do remember is in the local town, there were these fridge magnets and one of them said Rock on Tommy that is one thing I will always remember. I remember watching on television, but we didnt see him because he wasnt up there going for the gold medal. M McM: Tommy, from your point of view, was it surreal being at the Olympics  TH: The problem was that I got a stress fracture on my foot at the end of January and the doctor told me I wouldnt be able to recover in time. I was on crutches for six weeks for rehabilitation, but I got there. I was glad to be there and soaking up the whole atmosphere of being there. I wanted to make sure I finished the marathon on the day and have something I will remember for the rest of my le. But, I wasnt at my peak performance and was below power.

The virtual race around the world challenge will see the club travel across the globe with the miles logged by members each week. Like most things in the current climate, the challenge is virtual and is carried out in accordance with current guidelines and regulations. Nevertheless, it has provided a great opportunity for the Harriers to connect, have a common goal and log some eco-friendly air miles. The club challenge has seen Harriers collectively run a total of  miles. This has seen the club cross Europe, Asia and beyond. Currently we are navigating our way through Oceania, as we run along the Southern coastline of Australia from Perth to Sydney. googletag.cmd.push Club chairperson Maureen Mallon commented, “No one ever expected this year to be so strange, scary and stressful. To keep the running community’s spirit up, the virtual running round the world is, in my opinion, the best way to try and keep members motivated. The best part of it is that it doesn’t matter who does what miles, speed, or how the miles are done it’s about members getting out. We all know the benefits of exercise both physically and mentally and it’s good to have something to focus on. No one knows when we will get back to group training or racing so for now it’s about supporting each other and working towards our virtual goal.” googletag.cmd.push Soon the club will head to New Zealand and then on to South America. From the start of the challenge around  members have participated. For some members, the break from racing has provided the perfect time to build a solid training base for future races. Whereas for others, the priority is to get out and get some fresh air. Nevertheless, the club is connected by this common goal. Joe Curry’s Marathon fundraiser Spring time marathons, for many, are the climax of months of hard graft and training. Unfortunately, events such as the London and Belfast marathons have not taken place this year. However, Joe Curry made sure his winter training would not be wasted. Back in April, the Cookstown man ran the landmark distance of . miles in his back garden! Joe ran  laps of his garden to raise funds for The Intensive Care Society. To date he has raised nearly pound. Joe paid tribute to NHS staff, saying his past marathon and ultramarathon exploits would be easy in comparison to the challenges of frontline workers. Mental Health Week The club was proud to support mental health week. It’s no understatement to say that for many, running provides an opportunity to escape le’s problems. The exercise and club comradery is a great setting for members to help boost their mental health. The club’s welfare officer, Briege McCann reaffirms the club’s position to support the mental well being of the club’s members. She said, “Mental Health week is a great opportunity to pause and reflect, not just to look after ourselves, but all around. Sperrin Harriers is much more than just a running club, but a community where each member is highly valued.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Last week Deputy First Minister Michelle ONeill announced that the Magee Medical School had been agreed and that students would start next September. Days later Economy Minister Diane Dodds said signicant work is required and questioned Ulster Universitys financial stability. She added that further reports would be submitted to the Executive.

It is very important that we keep the pressure on to ensure the Magee Medical School opens in September . “I emphasised this in my speech in the Northern Ireland Assembly this evening, in which I complained about the lack of transparency over the progress on the Medical School and compared this to the confusion over the plans for Northern Ireland after the end of the Brexit transition period.” In part of that speech, she said: “I met – virtually of course – yesterday with senior representatives of Ulster University. I left the meeting with the sense that they were as in the dark about what happens now regarding progressing the business case for the Medical School as we in Northern Ireland are about the new customs arrangements after Brexit. googletag.cmd.push “We need to know what is going on. We need greater transparency. That applies to the British government’s plans for Brexit, and also to the plans of our own government – the Executive and its senior officials – when it comes to the Magee Medical School.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Last week Deputy First Minister Michelle ONeill announced that the Magee Medical School had been agreed and that students would start next September. Days later Economy Minister Diane Dodds said signicant work is required and questioned Ulster Universitys financial stability. She added that further reports would be submitted to the Executive. Seeking clarity on the matter, Sinead McLaughlin said: “I have today submitted a written question asking health minister Robin Swannhe will publish his department’s own internal business case for the Magee Medical School. We need greater transparency. googletag.cmd.push “While I very strongly welcome the progress made recently with regard to the Magee Medical School, we also have to impose sunlight on the process to learn where the blockages are. It is very important that we keep the pressure on to ensure the Magee Medical School opens in September . “I emphasised this in my speech in the Northern Ireland Assembly this evening, in which I complained about the lack of transparency over the progress on the Medical School and compared this to the confusion over the plans for Northern Ireland after the end of the Brexit transition period.” In part of that speech, she said: “I met – virtually of course – yesterday with senior representatives of Ulster University. I left the meeting with the sense that they were as in the dark about what happens now regarding progressing the business case for the Medical School as we in Northern Ireland are about the new customs arrangements after Brexit. googletag.cmd.push “We need to know what is going on. We need greater transparency. That applies to the British government’s plans for Brexit, and also to the plans of our own government – the Executive and its senior officials – when it comes to the Magee Medical School.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Last week, his father Sean Johnston and mother Karen Doherty were overjoyed to celebrate their son’s first birthday at home in Derry. Midway through Karen’s pregnancy it was discovered that her unborn baby had Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia or CDH for short. It is a rare potentially fatal abnormality which occurs in approximately  in , births and accounts for around % of all major congenital abnormalities. In these uncommon cases, unborn babies develop a hole in their diaphragm, the thin sheet of muscle separating the chest from the abdomen, which can allow the stomach, liver or bowels to move up through the gap into the chest cavity, squashing the lungs and, in the worst cases, leaving them too underdeveloped to allow breathing after birth. googletag.cmd.push The past year has been challenging, a journey of ups and downs as Milo recovered from a le-saving operation and overcame bronchitis on several occasions. While researching and doing everything to ensure their unborn child had the best possible chance of survival, the couple also had to devote time to care for their other much-loved boys Ethanand Jake . Milo’s condition was first detected at Karen’s -week scan when they were told that his stomach had been pushed up to his chest cavity and his heart was on the wrong side. A consultant was able to diagnose CDH but it still had to be confirmed by a specialist at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast. googletag.cmd.push The couple were given news that no expecting parent wants to hear, that their unborn child had a % chance of survival. It came as a hammer blow and that day was a complete blur. Sean said: “We were in shock, you just don’t know what to do. We wanted to know what happens next.” Making it to full-term was far from certain. Travelling to Belfast for scans became the norm but they remained positive. At  weeks a lung-to-head ratio was measured to determine a prognosis. There hopes were diminished. Karen was admitted to hospital early, May . The baby’s due date was May  but leaving it any later would have worsened his chances of survival. Milo would need an intensive care bed immediately after he was born, there were none available at time of admission which raised concerns that Karen may have to be transferred to a hospital in Dublin or even England. Fortunately, a bed was free just in time. Sean explained: “Doctors said that when he is born he will be the sickest child in Northern Ireland at that time until we get him stabilised. “They don’t know what complications are there until he’s born, does his heart work,he can breathe orhe can’t oranything  works. “They didn’t want Milo to cry when he came out because that allows air into his lungs, which puts more compression on them and is more damaging, but he did.” AMAZING STAFF  A ventilator was set-up and numerous doctors awaited his arrival. The couple paid tribute to all staff but in particular consultant paediatrician, Dr Sweet, who was ‘amazing’. “He kept us positive and assured us he’d do everything in his power to keep him here, ‘as long as he’s willing to help me he’ll survive’,” Sean said. “He couldn’t make any promises but said, ‘as long as he’s strong enough I’m not going to give up on him no matter how long he stays here with us’.” As the senior consultant on call that day, Dr Sweet delivered the baby at .pm. The baby was immediately whisked away to be placed in an incubator and ventilator and they didn’t see him again until pm that night. “It was the longest time of our lives,” Sean recalled. “You keep checking to seethere’s any word back. We heard back once in that time that they were still trying to stabilise him. “We were taken to see him while he was hooked up to a ventilator with lines in his ankles, in his bellybutton, on his wrists. He was on mountains of medication for his heart, blood pressure, fentanyl for pain relief amongst other things.” BAPTISM  The baby’s grandparents got a chance to see him and they were driving home to Derry when Karen and Sean were told that he may not make it through the night. A baptism was quickly arranged and their parents were phoned to come back for the service. Names had been discussed, Milo being shortlisted. But asit was a sign from God, a Belfast priest called Father Milo performed the service, their minds were made up. A short time later doctors told them Milo wasn’t reacting to the treatment and there was nothing more they could do for him. Karen and Sean stayed by his side through the night. When morning came Dr Sweet started his sht and vowed to do all he could. Treatments were adjusted and the couple were told to take short period of respite with the assurance that the baby would be kept aliveanything went wrong. Around  minutes later they were greeted with words they longed to hear, ‘good news’. Milo was stable, he was off adrenaline and steroids, and his ventilation had been changed. However, a le-saving surgery was still needed to close the hole in his diaphragm during which he lost a lot of blood and required a transfusion. It was discovered that all of his organs except his liver had moved into the chest cavity,the liver had then Milo would’ve died. He kept fighting post-surgery and showed signs of improvement. SPECIAL  Peace of mind was restored on that fateful day. To the astonishment, and delight of his parents, Milo was discharged from hospital at age  and a half weeks. A setback came ten days later when he was readmitted to the Royal Victoria Hospital with a potentially fatal bowel obstruction where he spent a further two weeks. Back home in Derry Milo remained susceptible to infection and has been in and out of Altnagelvin with bronchitis. It has not been plain sailing but they have watched their baby make gradual improvements and are filled with hope about the future. Doctors have been stunned at his level of progression. The charity CDH UK has also been a great support to the family throughout. The emergence of Coronavirus means that Milo has to be isolated and protected at home but thankfully there are no concerns at the moment. May  was the pinnacle of a tough year, a beautul moment for all the family as Milo reached his first birthday, a milestone that seemed unreachable just twelve months ago. “This was a massive moment for us,” Sean said, “knowing everything we’ve been through to get there. “We thought back to the same time last year when he was in intensive care and what he’s overcome - it made it all the more special.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

South Derry film fans’ closest venues under the initial plan would have been Derry city, Portrush and Antrim, but plans are currently underway to bring the tour to Cookstown and Dungannon. Conor Moran, from The Big Drive Inn, told the County Derry Post that they hope to show four dferent screenings per day. He said: “We use an LED screen and the brightness is a lot sharper than a projector. Our movies can run from  o’clock in the day til  o’clock at night. googletag.cmd.push “In the afternoon, at pm and pm, we will be showing more family-orientated films. At pm, we’ll show a classic film and at pm a blockbuster. “The plan is to do this as a tour of Northern Ireland and keep it going as long as Covid- lasts.” The company had already begun to tour in the Republic of Ireland before it was placed into lockdown, with shows in Dundalk and Cavan, and are now resuming plans to move north. In keeping with strict hygiene guidelines, the organisers say they will be taking all necessary precautions and implementing social distancing. “We encourage arriving in, staying in and leaving in your car so it’s complete family isolation,” said Conor. googletag.cmd.push “Toilets will be provided, we provide portaloos. Your temperature is taken on entering the toilet by an automated temperature taker. “If your temperature is too high you wouldn’t be able to enter the toilet. All toilets are sanitised and there is state-of-the-art technology checking temperatures. “All toilets are sanitised after each use. There will be sanitisers on site as well and we’ll be encouraging people to sanitise. “We have a host of other processes in place to protect against Covid-. All transactions are cashless, so you buy your ticket online. “We won’t be offering any food yet, until the lockdown eases. If that’s during the tour, we’ll look at doing some food, but for the first few events, we’ll be encouraging people to bring their own. “All our staff members have undergone safety training to ensure we promote and enforce a safe event for all.” If the tour proves to be a success, the organisers have said they may look at continuing the service after the Covid- restrictions have been eased. “We hope to continue with it after the lockdown. It will be almost a funfair operation, staying in each venue for two days. “All of our screens are on trailers and we have four smaller trailers that are shown throughout the car park.” Conor does not foresee any issues in having to enforce social distancing but have insisted that they have a security team in place to deal with those who aren’t complying. “We did it just before the lockdown in the south and to be honest, people don’t want to leave their cars,” he said. “We had hundreds of cars and had no hassle. People are excited to see the film. If they do, we’ll ask them to leave the car park and we have staff in place for that.” More details can be found on the Big Drive-Inn Facebook page.

On Monday, five of Derry City  Strabane District Council’s  household recycling centres reopened after being closed for a period as a result of the COVID- emergency legislation. Long queues formed outside the centres before they opened as people who were in lockdown attempted to dump and recycle materials that had accumulated. Derry’s centres do not charge people to get rid of their waste. In Donegal people must pay for some items at recycling centres while others are free.  googletag.cmd.push At the most recent meeting of the council, DUP Alderman Maurice Devenney said the use of the dumps by people from Donegal was a quite serious problem which needed to be examined. Alderman Devenney said that given the costs being faced by the local council as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, they should not be footing the bill for people from a dferent jurisdiction to get rid of their rubbish. He suggested that when the dumps are re-opened the council should look at new measures to prevent people from outside the council area using the facilities. Alderman Devenney asked for a report to be prepared in a bid to try and establish how many vehicles with southern registrations are using the local dumps. googletag.cmd.push Addressing the issue of cross border waste, a council spokesperson this week said that it is aware of ‘some cross border waste’ being brought to its recycling centres by members of the public and that its centres are designed to handle the volume of waste which passes through daily. She said: “This issue is reviewed on an ongoing basis with elected members recently requesting a full report on usage that will come before them for review and discussion at the next Environment and Regeneration Committee. “Council acknowledges the fact that there are many instances where users of the amenity sites live outside of the Council area, for example they may own a property within the Council area. “Council continues to remind people from outside of the council area that where possible they should limit travel and should use services and facilities in their own areas.” The Council spokesperson added that they experienced a high volume of users at the sites when they reopened on Monday and encouraged the public to hold off and avail of the services later in the week. Five centres at Pennyburn, Glendermott Road, Strathfoyle, Claudy and Strahan Road in Strabane are all open from am to pm Monday to Friday, am to pm on Saturday, and Sunday opening from  to pm for Pennyburn, Glendermott Road and Strahan Road sites only. The public are reminded that the council’s regular refuse collection service is fully operational throughout this emergency period and that additional support to deal with excess waste has been provided through a bespoke COVID Waste Helpline –    - and a free Bulky Waste Collection Service that can be booked online on the councils website.

Patricia McCallion, who owns her own hair and beauty salon in Waterloo Street, agreed to be stripped of her make-up and lashes to take part in Pretty Single which airs on Monday. The series sees siximage-concious singeltons embrace the natural lookto try and finda love connection that is more than skin deep. Patricia kicks off the showbygoing on five dates with five dferent guys, while her co-starswatch the dates unfold from the comfort of their sofa – providing supportive and humorous commentary throughout. googletag.cmd.push Mum-of-one and self-confessed romantic, Patricia admits she hides her true self behind make-up to boost her confidence. “It’s putting on a mask in the morning, it’s covering the flaws that you don’t like about yourself, she said. People often say to me you look like you workin the beauty industry and I do like to look the part. I have to look at myself in the mirror all day at work so I want to look mybest. Each of the five suitors have been specially matched to Patricia but she could only take one to dinner. The dates were one after the other and then you had to whittle it down to two and decide which one to take on a proper date, explained Patricia. googletag.cmd.push If I was going on a normal dateId have my make-up done because you want to impress, but the funny thing was the fellas didnt even notice we werent wearing make-up. I felt like I was putting myself out there and it was scary, but at the same time I felt like they were getting to know the real me because I was more vulnerable. Patricia remains tight lipped about who she chose for her date, but revealed she was given the option of going bare faced or wearing make-up. I kind of went for a bit of both, she laughed. She is now looking forward to seeing the show for the first time when it airs on Monday. The trailer came on the other night after Eastenders and I was jumping around the room, she admitted. I kept rewinding it to watch again. Narrated by Derry Girls star Saoirse-Monica Jackson, Pretty Single is a Stelly Media production for BBC One Northern Ireland and BBC Scotland. It begins on BBC One Northern Ireland on Monday  May at .pm. All six episodes in the series will be available on BBC iPlayer after the first episode is broadcast.

From skipping to keepy uppys, Hanging Tough to Netball Shootouts, the Faughanvale staff showed their sporting talents and set targets for the children to beat. Being confined to home means that our pupils who are normally immersed in exercise, through school PE, after school activities, organised sport and outdoor play, have had to find a new normal,” commented Vice Principal Ciaran OHare. The Sink the Staff challenge, is the most recent initiative by the staff in what has proved to be a busy few months. Their Music co-ordinator, Miss Moore has captivated the pupils through the creation of the Virtual Choir, releasing new songs each week for the pupils to perform. googletag.cmd.push The PE coordinator, Mrs McKeever has continually promoted a healthy and active lestyle in the build up to a Virtual Sports Day in early June. Moving more and sitting less are key to help our pupils maintain physical and mental health. Launching the Sink The Staff challenge on Mental Health Awareness week, would make that connection stronger,” OHare added. Our staff have been absolutely brilliant and jumped at the opportunity to engage our pupils through exercise challenges. Whilst stepping out of their comfort zone, the staff knew that this would create a great buzz of excitement and lt the spirits of the children. googletag.cmd.push Each day, two  second challenges were posted on the schools social media accounts, encouraging the pupils to take on the mite of the staff and to video their best efforts. The response from the children was incredible and indicative of the amazing support we receive daily from our families. The bond between school and parish has never been stronger,” Ciaran continued. Over the course of the  challenges, the school had in excess of  videos, with each child relishing the opportunity to take on the staff in their school. I hope that amid the gloom of this pandemic, our pupils will look back fondly at the week they took on and proved victorious against the school staff. Restoring a little piece of normality and structure to the lives of the pupils has been so important,” he concluded. The competitive spirit may have been lying dormant within Faughanvale in recent weeks. The Sink the Staff challenge has whet the appetite of our pupils as we look forward to our Virtual Sports Day on June th.

Terence McDowell, principal of St Eithnes Primary School, has also supported calls from church leaders for the  plus transfer test to be scrapped this year because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Education Minister last week said it was his aim to see a phased reopening of schools across the North, starting with limited provisionfor GCSE, A-Level and P pupils this summer. Mr McDowell said he first learnt of the Education Ministersplans from the news and had not been consulted about them. googletag.cmd.push It was the first we heard of it and a lot of questions would need to be answered first, said Mr McDowell. The Minister wasnt very definite about the plans. Mr McDowell said he feels very sorry for his P pupils who face the possible prospect of moving on to post-primary school without the chance to say goodbye. My heart goes out to them, said Mr McDowell.For the other primaries we will eventually get them back and we can make up for the missed time, but for the Ps you can never replace that time. There are so many rites of passage like their school trip that they will never get to do and they will go into post primary without preparation that we would normally give them for what is a such a big change. googletag.cmd.push If the plans go ahead, it will give us some formof contact and offer some closure to both pupils and staff. The P teachers were told they might not see these pupils again with just two days notice. Staff at St Eithnes PS had already created a DVD for P pupils and a certicate to mark the end of their time at the school. Its always sad to see pupils go, but it will beall themore poignant this year, said Mr McDowell. Under Minister Weirs plans, primary schools and post primary schools would reopen with limited provision for key cohort years in August, followed by a phased provision for all pupils at the beginning of September. However, teachers would traditionally be on annual leave during the school summer break in July and August. Teachers have been working really hard preparing online resources and work packs to keep pupils going, said Mr McDowell. We dontknow what the requirementswill be, but I believeit will be  pupils to a classroom. We have almost  in our two P classes so they will need to be split into two rooms and that will require more staff. The physical layout of desks and chairs will need to be considered and the resources they are using. We have already discussed requisitioning inidual resource packs for each child but that will come at an extra expense to the school and Im sure we wontget any extra resources. Mr McDowell said the movement of pupils outside the classrooms would also be a concern. We need to consider how the children will move around the school as the corridors arent very wide. We also need to think about meal times in the canteen, where normally we would have one or two slots to feed the whole school. Toilet breaks will need to be consideredtoo and time given for children to properly wash their hands. This will all be time taken out of teaching time. Keeping the childrentwo metres apart staff and each other would be particularlydficult for younger pupils. Children in P naturally gravitate towards one another, said Mr McDowell. You cant police that, it is going to be impossible. Things happen at school where children fall and hurt themselves and they will need comforted. Do we have to tell a child with a bleeding to chin to wait while we ring their parents  Some children will find the transition to primary school dficult and they might be crying or upset. To not be able to comfort that child goes against the grain of the very reasons that teachers came into this profession. Last week,Bishop of Derry, Donal McKeown sent a letter to Catholic post-primary schools asking for the transfer test to be scrapped this year, a call echoed by Mr McDowell. The transfer test causes much anxiety anyway and our teachers have been unable to prepare children in the normal way this year and working from home just doesnt compare. It is causing much anxiety and we need to consider something to stop that. There isnt a levelplaying field in what parents can provide. They might be working from home, they might have multiple children, they might be looking after an elderly relative. Every household is unique. I am very mindful that parents have been thrust into the role of teachers, they are not professional teachers. Parents shouldnt compare themselves to others. We always tell the children just do your best and thats the same message I would have for parents. They are doing the best they can. Meanwhile, Derry Sinn Fein MLA Karen Mullan, has called for an`education forum comprising of teachers, school leaders, parents, trade unions and public health experts to be convened before schools are allowed to . The deputy chair of the assembly education committee, said the forum, would address huge concern and anxiety at the prospect of an eventualto school. Its my view that anyto school must be done in complete partnership and in conversation with all those involved in education when the time comes, said Ms Mullan. Parents, young people and our teaching staff must have confidence that health and safety is paramount in anyto school. There will be no one size fits all approach for schools in preparing to re-open. There should be an intense period of discussion that will be crucial to understand the flexibilities and the bespoke needs that dferent schools and dferent settings will require.

Yvonne Martin, the Director of Nursing at the hospice, had been due to retire at the end of last month after a -year career. However, instead, Yvonne is staying on at the hospice until the end of June to support her colleagues through the current crisis. This is just another example of our local healthcare workers have gone far beyond the call of duty during the ongoing pandemic. Yvonne has worked at the Foyle Hospice for  years. googletag.cmd.push She was part of the team when the Inpatient Unit at the hospices base at Culmore Road opened. She obtained her nursing qualication as a registered nurse at the Royal Victoria Hospital of Nursing and later studied at Ulster University where she attained a degree in Professional Development leading to a Postgraduate Specialist Practice and an MSc In Palliative care. As part of the Senior Management Team at the local hospice, Yvonne has full responsibility for nursing teams which include the Inpatient Unit, Day Hospice, Community Team and Clinical Services. Her job involves ensuring the smooth day-to-day running of the hospice. googletag.cmd.push Yvonne said: “It has always been an honour and privilege to work in the hospice and be part of the team providing specialist palliative and end of le care to our patients, alongside the provision of much needed support to their families and carers. It can be a very sad, emotional place to work, but we also can have a laugh despite the sadness. Foyle Hospice, as everyone knows, sits in beautul gardens so it is lovely to drive down into the hospice every day, regardless the weather, and to look out at such a lovely setting. The patients always comment on the beautul setting and views we have over the Foyle Bridge. A spokesperson for the hospice described Yvonne as an amazing woman who has been a large part of the hospice for the past  years.

However, concern has been raised about a group of young people who are harassing workers on the site. The construction of the new centre had to be stopped because of the lockdown restrictions. However, work has now recommenced following the easing of some aspects of the restrictions. A spokesperson for Shantallow Community Centre, however, said it was important that the contractors were allowed to get on with the project in peace. Unfortunately they are being harassed by a handful of local young people, the spokesperson said. googletag.cmd.push I am asking all parents and any adults to make a point of walking through the Donkey Field - community centre area when you can - out doing their daily exercise, walking the dog or just to check the site. This centre belongs to you. Don’t let a handful of people spoil it. We cannot risk the contractors having to leave the site again because of a couple of people who are hanging round the Donkey Field and think its a laugh to hassle the builders! googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Council Animal Welfare Officers have been tasked with looking into the alleged incident after a report was made to the PSNI in January of this year. A PSNI spokesperson said: “Police in Mid Ulster received a report regarding cruelty to horses in the Magherafelt area in January . “Under the Welfare of Animals Act, District Councils are responsible for the enforcement of the legislation as it applies to non-farmed animals. “This would therefore include horses. The report was subsequently passed to Council Animal Welfare officers who are currently investigating the matter, the spokesperson added. googletag.cmd.push Mid Ulster District Council confirmed it was aware of the animal welfare complaint and a spokesperson said ‘an investigation is being undertaken into the case’. Images of the alleged incident were published online along with videos that appeared to show a horse with a bloodied mouth and missing front tooth. A further video appeared to show a horse with a rope tied from the fetlock strap over its neck to keep its head in a downward position. Mid Ulster MLA Patsy McGlone called for those responsible to be held to account. He said: “A lot of concern has been expressed to me personally and my party colleagues locally about footage which has appeared on social media. googletag.cmd.push “These allegations of abuse must be rigorously investigated and I have contacted Mid-Ulster Council, Animal Welfare, PSNI and the Minister at DAERA. “Abuse of harmless animals is despicable and those responsible must face heavy sentences for their hateful actions.” Mid Ulster councillor Malachy Quinn, who has been campaigning for an Animal Cruelty Register for Northern Ireland, also condemned alleged footage of the incident. “The pictures and videos that have been shared a quite sickening and disturbing,” he said. “This morning I sent an email to Mid-Ulster Council Chief Executive to seek assurances that it will be dealt with as a matter of urgency. “This time last year I started a campaign to introduce an Animal Cruelty Register, where those convicted of animal abuses would have their name placed on it and it could be accessed by animal charities and police to prevent those people having access to animals again. “Under present law they can easily get animals across the border or over in the UK. The events that have come to light over the weekend only strengthen the call for this register. “The videos and pictures show disgusting abuse of horses and the people who are subjecting them to this should never be allowed to own another animal. “The SDLP will be pushing the DERA Minster Edwin Poots to bring forward legislation to create a register and also the Justice Minister Naomi Long to bring in tougher sentences for Animal Abuse.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

MLA for the area, Emma Sheerin, said that broadband was an essential utility for households. “It is a poor reflection on the state that basic utilities like broadband are still out of reach for some rural dwellers,” she said. “The fact that many of us are still in lockdown has meant that internet, which is already a necessary utility in most households, is even more essential. googletag.cmd.push “For those asked to work from home, for students attempting to complete school or university work, even for the most basic contact with friends and family, internet has been needed. This has exacerbated the frustrations of those for whom broadband is intermittent or non-existent, and anyone who has ever watched that wee wheel of buffering when trying to stream a video will know just how disheartening it is!” poundm of funding has been made available for the enhancement of rural broadband through Project Stratum, with just under , currently eligible for help. Ms Sheerin said it was vital the support was targeted at the premises that are most in need. googletag.cmd.push “Myself and my Sinn Feacutein colleagues reminded the department that there is another reality, namely the disparity that exists within the Up to  Mbps category,” she said. “I asked that homes on the smaller spectrum of speed be prioritised, so we would not see a situation where a house receiving broadband of  Mbps is improved to  Mbps, whilst another home  miles up the road, with a speed of  Mbps, wouldnt receive any help. “It was our fear thatcost efficiency was prioritised over need, those far off, hard to reach homes, would see no intervention, just because it was going to cost more to get to them. A delay to the roll out of the project has seen the number of eligible premises drop as broadband providers continue to improve their provision. “Due to upgrades by broadband providers, the number of homes with less than  Mbps broadband speed has decreasedby ,, from , to ,,” said Ms Sheerin. “I welcome this, but onlyit means that all , homes are helped, particularly those with the worst service to begin with. I have asked the minister that this be prioritised, and that work begins as soon as is possible.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The club normally hosts their annual k road race for the Joe Housten Cup on the June Bank Holiday weekend. But this year’s event was cancelled, and instead, the club is inviting people to check out their Facebook page for more details on their virtual k. Half of the proceeds raised will go to Donegal Hospice. googletag.cmd.push Anyone can take part in our Virtual k, Cora added. We have people entered from all over Donegal, and from Dublin and London too. Its just a bit of fun and its just € to enter.

The tournament was cancelled and when their entry fee was ed, they decided it would be nice to donate it to charity.” The donation will be presented to the hospice, along with money raised in a virtual k fundraiser which Cappry Rovers are running this week.  The club normally hosts their annual k road race for the Joe Housten Cup on the June Bank Holiday weekend. But this year’s event was cancelled, and instead, the club is inviting people to check out their Facebook page for more details on their virtual k. Half of the proceeds raised will go to Donegal Hospice. googletag.cmd.push Anyone can take part in our Virtual k, Cora added. We have people entered from all over Donegal, and from Dublin and London too. Its just a bit of fun and its just € to enter. You can post your time when youre finished and half of the proceeds will go towards our club and the rest to Donegal Hospice. Full details of the fundraiser can be found on the Cappry Rovers Facebook page. The fundraiser started last Friday and will close at pm this coming Saturday, May .

Lavey, once a force in both codes, beat the Lynchs to grab a title at the start of the decade – under current Slaughtneil boss Michael McShane. Before the maroon and white dominance, Swatragh nipped in to take the  title. It was an era when the CCC produced the master-stroke of a graded championship structure to give more Derry teams a better crack at an Ulster title.  – Daryl McDermott Big ball or wee ball, it didnt matter – Sticks, in his laid-back manner was Mr Consistency between the posts. He had razor sharp reflexes and ied puck-out. He had a great eye and safe hand between the posts. He was Derrys keeper for longer than I can remember. Unlucky to have played in the era of Slaughtneil and Kevin Lynchs dominance. googletag.cmd.push  – Paddy Kelly A constant in the Kevin Lynchs defence and even had the versatility to pick up a spot in attack for the  hurling team of the year. He has put in place a legacy that his younger brothers are now following. In last years final with Slaughtneil, he was immense, led by example and wouldve deserved to lt the cup. Quiet and does his talking on the pitch.  – Sean Cassidy Has been a tower of strength in the heart of the Slaughtneil defence since coming out of the minor grade. Has played a wing back and full back. He is strong, commanding and has a extremely long clearance that takes the pressure off his defence - all done with a smile on his face. Tad took his club for to the county scene where John McEvoy appointed him as captain. googletag.cmd.push  – Karl McKaigue Karl is the player that corner forwards just had to see coming. An very skilful hurler coming up through the underage ranks and as he filled out, he combined his hurling with an athleticism that just sets him apart. Like Paddy Kelly in the other corners, he says very little but when he is given a job to do in a game, there are few better. He can also dodge forward to pick off a score.  – Mark Craig Mark captained Derry to U glory in  and he has been a mainstay in the Kevin Lynchs story at senior level since. He has played in the defence and had spells in the attack during the decade as the Lynchs tried a reshuffle to give them a focal point. Histo the county  under John McEvoy has given the young guns an experienced head to led them into inter-county hurling.  – Brian Oacuteg McGilligan Brian Oacuteg has played at full-forward and midfield for Banagher as they tried began to exert an influence over the Lynchs and try to knock Slaughtneil off their perch. He has played at full-back for Derry this season, but he is perhaps at his most influential at centre-back with his presence and positional sense. He has many more years of hurling left.  – Liam Oacuteg Hinphey One of the terric characters of the club scene and has played both codes for Derry over an accomplished career. He is very combative under the dropping ball and has played anywhere across the half-back line and on the end of the square. And this was all during a career that brought a troublesome injury, but he was never found wanting. One of the greats.  - Chrissy McKaigue The most decorated club hurler of a decade. Apart from his spell with the Sydney Swans, he has been named in the team of the year since the County Derry Post began and he was hurler of the year in . He is just a natural and like Cormac ODoherty and Brendan Rogers, would probably grace any team in Ireland. He is ultra-completive and has a skill set to match.  – Gerald Bradley You dont miss anything until its gone. Gerald Bradleys knee injury probably cost Slaughtneil the Ulster title in , such is his natural leap and catch. He is now back to his best and last season excelled in the role of the teams quarter-back, sitting in the pocket to frustrate Dunloy and Ballyhale but was able to spring Slaughtneil into an attacking outfit. His point against Dunloy last year...well, what can say. Awesome.  – Kevin Hinphey Joins Liam Oacuteg as the second set of brothers on the team. A very astute player who could play up front and in defence, where he was named on the hurling team of the year on three occasions. Another terric servant of the Derry county team and he battled back from a serious knee injury to get back playing last season. Like his father did, he has invested a lot of time in the clubs underage who are now coming through to the county team. - Cormac ODoherty He was born to play hurling. Played in goals at underage, in the teams well before his years, with a touch developed playing with his older brothers at home. Once he progressed outfield, in his own age groups, he was destined for greatness. Accurate from frees and play, but it is his awareness that sets him apart. Very smart on the ball and can see pass before the inside forward even calls for the ball. A natural.  – Paddy Henry Paddy landed - in Laveys  win over Kevin Lynchs. It was a year to remember, as he kicked the winner fo his native Castledawson in the intermediate football final. He has been a consistent performer and has been selected on the County Derry Post hurling team of the year on three occasions. He is now sowing the seeds of hurling in the Dawson.  – Brendan Rogers Rogers was named at full-back on the club football team of the decade and with the small ball, he is the assassin in Slaughtneils attack. He is terric in the air, is quick, has power and a terric eye for goal. He took a bursting collection of underage medals into the senior ranks and was arguably the main reason for their early domination at senior level, with an attacking power few could match.  – Seacute McGuigan The Slaughtneil man is a brilliant ball winner and has an eye for goal that has helped the club dominate the club and provincial championship scene. For the guts of five years, he was unmarkable at the edge of the square and it allowed Brendan Rogers to be deployed where. Has a very relaxed demeanour, but knows how to perform when it matters. Named on the Champions team of the season at last years All-Star awards.  - Ruairi ConveryWhen Convery hung up his hurl, Eamonn Hasson commented that you just dont replace men like him. He was pivotal in Swatraghs hurling and football double season in , a fittingfor a man who spearheaded their march up through underage. A huge loss to Derry hurling as well and its a pity Swatragh didnt land an intermediate Ulster before he hung up his hurl. RELATED - Paul McFlynns football team of the decade.HEADLINE – DERRY CLUB HURLING TEAM OF THE DECADEINTRO BOX It was a decade dominated by Kevin Lynchs and Slaughtneil, with the latter going on to dominate Ulster and knock the All-Ireland door with purpose last season.Lavey, once a force in both codes, beat the Lynchs to grab a title at the start of the decade – under current Slaughtneil boss Michael McShane.Before the maroon and white dominance, Swatragh nipped in to take the  title.It was an era when the CCC produced the master-stroke of a graded championship structure to give more Derry teams a better crack at an Ulster title. – Daryl McDermottBig ball or wee ball, it didnt matter – Sticks, in his laid-back manner was Mr Consistency between the posts.He had razor sharp reflexes and ied puck-out.He had a great eye and safe hand between the posts.He was Derrys keeper for longer than I can remember.Unlucky to have played in the era of Slaughtneil and Kevin Lynchs dominance. – Paddy KellyA constant in the Kevin Lynchs defence and even had the versatility to pick up a spot in attack for the  hurling team of the year.He has put in place a legacy that his younger brothers are now following.In last years final with Slaughtneil, he was immense, led by example and wouldve deserved to lt the cup.Quiet and does his talking on the pitch. – Sean CassidyHas been a tower of strength in the heart of the Slaughtneil defence since coming out of the minor grade.Has played a wing back and full back.He is strong, commanding and has a extremely long clearance that takes the pressure off his defence- all done with a smile on his face.Tad took his club for to the county scene where John McEvoy appointed him as captain. – Karl McKaigueKarl is the player that corner forwards just had to see coming.An very skilful hurler coming up through the underage ranks and as he filled out, he combined his hurling with an athleticism that just sets him apart.Like Paddy Kelly in the other corners, he says very little but when he is given a job to do in a game, there are few better.He can also dodge forward to pick off a score. – Mark CraigMark captained Derry to U glory in  and he has been a mainstay in the Kevin Lynchs story at senior level since. He has played in the defence and had spells in the attack during the decade as the Lynchs tried a reshuffle to give them a focal point.Histo the county  under John McEvoy has given the young guns an experienced head to led them into inter-county hurling. – Brian Oacuteg McGilliganBrian Oacuteg has played at full-forward and midfield for Banagher as they tried began to exert an influence over the Lynchs and try to knock Slaughtneil off their perch.He has played at full-back for Derry this season, but he is perhaps at his most influential at centre-back with his presence and positional sense. He has many more years of hurling left.  – Liam Oacuteg HinpheyOne of the terric characters of the club scene and has played both codes for Derry over an accomplished career.He is very combative under the dropping ball and has played anywhere across the half-back line and on the end of the square.

As part of the Marathon Potential  cohort, I attended a two week training camp near Torre-Vieja, Spain, organised jointly by Athletics Northern Ireland and Athletics Ireland.I had the honour of going toe-to-toe with then NI marathon record holder, Paul Pollock, on the track.I also had the opportunity to spend time with Paul off-track, alongside Kevin Seaward, learning from two powerhouses of Irish marathon running and building on the advice we received from Stephen Scullion, in Belfast in early December.Most importantly, I made lasting friendships with my fellow Marathon Potential  athletes. The sense of community allowed me to really embrace the project.Setting a goal of putting two of us on the start line of the  Paris Olympics is very ambitious. As a younger athlete, I always felt like an underdog.This feeling, which I once perceived as a negative, has become one of my chief strengths. The goal of becoming an Olympian, which I have chased mdash still chasing mdash from an early age, has, at times seemed unattainable.However, as time has passed, I have grown to love the chase. I look forward to the next stage on this journey, in the company of the Marathon Potential  athletes and support staff, under the stewardship of my coach and mentor of  years, Richard Rodgers, and the band of local training partners.Our way of le has changed dramatically in the space of four months due to COVID-. I remember reading the news in January and having the unnerving feeling that it would not be the last time that I would do so.When I recorded a : personal best over the half marathon in Barcelona in mid-February, the virus was relatively undocumented in Europe. By mid March, I understood that I would not be racing for a long time.My biggest mdash and somewhat selfish mdash fear was that there would be a blanket ban on exercise. Nonetheless, the sanctions under which we are all living have forced me to reconsider the spirit in which I run.To those friends and family in the health service, who have been tackling the virus over the past six weeks, I am amazed beyond words. Thank you for what you are doing.As a PhD student I do not consider myself a key worker. I decided that I would follow lockdown protocol as strictly as possible to do my part. Double runs mdash two runs a day mdash have always been a staple part of my training, allowing me to hit the high mileage required to prepare for the marathon.Completing the same mileage across the week off one daily training session was initially challenging. However, I eventually adapted after two weeks of attrition. In the process, I learned that I benefit from the extra recovery time between runs. This pleasant surprise helped me come to terms with what seems like a more or less empty race calendar in .Athletes are creatures of habit. We are conditioned to race on a monthly or two-monthly basis. Having the options restricted has enabled me to focus on the process of training without looking too far ahead. It has reminded me that, despite thriving off pushing to my limits in races, I love the journey, equally as much.Yes, it is all about achieving in races, but also, to get there a long time is spent training mdash  years and counting. So we have to love the training too. A consequence of this has been that I have begun to pay attention to the finer details in training.When doing a hard workout, I set high standards for each and every repetition, be it focusing on my running form, my cadence or my composure in a strong headwind. I have been trying out new drills and core routines to break up the days.Beyond training itself, I have found myself looking after my kit better than I may have done in the past. This, strangely enough, has been one of the most fulfilling aspects of my day.Given the recent stint of unusually sunny and warmer April weather, I have been leaving my shoes to dry in the sun after runs. A friend recently told me that this is a standard practice in Japan, harnessing the heat of the sun to kill off microbes.It has become a bit of a ritual for me. My shoes fairly pound the roads, so I guess they deserve some respect for what they allow me to do. Seeing them propped against the wall lts my spirits.I can understand that many of you will be disappointed not to have run the Deep RiverRock Belfast City Marathon, but your chance to do so will come around again in September or the future.Anyone who is brave enough to step on the start line of a marathon is a special type of person, irrespective of fitness.More so those who run to raise money for a cause. It takes courage to do this. Bank that courage and build on it over the coming months. It is directly transferable to enduring the current crisis.I remember passing the -mile mark in the  Dublin Marathon. I was in a world of pain mdash itrsquos worth it when yoursquore on track for : mdash when I passed a sign that read lsquoWhat wall rsquoI knew then that I would be coming back to this distance time and again. Right now, I have to wait. We all have to wait. Runners are resilient. Focus on whatever training you can do right now and enjoy the journey..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20th May 2020 Dundrum.jpg","title":"Dundrum chef stars in Great British Menu final  ","story":"CHEF Alex Greene narrowly missed out on being crowned Champion of Champions at the Great British Menu banquet to honour  years of childrenrsquos literature.The Dundrum man admitted he was ldquogutted at not securing the final accolade for the best dish at the event ndash despite becoming the second chef to have got two dishes through to the final and the only Northern Ireland finalist ever to have done it.He lost out to double Michelin-starred chef Niall Keating whose fish dish was voted the best by the  diners, who included Alexrsquos mother, Glynis, his employer, Michael Deane, and Michaelrsquos we, former UTV presenter Kate Smith.However, he was being feted by local fans and well-wishers after the show came to an end on BBC on Friday night.The highly competitive  year-old wowed judges and guests with his starter and desert dishes - a potato and cheese sauce based dish inspired by CS Lewisrsquo book, The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe and a coconut and chocolate ganache dessert with edible rice pages and covers presented as a book inspired by Oliver Jeffersrsquo book, The Incredible Book Eating Boy.The event was held in early February, so Alex, who started his career off in the Buckrsquos Head restaurant in his home village, has had some time to reflect on his success.ldquoIrsquove been overwhelmed by the response Irsquove had from people on social media itrsquos been just mental, he said.ldquoItrsquos another achievement for me and itrsquos something I wanted to do for a long time. To get one dish is big, to get two dishes to the banquet is major as itrsquos only happened twice before and never for someone from Northern Ireland.ldquoAlthough I think everyone was shocked that I didnrsquot get Champion of Champions. A producer came afterwards to ask me how I felt about it and even Niall didnrsquot think he would get it.ldquoI was gutted to be honest. It couldnrsquot have been any closer and I did feel it after all the hard work I put into it. While I enjoyed the whole experience, I do regret not getting Champion of Champions. To me, not to get the whole thing, particularly after coming so far, was tough and hard to stomach. Itrsquos hard when I know the amount of effort I put in and then to get so close. But I know that I couldnrsquot had done anymore.Alex revealed that he worked seven days a week on perfecting his menu dishes for four months while maintaining his demanding job as chef at the Michelin-starred EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, the fine dining experience of the Michael Deane group, where he has worked for the last three years.ldquoWe started filming last November and I was working in the kitchen at Deanes every day, and even on Sundays when Irsquom normally off. The guys at work and Michael were absolutely amazing with their support as well as the local guys who produced the props for me, said Alex.Viewers saw that all the chefs were up against it at the banquet as they had to do all their own food preparation with the work being doubled for AlexldquoIt was a hard couple of days and it wasnrsquot all fun and games. We had to do all our own prep, there was a delay in starting as guests arrived late due to Storm Ciara and there was a lot of things that went wrong, like the power going off, that wasnrsquot shown, said Alex.ldquoI joked with the other two guys you can just put the effort into one dish and can make sure its absolutely perfect but Irsquove got two to doldquoThe profile of the programme and the scale of the guests and how well known they were made it feel more pressurised.Ten years ago, Alex moved on to Deanes in Belfast after the Bucks Head, where he was working when they first received the Michelin star under Derek Creagh. He later moved to work with Gordon Ramsay at Claridgersquos, followed by Petrus in London, then had a spell in New Zealand before moving closer to home to the Clf House Hotel in Waterford.There are great expectations on what Alex will do next in his career but he doesnrsquot feel that a change will happen so soon considering the impact of the coronavirus lockdown has had on restaurants.ldquoA lot of people have said to me that I should open my own restaurant, but the industry is in dire straits at the moment so itrsquos hard to know what will happen, said Alex. ldquoOf course, I have ideas of what I would like to do, but Michael gives me a  for what I want to do which I appreciate.

He also raised concern that a commitment to pay staff for the days they went on strike last December has not been delivered.In a detailed response mdash issued after last weekrsquos production deadline had passed ndash the South Eastern Trust said while the Covid- outbreak appeared to have reached a plateau within its hospitals, ldquothe incidents and challenges within the care sector continue to increase and the organisation is currently some distance from being able toto business as usual.The statement continues: ldquoWe are now considering a recovery plan for our elective, cancer and all other key services. This will include the services we can safely restore and by when.ldquoThere is also a global supply issue regarding anaesthetic, opioid and other medications.The shortage of these medications, amongst others, will have an impact on what services we can restore and how quickly.ldquoRoyal College guidelines for surgical specialities and endoscopy currently advise risk assessment and only performing very urgent procedures. This is due to the risk to the staff and also the patient attending hospital.ldquoThis is signicantly limiting the level of endoscopy we can carry out at this time. There are no plans to cease the reprocessing and maintenance of the endoscopy equipment in the Downe day procedure unit.The health trust insists that it is required to agree any recovery plan regionally to ensure equitable provision, explaining the bowel screening programme Mr Hazzard refers to has been suspended across Northern Ireland.ldquoOur priority will continue to be the safety of our patients and staff whilst we do this, said the health trust.ldquoThere is an ongoing requirement for additional staffing from across the organisation within the emergency departments at the Ulster and Lagan Valley hospitals which continue to have signicant and rising numbers of patients attending.ldquoBoth EDs have been separated into Covid- and non-Covid- spaces. The safe separation of patients requires the support of more staff, helping to reduce the likelihood of cross infection and facilitates the requirement for social distancing.The health trust says there is also a requirement to separate inpatient wards into Covid- and non-Covid- spaces at the Ulster, Lagan Valley and Downe hospitals which requires the support of more staff.ldquoUnfortunately, the Trust is also experiencing signicant numbers of staff absences at present. The reasons include self-isolation due to symptoms and shielding of vulnerable persons. This includes a high number of staff who work in the day procedure unit in the Downe Hospital, the statement continues.ldquoIn addition, we continue to work with colleagues in primary care, including the independent sector where there is an ongoing high level of pressure as a result of the virus.ldquoIn some cases, our staff have been providing care and support to the nursing and residential homes in the locality where the need is most acute. Supporting our colleagues within the care sector and the most vulnerable in our society is an absolute priority.The health trust insists that a commitment to pay staff travel time between the Downe and Ulster hospitals has not been rescinded and that eligible staff will receive a payment in lieu of travel time.In relation to strike pay, the Trust said Stormont health minister Robin Swann gave a commitment that pay deducted as a result of industrial action would be reinstated, with payments from the Business Services Organisation delayed as a result of Covid-.

These changes are becoming more apparent when extreme weather events increase and sea levels rise.ldquoUsing ground-based survey technology, we can study relatively rapid changes in the movements of beach sands on this site.ldquoResearch to date has shown the once golden beach at the promenade at Newcastle have over the past few decades been pushed down the coast toward Ballykinlar through wave and tidal action.ldquoWith increased storm events we are studying how this may present itself in the near future.Professor Jackson added: ldquoAs well as past and present movements, we are examining future scenarios of how heightened sea levels at the site will alter the coastline dynamics.ldquoWe are using Murlough Bay as a test bed for establishing coastal monitoring protocols for other sites in the region. These protocols will help advise any future science-led coastal management approaches we may adopt for protecting these vulnerable environments.Gina McIntyre, CEO of the Special EU Programmes Body, said the research being carried out will provide invaluable data to help protect Murlough Bay for many years to come.ldquoIt is one of the key environmental protection projects that will lead to better, more sustainable, marine conservation activities across Northern Ireland, Ireland and Western Scotland, she said.Dr Melanie Biausque, who can often be seen surveying the beach at low tide using a quad bike, explained what is done with the collected data.ldquoWe visit the site every month and for the next few years this will help generate a visualisation of surface height changes on the beach, telling us how waves move sand around under dferent wave events, she said.ldquoThese are incorporated in a computer model that should allow us to see how future storms will react with the underlying sandy seabed and beach.Another Ulster University researcher, Dr Edoardo Grottoli, has also been collating information of past changes of the coastal system in Murlough Bay using historical maps, past aerial photography and historical accounts of storm impact.He said: ldquoPast events will show us to better understand how important patterns of change have unfolded through time and how the coastline is evolving to present and future positions.ldquoSociety needs to understand the movement of the coast and the processes that drive the changes in order to protect our marine environment in the longer term..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20th May 2020 Supporters Club.jpg","title":"Supporters’ club members select their favourite Man Utd team  ","story":"LOCAL Manchester United fans have picked their favourite Reds team of the Premier League era.Members of the Downpatrick Manchester United Supportersrsquo Club were asked to pick their favourite players since the start of the Premier League in .They were tasked with selecting a best eleven along with five subs.

Miserably hugging the left touchline of the pitch I was reduced to a state of terror by the piercing yells of ‘I’ll break your f******g legs McCambridge!’ .The truth is that I never possessed the size, speed or basic competitive spirit which would make me proficient in any game.And yet I have achieved one sporting triumph which I will remember with pride for as long as I still possess my memories and ability to reason. A result which defies all logic, which is so freakish that it can only be described as truly astonishing. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...The year was  and the sport was darts . All of the best players in the world of arrows had come to Northern Ireland for the Premier League. In that year, ahead of the Odyssey appearance, the organisers staged a small promotional event at the old House of Sport building in Belfast.In attendance was Raymond van Barneveld, affectionately known to fans around the world as ‘Barney’. Barney is probably the most popular darts player in history and a five-time champion of the world.On this occasion the organisers wanted Barney to play a few short challenge legs against local fans and personalities. They had run into trouble finding a journalist prepared to face him and a local PR company askedI would step in. I enthusiastically agreed.There was just one problem, and one that I did not disclose. I am rubbish at darts. Since my childhood I’ve always had a fascination with the game but it never transferred to any aptitude at the oche.By the time I agreed to face Barney I probably hadn’t thrown a dart in a couple of years. All the undeniable factors pointed to it being a massacre, rather than a match. I would have as good a chance of knocking out Carl Frampton, nut-megging Lionel Messi or outsprinting Usain Bolt as beating Barney on a dart board.The format was that we were to play one leg of . Perhaps sensing my nerves, Barney gallantly allowed me to go first.I attempted to calm myself and adopted a darting pose. I threw my first arrow. It sailed high over the top of the board, impaling itself on a thin strip of rubber which had been erected to protect the wall. No score. My second dart went even higher, embedding itself in the wall itself. I took a moment and threw my third dart into the middle of the single  bed. I was delighted.At this point I can only assume that Barney had already decided I was not to be taken seriously because his own standard fell well below the normal and he threw poorly. Still, within a couple of turns, I was more than  points behind and he was well on his way to victory.I think it was on my third visit that I hit a treble  and two singles for a score of . This was as good as it ever gets for me and I was thrilled that I had at least shown Barney and the small crowd that I had some level of competency. Idiotically I pumped my arms in the air and Barney laughed gallantly.Then Barney moved to finish the match on his next turn. He left himself  and with his third dart aimed at double . His throw was true and the arrow bent the thin wire of the double bed. But it was on the wrong side of the wire. It could not have been any closer, but it was on the wrong side of the wire.What happened next is so truly bizarre and unlikely that every single second of it is still stark in my memory, aschipped there in solid stone. All I can say is that this is exactly how it happened.The scorer told me I needed  to win. I had never checked out a score this high in my le. I know I never will again.Now, there are several ways to check out . The conventional route is to go treble , double . The flash route is to go for bullseyeand then tops . What happened next was neither conventional nor flash.I aimed for the bull in the middle of the board. My dart sailed into the middle of the treble . In darting terms I wasn’t even in the right continent.However, treble  is  and some quick subtraction told me I was now left with . I still had a chance. I knew thatI could hit single  I would have a shot at double  to win. I aimed at single  ... and my dart flew into the treble .This was now approaching a level of high farce and I was so disorientated that I could no longer compute what my score was. Barney whispered in my ear that I had  left.It took me several seconds to locate the  bed in the board. I steadied myself and, without thinking about it, released my last dart.In that tiny moment all the planets were aligned. The arrow soared like Poseidon’s trident ... straight into the middle of the double  bed. Nobody, not even Barney, could have thrown it better.There was a moment of stunned confusion before the crowd realised what had happened. I had won, I had somehow beaten Barney. I had thrown one of the worst checkouts ever and managed to beat one of the best players ever. There was a smattering of applause and laughter from the spectators.Barney was charitable with his time and posed for photographs with me afterwards. The truth is that over a short single leg a very bad darts players can beat a very good darts player with a little bit of luck. But I was a very, very bad darts player and I had beaten a great. There is no logic which can explain it.There are moments in le which are not meant to be understood, merely savoured.—— ——A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Please try again later.Submitting...Despite receiving multiple awards around the world, before Adrian McKinty started writing his latest bestseller The Chain, he was struggling to make ends meet and had decided to work as an Uber driver. Persuaded by fellow author Don Winslow to give it a final shot, Adrian started on what would later become The Chain – a terrying thriller that sees parents forced to kidnap children to save their own – for which Paramount Pictures has acquired the screen rights.Explaining how an old school teacher was the inspiration for the book the -year-old said: “I know a lot of people just think chain letters are silly, but I remember when I was a kid they scared the wits out of me. “People would say, ‘make three copies of this and send it on or your mother will die’. I thought better safe than sorry, I’ll make three copies of this and send it on.“When I was at Victoria Primary School in Carrick my P teacher was this woman called Mrs Carlisle. This was in the late s. These chain letters had been going around for a long time. She heard about it and askedanyone in the class had been getting chain letters and was really worried about it. Most of the class put their hand up. She said, ‘bring them all to me tomorrow’. “We all brought them to her, she took us outside, put them all into a bonfire and said, ‘I will take all the bad luck and all the hexes and stop these chains now’. Then she set fire to all the letters. I just remember I could not believe it. I thought, ‘well, we won’t be seeing her again’.“It made a huge impression on me as a kid when you’re so vulnerable and impressionable. “I remember any time I was away I’d always say to my mum when I got back, ‘how’s Mrs Carlisle doing ’ expecting to hear something out of The Omen, some news of a grizzly death, but no, she’s still alive, living in Trooperslane to this very day.“My mum gave her a signed copy of the book. She knows she was the big inspiration for the book.”After leaving school in NI Adrian went to Oxford University on a full scholarship to study philosophy before emigrating to the USA to become a high school English teacher. Normally Adrian’s book are set in Northern Ireland, however The Chain takes place in Boston: “I wanted it to be set in America for a couple of reasons. I wanted the main character to be able to buy a gun.“Also, the only part of America I really know well is Boston. That’s where my we is from.“I like my books to be very accurate. You want somewhere where you’re familiar with, you’ve walked the streets, you don’t make mistakes. You know the smells and the colours and the textures. You don’t want to have to Google details.”Before The Chain he was best known for his DS Sean Duffy series set in s Northern Ireland: “To me it was a no brainerI’m going to write a detective series set in the s, what do I know really well – Belfast and Carrick. I knew what was on the radio, what was on TV, what people were eating, what they were driving. For me to write about London or New York in the s I’d just be guessing.”Of the movie prospects for The Chain, Adrian said: “Whether that becomes a film or not I don’t know. Fingers crossed. One of my previous books was optioned – Dead I Well May Be – they renewed the option  times, every year for  years then they didn’t make the film.”Adrian’s books have won the Edgar Award, the Ned Kelly Award, the Anthony Award, the Barry Award and have been translated into over  languages. The Chain was recently longlisted for the Theakston Old Peculier Crime Novel of the Year. He faces tough competition in four former champions Denise Mina, Chris Brookmyre, Val McDermid and Lee Child, with the public voting now open to help determine the shortlist, which will be announced on June .Asked whether sales or awards were more important, Adrian said: “I suppose ultimately it’s selling copies of the books over awards. You have to be able to make a living out of this racket. I had a few years where I was winning crime fiction awards but only selling a couple of thousands copies of my books a year.“At a dollar a book that’s about two grand a year. You just can’t live on that no harm to you.”Discussing his decision to quit writing he said: “People have said to me, ‘you should never give up your dreams, you’re a bad example’. People have gone after me a wee bit, but I feel like I gave it a good go. “For eight or nine years I dedicated myself to being a writer. The books were coming out, they were getting good reviews. “My problem was they were set in Belfast during the Troubles, that was a hard sell. People would read the back and say, ‘I’ve had enough of all that nonsense’.“Getting people in England to buy those books was really dficult. It was even worse in America. For a lot of American readers their view of Ireland is The Quiet Man. The stuff I was writing about – RUC vs the IRA, Protestants vs Catholics, bombings, shooting, raids – was really interesting to me but perplexing for American readers.”He said: “I think the break helped. It gave me a time to think about new ideas and new concepts. I started thinking about my childhood at Victoria Primary School, growing up in Carrick, and that’s where The Chain came from.”Coronavirus literatureAskedhe thinks there will soon be a wave of novels set against a backdrop of the Covid- pandemic and lockdown, Adrian said: “There’s two ways of thinking about it.“After the  epidemic , in , , Charlie Chaplin didn’t start making a lot of lockdown movies. They were basically the same films that he was making before.“You look at the writing – you have Ulyssesand The Waste Land– they weren’t about what was happening in that period.“It just could go on the same as it always has. People don’t want to think about.”He continued: “Another way of thinking about it is, it’s such an interesting topic, everybody is going through it. Somebody is going to have to write something about it.“I was thinking to myself it is actually quite interesting for a crime writer. I’ve written a few locked room mysteries in my early career.“I really like the idea of someone being murdered in a locked room, during lockdown, while everyone  is in a locked room in lockdown as well. What could be more delicious than that ”Also discussed during our interview was the idea of a serial killer at work during lockdown.Adrian said: “I remember reading a book about a serial killer during the Blitz. It was the perfect crime because so many people were being killed by bombing every night what’s another body lying on the street.“That might work for Covid too. What’s one more little old lady dead when the police are already overstretched ”Least productive timePeople who think writers will have found it easy to adopt a stay at home regime during lockdown are way off the mark according to Adrian.He said: “I haven’t really been out of the house for about six weeks, but what  can you do, you have to obey the orders, stay inside.“I’m in New York, I’ve been here about two years. Up until the last six weeks it seemed like a great idea, now we’re stuck inside a tiny, wee apartment for two months it’s getting a bit claustrophobic.“It’s the funniest thing, this has probably been the least productive two months in the past  years.“Both kids are home all the time, you’re homeschooling them and helping them with their online homework and stuff like that. “They’re bored out of their minds so you’re playing Cluedo, Monopoly, and at the end of a day of really doing nothing you’re just exhausted.“I don’t really understand it to be perfectly honest. Normally I’d go to bed at about midnight or one. By  o’clock I’m just beat. Another day’s over, you go to bed, get up and it’s the same thing all over again.“It used to be I’d go out and do a really long walk every day, four days a week I’d go to the gym, go for a swim or whatever. “I’ve been doing none of that, yet I’m exhausted all the time.“For the first month I was feeling really guilty about it. I was saying to myself, ‘Adrian, you’re wasting your le, son, you should be getting up at six, getting the work done before the kids get up’. I was really beating myself up.“Then I was emailing with a whole bunch of friends and everybody was telling me the same story. They’re not getting anything done and are just really exhausted.“Somebody on Twitter posted that they’ve used this time really well, they’ve learned French. I unfollowed them immediately. The rest of us are stuffing our faces with pizza and watching TV and you’re learning French – give me a break.”He added: “When this lockdown is over the first thing I’m going to do is go to the pub, the second thing is get a haircut. I look like I’ve been living in the jungle for five years. If there’s some hipster haircut place that also sells beer I’m going there.“If you’d asked someone six months ago what they wanted to do, what their aspirations were, they’d maybe have said they want to go skiing or run a marathon. Ask me now, I want to get a pint in the pub and haircut.”Sadly for Adrian, he doesn’t think he will be able to visit home this summer: “I go home every summer to check on my mum and stay for a while. I don’t knowthat will be possible this year.”Adrian’s late father worked at Harland and Wolff while his mum worked as a secretary. He has other family members who still live in Carrick, and some further afield.He said: “It might have to be Christmas instead. I love to get back and see everyone. It’s a real shameI can’t this year.”One elf is enoughAdrian lives in New York with his we Leah and his daughters Sophie and Arwynn.Arwynn’s name is based on a Lord Of The Rings character due to the fact Adrian and his we met in the Oxford pub that author JRR Tolkien used to frequent. “When Sophie was born I wanted to call her Eowyn , but Leah wouldn’t let me. She said we’ve got one elf in the family and that’s enough. She’s named after her grandmother.”Loosehead prop for Jerusalem LionsAdrian explained how he ended up playing rugby for Jerusalem’s local rugby team when his we was there on a year’s scholarship.He recalled: It said on the scholarship that neither you or your partner is allowed to work. For the first couple of months I was just walking around the city enjoying Jerusalem, then I saw this poster for this rugby team – the Jerusalem Lions. I thought, ‘well I’m bored out of my mind here, I’ll go along to their training’.“I think a lot of them had never played rugby before because I immediately made the first team after the first training session. I spent that year playing loosehead prop for the Jerusalem Lions. We travelled all over Israel, Egypt and up into Lebanon. It was very surreal when you look back on that.”He added: “When I was playing you took your kit home with you and you got a laundry allowance to get it washed. It was about  shekels a week, that’s about £ or £. It suddenly occurred to me, ‘Adrian, you’ve attained your dream – you’re a professional rugby player’. I was playing rugby and getting paid for it.”\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Wersquove got the capacity to do it.Matthew went on to describe the atmosphere at Llandough Hospital.ldquoWersquore both in Penarth and wersquove lived here all our lives. Its important to us that we support it as much as possible.ldquoIts uplting being able to do that. It was so emotional being able to see the nurses on the Covid ward.ldquoFor me and Charlotte it was very humbling because those guys are putting their lives at risk and theyrsquore asking for stuff for patients, not for themselves.ldquoWe were quite tearful because we didnrsquot want to leave them there ndash but theyrsquore doing it day in-day out without batting an eyelid. Amazing people.Alongside their charitable work, Matthew and Charlotte have adapted to the challenging economic climate by introducing a delivery service for their customers.The pair have been working without the support of their staff who they had to furlough after the government closed all non-essential shops.ldquoWersquove started doing take-out because we canrsquot afford to do nothing for three months. Wersquoll lose the shop, said Matthew.ldquoWersquoll continue to do these drop offs for the hospital as long as people fund it, and wersquoll continue to do our take-out service.ldquoBecause for shops and restaurants I think its going to be long term.ldquoWe might be in this for six months before we can open to the public.ldquoAs long as we get the support and people keep shopping locally, then yes we can get through it.ldquoRunning a business is a constant challenge and you donrsquot ever stop having to adapt. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues

new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One,
