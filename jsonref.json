Someone would buy them and go around village halls doing lectures and people would pay to see it.          Obaysch the hippo was the first hippo seen in Britain since prehistoric times. He mated with a female and they had a female calf, which was named Guy Fawkes. The slide in this collection (pictured) shows the whole family, the only one of its kind. The hippos would draw 10,000 visitors a day          Even 150 years ago, the zoo housed a wide range of different animals. A zoo keeper is seen here with a Boa constrictor, a non-venomous snake that uses its heavy body to constrict and kill prey          This Babylonian lion was one of the star attractions at the zoo, and is seen here inside a cage at the zoo. London Zoo only opened in April 1828, and by 1870 there were already dozens of animals on display          Some of the animals, including this chimpanzee, would be dressed up in clothes for the public\u0027s amusement.

Its colours were added after the photograph was taken using glass plates          Crowds would gather to see the elephants (pictured) at the zoo, and children would often be allowed to ride on top of them. The remarkable images also reveal the dress at the time, with men wearing bowler or top hats and women wearing frocks          A white handed gibbon was another of the animals on display at the zoo. It is seen here chained to a tree. Many sets of the remarkable images would have been made, but as they were printed on glass plates - and therefore small and fragile - most haven\u0027t survived           Pictured here is a Syrian wild ass, which is also now extinct.

It is a subspecies of the Onager, which is a species of horse native to Asia          A Markhor, a large wild goat, is pictured here alongside another goat kept at the zoo. It is distinctive because of its screw horn and is found in countries including Afghanistan and Northern India           A tiger was another ferocious predator on display at the zoo and is seen here caged and next to a sign notifying members of the public of what they are looking at. Mimi Connell-Lay, from the auctioneers, said: \u0027As photography goes, these are pretty early images and they are all hand-coloured, at a time when most photos were black and white\u0027          There was not only predators on display at the zoo, but also prey - including this Cape buffalo (otherwise known as an African buffalo). Although they are still very dangerous creatures and only hunted by a few predators including lions and crocodiles           A monkey is seen here smoking a pipe, no doubt given to it by a keeper at the zoo. The image is around 150 years old, like the others in this collection           A camel is seen here with a zoo keeper. The Bactrian camel has two humps on its back, unlike the single-humped dromedary camel          Wolves were also kept at the zoo, with one seen here waiting at the entrance to its den. The images were taken in 1870 and are going up for auction at David Lay in Penzance, Cornwall, on December 6          A West African river hog was another of the creatures on display at the zoo. It is a member of the pig family living in Africa, and in its natural habitat would rarely be seen away from the rainforest           A Sumatran rhinoceros is seen here at London Zoo in 1870. It was one of the tourist attraction\u0027s most popular animals at the time. It is one of five subspecies of rhinoceroses still in existence. Images of creatures such as this were taken as not everybody could go to the zoo, whereas somebody could take these pictures all over the country          The zoo was a hugely popular tourist attraction and brought thousands through its doors every day. People are seen queuing at the entrance on a national holiday in 1927At that time, animals were often exchanged throughout Europe as gifts - but were frequently mistreated while held in captivity. After one of the animals bit a nobleman in the 1930s the menagerie was closed and many of the animals transferred to the newly opened London Zoo.All the tropical animals at the zoo were kept inside until 1902, over fears they could not survive the cold weather of London.But soon after a drastic redesign of the zoo and its enclosures by Dr Peter Chalmers Mitchell, led to a bringing of the animals out into the open.          Jumbo the elephant was one of the star attractions at the zoo. He used to give children rides around the zoo until keepers decided he was getting a bit frisky and dangerous and was sold him to PT Barnum for the circus          Excited zoo goers are seen here trying to touch the giraffes on display at the zoo. They are pictured here in 1911, soon after tropical animals were allowed outside for the first timeAs the years went on, the collection of animals grew at the zoo until the 1990s when it had almost 7,000 animals. It also had to overcome a scare in the 1980s when, facing financial problems, it announced its closure before a swell of public support in both visitors and donations enabled it to stay open and improve.It now houses a collection of 20,166 from a spread of 698 species of animal and is one of the city\u0027s most popular tourist attractions.                          "},{"url":null,"title":"Tube commuter makes intricate cheese salami sandwich","story":"  The girl is engrossed in her creation and is unaware of other passengers watching her, and a man sitting next to her struggles to contain his laughterBut after a few seconds, the woman, who is wearing headphones, looks up and realises that she is attracting some attention. One fellow traveller said: \u0027This is probably one of the best things I’ve ever seen at one in the morning.\u0027This girl got out a fresh loaf of bread, a packet of deli ham, Laughing Cow cheese triangles and made a sandwich on the tube.\u0027           After a few seconds, the woman, who is wearing headphones, looks up and realises that she is attracting some attention.\u0027Women Who Eat On Tubes\u0027 founder says he might take down...Women pictured eating on Tube by strangers for bizarre...Share this articleOthers said they saw no issue with someone making food on a train.One wrote online: \u0027I don\u0027t really see anything wrong with this to be honest.Another said: \u0027What, she was hungry.

She was also said to have warned her grandson about their behaviour.It is understood that the request to use the atomisers – hand-held devices for spraying water or perfume – to create a pleasant aroma for guests at St George\u0027s Chapel specifically came from Meghan\u0027s office at Kensington Palace.Although she and Harry organised the wedding themselves with an in-house team, anything to do with the chapel – the venue for several royal marriages including Queen Victoria\u0027s and burial place of ten monarchs – is a matter for the Queen, who had to give them permission to use it.

And when the request to use the atomisers was raised, the response was, well, a little sniffy.The source said: \u0027Apparently Meghan didn\u0027t like the smell of the chapel, which, as you would expect, is a little musty. It\u0027s not unpleasant at all, though. \u0027It just smells how you would expect an old building to smell.

Dark rum goes well with hard crystalline cheeses, such as gouda, but mixing it with crumbly stilton is a peculiar first.TASTE TEST: The stench of alcohol hits me the moment I cut the truckle (pictured right) and that’s pretty much all I can taste. It’s incredibly sweet — there’s a generous portion of raisins, ginger and peel — but perhaps too much ‘pudding’ and not enough ‘cheese’, as I can barely taste the Stilton.REPULSIVE RATING: 35MINCE PIE MARTINI£10 for 35cl, Marks \u0026amp Spencer storesWHAT THEY SAY: M\u0026ampS have been bringing out unusually flavoured Christmas spirits for years, some more successfully than others.The mince pie martini, designed to be shaken and served over ice, is infused with all the flavours of a festive pastry.It’s essentially mulled wine — but, at 20 per cent alcohol by volume, twice as potent.The ingredients list doesn’t contain gin (the usual boozy component in a martini), but simply ‘alcohol’, diluted with ‘demineralised water’.TASTE TEST: Distilling buttery pastry and juicy mincemeat into a glass is no mean feat, and I’m rather sceptical.What pours out of the opaque bottle is a caramel-coloured liquid. The first sip is overwhelmingly alcoholic but it goes down easily (far too easily, actually), and I’m left with a lovely aftertaste of Christmas spices.A hit if you’ve got a sweet tooth.REPULSIVE RATING: 05MARMITE SPROUTS£1.50 for 400g, iceland.co.uk          As a devout sprout-sceptic and lifelong Marmite-hater, these are a double whammy of disgustingnessWHAT THEY SAY: These frozen sprouts, intended to push the much-maligned veg to a younger generation, come with pellets of Marmite-flavoured butter.They can be pan-fried in 12 minutes and supposedly have a ‘unique flavour profile that is a combination of umami, salt and yeast.’Food technologists at the supermarket say this boosts the taste by making the sprouts sweet and suppressing their bitterness.TASTE TEST: As a devout sprout-sceptic and lifelong Marmite-hater, these are a double whammy of disgustingness.The pros — the sprouts are easy to cook, stay firm and keep their vibrant green — are vastly outweighed by the cons, including the unpleasant salty taste, the bitter aroma that fills my kitchen, and the soggy puddle of brown butter that congeals around the pan.REPULSIVE RATING: 45GINGERBREAD STUFFING BALLS£3.30 for 12, Co-op stores          The chunks of apricot are too big and the ginger flavour so pungent that my eyes waterWHAT THEY SAY: I had high hopes for these gingerbread and apricot stuffing balls, which come from the same ‘Irresistible’ range as the Brussels Sprouts Pizza.They’re made from outdoor-bred Hampshire pork (which makes up a not-too-shabby 69 per cent of each ball), mixed with ginger puree and dried apricot, as well as sage, parsley and cinnamon.TASTE TEST: The first bite is pleasant enough — succulent and packed full of herby flavour — but it quickly gives way to an unexpected sweetness.The chunks of apricot are too big and the ginger flavour so pungent that my eyes water. These would be more at home on a dessert platter.Repulsive rating: 45FESTIVE YORKSHIRE PUDDING WRAP£7.99 for 800g, lidl.co.ukWHAT THEY SAY: This is the Frankenstein’s monster of festive food, comprising an entire Christmas dinner — turkey, sausage, gammon and pork, sage and onion stuffing — sandwiched inside a rather stodgy Yorkshire pudding.The box suggests it serves six, but it’s tempting to pick it up in your hands like a giant burrito and scoff the lot.TASTE TEST: Despite two hours, 15 minutes in the oven, the Yorkshire pud is soggy and sodden with oil. The sausages are an unappetising grey colour and I can’t tell the many different meats apart. The nutritional information is the stuff of nightmares: each serving contains a third of your recommended daily intake of salt.REPULSIVE RATING:45GIN AND ORANGE CHEESE£13 for 1kg, Waitrose deliWHAT THEY SAY: This huge slab of Yorkshire Wensleydale is a proper indulgence, weighing half as much as my turkey.It’s creamy, crumbly and studded with caramelised orange, as well as being infused with dry gin from an award-winning family distillery.TASTE TEST: Perfect if you’ve got cheese-loving guests coming over. It’s worth keeping an eye on the best-before date, though: mine expires on December 21.It tastes smooth, mellow and nicely tangy, thanks to the orange peel. The gin is unnecessary, though I’d rather have booze with my cheese than in it.REPULSIVE RATING: 25GLITTERY GINGERBREAD GIN LIQUEUR£12.00 for 50cl, asda.com          Looks more like a perfume bottle than a spirit, and the glitter tends to settle at the bottom until it’s shaken through the ginWHAT THEY SAY: Sparkling with pearlescent edible glitter, this over-the-top liqueur is made by combining premium gin with ginger and cinnamon.Asda hopes it will become a staple at festive parties, with serving recommendations including drinking it straight (hic) or adding it to a glass of fizz.TASTE TEST: Looks more like a perfume bottle than a spirit, and the glitter tends to settle at the bottom until it’s shaken through the gin. It’s perhaps a little tacky, but it can’t be faulted for lack of sparkle.The smell does everything it says on the tin, but the flavour is pretty insipid.REPULSIVE RATING: 25CARAMEL AND COCOA TORTILLAS£1.90 for 190g, tesco.comWHAT THEY SAY: Tesco’s new festive nibbles finally catch up with the sweet-and-savoury trend of five years ago.They’re made from maize flour tortillas, rolled up and dotted with dark chocolate nibs, then dusted with salted caramel seasoning.TASTE TEST: Neither sweet nor savoury, nor particularly crisp, nor even that interesting, these are no match for crisps and dips.I can’t work out whether they’re supposed to be eaten before a meal or after — and the caramel ‘seasoning’ gives them the distinct whiff of stale cinema popcorn.REPULSIVE RATING:45SALTED CARAMEL CHEESE£1 for 90g, asda.comWHAT THEY SAY: Competing for the crown of ‘most ridiculous Christmas cheese’ is Asda’s Wensleydale with salted caramel and white chocolate.Both Waitrose and Morrisons have flavoured Wensleydale with salted caramel before, but this takes it one saccharine step further, with fudge pieces and white chocolate chips.TASTE TEST: This is the smallest wheel of cheese I’ve ever seen, and once you take the wax off there’s even less to go around. This is no bad thing — one small bite is enough for me, and I can’t find any other takers.The taste is just as strange, syrupy and downright disgusting as I expected. When, or why, anyone would ever want to eat this is beyond me.REPULSIVE RATING:55 "},{"url":null,"title":"Expert advice DIY festive wreaths make neighbours green envy","story":"    Sarah Rainey Christmas wreaths from bottom left Clockwise - Larry Walshe, McQueen, Simon J Lycett, Nikki Tibbles (Wild at Heart), Scarlet \u0026amp Violet, Rob Van Helden and Lavender Green Flowers  The first step for all designs: start by covering your base - either straw or metal - in moss (left) or pine (right)Sprout pizza?

That’s clear with this wreath (£125, larrywalshe.com) studded with pine cones and baubles.‘This intersperses different textures, which stops it looking too gaudy,’ Larry explains. ‘The base is Norwegian spruce with eucalyptus and asparagus, and viburnum berries.’          Larry covers a metal ring with moss and leaves using florist’s wire (£3.99 for a 45-metre roll, amazon.co.uk). ‘Cut the foliage up. Don’t go too small you want natural pieces sticking out,’ he explains.On top, everything is decoration. ‘Twist the wire back into the base,’ he adds. If you’re hanging it on a glass door or window, use foliage to make a green ‘back’, wired into the base, he says. A fresh wreath should last at least three weeks. ‘Only use products that will last, such as dip-dyed or painted leaves,’ he adds.Larry is running wreath-making classes on December 5 and 9 in Chiswick, London (£85pp).STUDDED WITH SURPRISESAt first glance, this wreath by McQueens — which supplies five-star hotels — looks very traditional: pine, gold and a red ribbon. But on closer inspection, it’s anything but.Senior florist Andrea Bassoli topped blue pine leaves with artificial gold trees, pomegranates and mini succulents (cacti) dipped in glitter. He adds bonsai roots, pine cones and dried blue scabiosa flowers. ‘Go with the directional flow of the leaves,’ he says.    He uses a ready-mossed straw wreath ring (£1.95, amazon.co.uk) and florist’s wire. ‘You need a robust frame, or the wreath will lose its shape and things fall off,’ he says.For a more modern look, put the ribbon slightly to one side, Andrea says, and affix a twist of florist’s wire to the back for a ‘hook’.Bespoke wreaths from McQueens cost around £250. There are full-day classes in London, on December 3, 5, 7 and 8 (£295pp, mcqueens.co.uk)ECO-FRIENDLY EXTRAVAGANCEEvery element here (£425, simon lycett.co.uk) is biodegradable, recyclable or reusable — which matters to Simon Lycett, the florist behind the blooms at the weddings of Prince William and Kate, Prince Charles and Camilla and the Beckhams.‘I’ve tried to avoid glitter and plastic. Use home-grown ingredients,’ Simon says. He uses a wire wreath frame (from 50p at hobbycraft.co.uk) — ‘or make one from a pair of bent coat hangers’ — and covers it in moss: ‘Rake it off the grass.’          Cover the base using Christmas tree trimmings, attaching it with wire going clockwise. ‘Start at the top with stems pointing down,’ he adds. Decorate with dried fruit, crab apples, berries and rosehips, and baubles.‘If you’ve got children, skip the berries and add Quality Street sweets,’ he says.The silk ribbon, frame and baubles, can be recycled for next year. ‘Pull out all the wires and throw the rest in the compost heap,’ Simon says. ‘You can hang the mossed frame up in the garage and use it again.’ASPARAGUS FERNS AND BERRIESThis crescent-shaped wreath (£95, wildatheart.com) is by Nikki Tibbles Wild At Heart — which has done ornate floral displays for Kensington Palace, Chanel and Dior.‘This asymmetric design is a contemporary alternative,’ says head florist Ruth Warren-Steed.          It comprises autumn meadow flowers and seeds attached to one side of a 15-inch copper hoop (from £3, etsy.com).Ruth affixes scented pine, willow, asparagus fern, pine cones, copper strawflowers, protea heads (£10, amazon.co.uk) and berries.‘Use buds and dried flowers, such as poppy seed heads,’ says Ruth. You could cover half of the frame, which is ‘half the work’, and she also recommends that you ‘don’t get hung up on the classic ring. Let your imagination run wild’.POPS OF PINK AND PURPLEUnconventional colours — pink, purple, orange — make this wreath by Vic Brotherson, owner of Scarlet \u0026amp Violet (a favourite of Nigella Lawson and Kate Moss) stand out. On a wire frame covered in moss, Vic adds pine foliage, copper beech leaves, rosehip, heather and pink peppercorns. Vic recommends pine and cedar leaves, which last eight weeks, and adds them in bundles.          ‘Some of our clients have expensive front doors, so don’t want to use nails for hanging,’ Vic explains. ‘I run a ribbon from the wreath over the door and attach it to the letterbox on the other side. Nobody can steal it!’ Small wreaths from scarletandviolet.com cost £85 and large wreaths are £100.FRUIT \u0026amp NUTRob Van Helden, who decorated St George’s Chapel for Princess Eugenie’s wedding, says slices of apple, preserved oranges and nuts are ideal for wreaths.‘They’ll last all season and give a lovely scent,’ he says. Rob uses a straw frame (from £2.50, etsy.com) for a homemade look.          ‘I layer it with blue pine and pine cones. Then I add the fruit, nuts, cinnamon sticks and baubles, before tying it with a ribbon.’ Rob’s top tip is to arrange the elements in clusters, and to ‘know your door’ — on a navy door, for example, blue and copper colours work well.‘I also like one on a table, around a hurricane vase with a candle in it,’ he adds. Luxury wreaths cost around £250 at rvhfloraldesign.com.SCENT AND SPARKLERosemary and lavender are key to this design by Lavender Green Flowers, who created displays for Pippa Middleton’s wedding. ‘It gives your house a festive smell,’ says Maddie Dawkins.She binds moss on to a metal frame and adds pine, lichen, dried oranges, hydrangeas and pine cones in glitter spray (£4.50, amazon.co.uk). ‘You don’t want a perfect circle,’ says Maddie.          ‘Dry garden hydrangeas by hanging them upside down,’ Maddie says. ‘Preserve sliced citrus fruit on greaseproof paper by baking them for five hours at 80c.’ Spritz the back and sides of the wreath with water once a week.

Artists and writers who tried more radical arrangements have a lot to teach us, writes Lara FeigelIn 1919 the German Dada artist Raoul Hausmann dismissed marriage as “the projection of rape into law”. It’s a statement that relishes its own violence: he is limbering up to fight marriage to the death. A strange mixture of dandy, wild man, provocateur and social engineer, Hausmann believed that the socialist revolution the Dadaists sought couldn’t be attained without a corresponding sexual revolution. And he lived as he preached. He was married, but was also in a four-year relationship with fellow artist Hannah Höch.Hausmann and Höch form one of the couples in the Barbican’s Modern Couples exhibition, which shows the freewheeling experimentation of interwar art to be inseparable from even more extravagant experiments in sexuality and coupledom. The exhibition includes several of the partly whimsical, partly grim collages Höch made at this time. Bobbing her hair and smoking in public, Höch was a self-styled “new woman” who shared Hausmann’s carnivalesque contempt for bourgeois morality. Her Bourgeois Wedding Couple (Quarrel) photomontage from 1919 satirises the married pair as ungainly children. The bride teeters on the boots of a grown-up woman, but she has the body of a mannequin and the face of an overgrown baby whose tantrum is observed by her childlike spouse.However, the alternative to bourgeois marriage wasn’t obviously promiscuity for Höch in the way it was for Hausmann. Years later, she described being “disappointed, crushed, destroyed” by the double standards of the Dadaist men, who wanted to free women while remaining obdurately patriarchal. At the time, she wrote a short story about an artist called Gotthold Heavenlykingdom who undergoes a spiritual crisis when his wife asks him to do the dishes. She also made The Father, depicting Hausmann as a male mother (Hausmann’s own face looms over female legs) holding a small baby who’s about to be hit in the eye by a boxer. The portrait is partly a comment on Hausmann’s double standards. Though he urged Höch to have his child, it was clear he wouldn’t be holding the baby or protecting his new progeny from harm.Höch went on to have a relationship with a woman, the Dutch writer Til Brugman. She wanted to provide “a model of how two women can form a single rich and balanced life”. Their nine years together were a lot more peaceful than the years with Hausmann. Was her new relationship happier because of the gender equality? Or because she was no longer experimenting with free love? Is it possible to live out Hausmann’s vision of sexual freedom and be happy?Questions of this kind are invited by the Barbican exhibition, which gives visual form to a kind of sexual musical chairs. The surrealists lived out their commitment to the primacy of desire by taking new sexual partners with ease. We find Max Ernst coupled with Dorothy Tanning and Leonora Carrington here, Valentine Penrose with Roland Penrose and Alice Rahon, Lee Miller with Man Ray and Roland Penrose. Meanwhile the Russian constructivists put forward a vision of revolution very like Hausmann’s in which women as well as the proletariat were to be freed of their chains and marriage was to be consigned to the scrapheap of history. The exhibition includes a room on Lilya and Osip Brik, who lived in a 15-year ménage à trois with the poet Vladimir Mayakovsky, until he killed himself in 1930.The wall and catalogue texts remain studiedly neutral about this death and the many other suicides they report. Were these the costs of experiment? The Barbican show doesn’t quite decide how we should situate ourselves: are we voyeurs from a nostalgic but disapproving future, or participants in a continual present? Have we moved on from this era or failed to live up to it? And does a vision fail just because it ends?I have wondered throughout my 30s if my generation has sold out, counting myself among its ranks. Around me, everyone has seemed to be getting married with the expectation of monogamy we’ve developed the notion of “cheating” in place of the notion of freedom even the gay couples I know seem to aspire to something very like a traditional marriage. The women I grew up admiring – Virginia Woolf, Simone de Beauvoir, Doris Lessing – chose not to live in this way. They expected love to be something more radical.Maggie Nelson writes about the tapering off of risk in The Argonauts, her brilliant, passionate yet coldly analytical account of the process that led to mothering a child with the transgender artist Harry Dodge. She describes the nostalgia for an earlier era of homosexual life that leads some gay men to seek erotic adventures in countries where homosexuality is banned. They’re looking for the thrill of danger. When something is risked, even when it’s just misery or disapproval, the pleasure of what’s gained increases. But there’s something else, too, that we might be looking for in seeking sex beyond the domestic. I find that looking back on the riskier gay world of the 1980s, or on the 1960s commune, or on the incestuous constellations of the interwar avant garde, it’s the communal aspect that most appeals to me and that I worry is harder to find now.The surrealists, the constructivists, even the homelier set at “Bloomsbury in Sussex”, were creating worlds where people emerged from the closed doors of their separate families and allowed themselves to love, depend on – and be disturbed by – a larger circle of people. They were enabled to do this by utopian political visions that included sexuality. For the surrealists, desire itself was to be allowed to dictate everything from sex to politics. The constructivists, who shared the larger Soviet aim to collectivise life, wanted to discard ownership of bodies as they discarded ownership of homes.In Russia, these ideals were enshrined in law in 1918 when the new Soviet government ratified its Code on Marriage, the Family and ship that abolished the inferior legal status of women, eliminated religious marriage, gave children born outside marriage equal rights to those born within it and made orce an easy formality. The author of the Code, Alexander Goikhbarg, looked forward to the time when “the fetters of husband and wife” were obsolete and love could be enjoyed freely. The founder of the Soviet “Women’s Department”, Alexandra Kollontai published a book in 1932 insisting that as there was “neither morality nor immorality” in nature, the sexual act should be recognised as “neither shameful nor sinful … as much a manifestation of a healthy organism as the quenching of hunger or thirst”.Kollontai’s views were not quite this clear-cut. She was the daughter of orced liberal intellectuals, which gave her a head start in rethinking marriage, but her own experience of marriage and separation were pretty difficult. Nonetheless, she still thought the ideal was worthwhile. Other Soviet officials were more critical. Lenin disliked the concept of free love because of its association with bourgeois promiscuity and because while it took “two people to make love”, a third person was likely to come into being as a result. By 1936, the family had been reinstated as the dominant unit in Soviet Russia and the orce and abortion reforms had been rescinded.Nonetheless, for artists such as the Briks and their circle, belief in communism continued to entail belief in free love. These ideas were crucial sources of inspiration for the 1960s hippy communes, which redefined society, the family and the couple according to principles that Goikhbarg might have approved of, even if he might not have liked the results. There were similar ideas at play in the gay bathhouses in 1970s America that proved crucial in providing gay men not just with the opportunities for sex but with an alternative vision of community. This was given a political impetus in the run-up to the 1980 US election, when the New St Mark’s Baths in New York City conducted a voter registration drive on its premises.These experiments lost some of their credence in the Aids crisis. And as the children of the 1960s generation grew up, it became clear that the communes too had come at a cost. In her 2017 book, Future Sex, Emily Witt observed that her generation grew up viewing the experiments of the past as more a warning than an inspiration: “Obedient children of the 1980s and 90s saw the failures of the counterculture, took them as implicit lessons from our parents, and held ourselves in thrall to grade point averages, drug laws, health insurance, student loan payments … condoms, skin protection factors.”Visions of communal living now don’t often include sexual freedom, and sexual freedom doesn’t often come with utopian communal politics. In Witt’s tour of sexual freedom she found that today’s self-styled polyamorists were more often located within capitalism than fighting against it. Free love is less the territory of the avant garde than of Silicon Valley, its practitioners more likely to be found designing a new app than a photomontage. The rules of the polyamorists Witt met are carefully negotiated and lodged as shared Google documents. There’s much to be said for this. Certainly it seems preferable for any children created along the way. But it’s not a utopian vision.The strength of the book lies in its ambivalence. “There is much to be learned from wanting something both ways,” Nelson writes, talking about queer theorist Eve Sedgwick. Nelson tells us about the gay men who seek danger abroad partly because she knows about her own double standards. She’s interested both in testing the limits of coupledom and in reminding us how stubbornly powerful a force coupledom can be. Coupledom asserts itself just when she’s discovered that she’s happy to be alone, just when she’s committed to theorists who celebrate the provisional, appearing in the guise of two changing bodies, “two human animals, one of whom is blessedly neither male nor female, the other of whom is female (more or less)”.There’s no getting away from the power of coupledom as an arrangement. We’ve all experienced it: couples and quasi-couples form in the most unlikely places, meaning that there’s a loss after any holiday or large project undertaken with a friend or a colleague when you discover that the new couple has to be ided so that old couples can be returned to or new couples forged. The narrative of the Modern Couples exhibition is precisely this: free love not as the jettisoning of the couple but as a kind of speeded up square dance in which couples come together only to break apart and re-form, occasionally coupling up with other couples. Theories of free love like Kollontai’s have their limitations because however free we may learn to be sexually, we find it hard to resist coupledom and couples bring their own demands.I often think that the theory of free love that works best alongside the couple is De Beauvoir’s in The Second Sex. What makes this so powerful is twofold: De Beauvoir makes a compelling case for why sex matters, describing a more transformative act than the quenching of thirst and she analyses not just sex but the structure of coupledom and the otherness that sexual coupledom first brings raging to the surface and then provides a way of surviving.Here’s her description of the ideal sexual act: “The words ‘receive’ and ‘give’ exchange meanings, joy is gratitude, pleasure is tenderness. In a concrete and sexual form the reciprocal recognition of the self and the other is accomplished in the keenest consciousness of the other and the self … the dimension of the other remains but the fact is that alterity no longer has a hostile character this consciousness of the union of the bodies in their separation is what makes the sexual act moving.”The alarming yet tender confrontation with the other takes us back to Höch’s collages of half male, half female figures. Perhaps these were not just acts of protest, but acts of registering both the oddness and the generativeness of coupledom.So how can we accept the grip of coupledom but stop it taking over our lives, if that’s what we want, retaining a vision of the communal? De Beauvoir believed that this kind of sexual intimacy charged by otherness could neither be sustained nor contained by marriage. Instead she advocated “a pact of freedom and sincerity” in which a couple granted each other openness and freedom.This was the kind of pact she had with Sartre, and it had its moments of crisis. In 1947 she fell seriously in love with Nelson Algren, an American writer whose Chicago gangster persona was part of his allure, fascinating and confusing the poised French intellectual he’d seduced. She experienced the kind of sexual passion she went on to describe in The Second Sex, but she wouldn’t give up Sartre and the relationship foundered. She depicted it in her 1954 autobiographical novel The Mandarins, which makes troubling reading in portraying a heroine left depressed by the onset of middle age, contemplating suicide because she’s unsure whether she can be fully embodied again.Yet this isn’t the whole story. Though she paid the price of loneliness, De Beauvoir retained her role as the high priestess in the communal world that she and Sartre had created, taking their place at the barricades in 1968 as s of the new counterculture. If she has something to say to us now, if any of the couples on the walls of the Barbican have anything to say, then it’s not because they got it right or wrong but because they showed how high the stakes were in trying to move beyond the family structure at all – how much there was to be gained as well as how much to be lost in seeking a mode of living that incorporated the couple within the communal. Looking back on these experiments, many of them seem wildly flawed. But let’s revisit them not just with curious nostalgia but with urgent questions about how to live.• Lara Feigel is the author of Free Woman: Life, Liberation and Doris Lessing (Bloomsbury).

But please, spare us the lazy catfight tropesThe United Kingdom is hopelessly ided, unsure as to its future and so acutely at risk of constitutional crisis that it could soon become ungovernable. So it falls to the popular press not to soothe ision but to distract us. The dead-cat strategy is useful just now. (According to a disciple of this practice – Boris Johnson – you simply throw a dead cat on the dining room table so people start talking about the dead cat instead of the issue that’s causing everyone grief.)But what’s even better than a dead cat? Two living ones, I suppose, and thus the tabloid headlines this week have been about an imaginary “rift” between Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton. I say imaginary because I don’t know the truth and nor, clearly, do the people writing this ludicrous stuff. They don’t know so much that even in their own speculation they have to put the words “rift”, “tension” and “feud” in quotation marks.Nonetheless, the self-congratulatory welcoming of a orced woman of mixed heritage into the royals didn’t last long, did it? Pregnant and over-demanding, the Duchess of Sussex must be a bit shocked to go to bed as a symbol of tolerance and wake up as Wallis Simpson, another bad American who upset our royals.Who could be upset by Meghan, though? Mostly she seems to perform well, as far as I can tell, crossing her ankles and wearing horrible tights and big hats. She is breeding in captivity, as all royal women must. The crowds love her, so what exactly has she done wrong? Even the scant “evidence” or “leaks”, which are nothing more than bitching from anonymous courtiers, hardly make her sound like the Wicked Witch of the West.Among her alleged crimes, it seems that she wanted an emerald tiara. I don’t know what’s wrong with that. And she made the Duchess of Cambridge cry when Princess Charlotte was being fitted for a bridesmaid’s dress for Meghan’s wedding. In other words, she behaved like every flustered bride. She insists on writing her own speeches, and likes to think about them. What a monster! Harry is reported to have said, “What Meghan wants, Meghan gets.”Perhaps he did perhaps she does. Perhaps having estranged family members in the US sell stories about you while at the same you are learning royal protocol, and perhaps being pregnant in the public eye is a very difficult thing. I can’t imagine why anyone would want to be a princess. At the time of the wedding I called it a retrograde step, the reinvigoration of the firm for the benefit of … what? England patted itself on the back for its ability to accept a stunning, opinionated woman who was not white, at the very same time as we were told that non-white immigrants made everyone feel uneasy.Well, it didn’t take long for the “rumours” to begin, did it? Soon this woman was getting above herself. It’s the same old story. Remember when Kate, whose USP was her ultra-blandness, was also sneered at for being merely middle class. Who can forget the totes hilair “doors to manual” joke about her “pushy” mother? Because, remember, people who have had actual jobs are apparently not good enough for our royals .Inevitably then, the tabloids, for whom womanhood is simply an endless state of measurement, competition and resentment, pit Meghan against Kate. These two young woman are very “different” – Christ, there’s a scoop – and therefore, as is the way, they must hate each other. The catfight narrative is pathetic, but it’s a tried-and-tested formula. Strangely, a year ago, a body language expert – those people who apparently make a living analysing hair-flicking – told us that Meghan was in fact mirroring Kate’s body language and relating to her as a big sister. All was hunky-dory.And strangely for a feuding woman, Kate, when asked during a visit to Leicester this week if she was excited about Meghan’s pregnancy, replied, “Yeah, absolutely. It’s such a special time to have little kiddies and a cousin for George and Charlotte and Louis. It’s really special.” What a cow.What is deeply depressing, then, is that while books that celebrate female friendship are flying off the shelves, the lazy old catfight narrative should reassert itself. This is a throwback as archaic as the royal family itself. In the fairytale that is never told, two princesses meet and they get on fine, almost like normal people. Whoever is selling these feud fantasies should realise us non-princesses just don’t buy them. We moved on a long time ago.

So what would she delete from her history? As she stars in Ralph Breaks the Internet, Silverman discusses 4chan, Trump and bad gags “I don’t forgo any important part of my life for being on the internet,” says Sarah Silverman. We are supposed to be talking in person but she’s stuck in traffic so we’ve started the interview over the phone, which is awkward – although we are talking about how much she looks at her phone, so maybe it’s appropriate. She doesn’t have any self-imposed rules about screen time, “but I’m pretty good at making things a treat. I don’t go crazy with any one thing. Even a cigarette: I’ll just have one once in a while.” She pauses: “I guess I shouldn’t say that because this is a Disney movie I’m promoting.” Shortly after this exchange, the phone line mysteriously cuts dead. A loss of signal? Or has she gone too far off-message for her Mouse House handlers? We will never know.No one could mistake Sarah Silverman for a children’s entertainer. Her Wikipedia page even has a subsection devoted to “Controversies”. Silverman’s brand of comedy is famously hard-edged, boundary-teasing, close to the wind-sailing, but told with a smile, a wink and a winning sense of silliness. Yet here she is in Disney’s family-friendly sequel Ralph Breaks the Internet, reprising her perky virtual video game character Vanellope von Schweetz. As the title suggests, she and the adorable lunk of the title (voiced by John C Reilly), are whisked from their offline amusement arcade backwater to this brave new thing called “the internet”, which the movie depicts as a bustling, regimented, perpetually sunny metropolis dominated by corporations such as Google, eBay and, of course, Disney. So, not far removed from modern-day Los Angeles.Understandably, Ralph Breaks the Internet does not stray into the more adult-oriented neighbourhoods of internet city, which is where you would find much of Silverman’s own output. She has a significant online presence, including 12.5 million Twitter followers and, currently, her web TV show I Love You, America. In the opening episode of that, Silverman took the old nerve-calming adage of “imagine your audience naked” one step further, and had an actual naked couple in the audience, whom she interviewed with regular, gratuitous closeups of their body parts. She has appeared on a chatshow dressed as Adolf Hitler. She went viral on YouTube with a song called I’m Fucking Matt Damon. She has regularly joked about rape, paedophilia and racism. If the internet were a city, Silverman’s crudeness could fill a mall.“Boundaries are the best thing for comedy in a lot of ways,” she says. “I mean, I fight them. I intrinsically don’t like to be told what to do because I’m a comic. I’m allergic to it. But those boundaries force you to have to find a new way. I like finding hard comedy in places that don’t hurt someone.”That is why her fans love her, but you can see how it might create certain challenges when it comes to promoting a wholesome, big-budget Disney movie (they needn’t worry, Ralph made more than $80m on its opening weekend in the US). When she arrives at our London rendezvous in person, she gives me a hug, apologises and sits on the floor. She is frank and engaged and exudes enough warmth to heat the freezing cold hotel room, although she keeps her coat on throughout. The coat is new: black, padded, full-length, like a wearable duvet. “I bought it for this trip. It was $200 and it’s kept me really warm, though the zipper’s not wildly strong.” Yes, she bought it online, but Silverman is no sucker for internet commerce. “I live in a small apartment and I don’t have much storage and so I can’t have things,” she says. To its credit, Ralph Breaks the Internet does acknowledge that the web is not all sunshine and kitten memes. As well as a story of friendship, growth and product placement, it serves as an introduction to modern online perils: inducements to consume, irritating pop-ups, violent games, abusive trolls and hurtful comments, the latter almost shattering Ralph’s love for the internet terminally. There is even a brief trip to “the dark web”.Beyond that, she also tries to zone out the daily churn of celebrity gossip. Typing her name into search engines on the morning we meet, the top two news items are “Sarah Silverman, 47, looks stylish in a corduroy mini skirt as she joins her co-star John C Reilly, 53, at Ralph Breaks the Internet premiere in Dublin” (Daily Mail, via Google), and “Sarah Silverman \u0026amp Jon Hamm Are Boning. Somewhere, Bill Maher Seethes With Envy” (thehollywoodgossip, via Bing).As for more garden-variety trolling, Silverman has learned how to deal with the mixed bag of online comments. Some are hateful, many are supportive, some are just plain weird (random Instagram sample: “I’m not gay, but I would deep-throat giant black cock for a chance to play basketball with Sarah Silverman”). “I kind of know, with my eye, how to scan through them now,” she says. “I also look at them when I’m in a ‘solid place’. It’s certainly not a thing to do when you’re feeling vulnerable, and yet a lot of people are drawn to doing that when they are because they want to validate themselves they want to read something that makes them feel worth being on this Earth. So you really shouldn’t read them unless you absolutely understand that you deserve love and have a place on this Earth. Because otherwise you’re fucked.”Nearly three decades in standup has thickened her skin, it seems: “As a comedian, trolls to me, I see them as hecklers. And what I’ve come to learn about hecklers is, whatever they’re yelling out, the subtext is: ‘I exist!’ Right? And that’s what I see on the internet. They want love. They go towards love. That’s why people join hate groups. They find family there. They find acceptance there. That’s why Trump has gone to the far right. People there go: ‘You’re amazing!’ They like him there. They see that they can manipulate him with love. Our governments are filled with people with daddy issues who don’t look inward, who have no perspective, who don’t live examined lives, and we’re all paying for it. You see that in trolls and in the rage on the internet. This is misplaced anger!”Silverman can be crude and irreverent but she is also, increasingly, unashamedly political, and surprisingly earnest about it. “I like being silly and funny and stupid, especially on Twitter, but I do feel a little responsibility to push out what I think is important information or true information, even though it’s not very funny, at a time where truth has not much currency. I don’t know if you know this, but Russia infiltrated our elections with the intention of causing chaos and turning our citizens against each other and that has exactly happened.” She is adopting an exaggeratedly serious tone now, folding the edges of her earnestness back into humour.She strikes a similar balance between political and goofy in I Love You, America, in which – ironically for a web-based show – she seeks to bridge ides through good old-fashioned real-life encounters, rather than aggressive, anonymous online ones. In each episode, she escapes her self-described “liberal bubble” and visits people she disagrees with: Trump-voting crab-fishers in Louisiana, for example, or a conservative Mormon family in Wyoming.This is another hazard of the internet age, especially for comedians such as Silverman: it is easier than ever to both cause offence and take offence. With a live standup show, there is context and nuance and intimacy online, anything perceived as contentious or off-colour will go straight into that “Controversies” section on Wikipedia. And it will stay there for ever. The latest entry dates from this October, in relation to her friend and fellow comedian Louis CK, whose career was derailed by revelations he had exposed himself and masturbated in front of women. Silverman was one of those women. In her case, it was consensual and non-exploitative, she stated, although she never condoned his actions. Inevitably, her comments were repeated, amplified and condemned.Does she ever wish she could just delete her online history? “Well no, because I think you have to learn from history, in macro ways and in micro ways, with your own history. So all I can do is learn from it, be changed for ever by it, and do what I can to make it right going forward.Part of that, she observes, is the internet making the world smaller. She says she likes to have her mind changed, which is something your rarely hear anyone say. “I think, as a comedian, if you’re not changing with the times – not just second-guessing what the kids want to hear but growing and changing as a human being, living an examined life – that will reflect in your comedy. You’ll lose fans and you’ll gain fans. That’s not up to me, but I just try to stay within what I think is cool and funny and interesting. If you can’t change with the times, you’re fucking old.”Ralph Breaks the Internet is in cinemas now"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89d227ad6319e5d898469c45c8a0dbb8f68e37b9/0_128_3760_2256/master/3760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=457bdc5a15672502ad505ba0593a3eaa","title":"the lowdown on british columbia this canadian province is not to be missed","story":"With cosmopolitan cities nudging wide-open wilderness, spectacular wildlife and a superb culinary scene, British Columbia offers a host of amazing adventuresChefs around the world adore BC for its incredible produce, from sweet spot prawns, celebrated in a festival each year at Vancouver’s Fisherman’s Wharf, to the juicy Okanagan cherries and peaches, which locals devour by the crate.Start planning your trip by poring over online menus at stellar Vancouver restaurants such as chef Andrea Carlson’s Burdock \u0026amp Co Gastown go-to, French-influenced L’Abattoir or the upmarket west coast take at Botanist.

If parliament was in deadlock, Theresa May could get herself out of that deadlock by backing a second referendum.”Gyimah, who voted to remain in the EU in 2016, likened the negotiations to a football match in which the opposition “are the referee and they can make up the rules as they go along”.He added: “We all know more about the EU than we did during the first referendum and in particular the terms of our departure. I am happy to concede if we have a second referendum and if leave wins, at least we would do it with our eyes wide open.”The MP for East Surrey said he came to his decision after looking through the terms of the deal and receiving feedback from his constituents.He also cited May’s decision to give up on efforts to gain access to the EU’s Galileo satellite navigation system for defence and critical national infrastructure purposes after being frozen out by Brussels, which he has said was “a foretaste of what’s to come under the government’s Brexit deal”.“We don’t actually have a deal, we have a deal in name only,” Gyimah said. “What we have is a series of principles of what we want to achieve as a country, a set of negotiations after we have left the EU and given up our voice, our veto and our vote.“We will have to deal with these consequences and the public would not forgive us if we don’t level with them on the difficult choices ahead.”The Democratic Unionist party, which has a confidence and supply deal with the Tories, has indicated it will not support May’s plan, as has the Labour party and many of the prime minister’s own MPs.Jo Johnson and Justine Greening, two former ministers, welcomed Gyimah’s suggestion that a second referendum was worth considering now May’s deal had been made public.“Like many MPs, he has recognised the huge shortcomings of the prime minister’s deal and the need to find an alternative path forward for Britain,” said Greening, a leading supporter of the People’s Vote campaign.However, the culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, said he was sad to see Gyimah leave the government over Brexit.Wright acknowledged the agreement with the EU was not perfect, but said he believed it was the best one available.“All of my colleagues are going to have to make their own judgment about what they think about this deal,” he told the Today programme.“The negotiation we have had with the European Union was always going to be a matter of compromise for both sides. You do have to compare this deal with the realistically available alternatives.“Either we leave with no deal, which would have serious economic consequences, or we say to the British public: ‘I’m sorry you have got it wrong, you are going to have to do it again’, which I think would have serious democratic consequences.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/826cfa33ce347ff4e4a03bb768364d97ccdb22e4/0_180_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06b3ffafe027f48dac34b326cc5c654d","title":"week in wildlife in pictures","story":"Red fody, beached whales and wildlife rescued from an Australian heatwave in this week’s gallery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86b1978b9fbdefac2479146877dc9dc873bf520b/0_175_5481_3289/master/5481.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d304ca36df3f82a00ff7eaa7aed4e030","title":"michael b jordan black panther creed ii hollywood","story":"The 31-year-old has delivered a one-two punch of killer performances this year with hits Black Panther and Creed II and he’s working hard to cement his place in the industryThere’s something serendipitous about Michael B Jordan ending 2018 with another smash hit. After an Oscar-buzzed role in Marvel’s Black Panther, he’s now headlining Creed II, a sequel that’s over-performing at the box office –\u0026nbspand at the same time, the industry is expanding to give more chances to other black actors than ever before.Alongside John Boyega, Daniel Kaluuya, Stephan James and Jovan Adepo, Jordan is one of an increasing group of stars who are finally being given major roles in blockbuster projects. But is this modern “black renaissance” the cause of his rise to leading man status, or was Jordan destined for greatness regardless?The 31-year-old has been in the business for about 20 years, since first appearing in commercials as a child. This year alone provides proof that he’s graduated to a leading man, after impressing in The Wire and in 2013’s fact-based indie Fruitvale Station.He stumbled in 2015’s poorly received Fantastic Four reboot, but then Jordan found hitherto unseen success as the supervillain Killmonger in Black Panther earlier this year. Reuniting him with his Fruitvale Station and Creed director Ryan Coogler, Jordan delivered an intensely complex, fascinatingly relatable bad guy, praised by fans and critics alike. Abandoned by his wealthy Wakandan family, Killmonger grew up fatherless, alone and impoverished with a surging rage for his predicament.Jordan’s performance embodied black pain in a way that felt horribly relevant in Donald Trump’s increasingly ided America. But despite praise, Jordan’s immersion in the role took its toll. He poured so much of himself into the villain that the end of production was reportedly followed by a stint in therapy. “Once I got finished wrapping the movie, it took me some time to talk through how I was feeling and why I was feeling so sad and, like, a little bit depressed,” he shared on The Bill Simmons Podcast. Sessions with a therapist helped him move on just in time to prepare for his next project.But the critical and commercial success of $1.3bn mega-hit Black Panther didn’t bleed into his second film of the year, HBO’s adaptation of Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451. Jordan starred as a dystopian fireman, trained to set fire to “contraband media”, but while the plot might have felt prescient, and despite a formidable co-star in the shape of Michael Shannon, the film premiered at Cannes to lukewarm reviews. Jordan was too busy to notice, however, since he was in the middle of another grueling production.In 2015, he’d scored a win with his induction into the Rocky franchise Coogler’s rousing reboot Creed, a franchise he returned to this year. Creed II is already a major hit, outperforming expectations with $62m in its first week and scoring strong reviews. The saga chronicles a boxing underdog with a champion name – Adonis Creed – who is fighting his way to recognition, independent of a legacy that seemed to die with his father. In the sequel, Adonis must face the son of the man who murdered him. The journey he takes resembles Jordan’s own struggle to legitimate leading man status in a traditionally restrictive industry for actors of color. It’s no wonder that the actor plays the boxer so well. There’s also that name …“Being named Michael Jordan – I think growing up playing sports and having a name like Michael Jordan, and I was extremely competitive, I used to get teased a lot,” he said to NPR’s Audie Cornish last month. “But it made me want to strive for greatness and be able to compete at whatever I decided to do.”Toughness on screen has also been offset by an undeniably grounded charm off it: Jordan has achieved virality on more than one occasion this year. In March, Jordan offered to pay for a replacement retainer for a fan who broke hers from excitement over seeing him shirtless in Black Panther. Two months later, he was riding high on Twitter again after it was revealed he’d met a fan who contacted him via Instagram. Just this week, he’s been at it again – cannily meeting a fan who had previously gone viral by Photoshopping the pair together.There’s also something else that drives Jordan: the need to prove himself outside of restrictions tied to his race. In an interview for Variety’s Actors on Actors series, Jordan revealed to Insecure’s Issa Rae that he seeks out roles written for white actors. Roles written for black characters, he reasoned, were filled with the writer’s preconceived notions of what his character was supposed to be.“I’m first and foremost a black man, for sure, but what I’m trying to do, and what I’m trying to represent and build, is universal,” he said in a Vanity Fair profile in October. “We live in the times where everything is based around race, and for me, it’s like, I get it, I understand. It just makes everything so loaded.”In March, Jordan made waves by announcing that his production company Outlier Society would adopt an inclusion rider for every future project they take on. He was the first to respond to Frances McDormand’s Oscar acceptance speech which saw her talk about the rider that would demand equality in front of and behind the camera. It was groundbreaking news by itself but later in September, Warner Bros announced it would partner with Jordan to ensure this became a company-wide policy.The first film to hold true to the policy will be Just Mercy, a film that sees Jordan star as civil rights defense attorney Bryan Stevenson. It’s a project that will help to further extend Jordan’s appeal beyond the multiplex and into the awards conversation. Yet there’s a chance he might be heading to the main stage next year with experts predicting a best supporting actor nomination for his performance in Black Panther, a film that might well be the first superhero adventure to ever score a best picture nod.Jordan has honed his skills and set his goals while plotting to challenge an oppressive system that has weighed people of color down. He’s working hard to claim his own seat at the table, and is taking care to prevent barriers to his progress and that of black actors coming up behind him. With a banner year, he’s not only become Hollywood’s most exciting new leading man, but he’s helping to define what we should expect of other leading men in the future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c79d209f4a3acaf82649f227477802432331d8c8/0_885_3201_1920/master/3201.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d08dadc974d2fd963dbcf46fb63448f","title":"meera sodhas recipe for vegan yaki udon noodles","story":"Chewy udon noodles, stir-fried with tangy, curry-spiked veg and pickleUdon noodles are my favourite noodles: fat, chewy and wonderfully slurpable.

As a result, I don’t feel at all prepared for the festive season. But ‘tis the first of December and, ready or not, a month of inevitable overindulgence is upon us. So slip on your stretchiest trousers and let today’s comfort cooking ease you in gently.This gratin is indulgent enough to stand on its own as a main course, served with a light green salad to cut through the creaminess. Sweet vermouth adds an extra dimension, but can easily be replaced by another sweet white wine.3 fennel bulbs (about 1.2kg), fronds intactSalt and black pepper2 granny smith apples (350g)100ml sweet white vermouth, or other sweet white wine100ml double creamFor the crust50g panko breadcrumbs50g parmesan, grated10g fresh dill, chopped10g tarragon leaves, chopped1½ tbsp fennel seeds, toasted and lightly crushed in a mortar1½ tsp lemon zest2 tbsp olive oilHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)390Fgas 6. Remove the fronds from the fennel bulbs and set aside, then cut each bulb lengthways into eight wedges. Fill a large saucepan with a litre of water, bring to a boil on a high heat and add a teaspoon of salt. Blanch the fennel wedges for 10 minutes, then drain into a sieve placed over a heatproof bowl, to reserve the cooking water.Meanwhile, peel and core the apples, then slice them thinly (use a mandoline, if you have one) about 2mm thick. Put the apples in a 30cm x 20cm baking dish, along with the fennel, vermouth, cream and 100ml reserved cooking liquid. Season with a quarter-teaspoon of salt and a generous grind of black pepper, and toss everything together until well combined. Cover tightly with foil and bake for 45 minutes, until completely softened.Meanwhile, prepare the panko crust by combining all the ingredients with a quarter-teaspoon of salt, a generous grind of black pepper and the reserved fennel fronds.After 45 minutes, take the dish from the oven and remove the foil. Top with the panko mixture and bake, uncovered, for another 20 minutes, or until golden brown and bubbly. Leave to rest for 10 minutes, then serve.You can make the bread porridge – which is a bit like a thick bread sauce – in advance and thin it down with milk before serving. Replace the pheasant with wedges of roast pumpkin to turn this into a vegetarian main.70g unsalted butter1 pheasant (700g)Salt and black pepper4 thin rashers bacon (80g), roughly chopped2 small onions, peeled and quartered 10 sprigs fresh thyme (15g)3 bay leaves150ml dry white wine3 tbsp port200ml water700ml whole milk, plus a little bit extra, to thin down400g loaf sourdough, crusts removed and discarded, crumb torn into 2-3cm pieces (250g net)100ml double creamFor the pickled walnut salsa2 pickled walnuts, roughly chopped, plus 1½ tbsp pickling liquor1½ tbsp olive oil20g walnut halves, roughly broken10g parsley leaves, roughly chopped30g pomegranate seeds (ie the seeds from about ¼ of a pomegranate)Put 20g butter in a medium-sized, heavy-based casserole pan for which you have a lid and put on a medium-high heat. Season the pheasant all over with half a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, then lay it in the pan. Fry for three to four minutes, turning regularly, until browned all over. Add the bacon, half the onion, half the thyme, one bay leaf, the white wine, port and water, and bring to a boil. Once boiling, turn down the heat to medium-low, cover the pan and leave to simmer for an hour and a half, until the pheasant is cooked and the meat is falling off the bone. Turn off the heat and, once the pheasant is cool enough to handle, lift out and set it aside with the bacon and onion. Strain the cooking juices back into the same pan discard the remaining aromatics.Pick all the pheasant meat from the bones and return the meat to the cooking liquid with the bacon and onion. Bring to a boil on a medium-high heat, then reduce for three to four minutes, until you are left with about 100ml liquid in the pan. Cover and set aside.Pour the milk into a large saute pan and put on a medium-high heat with the remaining butter, onion, thyme, bay leaves, half a teaspoon of salt and plenty of pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer gently for 10 minutes. Discard all the aromatics, add the sourdough pieces and stir through for three to four minutes, until the bread has softened and has the consistency of porridge – you may need to add a bit more milk or reduce the porridge for longer, depending on the texture of the bread. Once the bread is ready, stir in the cream, cover and set aside.Mix all the salsa ingredients in a small bowl with an eighth of a teaspoon of salt.Divide the sourdough porridge between four shallow bowls, top first with the pheasant mixture and then the salsa, and serve.This is a deconstructed cheesecake, which makes the process from bowl to mouth a lot quicker. All the elements can be made ahead. The cheesecake itself will keep in the fridge for three days, as will the quince and syrup – simply bring the fruit back to room temperature a few hours before serving, and gently heat the syrup to loosen it. The crumble will keep for two days in an airtight container at room temperature – bake in a very hot oven for a few minutes to crisp up. For the poached quince 1 lemon1 large quince (320g)70ml red wine70g caster sugar¼ tsp ground allspice½ tsp vanilla paste or extract1-2 oranges – skin finely shaved, to get 3 strips, then juiced, to get 3 tbsp145ml pomegranate juiceFor the cheesecake100g goat’s cheese30g icing sugar, sifted200ml double cream¼ tsp vanilla bean paste or extract¼ tsp ground allspice½ tsp finely grated orange zestFor the crumble70g unsalted butter50g amaretti biscuits – the hard ones, not the chewy variety50g Hobnob biscuits50g blanched hazelnuts, well toasted and roughly chopped¼ tsp ground allspiceFlaked sea saltHeat the oven to 190C (180C fan)390Fgas 6. Juice the lemon, reserving the squeezed halves. Set aside one tablespoon of juice, then put the remaining juice and the squeezed halves in a large bowl with plenty of cold water.Peel the quince, then cut it in half lengthways. Cut each half into eight segments, so you have 16 segments in total, putting them in the lemon water as you go, to prevent them discolouring. Once you have cut all the segments, use a small, sharp knife to remove the core and seeds – the segments will now look like crescent moons.Whisk the reserved tablespoon of lemon juice with the wine, sugar, allspice, vanilla, orange juice and peel, 100ml pomegranate juice and 120ml water. Tip the wine mixture and drained quince segments into a high-sided baking dish that’s just big enough to hold the segments without them overlapping too much. Cover tightly with foil, bake for 40 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for another 35 minutes, basting two or three times, until the quince is soft and has taken on the colour of the wine. Add the remaining three tablespoons of pomegranate juice and leave to cool.Meanwhile, put the goat’s cheese and icing sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer with the whisk attachment in place. Whisk slowly to make the cheese as smooth as possible, then add the cream, vanilla, allspice and orange zest, and whisk again on medium speed, until the mixture thickens enough to hold its shape – about one to two minutes – then refrigerate.For the crumble, gently heat the butter in a small saucepan on a medium heat for about six minutes, swirling the pan from time to time, until the butter begins to foam, turn brown and smell nutty and caramelised. Set aside to cool for a few minutes. Roughly crush the amaretti and Hobnobs, then mix in a bowl with the hazelnuts, allspice, the cooled butter and a generous pinch of flaked salt. To serve, spoon a large scoop of cheesecake mix into each bowl and top with some crumble. Spoon the quince and syrup on top, and finish with more crumble and a final drizzle of syrup."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9ebdfd732764928a71b7c35bef8b8818823df55/0_19_1714_1028/master/1714.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8ab69a94870b46e156bb355d81f43a7","title":"quiz litty shook or goat can you talk tween","story":"Finstagram, spilling tea and looking snatched.

Oh, the cornices and the eaves you might have missed! The kites in trees! The tall, handsome strangers with long, smooth necks. The pattern in the clouds that looks like a pig – or is it a bear? The outline of the UK, while the union lasts. The old brickwork adverts on the sides of Victorian buildings. The unexpectedly witty graffiti on the railway bridge. The ascending, spiralling, iron balustrades.Always look up. If you live in the country: look up for the stars and their constellations, or the book-lined studies of farmhouses, peeked through windows. If you live in the city: look up for the glass and the steel stretching higher and higher. I even like the Shard. If you’re abroad and walking through dusty, narrow streets somewhere, look up to see the patterns of rugs thrown over balcony railings to air.Looking down yields fewer rewards. The same feet you have known all your life, even if shod in spectacular shoes. Perhaps a gorgeous, reddening autumn leaf, but look overhead and there’ll be more. Dogs and cats, of course, are the exception to the rule here. But looking up reveals new treasures and pleasures all of the time.It took me a few years to notice the Antony Gormley figure on top of Exeter College on Broad Street in Oxford. It took me riding on the top decks of buses (the best way) to notice multiple murals of butterflies in Camberwell, south London, before learning about the species of butterfly they all celebrated, originally native to the area (look up, too, to see actual butterflies). I focused on the cafe at the top of Mount Snowdon, scrambling up the scree as my bare knees became patterned with tiny stones, to will me on. I stumbled across a tree slap bang in the middle of London – in Hyde Park – home to glorious lime green parakeets. They will swoop down and peck at slices of apples if you offer them.

The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, sparked anger in the summer by suggesting rail workers should have pay rises tied to the lower rate if they wished to keep fares lower.Darren Shirley, the chief executive of the Campaign for Better Transport, said: “Rail passengers have endured enough this year, with botched timetable changes and delays to their journeys which led to the worst punctuality figures for 12 years.“The government should introduce a fares freeze from January. Any future fare increases should be based on the consumer price index rather than an outdated and discredited measure of inflation. Rail travel should be affordable so passengers aren’t left struggling with the cost of their commute.”Anthony Smith, the chief executive of the Transport Focus watchdog, echoed calls for a fairer, clearer fares formula based on CPI. “Many passengers, still reeling from summer timetable chaos and frustrated by ‘autumn’ disruption, won’t believe fares are going up again.“Passengers now pour over £10bn a year into the rail industry alongside significant government investment, so the rail industry cannot be short of funding. When will this translate into a more reliable railway and better value for money for passengers?”Labour said fares should have been frozen on GTR and Northern, which were particularly affected by the timetabling chaos. The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said: “With fuel duty frozen over the last eight years while bus and rail fares have been allowed to soar, it’s difficult not to conclude that this government is anti-public transport.”Paul Plummer, the chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, said: “Nobody wants to pay more to travel, especially those who experienced significant disruption earlier this year. Money from fares is underpinning the improvements to the railway that passengers want and which ultimately help boost the wider economy.”However, rail passengers who got in touch with the  expressed dismay at the continuing fare rises.Julie Apps, 49, a bookseller who commutes from Dorking to Guildford, said: “My train has been late every time I’ve taken it – and it is often cancelled, often at the last minute and then we can see it run empty through the station.”She said that even though she was a part-time worker she was planning to buy an annual season ticket, the price of which is going up to £1,620 and will cost her more money than daily fares, to avoid the stress of buying a ticket from an unmanned station. “Even though they have put in new ticket machines they break down all the time.”Peter Croasdale, 54, an NHS worker at Guy’s hospital in London, commutes from Preston Park in Brighton to London Bridge on a £3,968 annual season ticket, which is set to rise by £134 to £4,092. He said: “I think my season ticket is good value considering how often I use the service and how far I travel each week. However, as an NHS worker I have had barely any pay rise in the last eight years and the cost of this ticket has increased way beyond any pay rise I may have received.”Alison Bunce, 44, a video editor, who commutes from Ash Vale, Surrey, to Richmond, south-west London, on South Western, will pay £3,256 in 2019. She said: “Considering the woeful service, the fares are far too high. Every year we are promised that the fare increase will pay for maintenance and so forth, which will mean the service is more reliable. Every year it gets worse.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/755257b1e2fad6b8a902c1b704d6d73ac09495e4/0_930_2574_1544/master/2574.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfeeefa66d2dae6d02f7ed8bff3dcc65","title":"katherine jenkins mezzo soprano everything want home","story":"The mezzo-soprano on lack of nerves, not speaking between performances and putting on a show with her kidsI get up at 6.30am to feed my seven-month-old son, Xander, but as a morning person, I have lots of energy.

The artist formerly known as Scary Spice was enjoying success as a judge on The X Factor, the public adored her once again, and most important of all, she was ecstatically in love with her husband, Stephen Belafonte. Not only were they soulmates, she told me, they shared an extraordinary intimacy after seven years of marriage, they had sex five times a day. They were so compatible, she said, that she had basically married herself. She showed me the wedding-vow-renewal ring he had just bought her, and told me she was the luckiest woman in the world.Only it turns out she was lying.In her new memoir, Brutally Honest, Brown reveals that her marriage could not have been more unhappy. She claims Belafonte was abusive, and that she could only get through the day by snorting cocaine for breakfast. Had she not finally gathered the courage to leave, she believes she may well have ended up dead. Brown says she didn’t know the word back then, but she thinks she was a classic victim of gaslighting – made to feel so small, stupid and inadequate that she doubted her own sanity.Two weeks after that 2014 interview was published in Weekend, Brown attempted suicide. Somehow she managed to drag herself out of hospital to appear as a judge on the final of The X Factor. Viewers were shocked by her appearance: her cheek was bruised, and there were scratches on her arms. She was not wearing her wedding ring. Belafonte took to Twitter to defend himself: “I don’t usually respond to Twitter msgs but I will respond to comments of hitting my wife which I think are quite disgusting un true!” Meanwhile, Brown said she had a stomach ulcer.It’s an astonishing story – not least because this is Scary Spice we’re talking about, the girl in the leopardskin with a tongue stud, the very personification of girl power. What happened?Today, we meet in a photo studio in London. I can hear her laughter – throaty, raucous – before I see her. Brown, now 43, tends to dominate a room. She is in a white dressing robe, getting made up and giving her team the lowdown on Peter Andre, a former boyfriend. “He was my booty call – a fantastic lover. And he was so polite. He’d ask before he kissed me!” She has lived in Los Angeles for years now, but her accent is unchanged – vowels hard and flat as slabs of concrete. And she still likes to talk about sex – her voracious appetite, her many lovers, her attraction to men and women. Nothing’s changed on that front but as she will tell me, there is a distinction between all this and being pressured into activities she was unhappy with, or having them filmed without her knowledge by her former husband.I ask if she remembers showing me that ring four years ago. “Yes. I should have said, ‘Look what I bought myself.’ Yeah. Crazy.” Why did she lie about the ring being a gift? “You condition yourself. It was just lie after lie after lie, and I got used to lying. I didn’t want anyone to find out what was going on.” Of course she told people she loved her husband, she says – what else would she say? “It was just a spiel. And inside I’d be thinking, ‘You’ve no idea how evil this person is I’m going to have to go home to in a few hours. Can I please stay at work a little bit longer – or is there a park I can go to with my kids?’”Brown’s friends and family had warned her against Belafonte, an American film producer who already had previous. In 2003, he pleaded no contest to a charge of battery against his former partner, estate agent Nicole Contreras. He also has convictions for theft and vandalism, and admitted to beating a duck to death with a brick.When they met, she says, she was in a vulnerable place, having recently separated from the actor Eddie Murphy. After Brown became pregnant a few months into their relationship, Murphy had told a journalist: “I don’t know whose child that is until it comes out and has a blood test.” Brown was portrayed in the press as a ruthless gold-digger – ironic considering she was worth a fortune at the time. A DNA test proved that Murphy was the father, and he now sees 11-year-old Angel regularly but the relationship was over.For how long was he like this? “A few weeks… months?” She smiles, realising how pitiable that sounds. “But it’s done in a very passive-aggressive way, so you don’t really know what’s going on and you start to blame yourself. ‘Maybe I can do better as a wife. I need to be more attentive, I need to make him happier.’ I didn’t want another failed marriage. So I stay in it, and it just snowballs.”Does she think he loved her? “No. No. No.” She weighs up each no, becoming more emphatic. “What he did, you can’t do that to someone if you love them. No, he didn’t love me.”It’s hard to reconcile this with the fearless Mel B we thought we knew – the kid who was regularly grounded by her father for failing to do her schoolwork or wearing short skirts the 16-year-old who left home to dance in Blackpool clubs the 18-year-old who answered an advert in the Stage for a “streetwise, outgoing, ambitious, dedicated” girl to audition for an all-female pop act the 21-year-old who became a household name as in-your-face Scary. The Spice Girls were an instant phenomenon, still the bestselling female group of all time.While the swagger and insouciance have always been part of her character, Brown says that in other ways she is an old-fashioned girl who just wants to please. Her parents might have stood out, as a mixed-race couple in 1970s Leeds (her father was from St Kitts and Nevis, her mother is white and Yorkshire-born), but they were conservative. They wanted their daughter to get a decent education, hold down a good job, to marry and stay married.Brown felt she had let her parents down when she orced Jimmy Gulzar (her backing dancer in the Spice Girls and Phoenix’s father) in 2000, after only 16 months of marriage. After Angel’s birth, she felt she had let herself down again, a single mother of two children by two different men. In 2011, she had a third daughter, Madison, with Belafonte. The last thing she wanted, she says, was to embarrass her family by being the single mother of three daughters. So she hung on. And, of course, there was another factor: she felt terrified.Last year, she stated in her orce papers that she had been “subjected to multiple physical beatings”. One example cited occurred in 2012, when she was rehearsing for an appearance on Australia’s X Factor with R\u0026ampB star Usher. She alleged that Belafonte “flew into a rage, claiming I had been flirting with Usher all day” and “punched me in the face with a closed fist”. Every detail was fodder for the tabloids. Meanwhile, lawyers for Belafonte branded the allegations “outrageous and unfounded” and “nothing more than a smear campaign”. (She later withdrew allegations of physical abuse.)One of the things that attracted her to Belafonte, she says, was that he had a libido to rival hers. Early on in their marriage, they decided to experiment with threesomes. “I didn’t say, ‘Ooh, don’t be so disgusting.’ I thought, ‘No this is the man who loves me, we could try that once in a while, it’s fine.’” The only thing Brown insisted on was that the person was female, which suited Belafonte.But, she says, she quickly tired of the threesomes. “After the first few times I didn’t enjoy it, but he would want to do it more often. I’d be thinking, ‘We’ve only been married a few months – why do we need to do that?’ But then something abusive would happen which made me shut up about it.”Belafonte told her that he had filmed their sexual activities without her knowledge, as well as her taking drugs and he threatened to use the footage to destroy her. “I was being blackmailed with videos. He’d say, ‘I’m going to expose you, you’re never going to be able to work again. I’m going to send these videos out to the press, and everyone is going to see what a mess you are.’”She claims that the relationship quickly became coercive. For example, he would insist they went to the annual Playboy Mansion party in Beverly Hills, against her will despite appearances, she says, she is quite shy. At the mansion, he would expect her to find a woman they could take home.It sounds as if you were procuring women, I say. “What does procuring mean?” she asks. (Brown recently discovered she is dyslexic, and has started carrying a dictionary around with her.) Pimping, I say. “Of course I was. Some years, I would just stand my ground and say I’m not going, but there were massive fights. He would almost send me out and I’d bring back the girl.”Belafonte took control of the family finances, arguing that Brown was too busy to look after her money, and it was best if he did. “It comes across as, ‘Oh God he really loves me, he’s looking after me, I don’t have to worry about this.’ Then he’s planting the seeds to be able to have the credit card to my bank account. But it doesn’t happen overnight. It’s bit by bit, very strategically done.”By now, she had stopped seeing friends and family. Before long, she says, she had become cut off from nearly everybody she loved – even her daughters. The family moved home frequently, but always to multistorey houses she and Belafonte would live at the top, while the children were four floors below.Before long, she felt incapable of fighting back. But you always seemed so strong, I say. “No,” she says. “I’m only strong in certain ways. I’ve been painfully weak.” How? “There was a point when I was like, ‘Yeah, I am a really bad person. I am ugly, I am worth nothing. I am a has-been Spice Girl.’ All these negative things that would be drilled into me on a daily basis by him. You start to believe it.”I mention one horrific part of the book when she describes waking up lying in urine, faeces and blood. “And vomit,” she adds. What had happened? “Sometimes I would have been in such panic or shock that I’d have been physically sick. Part of that cycle is you get blamed: ‘Look what you’ve done to the sheets.’ And you go, ‘Oh my God, I’m so sorry.’ And you clean it up, or throw it away and that’s that.” She says it with a kind of no-nonsense finality.What happened the day she tried to kill herself? “I just wanted that pain to go,” Brown says. “I didn’t want to exist.” What had brought it on? “The whole 10 years. I don’t remember what happened that day. I’ve got PTSD – I’m very raw about what I felt.” But as soon as she swallowed the last pill in the bottle, she thought of her girls, screamed, and decided she had to live. She called a security guard, who got her help.Brown was always the main breadwinner, and thankfully she says Belafonte wanted to keep it that way. “That was when I felt in control – when I was on TV, or in photoshoots, or being interviewed. That’s what kept me somewhat sane.” She talks about the relief of being able to escape to Australia to film The X Factor for a few weeks. “But then you go, ‘Well, I’m married and I have to go back to that.’ And you don’t see a way out.”There was another factor in her decision to stay. In 2009, Brown’s father was diagnosed with cancer. Even though she was estranged from her family, she was desperate not to upset them further. She was convinced that, if she left Belafonte, he would publicise every detail of their relationship and that the shame would kill her father. She decided she had to wait for her father to die first.In 2017, she got a call telling her that her father did not have long left, and rushed from LA to Leeds. “When I walked into the hospital room, he hadn’t spoken in months. And he looked at me and whispered, ‘I love you.’ His whole body was shaking, then he went back into a coma.” On his death bed, she told him she was leaving Belafonte.At her lowest, whom could she talk to about her marriage? “Nobody. Because saying it out loud to anybody else I’d have to admit it. My two youngest didn’t see what was happening. But Phoenix would hear me crying, so she knew all wasn’t great in paradise.” In her book, Brown accuses Jimmy Gulzar of leeching off her and having anger issues, and says Eddie Murphy didn’t like her to leave his sight. Has she had any good relationships? She reels off the names of some of the men who have not abused her – Murphy included. “Max Beesley. Peter Andre. Eddie. They’re all lovely guys. I’ve had some really kind, loving relationships.” Wasn’t her relationship with Murphy still a cage, albeit a gilded one? “Well, yes and no. He’s very ‘family’, which I love. Eddie’s just a homebody.”Brown writes that her relationship with Murphy was romantic and loving, far from a casual fling. Has he ever acknowledged that? “Well, we’ll see when the book comes out!” It’s the first time in a while I’ve heard that laugh. Brown also reveals that she was the one who walked out, after a row over her independence (she wanted them to buy a house together, he wanted to buy it for her). She flew back to Leeds, refusing to answer his calls. That’s when he told a TV reporter he didn’t know if he was the father of their baby.Brown insists she had always planned to go back to him. But if it was just a bit of an argument, why on earth didn’t you answer his calls, I say? No wonder he assumed it was all over. She sounds shocked, as if she’s just considered it for the first time. “I guess that does make sense,” she says quietly. “I thought he knew I was coming back. I was always coming back. That was a given.”When Brown finally left Belafonte last year, she walked out of the house with just $936 (he controlled most of their accounts). How much did she have at her peak? “Gazillions. Millions and millions and millions.” She says it was liberating walking away with so little. “I took back my freedom. And I knew, from that day forward, that I’d know where my money is going.”In the orce papers, Belafonte’s lawyer claimed she had “wiped out all of her Spice Girls’ money, approximately $50m, if not more”. Brown’s legal team claimed that the videotapes, which the couple shared with lawyers, showed she was drugged by Belafonte, and then forced to perform “non-consensual” sex acts. Belafonte’s lawyers insisted they had footage proving she gave her consent. When they finally settled, she agreed to pay him an estimated £1.5m over three years and £3.5m from the sale of their house. She withdrew the allegations of physical abuse, while he agreed not to show the tapes. Brown was ordered to pay Belafonte $40,000 a month in spousal support.Two weeks ago, Brown was awarded joint custody of their seven-year-old daughter, Madison, after passing several weeks of drug and alcohol testing. Both Brown and Belafonte were ordered to stay 200 yards away from each other, and Brown was ordered to pay his $350,000 legal fees.Is she now Poor Spice? She laughs, and says no chance: she’s already on her way back. “Fortunately, in the last year and a half, I’ve actually earned a shitload of money. All the contracts he took charge of, I’m now managing myself.” As well as the lucrative Spice Girls reunion, there will reportedly be a return to America’s Got Talent.Brown is desperate for a cigarette break. We go outside, and she sparks up. She says how excited she is about the forthcoming Spice Girls tour. There will only be four of the band, though – Victoria Beckham declined. Is it true that she told Beckham to, “Fuck off, you bitch”, as has been reported, when she snubbed them? “Well, anybody who knows me knows that’s my lingo, whether it be in a jokey way or whether I’m frustrated or annoyed. I’m sure it was something along those lines, because I want all five of us to get back together. Four is better than nothing, so I’m super happy it’s happening. But if she wants to join us – fingers crossed, at some point she will.”What was Beckham’s response? “I don’t think there was one. Hahahahaha! We’re all on a group email, us five. There’s lots of love and lots of history between all five of us, and between me and Victoria. Yeah, I’m feisty, and she can be feisty, too.”She lights up another fag before the other is out. Which Spice Girl is she closest to? She mentions Geri, and then says they also argue a lot. In the book, she recounts nostalgically the days they used to drive down the motorway flashing their breasts at oncoming cars. There were rumours that you and Geri slept together, I say. “Do you mean have sex, or did we just sleep in a bed together?” Sex? “Let’s just say I slept in a bed with them all. Hahahahhahahaha! I don’t think I should answer that!” For once, discretion gets the better of her.“I’m going to chain-smoke,” she says, before sparking up again. “You know, the great thing about us five is that we’re the only five people in the world who can say, ‘I’m a Spice Girl.’ I love that. I’m part of my elite club.” It’s touching to hear her say that – not least because she spent so many years thinking that being a “has-been” Spice Girl was a mark of failure.On the way back in, we pass her leopardskin jacket, hooked round a bannister. “My old costumes still fit me. I said to the girls, ‘I’ve already got my wardrobe for the tour!’”What is she enjoying most about life now? “My freedom. And I mean that on every level.” It’s impossible to know exactly what goes on in a relationship, especially when the person providing the account admits she has been an unreliable narrator in the past – but it’s clear that Brown remains traumatised by her marriage. When she tells me what she has done to her body since leaving Belafonte, I realise how determined she is to obliterate him. When they were together, she got a tattoo down her side. “It said, ‘Stephen, till death do us part, you own my heart’.” Has she had it lasered? “No. I got it cut out. I was put under for it, and I said to the doctor, ‘Give me the ugliest scar ever because I want it to be a reminder that that ugly person is cut out of my life.’” I also read that she had vaginal rejuvenation surgery after leaving Belafonte. No, she says, that’s not quite right. “They scraped the inside of my vagina and put new tissue in. It’s almost like a rape victim would do – essentially, you want to scrub yourself clean.”I tell her I’m thinking about that 2014 interview, when she talked about how much she loved herself and said, well, if she didn’t, then who would? “I do believe that. Did I love myself then? I probably loathed myself. But I can genuinely say now: yes, I do love myself. And I did when I entered into my marriage and that got chipped away. I allowed that to be chipped away.”Having come through it all, she says she feels better than she has in decades. Every day she rejoices in her new freedoms – to play her music full blast, to e-bomb in her LA pool with the girls, to practise reiki, to keep a pet goat. “As soon as I walked into our new house, just little things make me cry on the inside – the girls can sit at a table and play. I’m so happy living a life where they can just be kids and be with their mum. I think I’m more confident than I’ve ever been. Ever ever ever. Because I had no confidence for so many years and I had to nurture myself, almost bring myself back to life.”What does she hope people get out of the book? She mentions the final page, headlined Fifteen Signs Of Abuse. “I want it to be helpful to other women who have gone through it, or who are going through it. There are so many women that this has happened to. It’s an epidemic. I’m not just talking about the #MeToo movement, I’m talking about everywhere – from a council estate in Leeds to what’s going on in parliament. You hear of other people and think, ‘Well, that’s just a doomed relationship – that’s never going to happen to me.’ You never think you’re going to be eating, breathing, living that life. And then you are and you’re in denial: there’s no way out.”But you did get out, I say. “Yeah, I know. Many women don’t make it out alive, and if they do they’re badly damaged. I’m one of the lucky ones.” • Brutally Honest by Melanie Brown with Louise Gannon is published by Quadrille Publishing at £17.99.

Family members of other detainees and former detainees who have chosen to keep their cases private were also present.Some at the table could recall their joy at their own loved one’s release. Others could only imagine and, in Ratcliffe’s words, “feed off Daniela’s happiness”.The gathering showed not just the emotional bond that is formed in fighting for the release of a family member, but how much of that fight involves finely balanced judgments about publicity and relations with the UK Foreign Office.Many family members, as well as the NGOs that work alongside them, have an opinion on how the Foreign Office treats these consular cases, and it is not always flattering.Ratcliffe, who went public after only 36 days of his wife’s captivity, largely exempts Jeremy Hunt, the new foreign secretary, from his criticism. He said: “Iranians can sense double standards, and the fact that Hunt seems to have made these human rights cases a defining aspects of his foreign secretaryship really helps.”But he said the Foreign Office had an “institutional bias” for keeping things private. “They do not want publicity. They like softly-softly and say don’t politicise, exacerbate or offend, even to the point of initially struggling to say Nazanin was innocent. They cannot grasp the seriousness of the issue. They would prefer you go away and, like a GP, want to send you off with an aspirin.”Tejada questioned whether the Foreign Office was truly neutral in decisions about a detainee’s family going public. She said: “The FCO say that it is up to every family to decide whether to go public or not. In my experience, however, I wish I had received more support in my decision to do so instead of constantly being made to doubt this was a good option.”Polly Truscott, a foreign affairs expert at Amnesty UK, said: “We do not always recommend going public. It is hard for the family to be in the limelight. The argument is that if we go public the country will dig in its heels, raise the price and and make it harder to get the person out. You are increasing the value of the detainee by politicising it.” There may also be family members in the country that could suffer reprisals.Maya Foa, the director of Reprieve, which focuses on detainees facing the death penalty, said: “If the Foreign Office says to us ‘don’t do it’, we take it seriously. You don’t discount it even if they have a tendency to say it in all cases. I have said to the Foreign Office: ‘If you or anyone else can give us a credible reason or say something positive is on the move, we will go silent immediately.’”In some countries, such as China, and in some kinds of cases, such as blasphemy, Foa said her instinct was not to go public.But the Foreign Office’s faith in private persuasion may be a smokescreen for diplomats to do little, either due to inertia or a considered calculation about the wider national interest.Ratcliffe said he knew of few families that had not regretted not going public earlier.In Hedges’s case, the initial consular support seems to have been minimal. Tejeda was told that the Foreign Office could not disclose any information to her about her husband as it would be a breach of the General Data Privacy Regulations, and so a breach of Hedges’s privacy rights. The first meeting between a Foreign Office official and Hedges was largely consumed with asking him to authorise the government to communicate with his wife about his welfare.This blend of Kafka and PC Plod led Tejada to become so frustrated she sought advice from a lawyer, Rodney Dixon QC, who specialises in human rights cases in the Gulf. His advice was that she should go public.Tejada had certain advantages, Bernardi said. “Daniela is very intelligent, articulate and strong-willed. She was culturally attuned to the UAE and knew it well.”Tejeda rejected a campaign pitched at the tabloids and went upmarket. “The aim was to set up a political campaign that was directed at the Foreign Office and not aimed at calling out the UAE itself,” Bernardi explained.Sometimes these campaigns are designed to boost the morale of an isolated prisoner, but Hedges did not know what was being done on his behalf. When he was released on a form of bail in October he was given £1,200 and told to take a taxi to Dubai. “As he left the jail, one of his warders said: ‘Your wife has been very busy,’ and he said: “What does that mean’?’ It was the first time he knew what we had been doing to win his release,” Bernardi said.The lawyer thinks a combination of the campaign, the activism of Hunt and the UAE’s fear that it might sucked into the same kind of reputational nosee as Saudi Arabia led to Hedges’ pardon.But it is not the only time the Foreign Office has soft-pedalled with the UAE. A foreign affairs select committee report in 2014 highlighted complaints from detainees about the Foreign Office’s reluctance to lobby on behalf of families.Possibly the most egregious case of Foreign Office inertia is that of Andy Tsege, who was kidnapped by the Ethiopian regime in 2014 and forcibly flown to the capital, Addis Ababa. He holds British citizenship, and his partner, Yemi, and their three children are also British and live in the UK. Reprieve found the government’s handling of the case so supine that in 2016 it sought judicial review to force ministers to demand his release. In an open letter, the then foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said: “Britain does not interfere in the legal systems of other countries by challenging convictions any more than we would accept interference in our judicial system.”The Foreign Office argued that calling for his release or reducing its commitment to the Ethiopian people would not be helpful and indeed might damage the progress made in gaining consular access for Tsege.Foa described the letter as disgraceful and said the UK would not apply the doctrine of non-interference in commercial cases.“Sometimes you have to speak out,” she said. “Andy Tsege was silenced. To give him a voice was to keep him alive, literally and metaphorically.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b69f17c524bd27a7bd788b24d9339cf3cc64fbc7/0_0_3431_2059/master/3431.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d82810760d694b2122343c7ab048db0a","title":"may v corbyn on brexit the debate over the debate","story":"BBC, ITV or stepping aside for a celebrity edition of The Chase? Whatever, you don’t get to decideWith little over a week to go until parliament votes on Theresa May’s Brexit deal, one issue is taking up a disproportionate amount of time among Westminster’s political advisers and the nation’s broadcasters: arguing over the format of a proposed hour-long televised debate between the prime minister and Jeremy Corbyn.While the real business of selling the deal to MPs continues in parliament, the political and media class are locked in debate over the debate format. This has now splintered into various strands of subsidiary debates, each of which plays to different issues and insecurities among the political class and the general public that have emerged during the Brexit process.There’s the debate over whether the BBC is too close to the government and is too willing to work with the Conservatives to refine its format and secure the broadcast. There’s the debate over whether supporters of a hard Brexit or a second referendum should be represented during the broadcast or whether it should simply feature the two main party leaders. And, perhaps most importantly, there’s the debate over whether broadcasters can justify ripping up a Sunday night TV schedule filled with popular light entertainment shows for a dry debate about politics.This has led advisers at the top of the two largest political parties to ponder questions that are usually beyond their remit: would they be popular with the British public if the debate replaced an episode of David Attenborough’s Dynasties or a celebrity edition of The Chase?“These debates are elaborate displacement activity because they’re not actually dealing with the people who are voting,” said Craig Oliver, who as David Cameron’s director of communications led the painfully lengthy negotiations over debate formats during the 2015 general election. “I think Downing Street are trying to call Jeremy Corbyn’s bluff and show they have a position, while saying Corbyn doesn’t have a position.”The starting gun was fired on Sunday night when May’s aides briefed the Daily  that she would challenge Corbyn to a live television debate. Perhaps unexpectedly, Labour swiftly accepted the challenge in principle, prompting a swiftly arranged beauty contest in which the BBC, ITV and Sky News took turns to pitch to both major parties.Sky, aware of its relative size, offered to host a straightforward debate, presenting itself as a neutral host who would offer the footage to other bigger broadcasters. ITV promised a head-to-head on Sunday night with all the questions posed by Julie Etchingham and no studio audience.The BBC, knowing the threat posed by complaints about partiality, said its debate would be hosted in Birmingham and would include 10 prominent supporters of May’s deal and 10 opponents who would have the chance to ask questions, a format which Labour felt was “messy and confusing” – while also giving May the chance to paint her opponents as squabbling among themselves.On Tuesday night Labour let it be known it wanted the ITV option. But the following morning the BBC and Downing Street issued a joint statement challenging Labour to participate in the event on the public broadcaster. Absolutely no one was happy, with Labour feeling the BBC was attempting to bounce it into accepting a format which played to May’s strengths.“The format with the most integrity is the ITV one,” said Oliver. “The BBC one is an overly elaborate mechanism that will be unlikely to have anything other than heat in it, it will just be a vehicle for soundbites.”Claims of skulduggery abound. Labour and the rival broadcasters all claim that Downing Street had been in discussions with the BBC for several weeks before they publicly proposed holding the televised head-to-head. They base this on a leaked media planning grid published at the start of the November which shows the party had planned a one-on-one interview with David Dimbleby for the prime minister.Under this theory, May’s challenge to Corbyn was a quick media headline which accidentally spiralled into something bigger when Labour accepted. Rival broadcasters also mutter over the influence of May’s head of communications, Robbie Gibb, who until last year was the BBC’s head of political programming and was responsible for organising the corporation’s election debates – which May chose to skip.As things stand, there is still no agreement for a programme pencilled in for Sunday 9 December. “The ball is in Labour’s court,” said a Downing Street source. The expectation is that Corbyn’s team will eventually have to cave in and accept the BBC proposal – perhaps aided by the corporation’s head of current affairs, Fran Unsworth, making further concessions on the number of people on the panel – or look as though they are running scared.The only thing that both the Conservatives and Labour can agree on is that they want to exclude smaller political parties from the stage, prompting furious complaints from the SNP and the People’s Vote campaign. Meanwhile, Channel 4 could be tempted into producing a cheeky spoiler programme featuring other sides of the debate.Oliver insists that no one in the UK has yet found the best format for a discussion between political leaders: “What we realised about the television debate format is that they are not debates, they are vehicles to deliver messages. Basically you just get up there with a whole series of points and work out how you’re going to land them.”He said this was especially pronounced when ITV ended up hosting a discussion featuring seven leaders during the 2015 election: “David Cameron went down the line and said ‘you want to raise taxes, you want to raise taxes’. We had planned it and he did it. It becomes a basic method of message delivery rather than a real debate.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f034d7537d5c1177646b18698586744629fe022c/0_249_5119_3073/master/5119.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e59a92fc33b7849045b7647a87eb6b04","title":"rightwing thinktank deletes offer of access to ministers for donors","story":"Adam Smith Institute offered £1,000 donors invites to ‘power lunches and patrons dinners’One of the UK’s most influential rightwing thinktanks has deleted passages from its website promising access to government ministers in exchange for donations after the  began making inquiries about its funding.The Adam Smith Institute, a neoliberal thinktank credited with inspiring some of the most controversial privatisations of the Thatcher and Major governments, offered invitations to “power lunches and patrons dinners with influential figures, including politicians, ministers, journalists and academics” to anyone donating £1,000 a year.The regulator, the Charity Commission, said on Friday that it had started examining the institute’s accounts for “potential areas of non-compliance” with accounting rules.It is the second rightwing thinktank whose conduct is being examined by the commission for possible breaches of the rules.Earlier this year the chief executive of the Institute of Economic Affairs was filmed by an undercover reporter appearing to promise a potential donor access to a minister in exchange for funding a report on agribusiness. The group says it is “spurious to suggest that the IEA is engaging in any kind of ‘cash for access’ system” and denies wrongdoing.The Adam Smith Institute is made up of three different entities: a British company, a British charity and an American non-profit foundation, each with different rules on tax and the ability to carry out political activity.In a 2012 book, Madsen Pirie, one of the institute’s founders, said: “It was a very messy patchwork and it took us years to sort it out.

By Wednesday several passages on the institute’s website had been deleted, including the sentence: “We are a registered charity in the UK.” A lengthy passage describing a “two-pronged strategy for changing the world” was also deleted, as well as a section listing benefits for the institute’s financial backers. It is unclear why this was done.Those contributing £1,000 a year were offered “opportunities to attend power lunches and patrons dinners with influential figures, including politicians, ministers, journalists and academics.”Donors paying £5,000 a year were promised “a private events list, from which you can choose the Power Lunches and Patrons dinners you wish to attend.”Financial accounts indicate that between at least 1993 and 2002 the UK company ASI Research was regularly loaned thousands of pounds by the UK charity Adam Smith Research Trust. The company began filing abbreviated accounts after 2002, making it impossible to see if the loans continued.A spokesperson for the Adam Smith Institute explained that the UK charity reimbursed the UK company for costs it incurred in the course of business as a non-profit service company, rather than making grants.“While it seems this structure was a common one some decades ago, it can on occasion lead to imbalances and hence the loan account that appeared in the 1990s,” the spokesperson said. “This complied with the advice of lawyers and accountants at the time and was fully reported in the public accounts of both bodies.”The Charity Commission said: “All trustees of all charities must ensure they preserve their charity’s independence and make decisions that are solely in furtherance of their charity’s purposes.“The public rightly expect trustees of charities to take these responsibilities seriously, and demonstrate accountability to the public for the way in which their charity is governed, and the work their charity undertakes.“An important factor in demonstrating transparency is ensuring financial accounts are compliant with the accounting framework. We can confirm that we are examining the Adam Smith Research Trust’s financial accounts to examine potential areas of non-compliance with that framework.”The development comes amid questions about the political campaigning activities of a network of thinktanks and groups linked to an address in Tufton Street in Westminster."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ec8e9ef84d2aacbe3922b5e7d6007d8e6adf0b2/0_176_2048_1228/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aab040f5855de5652b5c64d44aaed0a1","title":"brexit uk may never recover 12bn invested in eu galileo satellite system","story":"British armed forces will not get access to Galileo, a rival to the US GPS system, after BrexitThe UK may never claw back £1.2bn of investment in Galileo, the EU’s satellite navigation system, as Theresa May officially pulled the plug on UK defence and security participation in the system after Brexit.Galileo, developed as a rival to the US GPS system, is due to be launched in 2020 with civilian and military variants. The UK’s continued involvement, given the extent of British funding of the system, has been at the centre of some of the bitterest rows of the Brexit negotiations.Britain has already contributed £1.2bn to the creation of Galileo, which has an overall cost of £9bn, but the EU has begun to exclude Britain from the security aspects of its development.British armed forces were due to have access to Galileo’s encrypted system when it is fully operational in 2026. However, government and security agencies have concluded it would not be in the UK’s security interests to use the system’s secure elements if it had not been fully involved in their development.The text of the political declaration which May secured with Brussels last week on the future relationship gave only a terse one-line statement on future cooperation. “The parties should consider appropriate arrangements for cooperation on space,” it said.On Friday, May officially announced that the UK would be pulling out of the system and made no mention of any attempt to recoup the UK’s investment.She added: “So what is in our national interest is to say no, you haven’t allowed us full access, so we will develop an alternative, we will look at alternative options, we are doing that work but we will work with other international partners to do so as well.”Whitehall sources said the issue of the £1.2bn was yet to be finally resolved because the UK could still choose to be involved in commercial aspects of the system. “We will be discussing our past contributions to the financing of Galileo in the upcoming talks,” a senior UK official said.Downing Street said the UK would explore options to build its own Global Navigation Satellite system to help guide military drones, run energy networks and other commercial uses. May said the UK had “world-class engineers and steadfast allies around the world. We are not short of options.”Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, said the development of a new system would be an opportunity to draw on British skills and expertise in satellite technology. “Space poses a new and increasingly dangerous front for warfare and it is crucial to push ahead with plans for our own world-class, independent satellite system,” he said.Signs that the UK had accepted it would be forced out of the system were apparent in August when the UK Space Agency announced a £92m feasibility study of a national alternative to the Galileo programme. Number 10 said a series of key contracts were now being tendered.The government now plans for possible collaboration on a new system with other countries such as those in the FiveEyes intelligence alliance and hopes to use some British overseas territories and Crown dependencies for a global network of locations necessary for infrastructure and worldwide coverage.The development of the system may be raised in several bilateral meetings May will hold with world leaders on Saturday at the G20 summit in Argentina. The prime minister will meet her Canadian and Australian counterparts, Justin Trudeau and Scott Morrison respectively.

On Friday, he became the seventh minister to quit Theresa May’s government over the issue.Gyimah said the deal on offer would mean the UK lost its voice in the European Union, while still having to abide by the bloc’s rules.“In these protracted negotiations, our interests will be repeatedly and permanently hammered by the EU27 for many years to come. Britain will end up worse off, transformed from rule makers into rule takers,” he wrote in an article for the Daily .“It has become increasingly clear to me that the proposed deal is not in the British national interest, and that to vote for this deal is to set ourselves up for failure. We will be losing, not taking control of our national destiny.”And the Conservative MP for East Surrey, who voted to remain in the EU, said May should not rule out holding a second referendum.The resignation is a fresh blow to the prime minister, who has been trying to get on the front foot in the fight to force her deal through parliament on 11 December.The Democratic Unionist party, which struck a confidence and supply deal with the Tories after the last election and upon whom May relies heavily, has already indicated it would not support her plan. And many of her own MPs, as well as the Labour party, do not back it either.Gyimah’s resignation triggered an outpouring of support from Tory remainers, including two former ministers, who highlighted his suggestion that a second referendum was an idea worth considering now May’s deal had been made public.Jo Johnson, who quit from his job as rail minister over Brexit earlier this month, said Gyimah’s resignation was “strong and principled” and welcomed his openness to “giving the public the final say”.The former education secretary and leading supporter of the campaign for a second referendum Justine Greening said: “Like many MPs he has recognised the huge shortcomings of the prime minister’s deal and the need to find an alternative path forward for Britain.”She was backed by the Lib Dems’ education spokesperson, Layla Moran, who said Gyimah’s resignation was yet more evidence the prime minister did not have the support of parliament. “The list of Tory rebels for May’s deal gets longer and longer and she is now searching for a new universities minister as well as votes. This government is falling apart and the decision must be taken back to the public.”Earlier this week, Gyimah was spotted at a breakfast meeting in Westminster with Johnson and the soft Brexit-supporting ministers, Greg Clark, David Gauke and Margot James, prompting speculation about plotting by those on the left of the party.With speculation about further resignations swirling on Friday night, James swiftly declared she was not going to quit, saying: “I fully intend to support the deal the PM is putting to parliament on 11 December.”Gyimah is likely to join the People’s Vote second referendum campaign, after talking to Johnson and Greening in the run up to his departure. But, with the ink barely dry on his resignation letter, he has yet to decide precisely what he intends to do.Chief among his concerns was the protracted negotiations over Galileo, the EU’s strategic satellite navigation system. The government has said UK defence and security services would no longer participate after Brexit and it emerged on Friday that the country may never claw back £1.2bn it had already invested.Gyimah said the prime minister was right to withdraw from the negotiation, which he said was “stacked against us from the very beginning”. But he added: “Galileo is only a foretaste of what’s to come under the government’s Brexit deal.”He wrote: “There is a mountain to climb, and we are still in the foothills. Under the deal we will have only two, at most four, years to agree at least five times what has been settled to date.“With so much left to negotiate, we must take a clear-eyed view on the strength of our position.” Gyimah said the EU had held the cards so far in the negotiations and time was not on the UK’s side. “All of this points to an off-the-shelf deal dictated by the EU that will be materially worse for my constituents in East Surrey than staying in.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5e2dfc1a811ea58069756294745ff3d06b2465b/0_251_4618_2771/master/4618.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=597f03bb014ef18fe2d073fae82d10a4","title":"snp and lib dems back benn amendment to prevent no deal brexit","story":"Parties join Labour and Tory rebels in amendment rejecting May’s deal and giving MPs a say on next step Theresa May’s plans to get her Brexit deal through parliament ran into fresh difficulties on Friday as it emerged that a “no to no deal” amendment submitted by Labour’s Hilary Benn with the support of two Tories had won the backing of the SNP and Lib Dems.Joanna Cherry, an SNP frontbench MP, said her party’s 35 MPs would support Benn’s “excellent” amendment, which rejects both May’s deal and a no-deal Brexit and gives parliament a say in what the government would do next.The Lib Dems also said they would give their support, alongside Labour and the Tory rebels who declared their backing on Thursday, meaning that it has a chance of success if the other minor parties and a dozen or so more Conservatives follow suit.Benn said his amendment declined to approve May’s deal, rejected the UK leaving the European Union without a deal, and “enables parliament to express a view, to see if there was an alternative that could get support”.The current legislation means that if May’s deal is rejected on 11 December, the government must make a statement within 21 days to say what it will do in the light of the defeat. That would present a serious blow to the prime minister, although she could in theory return with essentially the same deal and put it to the house again.But if ministers were to propose a no-deal Brexit, the existing rules make it difficult for MPs to overturn that because the legislation only provides for parliament to note the government’s decision at that point.MPs who support a hard Brexit are planning to simply vote against May’s final deal, once all the amendments have been dealt with – but the consequences of that make an economically damaging no-deal scenario more likely.Benn hopes his amendment would allow MPs who might otherwise have supported the prime minister because they are concerned about the risks of crashing out of the EU without a deal to vote against May’s Brexit plan. An estimated 94 Conservative MPs have said they will vote down May’s final deal, but the prime minister insisted that she was pressing ahead with the vote regardless.“When it comes to the vote that people are being asked to make in the House of Commons, I think we should remember that we gave the vote to the British people as to whether or not to leave the EU,” May said in an interview with the BBC during her trip to the G20 in Argentina.When pressed, the prime minister would not rule out trying to stage a second vote shortly to try and win approval at the second time of asking. “I’m focused on the vote that is taking place on December 11 and I want everybody who is going to participate, all the MPs, to focus on what this vote does,” she added.May also avoided answering whether she would be prime minister in a fortnight if she were defeated. “What I’m doing is focusing on that vote because this is not about me or any inidual member of parliament,” she said and called on every MP to put the national interest first.No 10 sources denied they would consider pulling the vote in the middle of the debate in an attempt to see if they could wring additional concessions out of the EU, before bringing it back to parliament.There had been speculation at Westminster that the idea was being considered by the whips’ office but insiders said that the message to MPs was that the vote on 11 December was final and that the alternative was no deal, or possibly no Brexit.Liam Fox, the trade secretary and one of the cabinet’s senior Brexiters, urged MPs to get behind May’s deal, saying that MPs were voting on the legally binding withdrawal agreement the week after next – but that the future trading relationship between the UK and the EU remained up for grabs.He said: “Whatever deal we want to have in future still requires a withdrawal agreement. This is something people don’t seem to be grasping. Whether it’s the deal that the prime minister has set out for leaving the EU, or the Norway style, or the Canada plus FTA, they still require the withdrawal agreement.”Benn’s amendment was one of five submitted on Thursday, but appears to be the one most likely to cause serious difficulties for May. A Labour frontbench amendment rejecting May’s deal submitted by Jeremy Corbyn was announced earlier this week – but it is unlikely to attract any Conservative support.Three backbenchers, the Conservatives Sir Edward Leigh and Giles Watling, plus independent former Labour MP Frank Field, also put down amendments that try to neutralise the Northern Irish backstop, amid concern that it could be used by the EU to trap the UK in an indefinite customs union."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c60402de95217f20388155327bee6e372e6cd473/17_306_5106_3064/master/5106.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef3f6a49e6b3203e28d71b0084a2ee3a","title":"magma shift mysterious seismic wave event mayotte","story":"Vibrations off Madagascar baffled experts but now they believe they have the answerIt is the kind of mystery scientists relish. On 11 November, something stirred near the French island of Mayotte off the west coast of Madagascar and sent a rumble around the world. Travelling at 9,000mph, the deep hum hurtled past earthquake detection systems unnoticed. No one appears to have felt a thing.The event came to light on Twitter when seismology enthusiasts posted weird signals they had spotted in recordings made by seismic stations from Kenya to Hawaii. Having ruled out the violent lurches of an earthquake, educated guesses gave way to more fanciful theories. Was it a landslide? A meteorite exploding in the atmosphere? The awakening of some long-dormant sea monster?Now researchers believe they have an answer. Stephen Hicks, a seismologist at the University of Southampton, was on the case fast. He downloaded data from a global network of seismic stations and set about analysing them. “What’s unusual is you see this very long signal travelling most of the way around the world which hasn’t been detected by operational earthquake detection systems,” he said.By looking at when different seismic stations dotted around the planet detected the rumble, the 30-minute or so signal was traced back to an event that took place at about 9.30am GMT in the sea near Mayotte. Geologists knew that a number of tremors had already rocked the region since a magnitude-5.8 earthquake in May. But earthquakes unleash high frequency seismic waves that vibrate back and forth and from side to side. “This source was completely deficient in those waves,” said Hicks. “It wasn’t picked up because the signal had a very low frequency. It was a low, gentle rumbling.”The Mayotte vibrations took about 40 minutes to reach Britain, and an hour and 15 minutes to reach Hawaii, more than 11,000 miles from their point of origin.Such low frequency rumbles are rare but not unheard of. Scientists have detected them before after glacier calving, landslides and sudden shifts of magma beneath volcanoes. There are no glaciers near Mayotte and an underwater landslide would have been picked up by hydrophones in the surrounding ocean, said Hicks. That leaves a magma shift somewhere under the seabed as the prime culprit.Hicks believes magma may suddenly have drained from a volcanic chamber about 10 miles under the seafloor near Mayotte, setting off the deep rumble that spread around the world. While strong enough to be picked up by sensitive seismometers, the vibrations would have been minuscule: far smaller than a millimetre. “It’s something that you wouldn’t perceive,” he said.Pierre Briole, a geoscientist at École Normale Supérieure in Paris, has reached a similar conclusion. He believes that a third of a cubic mile of magma may have drained from a volcanic chamber under the seafloor, unleashing deep vibrations when its roof collapsed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e96976ed1b109bd7a299ec3b77d4cf4ea9625bb/0_141_4608_2764/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9870d065f0a9bde9e017a99fea60afdb","title":"teenage boys and young men tell us what issues matter to you","story":"We want to hear from young men living in the UK for a project exploring the issues most important to youWhat’s it like for teenage boys and young men growing up in the UK?

Then it did something brilliant: nothing.Facebook left Instagram alone. The app was growing quickly, becoming more relevant each day, eating into rival Snapchat’s audience and threatening Facebook itself – just a few reasons why the tech giant dished out 10 figures for a company with no revenue.More than anything, Instagram was cool. Teenagers loved it. And Facebook was smart to keep its distance, because its eight-year-old platform had started to feel decidedly uncool (especially with younger audiences).After the acquisition, Instagram’s founders, Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, joined Facebook, and everything seemed peachy. By selling to one of the most powerful companies in the world, they immediately tapped into a massive audience and gained access to resources that the startup could only have dreamed about in its early days. Oh, and they became multimillionaires overnight. Life was good, and the future was bright.At the time, many critics mocked Facebook and argued it had severely overpaid. However, the joke was on Instagram. It was far more than a camera app, and Facebook knew it.In 2013, Facebook began testing ads on Instagram with a small group of major brands, including Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s, Burberry, Lexus, and Macy’s. In its official blogpost announcing this move (which, oddly, is a link that requires a Tumblr login now), Instagram made it clear that the ads would seem organic and non-invasive: “Our aim is to make any advertisements you see feel as natural to Instagram as the photos and videos many of you already enjoy from your favorite brands.”The plan was to “start slow”. And for a while, Facebook stayed true to its word. But then it saw the dollar signs that would inevitably make the $1bn price tag look like a steal.While there wasn’t a lot of fanfare around this initial push, it’s clear that Facebook immediately understood the impact of its new money machine. My guess is that the early results for Instagram were pretty much earth-shattering in terms of revenue. Facebook eventually introduced it as an optional placement within the ads manager platform in 2015, but that didn’t last long. Instagram quickly became a default placement for all new campaigns – unless the advertiser was savvy enough to manually deselect it.By September 2016, there were 500,000 active advertisers on Instagram (the question is how many were unknowingly doing so). Just one year later, this number quadrupled to more than 2m advertisers on the network.According to some projections, Instagram is expected to drive the majority of Facebook’s ad revenue growth in the near future. And though Facebook has held on to a sizable share of global mobile ad revenue for a while now, this total figure is expected to nearly double between now and 2021.Today, Facebook openly encourages all businesses to run ads on Instagram. Inside ads manager, it is simply another delivery mechanism for ads. You don’t even need an Instagram account to run ads on the platform.In reality, all of the problems absorbed by Facebook are Instagram’s problems too. The latter channel has been injected into Facebook’s ad product for a long time, and the data used for advertising is the same, which means that any manipulative behavior on the larger platform (from Russia or otherwise) affects both of them. We can’t forget that Instagram also knows everything about us. Facebook has even been toying with the idea of using your Instagram location history for ad targeting.On the flip side, Facebook – despite its flaws – has every right to do what it wants with Instagram. It’s amazing how many people treat them like separate entities when they are one. Kara Swisher argues that Facebook desperately needed someone like Systrom who could stand up for Instagram, but let’s not forget that he sold his company to them. When you agree to get acquired, you give up your power.Facebook recently announced that Adam Mosseri, the executive formerly in charge of news feed, would lead the Instagram team. He is certainly a competent leader with plenty of experience, but the task that lies ahead might be insurmountable.Over the past two years, Facebook has been experiencing an absolute nightmare that just keeps getting worse. Sudden departures from the cofounders of its three largest acquisitions (WhatsApp, Instagram, and Oculus) hasn’t helped its continuing PR crisis either. But amid all the chaos, Facebook has successfully positioned Instagram as an innocent bystander time and time again. (In a fantastic 10,000-word Wired story from February 2018, “Instagram” is mentioned only once). Other than stealing everything from Snapchat and making the app more addictive, Facebook’s key objective has been to leverage Instagram as a symbol of optimism.Naturally, this is not the case. While the narrative of Facebook as the villain of tech has become exhausting at this point, it feels preposterous to call Instagram “a generally positive environment”. The app has been plagued by countless toxic issues over time, including the unintentional promotion of online harassment, child abuse, mental health problems, and illicit drugs.Whether the public accepts it or not, Instagram is just as troubled as its parent company, and the cheerful gradient icon on your home screen is merely a disguise. The once innocent camera app is now trapped deep inside the big blue app – with no chance of escape."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ede040c57c76f267a22e6b677e56779e2ad8cee/0_78_2354_1413/master/2354.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c085051150414c51de9ae46182fc5bba","title":"seating plans playlists and cockle popcorn how to host this christmas","story":"The weather outside might be frightful, but there’s no reason why your party should be. From Christmas cocktail parties to sit-down dinners, here’s how to host with impact and ease this seasonThe nights have drawn in, George and Mariah are in a state of perpetual soundclash, and with them comes the unsettling urge to host a seasonal get-together.If you’re an unsteady host, even an intimate dinner with a handful of friends can seem daunting, so when you chuck in the plus-ones, her next door and a cluster of colleagues, that “fun and festive” party can start to feel anything but.But things don’t need to get all out of control and Abigail’s Party. We live in a time when fine dining and Michelin-starred chefs appear in the most casual of settings, and that informality extends to the at-home-host, too. Claude Bosi - head chef of Bibendum restaurant and Rémy Martin cognac bar – is one such Michelin-starred chef who advocates this relaxed approach when entertaining.“The key to a great party,” he says, “is to ensure you are with your guests. There are so many dinner parties where you try to impress and find yourself spending more time in the kitchen than you spend with your guests. A great party is a balance between good food and good hospitality.”Here’s how it’s done:The dinner partyThis casual mantra starts at the top – the formalities of the past have been dispensed with. Invites can go out on WhatsApp or email. Similarly, boy-girl seating plans at dinner are a relic of another time. Remember, too, if there are only two single guests at a dinner party, they don’t necessarily want to be seated together, lest they feel like show ponies being watched over by the other guests for signs of good chemistry. And unless you have a particular gift for crafting, there’s no need for place names.That said, some small details done nicely can make a real difference. Take your dinner table, for example, as chef and caterer Stephanie Boote says: “I like a simple table, not too much fuss. A linen cloth can be lovely, napkins, if you have them. A couple of little vases or bottles with flowers or foliage. Candlelight is a must. You can have a pile of plates and cutlery on top of an undressed table, a water jug and a stack of glasses, and if you have candles lit it will all be just fine!”There are lots of ways to make life easier as you prep your dinner-party meal, especially as your guests arrive and the heat rises in the kitchen. For Bosi, a neat trick is to go for a cold starter. He suggests getting a terrine from a local deli and serving it with a salad, all handily ready to go on plates ahead of time.Food writer and author Killian Fox offers similar logic when feeding a crowd. “Simplify,” he says. “Instead of a starter, lay out a range of snacks – decent crisps and dips, olives, maybe some crostini – for people to eat when they come through the door. Use the time you’ve saved to make sure everyone has enough booze.”Drinks are, of course, key to a great dinner party. Leave time at the beginning for an aperitif, which will give you more breathing room to prepare your food, take account of inevitable late arrivals (“our Uber kept cancelling”) and let appetites build.Fox suggests a handy seasonal cocktail, too, named London Calling. “It was apparently devised at Milk \u0026amp Honey in Soho. It’s citrussy, it contains sherry, and it gives you a chance to look classy with a cocktail shaker. A fine Christmas drink.”Bosi suggests a drink can offer some surprises and lead to unexpected food pairings. He likes a Royal Sidecar, made with Rémy Martin 1738 Accord Royal cognac, Cointreau and lemon – and paired with oysters.“Until recently, cognac was something you would have after a great lunch,” he says. “It’s not something you’re expecting to drink at the start of the meal, but I find it goes very well with seafood. It’s a nice surprise, a bit of creativity. At that moment, you’ve made people really relaxed and given your meal a stamp of quality.”From then on, you can go with some classic dishes: a big joint of meat, a casserole that can be easily cooked in advance, a beautiful stew with game, or Bosi’s festive favourite: beef wellington.When it comes to serving, Bosi tends to stick to sharing plates. “I put pots in the middle of the table and we start sharing,” he says. “I think dinner parties with people closer to each other are a better atmosphere.”Boote adds a word of practical advice: “Preparation is key. Your guests are here to see you, not have you run about trying to do things. Keep it simple, with excellent ingredients that speak for themselves.”Dinner party music has long been something of a slur, a byword for a pleasant but bland background soundtrack. But you don’t want to be sitting in silence accompanied only by the sound of mastication and scraping forks, so head to Spotify to put together some playlists.For dinner, you want something that is eclectic but not too distracting – you don’t want to be continually flicking to the next song. However, you also don’t want to drift into nondescript tastefulness, either.The drinks partyInteresting people, nice snacks, some decent tunes and plenty of booze is all that’s needed for a drinks party. Keep things loose – this means submitting to the inevitable and assuming a crowd will congregate in your kitchen. Be ready to push some seats away in the living room if a late dance party emerges.When it comes to the drinks, try to be creative, says Boote: “This year, we have made a fig leaf syrup to go with lime juice, gin and soda. It’s delicious without the gin, too.” She follows that adding clementine flavours and fizz to spirits makes any drink feel “festive and delicious”.Of course, guests will be looking for something to nibble on, so lay out some decent crisps, popcorn or olives.You can also add some more expansive finger food into the mix. Boote goes for gougères, a French choux pastry filled with cheese, while Bosi will be serving up some intriguing offerings: Rémy Martin cognac, mixed with tonic (a Rémy Grand Tonic – the French spin on the British classic), served with his “pickled cockle popcorn”. The cockles are rolled in flour then deep-fried in hot oil, coming out as if popcorn. “It’s a fantastic pairing,” he says. To give it a seasonal twist, add some clove or orange to the cognac.Fox offers a snack serving with a backstory: “The Gilda – a pintxo created in honour of Rita Hayworth, who starred in the film Gilda. It’s pretty easy: skewer a couple of green olives on a toothpick with guindilla peppers and an anchovy fillet.”You want to keep the music equally eclectic but a little more upbeat. However, don’t feel the need to overload it with bangers and floor fillers. If the party goes late, you can bring out the hits. Remember to let a few people try out their music selections – it’s never fun to be overprotective of the music at a party, nor do you want one person hogging the speaker. Finally, if things take a particularly boozy turn, fire up some karaoke through YouTube.And finally …Really, there’s no set formula. Follow your instincts, embrace comfort and concentrate on having fun. And, if in doubt, remember some salient words from Bosi:“Just don’t try too hard. Don’t try to impress is the wrong thing to say – you want to impress – but stay in your comfort zone. Stay comfortable, enjoy yourself, keep it simple – and have a good time.”Make like Bosi and kick off that good time with a Royal Sidecar or Rémy Grand Tonic of your own – buy a bottle here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3726e0cf652a6dff90d706ddbed00a8be919ab9e/175_494_4443_2666/master/4443.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6e028fb67b0a6496c923a0d482d1055","title":"george hw bush a life in pictures","story":"George HW Bush, who has died aged 94, was the 41st president of the United States.

It also happens to be the first year my kids are old enough to understand the concept of holidays. So I’m really looking forward to the beautiful moment when I tell them, for the first time, the story behind the Jewish festival of lights – the thrilling tale of how, 2,500 years ago, a small group of Jews called the Maccabees recaptured their temple from the Syrians and the oil inside that was supposed to last for one day burned instead for eight whole days – and they reply with that time-honoured question: “Uh-huh, so how many days until Christmas?”The Jews are a people of suffering pretty much all our holidays are based on this: “Now it’s time to celebrate  Grab a drink and fix a plate  But before you feel too great Remember that we suffered – hey!” as Patti LuPone memorably sang on the unsurpassably brilliant Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. This is just one of the many reasons it’s hard to convince Jewish children to get excited about, say, Passover, a spring holiday commemorating the tears of enslaved ancestors, instead of the Other Spring Holiday, which involves multicoloured eggs and chocolate: “Hey kids, I know the Christians are offering you bunnies and jelly beans, but check out my Passover Seder plate – I got horseradish and a lamb’s bone for you!” Bigging up Jewish holidays basically turns you into that weird neighbour who at Halloween tries to convince local kids to come trick or treating at her house by promising travel-sized toothpastes and old fruit.And this isn’t just about the accoutrements: Christian holidays tend to sound better, full stop. As Jon Stewart once said when talking about what he calls the annual “faithoff”, what we’re dealing with in December is one holiday celebrating the birth of the Christian messiah, and another “celebrating oil lasting longer than it would normally last. There’s no contest there!” My favourite Friends episode nailed this dichotomy even more succinctly by literalising the metaphor, in The One With The Holiday Armadillo. Ross attempts to get his son, Ben, excited about Hanukah by – for reasons we don’t need to investigate too deeply now – dressing up as an armadillo, only for Ben to ditch him as soon as Chandler walks into the apartment dressed as Father Christmas. This, essentially, is what Hanukah v Christmas is: an armadillo v Santa Claus.Like Ross Geller and Jon Stewart, I am a Jew who has had children with a non-Jew, and the pain suffered by Jewish parents like us is particular and poignant. But despite Ross and Stewart’s warnings, I did not anticipate this until my children were born. I was raised as Reform as a Reform Jew can get: yes, I went to Hebrew school, but my mother was a firm believer that any holiday that was fun was a holiday to be celebrated. We grew up doing Hanukah and Christmas, Passover and Easter, sometimes simultaneously. So when I had kids I assumed this kind of free-for-all approach to the Christian and Jewish holidays – bisecular, if you will – was natural and complication-free. As the holiday armadillo warned me almost two decades ago, I was wrong.What I hadn’t taken into account was that I’d grown up in a home in which both parents were – despite my mother’s fondness for Christmas stockings – Jewish. This meant that the Jewish holidays had the two-pronged support that they need to hold their own against Santa Claus and the Easter bunny. Stewart was recently in London on a standup tour and he returned to this issue, describing how in his home – as in mine – his non-Jewish spouse is more than happy for him to teach their kids about Jewish holidays – but that it’s hard to convince your kids to care when their other parent is opening advent calendars at the other end of the kitchen. Given that my kids are, as I write this, downstairs picking out advent calendars with their father, I don’t think I have ever related to a standup set so hard in my life.A Jew who marries out of their religion is a Jew who – it is safe to say – takes a fairly relaxed view of religious strictures. Indeed, you might even have convinced yourself that you think religion is largely a load of unkosher baloney. You’re gonna marry who you want – in your face, Rabbi! But there is something about having children that sharpens the mind. Traditions that used to make you groan with their hokiness suddenly seem weirdly important when you realise, first, they aren’t just about religion but are a connection to your childhood and, second, if you don’t shove them down your kids’ throats, no one else will. The survival of the Jewish faith is all on your shoulders! Kinda!But Judaism is famously resilient and has seen off worse foes than the ubiquity of a commercialised Christmas. So tomorrow night, all advent calendars and Christmas tree ornaments will be temporarily banned from the kitchen, and I will light the candles and regale my children with the story of how once upon a time a pot of oil burned for longer than some people expected. And then I will bribe them to pretend to care with a load of chocolate dreidels. You’re good, Santa – but I got moves, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acc1415df5d2a3c78c302d4c2624c9de112971ff/0_179_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c025370b813e8d6c4a09bf9cd9d4d0fa","title":"mexico andres manuel lopez obrador president","story":"Leftwinger to be sworn in on wave of hope that he can fix poverty, corruption and crime on behalf of ordinary MexicansMexico’s president-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador will take power on Saturday on a wave of hope that he can transform the country on behalf of the poor and marginalized – and suspicions that he will not be able to fulfill such great expectations.The silver-haired 64-year-old, who counts Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn as a close friend, won a historic victory in July, bringing the Mexican left to power after 30 years of dashed expectations.Figures from around the world have been invited to the inauguration, including US vice-president Mike Pence, first daughter Ivanka Trump, Corbyn and – to the disgust of López Obrador’s domestic critics – Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro.The man known as Amlo takes office as international attention focuses on a caravan of Central American migrants camped out at the US-Mexico border – the first foreign policy challenge of his administration.Pundits had warned Amlo’s election would unleash a wave of latent anti-Americanism in response to Donald Trump’s racist provocations – but Mexicans seem more preoccupied with the domestic problems such as rampant corruption, persistent poverty and a militarized drug war that has left 200,000 dead.On 10 December 2006, president Felipe Calderón, launched Mexico’s war on drugs by sending 6,500 troops into his home state of Michoacán, where rival cartels were engaged in tit-for-tat massacres.Calderón declared war eight days after taking power – a move widely seen as an attempt to boost his own legitimacy after a bitterly contested election victory. Within two months, around 20,000 troops were involved in operations across the country.The US has donated at least $1.5bn through the Merida Initiative since 2008, while Mexico has spent at least $54bn on security and defence since 2007. Critics say that this influx of cash has helped create an opaque security industry open to corruption at every level.But the biggest costs have been human: since 2007, around 230,000 people have been murdered and more than 28,000 reported as disappeared. Human rights groups have also detailed a vast rise in human rights abuses by security forces.As the cartels have fractured and ersified, other violent crimes such as kidnapping and extortion have also surged. In addition, hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced by violence.\u0026nbspImproved collaboration between the US and Mexico has resulted in numerous high-profile arrests and drug busts. Officials say 25 of the 37 drug traffickers on Calderón’s most-wanted list have been jailed, extradited to the US or killed, although not all of these actions have been independently corroborated.The biggest victory – and most embarrassing blunder – under Peña Nieto’s leadership was the recapture, escape and another recapture of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, leader of the Sinaloa cartel.While the crackdown and capture of kingpins has won praise from the media and US, it has done little to reduce the violence.Mexico’s decade-long war on drugs would never have been possible without the huge injection of American cash and military cooperation under the Merida Initiative. The funds have continued to flow despite growing evidence of serious human rights violations.\u0026nbsp“We don’t like Trump, but we also understand that he’s a danger for the country – so if you can mollify the danger, so much the better,” said Federico Estévez, political science professor at ITAM, a private university.With Amlo, “it’s about being Mexico-first, not being anti-gringo”, he added.He takes power amid astronomical expectations from ordinary Mexicans.“We need a change, to do what’s never been done before,” said Erik Yniesta, 44, an addictions counsellor.“He took on the system and beat it. He was the only valid option,” said Eleonora Montes, a sales representative in Tijuana. “All our politicians steal. In a country that’s so poor, they come to power as a way to get rich.”Such opinions reflect widespread disgust with the country’s mainstream politicians: outgoing president Enrique Peña Nieto leaves office with historically low approval ratings.Peña Nieto was initially feted by international commentators for structural reforms – Time magazine featured him on a cover emblazoned with the words “Saving Mexico” – but his administration quickly became bogged down in corruption scandals and growing anger over the dismal economy.Meanwhile, the country raced past a series of grim milestones with record numbers of homicides, but the president seemed uninterested in tackling the violence and corruption which beset ordinary Mexicans.“He simply didn’t know how to deal with the problems his government faced,” said Javier Garza, an editor in the northern city of Torreón.Amlo promises clean government and has argued that previously corrupt politicians will fall into line if the president sets a proper example.But last week, he stunned the country by saying he wouldn’t pursue past cases of corruption, preferring instead to turn the page.He further dismayed supporters by unveiling a plans for a new militarized national guard under military command – despite mounting evidence that Mexico’s armed forces have committed widespread human rights abuses in the name of the war on organized crimes.Meanwhile, he has held a string of plebiscites before even taking office – overturning a proposed new airport in Mexico city and rubber-stamping a series of pet projects, including a new refinery in his home state and a “tourist” train to the Mayan ruins of Palenque.All of the proposals were overwhelmingly approved – but on a turnout in single figures."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97ca2c51029bf0df5e2b4700f8c52dee73c94966/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ece51a4679cf19fe24f65183e4ad57a","title":"guardian survey suggests women are more populist than men","story":"Analysis of nearly half a million responses to the ‘How populist are you?’ quiz reveals populist attitudes are widespread, but vary by age, gender and locationThe p-word has become something of a pejorative, and few people would self-define as populist.But two thirds of people who completed the ’s How populist are you? were classified as populist, with the vast majority of them placed in the same left-populist grouping as politicians like the US senator Bernie Sanders, the Bolivian president, Evo Morales, and the leader of the Spanish radical leftwing party Podemos, Pablo Iglesias.Women who took the survey were also more likely to hold populist attitudes than men.Team Populism, the network of academics who helped build the ’s survey, said the results were broadly consistent with their own research, which shows that populist attitudes are more widespread than people often realise.Levente Littvay, an associate professor at Central European University, said he was surprised to see such a gender difference, which he described as “small but certainly meaningful difference”. He stressed that the ’s survey was not a representative sample and said further research should be conducted to explore potential gender differences on the populist list.Many quiz users expressed curiosity at their comparison to the leader of Podemos. Since emerging from the indignados movement in 2014, Podemos has battled against corrupt elites, terminated four decades of political duopoly in Spain, and tried and failed to become the dominant voice of the Spanish left. But the party’s rapid advance has put Iglesias in a position of influence, and his party now props up Pedro Sánchez’s socialist minority government.Podemos has lost momentum over the past two years , wounded by the internal squabbles, rifts and rivalries that bedevil more mainstream political parties. In May Iglesias and his partner, Irene Montero, were criticised for buying a €600,000 (£525,000) house in the mountains outside Madrid as they prepared to become the parents of twins. How, some of their supporters wondered, did the purchase sit with the principles of a man named after the father of Spanish socialism?And yet Podemos remains a powerful force, thanks in part to an enduring antipathy towards the political elite that has governed Spain since the country’s return to democracy after the death of Franco.“When Podemos emerged, they were almost a textbook example of populism,” said Raul Gomez, a senior politics lecturer at the University of Liverpool. “They didn’t even mention the terms left or right, which they claimed were outdated. They focused on the struggle between the people and the ‘corrupt elite’.”A key component of populism, says Gomez, is a binary view of politics: there are the good – the people – and then there are the elites who take advantage of them. “The key difference between leftwing and rightwing populists is that leftwing populists have an inclusive conception of ‘the people’. For Podemos, the people is an underdog coalition which also includes minorities and not just natives. What holds them together is their opposition to the economic and political elites, who are accused of hijacking democracy.”However, Gomez wonders whether Iglesias himself has ever been a complete populist. “I’d say for him populism is only a strategy. A way to simplify the message and send it across. A way to reach out to people who have a leftwing profile but would not listen to the old leftwing rhetoric.”The placement of the political leaders on the ’s quiz was done by asking experts on each politician to complete the same survey as if they were that person. To make this more reliable, experts – academics, journalists and others – were asked to complete the survey for each politician, and an average was taken of their answers.Cristóbal Rovira Kaltwasser, a professor at Diego Portales University in Chile, and one of the experts who helped plot Latin American politicians, said social media users complaining that Evo Morales was misplaced on the graph may not have have realised the left-right axis combined both economic and cultural questions.“Some of these leftist presidents in Latin America, while very leftwing in terms of economic policy, are pretty conservative on cultural issues – particularly compared with Europe,” he said.Some of Podemos’s inspiration has been drawn from Latin American political theory and from studying the region’s current and former leftwing leaders, such as Morales, the former Ecuadorian president Rafael Correa and the late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez.“Latin American populism has probably had a big effect on the Podemos crowd,” says Kirk Hawkins, an expert on populism aat Brigham Young University, and the coordinator of the Team Populism network. “Some Podemos leaders visited Venezuela to observe and ‘advise’ chavismo in its earlier years,” adds Hawkins. “And there is a fair amount of talk in radical leftist circles in Spain and beyond about the Chavista experience – most of it celebratory.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af3bf00ea1d9e3eb6bb3bba4e619a06865a71c2d/0_472_2271_1362/master/2271.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5139e6a6b410ee0a1d6011ecf2af785d","title":"macron saudi arabia mbs conversation g20 summit caught on mic","story":"French presidential aide confirms they spoke about Khashoggi murder and Yemen after microphone picks up informal talkThe Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, suspected of ordering the murder of the dissident writer Jamal Khashoggi and accused of war crimes in the Yemen conflict, has told the French president, Emmanuel Macron, “Don’t worry” at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires.The two leaders were having an informal conversation on the sidelines of the summit, standing close together and apparently unaware their conversation was being recorded. The subject of the snatched conversation was not immediately clear but a French presidential aide said afterwards that the Khashoggi murder and the Yemen conflict were the two key topics of the short exchange.According to a  analysis of their only partly audible conversation, Macron replies to the crown prince’s assurances: “I do worry. I am worried … I told you.”“Yes, you told me,” the prince says. “Thank you very much.”“You never listen to me,” Macron says.“No, I listen, of course,” replied Prince Mohammed, dressed in flowing white robes and smiling broadly after apparently becoming aware of a television camera.“Because I told you. It was more important for you,” Macron says, and gives a tight smile, before turning away from the camera to speak further to the prince.Macron then says something inaudible, to which the Saudi leader says: “It’s OK. I can deal with it.”After another indecipherable segment of conversation, Macron says: “I am a man of my word.”The Élysée Palace said the two leaders had a five-minute exchange on the sidelines of the summit in which Macron conveyed a “very firm” message to the prince over the killing and the need to find a political solution for the situation in Yemen.The Saudi prince’s decision to attend the G20 summit in Buenos Aires represented a calculated risk, as it was unclear whether the other leaders would condemn him. Many of his closest aides and security staff were involved in Khashoggi’s murder on 2 October in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, and the CIA has reportedly assessed that the prince gave the order for the execution.The results of the 33-year-old Saudi leader’s gambit were mixed at the start of the two-day summit. Macron and the UK’s prime minister, Theresa May, agreed to meet him. May insisted she had strong words to convey about the Khashoggi murder and the need for a full accounting of Riyadh’s alleged involvement.During a group photo marking the start of the summit, the prince stood at the far edge of the group, largely ignored and left alone as soon as it was over. But a few minutes later, Vladimir Putin greeted the Saudi prince warmly, giving him a high five as they sat down together at the large ring-shaped table for the first group session.Putin also came to the Argentinian capital fighting pariah status after an incident in the Azov Sea on Sunday in which Russian vessels rammed a Ukrainian tugboat and opened fire on two small Ukrainian navy cutters it was accompanying.Russian forces seized the vessels and their crew and Moscow’s refusal to return them was the reason Donald Trump offered for his decision to cancel a bilateral meeting with Putin, which had been planned for Friday morning.As Russian actions in the Sea of Azov had been known for days, there was speculation in Washington that the real reason for the change of mind was the court appearance of Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, on Thursday in which he pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the extent and duration of negotiations with the Kremlin about a possible Trump hotel in Moscow, continuing up to July 2016, at the height of the presidential election campaign.Trump, whose campaign is being investigated for its alleged links to the Kremlin, had denied any business dealings in Russia.On Friday, Russian media reported that Trump and Putin would meet informally at the fringes of the full G20 summit, but a White House official said no such “pull aside” had been scheduled.There was similar uncertainty over whether Trump would meet the Saudi crown prince, whom the president has supported in the face of US intelligence findings of his alleged culpability in the Khashoggi murder. The administration also suffered a significant rebuke from the Senate, which ignored the urging of top Trump officials and refused to shelve a debate on whether to cut US military support for the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen.The Saudi-owned broadcaster Al Arabiyah reported that the crown prince and Trump had held a “friendly meeting” on the sidelines of the summit, but the White House said the encounter only amounted to an exchange of pleasantries, similar to the US president’s greeting with every other leader.Before arriving in Buenos Aires, Trump had declared himself willing to meet the crown prince, while his national security adviser, John Bolton, ruled it out, saying there was no room in the president’s schedule. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, met his Saudi counterpart, Adel al-Jubeir, separately in a meeting that a statement said was focused on planned Yemen peace talks next week, “as well as the importance of making progress on the investigation into Jamal Khashoggi’s death”.On leaving the meeting, the Saudi foreign minister described it as “very productive”, saying they have discussed “challenges in the region and the bilateral relationship and ways of moving it forward”. Asked if they had also discussed Khashoggi, he did not reply.Trump began the day by attending a signing ceremony for a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, the USMCA, to replace the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). .“Just signed one of the most important, and largest, Trade Deals in US and World History,” Trump announced in a tweet. “The United States, Mexico and Canada worked so well together in crafting this great document. The terrible NAFTA will soon be gone. The USMCA will be fantastic for all!”Experts say the USMCA is a slightly tweaked and updated version of Nafta, which Trump has persistently pilloried. In his own remarks the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, repeatedly referred to the deal as “the new Nafta”, a formulation he must have known would annoy the prickly US president.The leaders began the summit without Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, whose plane had broken down on the way to Argentina and who was making her way to Buenos Aires on commercial flights, leaving May the only female leader at the meeting.As the proceedings began, it was unclear whether the participants would be able to agree on a final statement as the US had objected to some of the draft language on free trade and the need for multilateralism. The statement had not been settled by Friday afternoon, according to diplomats at the summit.Referring to some of the difficulties in finding even the most basic common language, the European council president, Donald Tusk, told journalists: “As this is a difficult moment for international cooperation, I would like to appeal to the leaders to use this summit, including their bilateral and informal exchanges, to seriously discuss real issues such as trade wars, the tragic situation in Syria and Yemen and the Russian aggression in Ukraine.”“I see no reason why the G20 leaders shouldn’t have a meaningful discussion about solving these problems. Especially because all the instruments lie in their hands,” Tusk said. “The only condition is goodwill.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d88e55c94eb0f43a0e10d9a1167bb42971537463/0_202_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb5b5cffe92f33f83d5aa80d03dea819","title":"metoo has been misrepresented as plot against men says founder","story":"Campaign to support survivors of sexual violence is unrecognisable, says Tarana BurkeThe founder of the #MeToo movement has said the campaign she started against sexual violence has become unrecognisable and misrepresented as a vindictive plot against men.Tarana Burke, an American civil rights activist, started the campaign in 2006 with the goal of providing support to survivors of sexual violence in her community. Last year the phrase took off globally in the wake of allegations against the Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein.Burke told a TEDWomen event in Palm Springs, California, that parts of the media had framed the movement as a witch-hunt and that US politicians seemed to be “pivoting away from the issue” in the wake of events such as the controversy over Brett Kavanaugh’s appointment to the supreme court.“Suddenly, a movement to centre survivors of sexual violence is being talked about as a vindictive plot against men,” she told the audience. “This is a movement about the one in four girls and the one in six boys who are sexually abused every year, and who carry those wounds into adulthood,” she said. “Victims are heard and then vilified.”Burke said she wanted the movement to return to the issues she set out to challenge over a decade ago.“My vision for the #MeToo movement is part of a collective vision to see a world free of sexual violence,” she said. “I believe we can build that world. Full stop.”“We owe future generations nothing less than a world free of sexual violence. This accumulation of feelings that so many of us are feeling together across the globe is collective trauma.”Burke said she felt the campaign was neglecting victims of sexual violence, adding: “This movement has been called a watershed moment, but some days I wake up feeling that all the evidence points to the contrary.“We have to re-educate ourselves and our children to understand that power and privilege doesn’t always have to destroy and take. It can be used to serve and build.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Beard advantages, 1950s: \u0026lsquoIt provides, as it were, a built-in outlet for nervous tension\u0026rsquoReports published into 2008 Dublin docks drowning and 1988 Co Offaly hit-and-runHSE seeks tenders to furnish ultrasound due to length of public health system waiting listsCiaran Devane says leadership is now about debate, process and teamworkAmid UK political uncertainty, diplomats pessimistic about May plan being passedDriver sole occupant of car and pronounced dead at the scene on local road near MilfordTaoiseach attends event to celebrate the centenary of women\u0026rsquos suffrage in IrelandA number of items have been identified as having been recently stolen in the UKVaradkar suggests justice system in the Republic is \u0026lsquoslow\u0026rsquo, and its efficiency could be improvedCourt hears woman\u0026rsquos routine surgery at Dublin private hospital led to her \u0026lsquonear death\u0026rsquoSome 96 people living with families who offered accommodation at height of migrant crisisWarning that State subsidies for traditional businesses may be the only way to reverse the decline in retail activity in rural townsJohn Paul Phelan says suggestion he wrote newspaper article at centre of Paudie Coffey defamation case is \u0026lsquooutrageous\u0026rsquoPupils \u0026lsquobeing denied education\u0026rsquo by policy of separating them due to behavioural issuesGrafton Architects founders receive Ulysses medal for \u0026lsquooutstanding global contribution\u0026rsquoEnvironmental Protection Agency takes prosecutions, while local authorities enforce main water pollution actsOwner of Aer Arann Islands had offered to sell it to local communities for sum of \u0026euro1"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3716201.1543600512!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"350m project aims to transform waterford s north quays","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tComputer generated image of  the planned Falcon development at North Quays, Waterford.There’s not much to see yet on Waterford’s North Quays, the site of a proposed €350 million regeneration project which got its first commitment of Government funding this week.Access to the 17-acre waterfront site is blocked by gates at both ends.

It’s hard to know if it will ever happen,” says Paul Walsh of Walsh’s Lotto Shop.A few doors along, in Aphrodite Beauty, Tara Dee says “the footbridge going ahead is good news.” But, she wonders where the customers for the 37,000sq m of retail space are going to come from.The developer of the North Quays project, Falcon Real Estate, which is part of the Saudi Fawaz Alhokair Group, says the answer lies in the site’s accessibility to the wider southeast region, the 11,000sq m of office space included in the plan and the 2,300 direct jobs it says will be created. The plan also includes a park and visitor centre.A total of €140 million will need to be raised over the next four years for infrastructure costs, of which €104.5 million is being sought from the Government. Some will come from the National Transport Authority and potential European funding sources are being looked at. Matching funding of €34.8m will come from Waterford and Kilkenny County Councils and Falcon’s investment of €350 million includes €9 million towards infrastructure.Waterford Chamber of Commerce chief executive Gerald Hurley says it had been assured of the Government’s and the developer’s commitment. Now it is “awaiting a response from the Department of Housing to see what funding is available and what the timelines for the allocation will be”.David Ennis of Ennis Gough Auctioneers says the footbridge will have a huge positive impact on traffic management and accessibility to the city for people living in Ferrybank. But he is concerned about where the 1,200 construction workers will live, and the scale and viability of the retail plan. He points to a nearby development, in which just one retail unit out of 10 is occupied.“It seems to be a bit of a Kevin Costner mentality – build it and they will come. Where are the retailers who are going to fill this space? We’re in a scenario where we have retailers leaving the city centre.”But the urban regeneration plan is not just about creating a new Dundrum or Kildare Village on the long-neglected North Quays, says Walsh, although the city “has a real deficit in retail provision”.It also involves creating “a sustainable transport corridor improving the access from north to south, linking the Greenway, and running right through the heart of the city”. The Greenway connecting Dungarvan to New Ross will cross the site using the sustainable transport bridge, he says.The plan includes the provision of a “European-standard integrated transport hub”, to replace Plunkett railway station, which suffers from accessibility and space problems. Between five and 10 years down the line, there is a proposal for a new traffic bridge, extending from the Tower Hotel across the river Suir.In the immediate term, the regeneration project includes a separate shopping development at Michael Street in the city. Suggestions of a light rail connection between the two are no longer being discussed the plan being looked at now is for a driverless bus running from the Apple Market to the North Quays.Supporters of the regeneration project say it will unlock other developments, including the €100 million redevelopment of the derelict Ard Rí Hotel, which was bought last year by Séamus Walsh, owner of Waterford Castle.Back in the city centre, retailers are reluctant to be perceived as talking down the development. Some privately express concerns about how the project will affect the city, where – if the number of empty units is an indication – the recession’s shadow is long.But Michael Walsh says he believes the development will benefit the city as a whole. “From our point of view, our footfall is only half of what it should be at the moment,” he says. “Expanding the offer is the key and making Waterford more attractive for the region and visitors. The alternative is a downward spiral for retail. We would see this as being the catalyst to really significantly increase footfall and visitor numbers.”Ultimately, the vision for Waterford is to preserve the historical city centre of small streets on one side of the river and create a more modern quarter on the other, providing access from Kilkenny, he says. This is in line with Ireland 2040 plans to grow the city to a population of 83,000.“It’s about trying to create a new face for a part of the city which has been derelict and dragging down the city for far too long. The city centre is off-centre at the moment. And we need development to happen on the north side to make the entire city viable.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3709939.1543164372!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"suspect device the all metal hip replacement that caused untold hardship","story":"The DePuy ASR hip launched in 2004, was promoted as a game changer in orthopaedics, with 3,300 patients receiving the hip in Ireland.  Problems were discovered, resulting in its recall in Ireland in 2010. Video: Bryan O’Brien Report: Colm Keena\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGillian O’Sullivan: ‘He told me there was a lovely new hip on the market that could last a lifetime . . . I would never look back.’Scandals involving breast implants and all-metal hips prosthetics have raised global concerns and prompted regulatory reform in the European Union. Now the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) has conducted a major investigation into the medical device sector.The debacle that is the DePuy metal hip illuminates the ways medical devices are brought to market and the mayhem that can ensue if a product fails to live up to expectations.On a per capita basis, more of the DePuy hips were implanted in Ireland than in any other jurisdiction. In excess of 1,000 Irish patients have issued proceedings against DePuy. Hundreds have already settled.When Gillian O’Sullivan gets up from her chair to fetch some hip X-rays, you can’t but notice that one of her legs is shorter than the other.One of the difficulties with replacing hips is that the artificial implants wear out. As bone and tissue get destroyed when prosthetics are being implanted, replacing worn-out implants with new ones is not a simple matter. For this reason, the practice has been to wait until people are older, and less active, before giving them artificial hips. If you get the timing right, the patient may be dead before the hip implant has failed.But in the early 2000s, hip implant manufacturers started to market new, longer-lasting implants they said were suited to younger, active people.In 2005, when she was 40, Gillian O’Sullivan went to see the highly regarded local orthopaedic surgeon, Tadhg O’Sullivan, in the Waterford Regional Hospital. She was suffering from arthritis.“He told me there was a lovely new hip on the market that could last a lifetime . . . I would never look back.”Her surgeon was referring to a new metal product from DePuy, a subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson and a major manufacturer of orthopaedic products. The so-called ASR hip came in two variants. One was a hip resurfacing device, which covered the cup and ball of the hip socket, while the second was a total hip replacement product, which involved replacing the top of the femur with a metal device, which then sat into the metal cup.Both products differed from what was previously on the market in that both traditional hip implants used a metal ball and a polyethylene or plastic cup. The DePuy hip had a ball and cup made out of a hard-wearing cobalt chromium metal alloy.Tadhg O’Sullivan was one of six design surgeons who had worked with DePuy’s engineers to design the new product. It is standard practice for innovative new products to be developed with the assistance of clinicians.At the time he saw Gillian O’Sullivan, the Waterford surgeon was showing surgeons around the world how to implant the new product, and taking part in post-market surveillance of how the product was performing.In October 2005, Gillian O’Sullivan had a DePuy hip replacement device implanted on her left side at the Kilcreene Orthopaedic Hospital in Kilkenny. In May 2006, her second hip was replaced. She was told she now had the “hips of Brian O’Driscoll”.However, her operations were difficult and she experienced pain afterwards.“By Christmas 2006 we knew I was in trouble. I had no energy levels, I was really sick, and you could hear me coming down the stairs. There was a click, click, click, every time I moved.”Her children could hear the grinding of her metal hips.In May 2007, she went back to Tadhg O’Sullivan. “I said, I’m in trouble here. He argued with me. He said I was in better condition than I had been.”She was told that “the god of orthopaedics” had performed her hip operation and that she should wait and see.By this stage O’Sullivan had moved from the Waterford Regional Hospital to the private Whitfield Clinic, also in Waterford. “Between 2007 and 2010, I was in an awful state. I would say to myself, I think I am dying.”Gillian O’Sullivan now believes that during the years 2007 to 2011, metal ions from her hip implants were progressively damaging the flesh and bone of her hip joints.When the DePuy hip was withdrawn from the market in August 2010, Irish patients were advised that their future care would involve the monitoring of the cobalt and chromium levels in their blood.After the withdrawal, Gillian O’Sullivan got a letter for an appointment at the Whitfield and Tadhg O’Sullivan warned her that she would be hearing a lot of public debate about cobalt and chromium ion levels in the blood. He said it was “all bullshit”.“They are trying to frighten everybody.”She went to see Jimmy Sheehan at the Blackrock Clinic again and brought along her blood test results which showed very high metal ion levels. “He said, you need to get those hips out now. They’re poisoning you.”In 2011, the right hip was replaced by O’Sullivan at the Whitfield, and a year later the second hip was also replaced. The operations, which were paid for by DePuy, were difficult, she said, and left her with a left leg that was longer than her right.During her original operations and subsequent operations Gillian O’Sullivan met a number of other patients who were having DePuy hips implanted or replaced by Tadhg O’Sullivan. Among those she met was Kiera Kenneally, who had DePuy hips implanted by Tadhg O’Sullivan in 2005 and 2006, the first when she was just 16 years old.Kenneally, who now lives in Sandyford, Dublin, is originally from Hillview, Waterford, and Gillian O’Sullivan knew her family. Kenneally sued DePuy. Her case was heard over a number of days in the High Court in 2016, but the case was settled with the agreement including a confidentiality clause. However, the transcripts from the sitting days have been seen by The .In August 2005, Kenneally had a resurfacing procedure done by O’Sullivan in Kilcreene. In May of the following year, the second hip was resurfaced.The left hip implant was replaced by O’Sullivan in 2010. During the operation, substantial metal ion damage to her hip tissue was discovered and there was substantial loss of bone.Blood tests taken afterwards showed cobalt and chromium blood levels that were, respectively, 10 and four times above what would be expected, the High Court was told.Kenneally has since been advised she may in time need to have a Girdlestone procedure, which fuses the femur to the hip so that it can no longer bend. She may end up in a wheelchair.The medical records in Kenneally’s case showed that before her procedure, Tadgh O’Sullivan discussed both with her and her mother the concept of metal-on-metal hips, the possibility of failure, and the issue of debris (which in turn leads to the release of ions).Gillian O’Sullivan also sued DePuy. During her High Court action, she says, DePuy “fought me all the way”.She also enlisted Nargol as an expert witness and he told the court that 90-95 per cent of her problems were due to the DePuy implants. DePuy argued that 90-95 per cent of her difficulties were due to her congenital condition.Mr Justice Kevin Cross decided that 90 per cent of O’Sullivan’s difficulties were referable to the DePuy hips, and awarded her €740,000. DePuy said it would appeal and the matter was then settled for €520,000.Unusually for people who made settlements with DePuy, Gillian O’Sullivan did not agree to a “gagging” clause and so is free to discuss her experience.In his judgment in November 2016, Mr Justice Cross said O’Sullivan was an “honest historian” who did not consciously exaggerate, but that her difficulties prior to her hip operations were greater than she recalled.As was the case with the Kenneally trial, Tadgh O’Sullivan was not a party in the O’Sullivan case, was not called by either side, and no one criticised his surgical skills. The judge said he accepted that O’Sullivan’s relationship with her surgeon had broken down some time after the second DePuy implant operation.O’Sullivan would need future revisions and would continue to be severely disabled for the rest of her life, the judge said. “The plaintiff will also be in significant pain, probably for life.”Gillian O’Sullivan says, reflecting on what’s happened to her: “You make the most of your life. I can’t be on a beach. The balance is completely gone, and I would fall over nothing. I get pains and contractions. I was in bed for six weeks after Christmas.”She is a mix of being surprisingly upbeat, while also occasionally displaying a fierce sense of resentment towards Tadhg O’Sullivan. “I live my life. If I’m upright for the day, I’m happy.”The DePuy hip debacle may end up costing DePuy up to $4 billion (€3.53 billion) in damages. Other producers of metal hip implants are also being sued.Although figures are not available for the Republic, total damages of up to €80 million may yet be paid to Irish recipients of DePuy hips, with legal costs in addition to that. It is the largest corporate personal injuries episode to ever hit the Irish legal system.Despite the challenges a metal-on-metal product presented, a new all-metal hip resurfacing product, known as the Birmingham Hip Resurfacing (BHR) system, made by Smith \u0026amp Nephew, came on the market in the late 1990s and began to prove popular.The device was attractive for young, active people with hip problems, and Tadhg O’Sullivan was an early fan. A former GAA player himself, O’Sullivan was known for treating young athletes with joint problemsO’Sullivan told The  that it was because of his extensive use of the Birmingham hip that he was invited to work with DePuy in relation to its new product. At the time “I was probably one of the most experienced hip resurfacing surgeons in the world.”Companies developing new implants often engage surgeons to assist them. Although DePuy engineers put a huge amount of work into designing their new product, this did not including clinical trials, something that was not necessary under EU rules.Simulator tests were used, but critics say the tests did not replicate the repeated stop and start motion that is intrinsic to human joint use, and were restricted to larger model components, the sort used by larger framed people.“It would have been a very good design process if they were designing a washing machine,” says Trinity College Dublin engineering professor David Taylor. “They seem to have forgotten that it was going into a human being.”Taylor, who specialises in materials that are inserted into the body, has acted for a number of people who are suing DePuy. For him, a critical failure made by the DePuy engineers was not testing the proposed product on people prior to going to market.The head of medical device regulation in Ireland, Dr Niall MacAleenan, speaking generally, said clinical testing of medical device products was complicated by the fact that many devices were designed to be inside the body for years if not decades.Assessments as to the suitability of implanted devices involves a “risk benefit” assessment. “There is always risk. The question is if it is an acceptable level of risk.”In January 2004, DePuy got approval from a UK notified body, BSI, to market its two metal hip products throughout the EU. Approval across other, non-EU markets soon followed.For the US market, the company had to get approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which was considered a tougher regulatory authority than the multi-agency structure operating in the EU.English surgeon Tony Nargol was an early enthusiast for the new DePuy product. In September 2003, he travelled to Rome for the product launch, where he met Tadhg O’Sullivan and some of the other design surgeons. He agreed to become involved in a clinical study of the device to be used to seek approval for the product in the United States, and also to become an “opinion leader” for the device in the UK.Between 2004 and 2009, the Newcastle surgeon implanted about 500 of the metal devices, making him one of the highest users of the product in the world.However, by late 2006 a number of his patients were presenting with difficulties. Nargol began to study the performance of the DePuy product in his patients, working with hospital colleague Simon Jameson.Among the matters they began to examine was the role played by the “angle” of implantation of the cup. They also began to notice that it was smaller models of the device, used in smaller framed persons, that appeared to be causing the most difficulties.When he revised the DePuy hip in some of his patients, Nargol noted a “greenish grey” fluid in the hip joint while doing so. This was “tissue necrosis”, he told the courts in Australia in an affidavit in 2013.In early 2007, he asked Ian Newell, DePuy’s regional manager in the Newcastle area, if he knew of other cases involving greenish grey fluid and tissue necrosis. “Mr Newell replied that he was ‘not aware of any’,” Nargol said in his affidavit.The response he got from DePuy caused Nargol to think that the problems he was encountering were caused by his work rather than the product.At a meeting with Newell and others in a hotel in Durham in September 2007, Nargol discussed the apparent link between smaller devices and high ion levels.In response, Newell showed him the data from a DePuy study of 89 patients who had received the hips in the UK, Australia, South Africa and Germany. The study subjected them to regular blood-testing to see if their cobalt and chromium ion levels became elevated.In November 2007, two papers about the DePuy hips were presented at the American Academy of Hip and Knee Surgeons conference in Dallas, Texas, one by Nargol and one by Graham Isaac, the DePuy engineer who led the team that designed the new product. Both flagged problems with the device.Isaac’s paper was entitled Whole Blood Metal Ion Levels after Surface Replacement of the Hip the effect of Component Positioning, and the authors included Isaac, Tadgh O’Sullivan and the other design surgeons, as well as a surgeon from South Africa. The authors reported that 24 months after their procedures, the ion levels for 50 patients (40 male and 10 female) showed three female (30 per cent) and three males (7.5 per cent) had significantly higher ion levels than would be expected.These elevated levels were associated with their devices being implanted at particular angles, the conference was told.DePuy, O’Sullivan and the other authors were saying the negative outcomes were related to how the devices were implanted rather than attributable to any defects in the device.During 2008, Nargol continued to have regular contact with Isaac, Newell and other DePuy representatives. He also began to notice patients with difficulties whose implants had been put in at an angle that was at or near the “safe zone” that he and his colleagues had identified from their research.In time, Nargol came to believe that the product was at fault, not his work as a surgeon. The implants put in at particular angles tended to fail earlier than others, and so created the early impression that the angle was the source of the problem.In August 2008, Nargol stopped using the complete hip replacement product and in early 2009 he stopped using the DePuy resurfacing product also.A colleague, surgeon David Langton, had by this time noticed a new problem with the DePuy implant called “edge-loading”, which contributed to high wear and debris and was, in Langton’s view, the result of the design of the DePuy product.During a meeting with Isaac on March 11th, 2009, at DePuy’s offices in Leeds, Langton and Nargol outlined their latest findings.Nargol said there were problems with the DePuy product even when it was implanted at the recommended angle. There was a “design flaw”, especially with smaller cups.One of the DePuy representatives at the meeting said, “we’re f**ked”, Nargol said in his Australian affidavit. Isaac said the problem was “multifactorial”, with the factors involved including patient weight and activity levels.Requests submitted through DePuy for interviews with Isaac and Newell were declined.In time Nargol became one of the harshest critics globally of the DePuy product. He and Langton became involved in litigation around the world as patients sued DePuy for damages. Nargol, along with Langton, gave evidence in a lot of these cases and the surgeons are party to continuing proceedings in the US where, as designated whistleblowers, they stand to make significant amounts of money if DePuy ends up having to pay out to the US Government for implants sold to public health programmes.The judge did not have to rule on the mala fides issue because of the position adopted by DePuy in the trial, but he rejected the attack on Nargol’s evidence. He said the expert witnesses for both sides had given honest evidence. Nargol would not be interviewed by The  because of the ongoing litigation in various jurisdictions.In 2010, by way of his involvement in litigation, Nargol discovered that other surgeons had expressed concerns during the mid-2000s about the DePuy product, contrary to what he said he had been told by DePuy.The highly regarded Belfast orthopaedic surgeon, David Beverland, told Nargol he had stopped using the DePuy product in early 2007. Requests from The  to Beverland for an interview met with no response.Nargol contacted Beverland in 2010 after being told by a former DePuy employee that the Belfast surgeon had experienced problems with his patients.In his Australian affidavit, Nargol quoted a 2010 email from Beverland to Isaac: “All in all, this ASR problem has to date been the worst problem I have faced in my surgical career. It has been a real nightmare.”Nargol also said that in 2010 he was shown emails from the Dutch surgeon Paul Born to a DePuy executive, dated June 2006, in which he said he’d experienced a significant failure rate with DePuy and would no longer be using the product.Nargol said that on several occasions during 2007 and 2008 he had asked Newell, Isaac and their colleague Magnus Flett if other surgeons were noticing similar problems to him.“Mr Newell, Mr Flett, and Mr Isaac told me on several occasions that ‘no one else has had any problems with the ASR’.”The DePuy metal hip was voluntarily recalled in August 2010 after figures from the National Joint Registry for England, Wales and Northern Ireland showed it was performing badly when compared with its peers.The registry collects information on all joint replacement operations so as to measure the performance of the different implants that are on the market.In its most recent annual report, the registry said that for the 992,090 hip replacements monitored since it began collecting data in 2002, some 7.27 per cent have been replaced (or revised, as the medical term goes).The replacement rate would be lower if it were not for metal-on-metal implants which showed a replacement rate of 19-22 per cent. The most successful type of hip replacement, metal-on-polyethylene, had a replacement rate of 4.87 per cent.“Metal-on-metal resurfacings have a revision rate at 14 years of 14.76 per cent and their use, as with all metal-on-metal bearings, is now very limited.”After DePuy withdrew its product from the market, there was extensive discussion as to how it had been approved for sale in the first place.The EU and the United States are the world’s two most important bodies when it comes to the regulation of the medical devices sector. In the EU, there are multiple “notified bodies” each of which can award CE marks to proposed new medical devices, thereby allowing them be marketed across the union.In Ireland, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) is the body that licenses new medical devices, while the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has a role in monitoring the safety of devices that are on the market.The DePuy products were approved by BSI, a UK-notified body. Clinical trials were not required under EU rules, even though the products are recognised as among the higher-risk category of medical devices. Approval by an EU-certified body opened the way to the devices being marketed in other economies, including Australia and South Africa. Many of the world’s poorer nations rely on the developed world for the regulation of medical devices.In the US, the FDA decided that the DePuy hip resurfacing product was a significantly new product and required clinical testing. It allowed the marketing of the total hip replacement product.In 2009, DePuy was told confidentially by the FDA that it would not be granting approval for the hip resurfacing product after reviewing company studies that showed it had failed prematurely in “significant” numbers. In response the multinational quietly withdrew its request for approval.The DePuy hip replacement product was approved for the US market by way of a controversial pathway called “substantial equivalence”.Medical devices can be approved for the market in both the EU and the US if they can be shown to be substantially equivalent to a product already on the market, or if they can be shown to be made of parts that are substantially the same as parts already on the market.The rule applies even if the device or parts already approved have since been withdrawn, even for poor performance reasons.As a study in the New England Journal of Medicine put it in January 2013, approval by the FDA by way of substantial equivalence “does not mean that a new device is safe and effective: it means that the device is deemed no less safe and no less effective than a predicate”.The study looked at how the DePuy hip replacement device came to be approved for implantation in US citizens. It found that the lineage of the device involved 95 different devices or device parts that had operated as predicate devices or parts to which DePuy said its new product was substantially equivalent.The predicate devices included ones that were “discontinued long ago because their risk of revision was so much higher than that of other hip” products, the authors noted.The NSAI was not able to tell The  how many higher risk devices it had approved over the past decade by way of equivalence, or how many had been approved after clinical trials, even though the information was sought as far back as September 3rd last.However, MacAleenan of the HPRA points out that precisely because implanted medical devices designed to last a long time inside the body are hard to subject to pre-market clinical testing, the data that comes from devices that are already on the market is particularly valuable.There is another interesting aspect to the substantial equivalence phenomenon both here and in the US, according to a Newcastle University biomedical engineer, Tom Joyce, who has extensively studied the DePuy debacle“It happens all the time that a product comes onto market via substantial equivalence, meaning that it is supposed to be similar to a product already on the market, but it is then marketed as if it is wildly different,” said Joyce, who has worked with Nargol and Langon on behalf of Irish plaintiffs.The EU is currently introducing a new regime for the certification of medical devices that is in part a response to the DePuy hip and other high-profile failures.Tadhg O’Sullivan told The  that up to the date that the DePuy products were withdrawn, he never had a problem with any of his resurfacing patients.Despite the global controversy over the performance of DePuy hip, there is no mistaking O’Sullivan’s continuing enthusiasm for the product.During a lengthy interview in his consultation rooms in the Whitfield Clinic, O’Sullivan said the DePuy implant was an important innovation for patients with serious hip problems.Asked if in his view there was a design flaw with the DePuy hip resurfacing device, his answer was simple: “Not really. If put in properly, no.”Likewise, he said he did not believe there was a flaw with the ball and cup of the total hip replacement product, though there was a problem with the stem that attached it to the patient’s femur.He believed that DePuy, and J\u0026ampJ, were probably acting on the advice of lawyers when they decided to withdraw the product from the market. The decision, he says, was the equivalent of saying: “Sue the f**k out of us.”And that, he said, is what has happened.DePuy has “pumped an outrageous amount of money into putting this thing right. Unfortunately, the more they pump in, the more our legal profession want. They’re like an insatiable dog.”As well as assisting the DePuy engineers and attending design team meetings over a number of years, O’Sullivan was also the co-inventor of two patents registered in the name of DePuy that were associated with the hip product.Publicly available information in the US indicates that the two US design surgeons who worked with O’Sullivan on the DePuy project, Tom Schmalzried and Thomas Veil, received a number of million dollars each in royalties and other payments from the manufacturer.However, O’Sullivan says his royalty income from DePuy was “relatively small” and that if the time he had spent as a design surgeon travelling to meetings and conferences for DePuy had instead been spent working at the Whitfield Clinic he would have been equally well rewarded.He has earned more from DePuy as a result of the programme it has put in place for patients post the withdrawal of the hip product than he did while working as a design surgeon, he said.The enormous global medical legal battle that has erupted since the product was recalled has led to a great amount of misinformation coming into the public domain, the surgeon said. “We have poor people coming in here thinking they are going to die.” It is “very hard to get at the truth when there is a huge amount of money to be made from suing a company”. he added.O’Sullivan said he had not seen one paper which, read closely, showed heightened cobalt and chromium levels causing medical problems. Yet people were coming to him now, he said, with normal ageing problems such as becoming forgetful, and blaming it on their ion levels.The patient may feel fantastic, and may have no problem with their hips, but he tells them the only way to get their ion levels down is “to take out the generator”. It is their choice.Surgeons want to do what is best for their patients, he said. The DePuy project was about “trying to help people of 30 years of age who needed a hip and not be sending them home and have them not working for the next 20 years.”As matters now stand, most metal hip products have been withdrawn from the market and all major manufacturers are producing a similar ceramic ball and cup product. “They’re all giving you the basic Ford Focus.”The threat of being sued means doctors feel pressurised into doing what is safest in terms of legal exposure, rather than what is most appropriate for their patients.Surgeons know that if they put in a product that has been around for decades, but which fails, they cannot be sued, he said. And manufacturers, if they are going to fear being sued, are deterred from creating new devices.The loser in the end, he says, because of the stifling of innovation, is the patient.A special alternative dispute resolution (ADR) process has been put in place by the Irish courts such is the level of claims that have been lodged against DePuy over its metal hip product.The highest award to date has been €750,000, but the average is in the region of €100,000. If a settlement is not agreed, a claimant can take their case to court.As of July, 540 of the 1,108 sets of proceedings lodged against DePuy had been resolved. Many of the proceedings lodged do not qualify for the ADR.A spokeswoman for DePuy said she would not give a figure for total awards made in Ireland to date.“DePuy has no greater responsibility than to the patients who use our products,” she said in a statement to The . “We are committed to the wellbeing of our patients and believe the full history of the ASR system shows we have worked properly and responsibly to improve patients’ lives through innovation.“We will continue to stand by our patients.”A special investigation by The  in association with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3716357.1543613086!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish preparations for no deal brexit intensify","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSenior executives from the main airlines, aircraft leasing and aircraft maintenance companies met Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney to discuss contingencies.Behind the scenes preparations by the Government for a no-deal Brexit have intensified in recent weeks, with detailed planning now under way for the possibility of the UK crashing out of the EU next March.Senior executives from the main airlines, aircraft leasing and aircraft maintenance companies met with Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, Minister for Transport Shane Ross and senior officials on Wednesday to discuss Brexit contingencies and preparations.This meeting preceded a European Commission seminar in Brussels on Thursday, also attended by senior Irish officials, on how air travel would be affected by a no-deal Brexit.

Irish diplomats were pessimistic about Mrs May’s prospects during a weekly video conference which involves officials in Dublin, London and Brussels on Thursday morning, sources said.However, they reported that a series of amendments on which House of Commons speaker John Bercow has said he will allow votes, before the substantive vote on the treaty, could result in the British parliament voting to rule out a hard Brexit.Senior Irish officials were also in Brussels for meetings with the commission on Friday about Brexit and no-deal preparations. Irish officials have also been meeting with French counterparts to discuss possible arrangements for Irish trucks coming through the UK and into the port of Calais, where a special EU lane could be reserved for Irish traffic.Government sources say preparations have intensified in recent weeks amid continuing political uncertainty in London.Senior officials say that there is likely to be a step-change in the Government’s public stance after the vote on December 11th, with more obvious and explicit preparations for a no-deal scenario being put in place. While the Government will continue to plan for what it calls the “central scenario” of an agreed Brexit following a two-year transition period, there will be an acknowledgment if Mrs May is defeated on December 11th that the prospect of a no-deal Brexit will move significantly closer.In particular, there are growing concerns over the potential economic impact of a no-deal Brexit, following a Bank of England report this week which warned of an economic crash worse than the one precipitated by the financial crisis of 2008. Concerns centre on the effect on exporters of a sudden fall in sterling, but there are also concerns in the Department of Finance about the budgetary implications of a damaging Brexit.Mr Coveney said on Friday there is still hope the withdrawal treaty could be passed by the House of Commons, adding that he thought Mrs May “has been underestimated at every step of the Brexit process”. However, privately, senior Government sources say that a more realistic – but still optimistic – scenario is that the deal passes on a second vote after being defeated the first time.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin was critical of the Government’s Brexit preparations, saying it had “failed to show the urgency or activity required to fully prepare for it”.But Mr Martin reiterated his pledge not to bring down the Government “during the critical phase which Brexit is in”. He said: “An election campaign and lengthy government-formation period would have posed a serious risk to our national interest.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Bryan O’Brien Methodist College in Belfast – better known as Methody\u0026nbsp– is an interdenominational, co-ed grammar school located at the bottom of\u0026nbspMalone Road in Belfast, next to Queens University. Founded by the Methodist Church in 1865, it has a long-established academic and sporting pedigree in Northern Irish second-level education and is ranked among the top schools in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom.Traditionally a Protestant school, Methody now draws both Protestant unionist and Catholic nationalist students. Past pupils include the\u0026nbspDUP MPs Sammy Wilson and Ian Paisley jnr, the Nobel physics laureate Ernest Walton, the former Church of Ireland Primate of All Ireland Robin Eames, the artist Colin Davidson, the Hollywood actor Jamie Dornan and the rugby player Paddy Jackson.Joni Mcilroy, who is 18 and\u0026nbspfrom Newtownards, Co Down, says she is Northern Irish. She grew up in a non-religious household. She wants to study politics in the United States.Jonathan ‘Jonny’ Mearns, an 18-year-old\u0026nbspfrom Dunmurry, is a Protestant unionist and identifies as British. He would like to study politics at Queen’s and eventually set up a new conservative political party.Izaak Carnduff, who is 17 and from Bangor, Co Down, identifies as Irish. He comes from a nationalist background and is non-denominational. He hopes to go to university in England next year.Hala Heenan, who is 17 and from south Belfast, is a Catholic nationalist but is not overtly religious. She identifies as Irish. She hopes to study history at university abroad and to return to live in Belfast.Adam Flanagan, a 17-year-old\u0026nbspfrom south Belfast, is a Protestant unionist and British. He wants to study economics in Britain and to return to Northern Ireland to work in business and, later, possibly politics.Shannon McKeown-Gilmore, also a 17-year-old from south Belfast, is a Catholic nationalist and Irish, though she is not religious. She has applied to study law in England and hopes to become a barrister.Jake Lowry, who is 17 and from east Belfast, is a Protestant unionist and British. He hopes to study politics and international relations in England next year and would like to be a civil servant or diplomat.Six out of the seven students raise their hands.None of the seven students puts up their hand.This group of 17- and 18-year-old students, are all in their final year at Methodist College in Belfast and are thinking seriously about their future education and careers. They sat down with The  to discuss Brexit and what it means for them and Northern Ireland.The discussion takes place as the draft orce deal emerges and stirs isions in Northern Ireland, Britain and beyond. The political consequences of a no-deal, disorderly Brexit are huge five students, including one unionist, believe Brexit could result in a united Ireland in their lifetimes.Just two of the students have Irish passports but some of the others, and their family members, are applying because of the potential restrictions on travel after the UK quits the EU in March 2019.Even the only student who supports Brexit within the group, Jonny Mearns, a Protestant unionist, says he might consider an Irish passport if it became very difficult to travel.For these seven students at Methody, Brexit has reopened a complex debate about nationality and identity politics that the Good Friday or Belfast Agreement – negotiated two or three years before they were born – attempted to settle.Jonny\u0026nbspThe money the UK puts into the EU could be spent elsewhere, particularly education. Britain is much better off using that money and trading with the EU or the rest of the world on its own terms.Joni\u0026nbspIt is kind of a regression of ideas to combat globalisation, which I think is impossible anyway. I am not really sure what it is achieving. The main things at the beginning were immigration, sovereignty I am not really sure how we are going to gain those things through Brexit.Izaak\u0026nbspIt is breaking up different people, different countries and it will make it a lot harder for students and people early in their lives to get as many opportunities as they do right now.Jake\u0026nbspAs always in Northern Ireland, identity is a huge issue and you could almost say that Brexit has created an identity crisis. There are nationalists within Northern Ireland who feel that they are being drawn away from their Irish identity and the uncertainty over a hard or soft border, or indeed for unionists, if there is going to be a border down the Irish Sea. Young people within Northern Ireland still remain very close to their identities and all this is being thrown into uncertainty by Brexit.Shannon\u0026nbspI don’t think it will be a deal that everybody wants or agrees with. It’ll be a very middle-ground deal trying to please as many people as possible and ultimately will do the complete opposite.Jake\u0026nbspI live in a predominantly unionist area and in fact the post office ran out of Irish passport application forms within days of the Brexit vote, so there is a real appetite because of the uncertainty.Joni\u0026nbspOur Irish passport forms are in the post. I have always wanted to travel loads so it is pretty crucial that you are not held up in loads of different queues. It was a bit of a no-brainer really.Jonny\u0026nbspThere are a lot of unionists taking up that opportunity but I just think the border question in terms of travelling from France to Britain, having control over our own border, is more important to me than being able to walk through a line at the airport.Adam\u0026nbspThe rulebook of identity in Northern Ireland is almost being torn up by Brexit. There were people who five years ago would have thought it unthinkable to get an Irish passport but they think it now just makes sense. As a Northern Irish unionist, I think that’s what makes Brexit most frightening. If we continue barrelling down this uncertain path towards Brexit, it genuinely calls into question unionism in Northern Ireland and Northern Ireland’s very existence ultimately as well.Hala\u0026nbspIt is a worry for my family because we have a house just across the Border. Are we going to have to bring our passports or other ludicrous questions like that? It is usually a quick 45-minute trip down the road. When travelling in the car, there is a little pole with a little red stick on it. That’s how you know you have crossed the Border.My mum and dad recount the tales of when you used to have to stop and open the boot of the car and there would be army checks. Now there is such an ease of travel. It instils quite a big fear inside me that there is a very small possibility that that might come back.Jonny\u0026nbspTo a certain extent. From Northern Ireland’s perspective, we worry about it a lot but we fail to realise that the majority of our trade is with the rest of the United Kingdom. We also fail to realise that the Republic relies on the United Kingdom more than we rely on the Republic of Ireland.Adam\u0026nbspAny hard border or any hardening of the border, even whether it avoids a totally hard border, is certainly dangerous in that it could risk a return to violence. Whether that would be the case, no-one can foresee that but I think the risk of that isn’t a price worth paying.Shannon\u0026nbspThe DUP – because of their own personal interest, they were obviously a pro-Brexit party – are not recognising that the people of Northern Ireland voted to remain.Jake\u0026nbspThe DUP are a Eurosceptic party. They campaigned for Brexit and Sinn Féin unfortunately don’t take up their seats so how can they advocate for the people of Northern Ireland if they refuse to go to Westminster. It is the issue of symbolism. Sometimes you have to put pragmatism before symbolism.Izaak\u0026nbspIf a “no deal” Brexit was to occur due to chaos from an event such as the DUP pulling the rug out from under Theresa May’s government, then I could potentially see a fracturing of the union that would cause Northern Ireland to splinter off from the UK.Jonny\u0026nbspDespite Northern Ireland voting Remain, it is highly unlikely that many of those who voted Remain but identity as British would be willing to sacrifice the union for the sake of remaining in the EU.Joni\u0026nbspIt seems that unionists in the North are too adamant in their support of the union to concede, and southern nationalists don’t feel strongly enough for Northern Ireland to leave the union at this moment in time. Yet the uncertainty created by Brexit and the changes in Northern Ireland suggest that the prospect is not as far-fetched as it once was.Jonny\u0026nbspBrexit could perhaps result in a united Ireland, but it is improbable. It would have to take Brexit to be a catastrophe before even thinking about this, which I do not for one moment believe will be the case.Jake\u0026nbspA no-deal Brexit would expedite any potential unification of Ireland. Regardless of the actualities of such a scenario, the symbolic significance of a hard border could galvanise moderate voters and pro-EU unionists to turn to Irish nationalism as their solution to a no-deal scenario. Of course, that wouldn’t be a sudden change in thinking but something that would perhaps develop over the decades to come.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

By forcing through this vote, while excluding UK companies from the contracts on unfounded security grounds, the European Commission has put this at risk,” Mr Gyimah said.“Without full, fair and open industrial involvement, Galileo doesn’t offer the UK value for money or meet our defence needs, so we would be obliged to walk away.”UK companies have built components for Galileo and one of the project\u0027s two Security Monitoring Centres was based  Swanwick in Hampshire. The site is now being relocated to Spain.On Friday, Mrs May announced Britain was giving up trying to gain access to the system for defence and critical national infrastructure purposes.I have been clear from the outset that the UK will remain firmly committed to Europe\u0027s collective security after Brexit, the prime minister said.But given the Commission\u0027s decision to bar the UK from being fully involved in developing all aspects of Galileo, it is only right that we find alternatives.I cannot let our armed services depend on a system we cannot be sure of. That would not be in our national interest. And as a global player with world-class engineers and steadfast allies around the world, we are not short of options.Instead, Mrs May confirmed the UK would build its own Global Navigation Satellite System, a project that independent experts estimate will cost between to £3-£5 billion.The UK is expected to work with the US and other Five Eyes partners, and Mrs May said any new system must be compatible with GPS so the two systems can cover for each other if one is subject to attack.The plan had been suggested before. In August, Mrs May ordered officials to start work on a British satellite-navigation system. Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, signed off funding amounting to as much as £100 million to map out plans for a post-Brexit UK satellite system The UK Space Agency is currently leading work, backed by the Ministry of Defence, on a planned British system to provide both open and encrypted signals with the same range of commercial and security applications as GPS and Galileo.More than 50 UK companies have expressed interest in the project and a series of contracts are being tendered.British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies around the globe would be used to provide the necessary ground-based infrastructure to deliver worldwide coverage.Mrs May said: What is in our national interest is to say \u0027No, you haven\u0027t allowed us full access, so we will develop an alternative, we will look at alternative options\u0027, we are doing that work but we will work with other international partners to do so as well.Decisions have yet to be taken on whether it will represent good value for money for the UK to make use of the commercial side of the Galileo project.In September, Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, poured cold water on Britain\u0027s plans to create a system that would rival Galileo..“A strong united Europe will allow its member states to reach for the stars. Thanks to our Galileo programme Europe is still in the space race.No single member state would have been able to launch the sateillite that 400 million users round the world are benefiting from,” he said, “Without Europe there would be no Galileo.“We respect of course the British decision to leave our Union. We regret it deeply, but we also ask the British government to understand that someone who leaves the Union cannot be in the same privileged position of the member states.Please review our commenting policyMexico\u0026#39s great gamble: \u0026#39Trump plays poker, but Lopez Obrador plays chess\u0026#39  Eurosceptics warn that EU judges will rule over Britain after Brexit while high on legal cannabisComment: Why I cannot back the Prime Minister\u0026#39s Brexit planTory minister Sam Gyimah resigns in protest at Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit dealComment: I thought about Botox… until I found out what it meant George H W Bush, former US president, dies aged 94 - latest news and world reactionViral Tide: How Russia became the new frontline in the war on HIVAIDSComment: Rather than committing political kamikaze, MPs must hold their noses and \u2028vote for this dealSir Cliff Richard avoids being pictured with Wimbledon ball boys despite being cleared of child sex assault allegationsBrad Pitt and Angelina Jolie reach custody agreement over their childrenNorth Korean soldier defects to South across border after guard posts blown upBack-to-back earthquakes shatter roads and windows in AlaskaG20 summit: Theresa May rebuts Donald Trump over Brexit deal and meets Saudi Crown PrinceSoaring numbers of children forced to have teeth taken out in hospital Prevent critics \u0026#39on side of extremists,\u0026#39 says home secretary Sajid JavidWho is Sam Gyimah?

On a weekday, when thousands of commuters were trying to get to work, college and school let alone the other, vast number of folk who thought they they would see the railway as their most convenient form of travel.Because it was in the North, the stoppage raised barely a glimmer of interest in the South. If it had happened in Kent or Surrey, to trains into London Bridge or Waterloo, all hell would have broken loose. Instead, it was just another day of misery, to go with the other numerous days lost, including when they changed the timetable, and the services across the North could not cope.Meanwhile, the Government is pressing ahead with a £56bn plan to develop HS2. Will the new high-speed link between London and the North-West change any of this? Will it improve things? Not at all. Will it make a difference that justifies such vast expenditure? Hardly. Is it a grotesque example of ministerial machismo, of gesture politics, of a total inability to see the wood for the trees? You bet it is.Archaeologists begin examining 10,000 years of history along HS2 routeNow we know HS2 really is a flawed projectHS2 requires extra £43bn \u0027for people to make the most of it\u0027The trains I’m talking about, the ones that were cancelled, were mostly on the branch lines, on the routes that people use day in, day out - not the West Coast Line, which already has a fast, comfortable service. In my lifetime, since growing up in Cumbria, and travelling to and from London to visit family, journey times have plummeted. On the main, trunk route - not on the secondary ones. This is where the problem lies, where the service is creaking.Cutting several minutes off the London to Manchester service does not matter a h’apporth. What would boost the experience immeasurably there would be to ensure that wifi works all the way, that a mobile signal is not lost. But that, too, is not what HS2 is about.Already, there is talk by those on the inside that the projected costs are soaring. The “main works civil contracts” on the London to Birmingham section, reports The Sunday Times, are “several billion pounds” over the official budget of £6.6bn. That’s before any earth is turned, and all manner of unseen, below ground problems are discovered.Conscious of a final bill that could spiral out of control, and being seen to get a grip, ministers are demanding that instead of sanctioning extra expenditure, costs are being renegotiated, to stick to the budgeted figure. This, in turn, has led to delays, as more design and development is required, and specifications redrawn. Again, the word is that the vast project - the country’s biggest and most demanding infrastructure scheme - is likely to be more than a year behind schedule.That\u0027s how fast HS2\u0026nbspservices will travel at when the project is completedPart of the issue here is that mooted figures are proving inaccurate, the result, apparently of an insistence that the new railway meets a deadline for the beginning of services, of 2026.The thinking behind this demand, that Britain is sick and tired of major capital constructions that seem to take forever to reach fulfilment (runway expansion of Heathrow was first raised exactly 50 years ago) is laudable. But put that together with a scheme that is huge and complex, and it can become a recipe for chaos. And that’s without HS2 being unnecessary in the first place.This is what ministers should realise: that £56bn buys you an awful lot of terribly needed enhancements, for instance to existing country and suburban services, and to digitalisation.There is a subtext, of course, to HS2 - one that is hardly ever raised, let alone publicly admitted. And it is that the 250mph railway has another purpose, beyond rushing passengers from London to Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester. It is that the faster railway makes commuting from Birmingham in particular all that more manageable. House prices in the West Midlands are so much cheaper than in the South-East. Public sector workers in essential occupations, in sectors like the NHS and education, will be able to afford to commute from Brum. HS2, you see, is aimed in part at alleviating London’s growing housing crisis. Which makes it a very expensive solution indeed.When confronted with the news of the overruns and delay, the Department for Transport said it would not comment on speculation. “Our priority is to ensure value for money for the taxpayer.”Yes, but does the overall project seriously provide value for money?Ministers have the ability to stop it in its tracks, to ert the investment elsewhere. Of course, that would involve a loss of pride. There would be some dismay in the North, but not as much as might be expected - particularly if the money was spent on other local, much-needed advancements. Perhaps they should test attitudes towards the new service before it\u0027s too late.For there are warning lights flashing all over this. An awful lot of cash is being committed to something for which there is little demand. Getting from A to B may become quicker, but B to C will be just as slow –\u0026nbspand it’s the B to C that is used by so many people every day, that ceased to operate last week and will do so again, even with HS2.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Regulated fares, meanwhile,\u0026nbspare linked to\u0026nbspretail price index\u0026nbspinflation and will rise by 3.2 per cent, as has previously been announced.Regardless of whether they buy regulated or unregulated tickets, the lot of users is not a happy one. They pay through the nose for\u0026nbspa shabby service prone to widespread disruption.\u0026nbspThese trains are affected by the Northern Rail strike this SaturdayA wake up call for rail operators? Commuters now have an ombudsmanThe near meltdown that followed the introduction of new timetables earlier this year brought\u0026nbsppublicity to the problem. But just as serious is the constant low-level pain inflicted upon passengers. No wonder the announcement left them, and their representatives, spitting tacks.\u0026nbspThe backdrop to this is the government’s policy of having taxpayers spend less subsidising the railways, with the\u0026nbspburden being shifted on to the fare-paying public. \u0026nbspAt first blush, that would seem like a credible plan, and even more so when you look at the numbers.\u0026nbspAccording to Full Fact, the fact checking charity, the railways have received subsidies averaging about £5bn a year over the last five years.\u0026nbspBut that’s just the start of it when it comes to public money. In 2016-17 about £15bn was spent in total, partly due to the way Network Rail, which owns and operates the tracks and infrastructure, is funded.\u0026nbspWanda Wyporska\u0026nbspof the Equality Trust\u0026nbspmade the point in  last year that this spending is weighted disproportionately towards London and the southeast, and so favours well-to-do commuters. She argued that the government should focus\u0026nbspon poorer areas\u0026nbspand\u0026nbsptransport used by the less well-off, such as buses and trams. She made a good point.\u0026nbspHowever, I would argue that one needs to look at rail in the context of an integrated transport policy that serves the needs of the nation, and its economy, as a whole.\u0026nbspRail, which has seen a sharp increase in passenger numbers and requires investment to cope with them, plays an important role in keeping people off Britain’s congested, polluting roads. Through that lens, the money is\u0026nbspwell spent.None of this changes the fact that the private rail operators have done a rotten job. Given what they’ve experienced, and what they pay for it, passengers’ outrage is entirely justified.\u0026nbspAt times like this, rail companies are fond of pointing out that 98p out of every £1 in fares goes into running the railways and that the extra money is needed to keep the show on the road.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

They\u0026nbspwere asked their opinions on their bank’s current account, and how likely they were to recommend the company. TSB’s overall score was 58 per cent, putting it in joint last place with Bank of Ireland, which was bottom of the table for the second year running. TSB sheds 20,000 current accounts in wake of massive IT failure Monzo to launch new crowdfunding round as it seeks $1bn valuationTSB boss Paul Pester steps down after new IT problemsTSB, which came in fourth in last year’s ranking, has suffered a crisis this year after a series of major IT failures, which caused\u0026nbspthousands of customers\u0026nbspto leave.Chief executive Paul Pester\u0026nbspstepped down over the tech meltdown and the chaos prompted a parliamentary inquiry. More than half of the TSB customers surveyed by Which? said they had experienced technical issues in the last year. The bank also scored poorly on customer service, telephone and online banking and complaint handling. “TSB’s slump suggests that customers felt outraged to have endured the prolonged IT issues that left millions locked out of their accounts,” said Gareth Shaw, money expert at Which?A TSB spokesperson said: “We’re sorry for the problems customers experienced as a result of our IT switch.“Regrettably this is why our scores are low in this poll. Our priority is putting things right for our customers and we’ve made significant progress.”Meanwhile, Monzo came out on top after reaching a large enough sample size for the first time since it launched in 2016. The\u0026nbsponline-only bank scored full marks for both communication and its app. With a total customer satisfaction score of 86 per cent, it narrowly beat telephone and online-only First Direct, which scored 85 per cent. Nationwide\u0026nbspcame in third\u0026nbspwith 79 per cent and challenger\u0026nbsp Bank was fourth with 76 per cent. Which? said this year’s ranking showed challenger banks were gaining favour. Mr Shaw said: “Impressive results from challenger banks place them well ahead of many of the biggest banking brands in Britain, showing that innovation and modern ideas are shaking up the market, with good customer service truly valued by customers.“Our research shows a clear gap between the best and worst providers and should act as a catalyst for customers unhappy with their service to switch banks – as it’s never been easier.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

That should allow people to share more personal moments with a smaller group, Instagram said.Instagram Stories has become the place to express yourself and share everyday moments, but our community has grown — sometimes what you want to share isn\u0027t for everyone, the company wrote in its announcement blog post.Instagram’s latest feature aims to tackle social media addictionInstagram had always intended for stories to be a more personal way of sharing information on the site. Not only do they disappear 24 hours after they are posted, users can see everyone who has watched them.Adding people to the list of close friends is simple: go to your profile and click on the Close Friends option in the side menu and add people. Then when you share a new story, you\u0027ll have the option of sharing only with the people in that list.Only you can see your own close friends list, people will not know from the app if they are not in it, and there is no way for people to ask to be added.\u0026nbspIf you are chosen as someone\u0027s close friend, you will see a green ring badge when you\u0027re viewing their stories, and a green ring around their profile photo in the list of stories.Close friends will be rolling out globally today on both iOS and Android, the company said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Cathy Adams, who started her love affair with Instagram in 2012, says the world is better when we’re connected to it, while Helen Coffey, who has never used it,\u0026nbsprefuses to tie her ego to her travelsClick to followThe IndependentBanning social media is a progressive idea, but does it bite the hand that feeds?Why we should all use Instagram on holidayIt all started on 3 January 2012.\u0026nbspThat was the date of my first ever Instagram upload. It was of a saucer of tea in some dingy burlesque club near Chancery Lane. It got zero likes – probably because who drinks tea at a burlesque club?\u0026nbspThings got better from there.5 April 2014: 11 people liked a picture of me posing with a giant frozen margarita in Tijuana. Nine people liked a picture of my feet standing on a glass floor on the 103rd floor of the Willis Tower in Chicago a few months later. This summer, countless people commented on the braggy snaps of me swimming in glass-clear waters in the Males (because… Males).Disappointingly, only 48 people liked a picture of me at my wedding, whereas 137 liked a candid (ish) pic of me laughing with Gordon Ramsay at his Bread Street Kitchen in Hong Kong.Sarah Michelle Gellar ‘terribly sorry for fat shaming’ Instagram postYou always remember the numbers. As a natural egotist, uploading a carefully curated snap to the channel and watching the likes roll in makes me feel all kind of zippy. After all, these Instagrams have timestamped my life since 2012.That’s not to say that Instagram doesn’t often behave. The bad things are myriad: waiting for Instagrammers to take pictures of your pancakes at brunch, or then artfully arranging your coffee and sunglasses and Moleskine around a cold plate of eggs. Trying to enjoy the pink-purple-blue sunset on Bali’s Seminyak beach and finding you have a row of Instagram screens blocking the view. Or the ninth circle of Instagram hell, which is queueing for a snap of Santorini’s sunset or for the small-time sunflower field in Canada which banned visitors thanks to Instagram overload.These are bad things, but it doesn’t mean Instagram is a Bad Thing: even if the Vienna Tourism Board currently thinks differently.Its current campaign “See Vienna, not #Vienna” is asking tourists to “see the city behind your pics”. It’s a progressive idea, particularly because so much destination marketing rests on the halo effect on social media. (Although its Instagram page, endorsed by almost 100,000 people, is still asking snappers to share ‘Vienna pics by including #ViennaNow’.)\u0026nbspSome Instagrammers might be badly behaved, but on the whole the platform is a force for good, especially in travel, and destinations should use to it their advantageIt’s a clever campaign, but one that rather bites the hand that feeds. Some Instagrammers might be badly behaved, but on the whole\u0026nbspthe platform is a force for good, especially in travel, and destinations should use to it their advantage.Mostly because of the staggering number of users. More than one in eight of us globally have Instagram. Users upload 400 million Instagram Stories a day. There are commercial gains, too: more than 72 per cent of users have bought something they saw on Instagram, according to Business Insider. For a tourist board, this provides a rich seam of free (free!) content, even if many of the snaps don’t deserve to be hung on the mantelpiece. Even the Vienna Tourism Board isn’t above using Instagram indirectly to promote its new campaign.Few people argue that being more connected than ever before – through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or even, howl, LinkedIn – is a bad thing. After all, it’s the primary reason so many people travel: they want to be connected to another world. Instagram facilitates that, albeit virtually. When I lived abroad, Instagram was one of the many platforms I had at my disposal to give a sneak flavour into my life in Asia. (Instagram was for delicious food pictures, Twitter was for snark.) It was also useful when I didn’t want to have janky Skype calls with friendseditorsmy mother – they could simply check into my Instagram to figure out where I was and what I was looking at.103rd floor of the Willis TowerFor journalists, no platform can be discounted: we need all the tools we can get to understand our audience. And if our audience is on Instagram, then we need to be on Instagram too. Especially working in travel, where spectacular images are so important to help sell a destination (alongside, ahem, fantastic words). Personally, Instagram has given me work opportunities I wouldn’t have found elsewhere: I’ve been commissioned to write features based on the destinations I’ve tagged myself in via Instagram, although I’m still waiting for a blurry photo of a cityscape to be bought by a picture editor…That brings me on to my next point: Instagram is great for meeting new people and picking up tips. Often I’ve geotagged myself in a particular destination and locals have messaged me about some cool new restaurant, a must-visit tea shop, or even offered to meet up for a beer to show me around. A photo I posted of the rust-red National Museum of Cambodia last year prompted a friend to message and say she was in Phnom Penh at the same time – and did we want to grab a Khmer beer later?\u0026nbspThen there’s the inspiration side of Instagram. I once organised a bucket-list trip to Tanzania based on a photo so flat-out spectacular that I knew I’d have to see it for myself. A journalist I followed (in the days before influencers) had snapped a picture of herself in an infinity pool at a safari lodge in the Serengeti, overlooking a watering hole. And so two weeks of annual leave was booked around visiting that particular lodge. I didn’t get the same shot (or even want to) but watching elephants bathing in the water while lazing in a cool kidney pool was every bit as blockbuster as the Instagram snap promised. And really – how is booking a holiday based on an Instagram post any different from flicking through an analogue Thomas Cook catalogue?Travellers forget that Instagram is also practical, because it’s real-time information. The app holds a mine of data. How big are the queues at Anne Frank’s house in Amsterdam? Check Stories tagged at that location. What is the weather like for a weekend trip to Berlin – are people snapped in light jackets or thick coats? Is it currently bucketing it down in Hong Kong? All you have to do is check out a handful of the 95 million (ish) posts per day.Yes, unplugging from Instagram while on holiday might mean you notice how gorgeously rococo Vienna’s Schönbrunn Palace is. But by snapping an Instagram of it, you’ve given yourself a memory to return to again and again. The world is better when we’re connected to it. And in this miserablist world, sometimes it just helps to have a nice picture to look at.Why we should all take a leaf out of Vienna’s book and unhashtag our livesGazing out over the picturesque expanse of Lisbon from my hotel’s rooftop bar, its pastel-shaded, higgledy-piggledy buildings interspersed with verdant trees, I try to take it all in. The sky, amber-hued as the sun sets the Tagus river and accompanying Ponte 25 de Abril, sparkling roguishly in the distance the storybook-perfect Castelo St Jorge, set high upon a hill in all its glory. I look and look and look – but I don’t reach for my smartphone.Yes, ladies and gentleman – I may be the only travel writer on the planet who doesn’t have Instagram. I’m not alone but I certainly seem to be in the minority friends and colleagues never fail to meet my app absenteeism with disbelief.“But you go to all those amazing places!” they say. “It’s such a waste!”My standard response is a curt, “I don’t like taking photos or looking at other people’s.” Which usually stumps them.They’re right in one respect. I do get the opportunity to visit some phenomenal spots – luxury hotels with infinity pools, white sand beaches lapped by cobalt waves, Michelin-starred restaurants with tasting menus so damn good I feel drunk on decadence. (Do you hate me yet?)Yat Sen Memorial ParkMuch of it is Insta-heaven, just begging to be caught, captioned and catapulted onto the internet’s favourite photo-sharing platform. But, while I obviously love heading out into the world to explore and experience, I haven’t the slightest desire to distil each destination into one staged shot, timed to perfection and filtered beyond all recognition.And now there’s at least one place which won’t expect that of me, one place that actively discourages such behaviour despite the allegedly increasing influence of “Instagrammability” as a factor in people’s holiday choices.Vienna’s bold new tourism campaign, Unhashtag Vienna, is targeting the social media generation with a simple message – put down the smartphone and enjoy the moment instead. Signs reading “See Vienna, not #Vienna” are there to greet visitors at the airport and, for the month of November, the tourist information office on Albertinaplatz will be giving out instant cameras with just 10 shots. The aim is that tourists spend less time snapping and more time actually experiencing.While I obviously love heading out into the world to explore and experience, I haven’t the slightest desire to distil each destination into one staged shot, timed to perfection and filtered beyond all recognitionIt might seem antagonistic to some but to me it’s plain refreshing. I salute Vienna for both their innovation and bravery in daring to suggest that perhaps there might be a better way to see a city than through a screen.Long before I became a travel writer I started to resent the impact smartphones had on travel – and on all activities, come to think of it. Dining with a friend and them only half listening while I shared my news, their attention far more invested in an ever-changing news feed going on trips where I had to repeatedly wait out of shot before I could sit down as colleagues secured the desired pic watching the sunset, my view marred by a hundred obtrusive, winking camera phones. I could go on.I’m not Amish. Of course I recognise that social media isn’t without its blessings and benefits. There’s just something about it that seems to suck all of our attention, vampire-like, in a deeply uncomfortable way. And there’s something about the aspirational quality of Instagram that sells us a dream – particularly when it comes to travel – filtering out the ugly, the uncomfortable or the just plain boring, until all that’s left are the bright and shiny parts. It kind of sets a place up to fail. How can the reality ever live up to the over-saturated promise? How can a “bucket-list destination” ever be more than a slight disappointment?Travel influencers also have a lot to answer for when it comes to promoting “bad behaviour” to get the money shot. Just this month, blogger and influencer Patricia, otherwise known as One Ocean Away, was called out for posting a picture of herself walking on railway tracks while a train travelled towards her – some said it could encourage others to emulate her in a more dangerous setting.Of course, all that’s only half the story. Truth time: what really freaks me out about Instagram is the idea of how closely tied my fragile ego would be to my travels.It would be nice to think that, when we post things on social media, it’s done merely for the pleasure of sharing our lives and connecting with others we just want to be part of that big, beautiful conversation.YangonIt would be nice – but it wouldn’t be true. For most of us, it’s the endorphin rush of seeing those numbers climb – follows, likes, shares, comments – that keeps us coming back for more. Whether we like it or not, we are all approval junkies for whom those figures are inherently bound up in our self-worth. In the era of the ubiquitous selfie, it seems inevitable to associate thousands of likes with the idea that thousands of people like you and, conversely, that a dearth of interactions means you’re essentially an online pariah.It happens on every platform, but Instagram is one of the worst offenders when it comes to making us feel our value can be measured numerically – particularly as statistics show that pictures with people in tend to perform better than those without. Ergo, people are judging you as much as they are the backdrop, whether it be Kyoto’s bamboo forest, Santorini’s blue-capped buildings or Singapore’s rooftop infinity pool.Blac Chyna under fire for promoting skin bleaching creamHailey Baldwin appears to confirm marriage to Justin BieberNick Jonas opens up about having diabetes in candid Instagram postTo be frank, I just don’t think I could hack it. I can already see how things would go – here’s me enjoying that Lisbon skyline. Here’s me honing the shot to find the best angle, filtering it so the buildings really pop, cropping out the messy table in front of me. Here’s me posting it. And, several hours later, here’s me checking it, and rechecking it, and rechecking it, ad infinitum, to see how many interactions I’ve had. I ignore the sweeping landscape before me I ignore the cocktail in my glass I even ignore the person sitting opposite me. I don’t need a crystal ball to see my inescapable Instagram future.Instead, free from such constraints, I’m able to live – not just in the moment, but in the place. I devour the view with my eyes, rather than observing it second hand. I savour each sip of my velvety espresso martini. I talk and listen and laugh with my companion, who is far more deserving of my attention than a collection of strangers online.Forget Unhashtag Vienna – I reckon it’s high time we unhashtag the world.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

William Cook catches\u0026nbspup with him in his Bristol studioClick to followThe IndependentKnees up at Yates\u0027s Wine Lodge, in Ashton-Under-Lyne: these lodges had a dismal reputation, seemingly designed for taking the quickest route to oblivionAt Manchester Art Gallery, in the beating heart of England’s most happening city (sorry, London – you’ve had your turn), Martin Parr is showing a gaggle of reporters around his latest exhibition. It’s called Return to Manchester, and the title is telling. Parr is a southern softy, born and raised in Surrey, but it was as a photography student at Manchester Polytechnic in the early 1970s that he found his creative focus. His first exhibition, back in 1971, was just down the road, in a corridor at Kendal Milne department store. Half a century later he’s back in the metropolis that made him, to open a one man show of Mancunian photos, then and now.It’s an exhibition of two halves: black and white photographs of the rundown Manchester of the 1970s colour photos of the dynamic Manchester of today. Wry and playful, yet imbued with a deep, unspoken sense of melancholy, it’s a profound and powerful evocation of the way that Manchester – and Martin Parr – has changed. “I had a fantastic time in Manchester,”\u0026nbsphe says, and his affection for the city – then and now – is evident in these photos.Picture of heart-shaped cancer cells wins science photography prizeThe earliest photographs in the show were taken while he was still at college, and the images that encapsulate\u0026nbspthe Manchester of the early 1970s are the June Street photos he took with his friend and fellow student, Daniel Meadows. They’d gone in search of Coronation Street, but the street which inspired the Salford soap opera had already been demolished. However, a few scenes had been shot on June Street, an adjacent street which had survived.Instead of photographing the drab exteriors of these terraced houses, they ventured within. Their portraits of the people they found inside exude the poise and dignity of Old Masters, which is ironic, for Parr has often been accused of being a photographer who takes the piss. “Unless there’s some vulnerability there, I don’t think you’re going to get good photographs,” he once said. There’s vulnerability here aplenty, and that’s what makes these portraits so appealing.June Street was one of several photographic projects which Parr undertook, entirely of his own accord, during his student days in Manchester. A series of photos inside Prestwich Mental Hospital captured the bleak ambience of that institution, but it was his Love Cubes series (which doubled as a board game) that epitomised his sense of fun. Parr photographed couples on the streets of Manchester, together and then separately. The idea of the game is to try and work out who’s going out with whom.Half a lifetime later these student projects still feel fresh and vital, but Parr’s course was a vocational training for a career as a commercial photographer, and so his superiors weren’t impressed. He could have been chucked out if it hadn’t been for Alan Murgatroyd, the one tutor who fought his corner. Happily, after all these years, Murgatroyd is still with us, and he appeared as the guest of honour\u0026nbspto open Parr’s new show.For this show Parr has returned to Manchester to shoot a new set of photographs, and the city of today feels a world away from the city of his student days. It’s multicultural and, above all, colourful –\u0026nbspfrom Media City to the Eithad, from mosques to yoga classes, from royal wedding street parties to Gay Pride. It was unimaginable, 30 or 40 years ago, that Pride would have such a big impact in a city like Manchester,\u0026nbsphe says. From pies at Bury market to gluten-free brownies in the Northern Quarter, like an anthropologist Parr finds signs of change amid the ephemeral and the mundane.Created with Sketch.The best of The

Day, 2000, by Tom PilstonAlbanians in Korce, 1990, by Barry LewisHas any British city changed more than Manchester since Parr arrived here in 1970? I doubt it. But the rest of Britain has changed almost as much, and Parr has chronicled that change with more wit and insight than any other artist I know. What makes his vision so acute? To try and find out, I travelled to Bristol, where he’s lived since 1987, to meet this elusive and enigmatic man who excels at examining the minutiae of our daily lives.We meet at his studio, on an industrial estate on the scruffy side of Bristol. His studio is tidy and businesslike (not for him the chaotic squalor of the tortured, tormented artist). His appearance is similarly anodyne, almost anonymous – nondescript leisurewear, neither smart nor scruffy. His manner is friendly but noncommittal – warm smile, wary eyes. He speaks quietly, clearly, lucidly. His voice is classless, rootless. He chooses his words with care.“I was fully aware that Manchester had changed enormously in the 35 years since I lived there,”\u0026nbsphe says. “There are now two Manchesters – there’s the traditional one and the gentrified one, so I went to both.”He’s broadly enthusiastic about the gentrification of the city, but he can see the downside too. “Gentrification can be a mixed blessing. It can tend to kill off the sense of community that was there before – richer, younger people move in – but in the end I think without it these places would suffer even more.”As befits a born observer, accustomed to travelling incognito, he’s used to blending into the background. With his pleasant but forgettable face, his neat grey hair and his bland chainstore clothes, he’d make a good private detective. He looks more like a middle ranking civil servant than a famous photographer - which is fitting, for that was his father’s job (though his passion was ornithology). Martin used to accompany him on his birdwatching trips - though Martin always used to watch the birdwatchers, not the birds.He was born in 1952 in Epsom, the buckle in the commuter belt. His parents were Methodists (“I went to Sunday School and argued with the teachers”), comfortably off, in a humdrum way, and reasonably contented. He has one sibling, a sister, seven years younger, which made him almost an only child. It sounds like a barren beginning for a creative artist, but the absence of high drama compelled him to look more closely, more keenly, at the world around him. “The advantage of coming from suburban Surrey is that everywhere else looks more interesting.”\u0026nbspHe was a meticulous collector, and a quintessential trainspotter. He still collects all sorts of trash-aesthetic bric-a-brac today.His main inspiration was his paternal grandfather, George Parr, a lay preacher and a keen amateur photographer, who lived in Calverley, in West Yorkshire. George taught him the rudiments of photography. For Martin, it was love at first sight. “There was never any doubt. As soon as I saw it, I thought ‘That’s the medium for me – that’s what I want to be.’”\u0026nbspMartin’s summer holidays in Calverley were among his happiest childhood memories. ‘I’ve always had a soft spot for Yorkshire – my father’s from Yorkshire, I’ve got Yorkshire in my blood.’ His first photographic project was a study of Harry Ramsden’s, the celebrated Yorkshire fish and chip shop. It was here that his passion for photography – and the north of England – began.Martin passed his 11-plus and went to Surbiton Grammar School, but compared with his Yorkshire apprenticeship school was distinctly uninspiring. He was a mediocre student and his teachers were underwhelmed. His school report makes interesting (and, in retrospect, amusing) reading. ‘He has considerable flair for photography and a certain amount of ability in the art field, but there seems to be little chance of realising his potential if his attitude to his general work continues to be so poor,’ wrote his form tutor. “Very little work achieved – very lackadaisical,”\u0026nbspconcurred his art master.It was only when he went to Manchester that he really spread his wings. In Manchester he encountered a sense of community more akin to the one he’d found in Calverley. “Coming from suburban Surrey, I was very taken with that – the friendliness of people, and how open they were.”He lived in Moss Side, which was thrilling. When they started demolishing Moss Side we used to go round and pick the stuff out of the old houses and photograph it – we had a great time. Photography was his calling. Despite being on a course which didn’t suit him, making work for which there was no real outlet, he never doubted his abilities. I knew what I wanted to do and why, and I just got on with it. I had total self-belief.In Manchester he met Susie Mitchell, an English student from the Home Counties who collaborated with him on various projects and subsequently became his wife. In the 1970s, Manchester was an exciting place to live, like a foreign country after the outer London suburbs, she wrote, in her eloquent introduction to The Non-conformists, his haunting book of photos of Yorkshire chapel life. Swathes of condemned terraced housing, monstrous Victorian public buildings, acres of wasteland awaiting redevelopment, grimy parks and odiferous curry houses…\u0026nbspFor Martin it was paradise.After graduating from Manchester they moved to Hebden Bridge, where they formed close relationships with some of the subjects of The Non-conformists (Susie interviewed them Martin photographed them). This intimacy resulted in some remarkable photos, but the relationship ended rather unhappily when some of their subjects realised, belatedly, that they were only photographic subjects (rather than soulmates) after all.I wasn’t a believer,\u0026nbspsays Parr. I respected their religion and I enjoyed partaking in it and photographing it.\u0026nbspHowever, he was essentially an atheist. From then on Martin kept his distance and his work became more detached. You’re never part of what you photograph,\u0026nbsphe says. You’re always an outsider.Susie became a speech therapist, a job that took her to Ireland and then to Merseyside. Martin went with her and on Merseyside he found the subject that made his name. His stark photos of New Brighton (a rundown seaside resort near Liverpool) were revolutionary. For one thing, they were in colour (a medium still shunned by so-called “serious”\u0026nbspphotographers) but above all it was his stark treatment of these Liverpudlian daytrippers which broke new ground.Parr showed New Brighton in all its gory glory – the fractious toddlers, the bored parents, the litter, the fast food... There was nothing falsified about it, but there was nothing prettified about it either, and for middle class audiences used to quaint depictions of the worthy poor, it was a rude awakening. This is a clammy, claustrophobic nightmare world where people lie knee deep in chip papers, swim in polluted black pools and stare at a bleak horizon of urban dereliction,\u0026nbspwrote Robert Morris in the British Journal of Photography. Parr called his series The Last Resort.The show was well received in Liverpool. Ironically, it was when it went to London that the reaction became more critical. Our historic working class, normally dealt with generously by documentary photographers, becomes a sitting duck for a more sophisticated audience,\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspwrote David Lee\u0026nbspin Art Review. They appear fat, simple, styleless, tediously conformist and unable to assert any inidual identity. They wear cheap flashy clothes and in true conservative fashion are resigned to their meagre lot. Only babies and children survive ridicule, and it is their inclusion in many pictures which gives Parr’s acerbic vision of hopelessness its poetic touch.With the hindsight of history, this seems rather unfair. Parr’s vision is acerbic but he never ridicules his subjects. On the contrary, his day-trippers actually seem rather admirable, striving to give their children a nice day out in the face of overwhelming odds. Merseyside was a pretty hopeless place in 1986. Like all good photographers, Parr was simply shooting what he saw.I don’t think I’m out there to take the piss, particularly. There has to be a sense of mischief, because that’s part of the British make-up and identity, but the mischief is applied equally to everything and anybody, because life is weird. People are strange, and people are entertaining. I do like people –\u0026nbspI love what they all get up to.’Most of the things he photographs are things he does himself.‘Portrait of Britain’ photo competition highlights ersity of nationFive tips for underwater filming and photographyStanley Kubrick\u0027s unseen photography reveals early talent of directorHe’s impervious to criticism of his work. I realised pretty early on that that controversial aspect to what I do never does you any harm,\u0026nbsphe says. I’m very democratic when it comes to classes – I put it up all classes.\u0026nbspHe followed up The Last Resort with several projects about the bourgeoisie.If anything, these projects were even more acerbic, attracting further criticism. One picture editor called him a gratuitously cruel social critic who has made a large amount of money by sneering at the foibles and pretentions of other people.\u0026nbspAgain, this seems unfair. It’s hardly Parr’s fault that he’s made a decent living, and it seems harsh to describe his stance as sneering. He delights in bathos and absurdity, but his vision is dispassionate, not cruel. I continue to be amazed that people still find my work controversial, because I’m just photographing western life, the leisure pursuits of the western world.One of his most successful series, Small World, was about mass tourism, a phenomenon which straddles every class. We have this idea of what a place would be like because we’ve seen it in the pictures and the postcards. When we get there the reality is quite different. I’m showing the reality of peoples’ expectations.We have this idea of what a place would be like because we’ve seen it in the pictures and the postcards. When we get there the reality is quite differentAs beauty spots become tourist traps, that reality is pretty grim – but for Parr, it makes great photos. “I find it completely fascinating. Remember: when a place is mobbed I’m happy, because I can make my point even clearer.”\u0026nbspAnd the point is? “That the mythology is different to the reality.”The overall conclusion one draws from Parr’s photos is that consumerism is pretty tawdry, and globalisation is making a bad situation even worse. And yet, inidually, his photos are full of fun. “That’s all part of the contradiction – the ambiguity is what this is all about.”Back in Manchester, Martin is winding up his tour. Most of the pictures I take are rubbish – I take more rubbish than most people because I take more photographs than most people, he says. What you’re trying to find is that magic moment, and how and when that happens is almost impossible to predict. So, even though I’ve been doing it for many years, I couldn’t quite tell you how to do it – but you have a very strong intuitive sense when it starts to happen.Martin Parr: Return to Manchester is at Manchester Art Gallery (www.manchesterartgallery.org) until 22 April 2019Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

As James Moore\u0026nbspexplains, it wouldn’t be the first example of a team machinating its own demiseClick to followThe IndependentThe Raiders’ defeat by the San Francisco 49ers earlier this month triggered much adverse commentThe Raiders are officially tanking,” declared USA Today’s Touchdown Wire last month. It’s not the first time this has been suggested by those covering the NFL for a living in response to the\u0026nbspteam’s dismal season.The contention that there’s nothing accidental about the losing streak is based on the notion that a lowly position in the final NFL standings this season\u0026nbspwould\u0026nbspsecure a favourable position in next year’s NFL draft. It allocates the first pick from each year’s pool of eligible players from the college game to the worst team, and then proceeds in reverse order, with the Super Bowl winner going last in each of seven rounds. Just over 250 rookies, many of considerable quality,\u0026nbspare selected in this manner.While no one from the team would admit it, and certainly not coach Jon Gruden\u0026nbsp(who indeed has flatly denied it), the suggestion that the Raiders are “tanking” was hard to dismiss\u0026nbspduring the 34-3 loss to the crosstown San Francisco 49ers at the start of November.Baseball players race to capture escaped ducklingsIt was a truly dreadful performance. Michael Wilbon, one of the hosts of ESPN’s talk show Pardon the Interruption, was moved to describe it as “the worst I’ve seen” from one of the league’s marque franchises.Having followed the Raiders for more than three decades, including through some very rough seasons, I couldn’t disagree.Gruden is the returning prodigal son, a man who\u0026nbspumpteen teams, both college and pro, had been trying to tempt back into the game from the broadcast booth.He was head coach during the construction of the last truly successful Raiders roster. That squad\u0026nbspwent to the Super Bowl in 2002, but ironically Gruden\u0026nbsphad by then been traded by the late Al Davis, the team’s mercurial owner, to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. And the Bucs won that game.Gruden got one of the rings traditionally handed to the winners, but critics sniffed that he did it with the team of his predecessor, Tony Dungy, who himself\u0026nbspwent on to win it all with the Indianapolis Colts.Bent upon moving the Raiders franchise to Las Vegas, Davis’s son and successor as team owner Mark needed to make a splash and create some excitement. He did it by re-signing\u0026nbspGruden\u0026nbspin January, courtesy of a reported 10-year, $100m deal that is unprecedented for an NFL coach. The package offered Gruden the chance to do things\u0026nbsphis way.With the sort of security no other NFL coach has, the man nicknamed “Chucky”, after the horror movie character,\u0026nbspfor his facial expressions during games\u0026nbsphas set about tearing apart a team that went 6-10 in 2018\u0026nbspbut had made the playoffs the previous year.Gruden during the NFL Football game between Oakland Raiders and the San Francisco 49ers in November (RexThurman James)Homegrown stars such as defensive wrecking ball Khalil Mack, one of the league’s best players, and the talented, if inconsistent, receiver Amari Cooper, were traded away for future draft picks, with the team fielding a combination of ageing castoffs and ultra green rookies this year.Mack wanted a monster extension, which he got from the Chicago Bears, his new home. Cooper, now with Dallas, would soon have been after a new deal of his own. Their departures, and other moves, have given the Raiders considerable head room under the NFL’s salary cap to spend in free agency. But this year’s team is a mess, and there were times when it looked like the players had quit on their coach during the Thursday night debacle in San Francisco. The Raiders made the 49ers rookie quarterback Nick Mullens, who had gone undrafted and had never started a game, look like 49er legend Joe Montana.Could the critics have been correct? Were the Raiders\u0026nbspthrowing away a season to make themselves competitive for their projected 2020 arrival in the city of sin?The idea of winning by losing is hardly unique to the NFL. World sport is peppered with examples, perhaps the most infamous being the ‘Disgrace of\u0026nbspGijon’ in the 1982 football\u0026nbspWorld CupThe result of the trades is that the Raiders have not only accumulated spending money they also have an impressive five picks in the first round of the NFL draft over the next two years.The position of the Raiders’ traded future\u0026nbsppicks from the Dallas Cowboys and the Chicago Bears will be determined by the\u0026nbsprecords of the latter two teams. The better they do with the help of the Raiders players they have acquired, the worse the return to the Raiders will be (and the Bears look like a lock for the playoffs, with the Cowboys in with a decent shot).The Raiders’ own picks, however, will be determined by the team’s record, and after losing to the LA Chargers on 11 November\u0026nbspfollowing the 49ers debacle, they were in pole position for the top slot and a shot at another defensive wrecking ball, Nick Bosa, the Ohio State Buckeyes product, and brother of Chargers star Joey Bosa. He sits at the top of the draft boards of most experts.It’s hard to see Bosa being as good as Mack. It’s hard to see anyone being as good as Mack. But the advantage with Bosa is that he will be stuck on a relatively cheap, league-mandated rookie deal for four years, with an optional fifth.If Bosa is the man the Raiders are after, it’s easy to see how they could win by losing.There was a similar case a few years ago, when quarterback Andrew Luck was coming out of Stanford, and was seen as an even more desirable commodity – a can’t-be-missed quarterback. A team prepared to “suck for Luck”\u0026nbspwould, it was said, be set for years. The Colts won that derby, and jettisoned legend Peyton Manning as a result. Luck has been decidedly unlucky with injury, but he has looked incredible this year, and easily worth the pain of the two-win, 14-loss\u0026nbspseason the Colts endured before getting him.Created with Sketch.The 20 contenders for 2018 Sports Personality of the Year Show all 21Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.121 The 20 contenders for 2018 Sports Personality of the Year121 The 20 contenders for 2018 Sports Personality of the YearThe idea of winning by losing is hardly unique to the NFL. World sport is peppered with examples. Perhaps the most infamous in what Europeans call football was the “Disgrace of Gijon” in the 1982 World Cup.Having played all its group games, Algeria had four points (at the time it was two for a win). Two of them came from the shock of the tournament when the north African side beat West Germany 2-1, the other two from a 3-2 victory over Chile. The intervening game was a 2-0 loss to Austria. With West Germany having thrashed Chile, a complex situation was created ahead of the final game between the Germans and\u0026nbspAustria. The upshot was that they could both qualify and prevent Algeria from becoming the first African side to reach the knockout stages if the Germans won by either one or two goals (a third would push Austria out).After a 10-minute barrage Horst Hrubesch found the back of the net for West Germany. The rest of the game was a depressing spectacle, with lots of passing taking place in the two teams’ own halves, and an almost complete lack of any effort to find a goal. The crowd cried foul. Actually, they cried “fix”!Both teams denied collusion and Fifa considered no rules to have been broken, but from the 1986 World Cup onwards the final pair of group matches has kicked off at the same time with the aim of preventing a repeat.Hrubesch celebrates scoring in West Germany’s controversial 1982 win against\u0026nbspAustria\u0026nbsp(RexColorsport)Cricket is a sport in which accusations of match-fixing regularly crop up, mostly as a result of players allegedly manipulating the outcome of games (or specific in-game elements) to the benefit of gambling syndicates.But teams have been known to do it for their own advantage too. The most notorious incident of this type came when Somerset captain Brian Rose declared his side’s\u0026nbspinnings closed after just six balls during a match in the early\u0026nbspstages of the one-day format\u0026nbspBenson \u0026amp Hedges Cup of 1979. Rose had worked out that his team would qualify for the second round from their group as long as they weren’t overtaken on strike rate, which was the formula in use for splitting teams at the time (it has since been replaced by net run rate)\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspirrespective of the result of the specific match.Unfortunately for the county, the game’s administrators intervened, calling an emergency meeting that led to Somerset’s expulsion. The rules of the game were subsequently changed to prevent declarations in one-day games.It isn’t just at the top level that the sort of shenanigans deemed “just not cricket”\u0026nbspoccur either. The supposedly genteel world of village cricket has seen it too, and in more recent times. Last year Carew Cricket Club made headlines nationally after declaring at 18-1 during their Pembroke County Cricket Club title-decider against second-placed Cresselly. They were 21 points clear, with 20 available for a win. But their opponents could potentially make up the gap through batting and bowling bonus points if they were to win handsomely.Man beaten to death in baseball bat attack‘10 out of 10’ drunk smashed guitar over sleeping mamba user’s headTo prevent this from happening, Carew closed its innings early, losing the game but winning the title by ensuring no bonus points could be scored. A Twitter storm ensued\u0026nbspand a disciplinary panel was set up, leading to Carew’s relegation to a lower ision, a fine and a ban for the team’s captain. But Carew kept the title. So they could still be said to have won by losing.In addition to the potential of securing an advantageous draft position –\u0026nbspand all the big four US sports of American football, baseball, basketball and ice hockey operate a variation on the draft theme –\u0026nbspit’s the absence of any\u0026nbspthreat of relegation that facilitates throwing away not just a game but the entire season in US sports. At least in theory.It might seem extreme to do it, but if you’re not a top-of-the-table contender\u0026nbspthere’s nothing to lose and everything to gain for a “rebuilding”\u0026nbspoperation. It’s more or less accepted practice in baseball\u0026nbsp(where around half the professional teams are essentially building for the future)\u0026nbspto throw in the towel come the end of July, at which time Major League Baseball imposes a trade deadline.The truth is that losing is anathema to professional athletes, particularly those who put their bodies on the line like American football players doTeams with no chance of making the end-of-year playoffs regularly swap their stars for prospects from contenders’ minor league “farm”\u0026nbspsystems. The Boston Red Sox got a pitching ace (Chris Sale) from the Chicago White Sox for four prospects in 2017, and a closer, Craig Kimbrel, from the San Diego Padres for another four in 2016. Those two were important parts of the team’s world series run this year. No one’s complaining about what the Red Sox gave up in return. Meanwhile the Padres lost 96 of their 162 games and the White Sox 100. The problem with “tanking”\u0026nbspfor tomorrow is that tomorrow doesn’t always arrive. It doesn’t matter how many prospects you accumulate if they don’t work out.The NFL draft is no more certain to improve your team than baseball prospects are. It’s a crapshoot, and although some are better than others at finding hits, Gruden’s record at Tampa wasn’t great.There is, however, a postscript to the story. The Raiders found themselves in Phoenix, Arizona on Sunday 18 November, facing the Cardinals, another struggling team in rebuilding\u0026nbspmode and with no chance of making the playoffs. Gruden’s men won a thriller courtesy of a field goal in the last second\u0026nbspthat was set up by a drive engineered by quarterback Derek Carr. Such comebacks were a hallmark of his during the 2016 playoff run.In so doing, the Raiders arguably hurt themselves, dropping from first to third in the notional draft order.\u0026nbspThey lost by winning. One headline writer said they were even managing to screw up tanking.But the truth is that\u0026nbsplosing is anathema to professional athletes, particularly those who put their bodies on the line like American football players do. The\u0026nbspraucous celebrations in the visitors’ locker room after the game showed how much victory meant. The members of the Raider nation who made their way out into the desert to watch were similarly delighted. Gruden looked pretty happy too.As the late, great Al Davis said: “Just win, baby.”\u0026nbspBecause winning’s much more fun.Still, the season isn’t over. And the road ahead will be a rocky one. The Raiders proved that by getting blown out by the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday. The remaining schedule sees the team facing the potentially Super Bowl-bound Kansas City Chiefs (twice), the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Cincinnati Bengals and the Denver Broncos in the weeks to come.It isn’t hard to see them losing the lot\u0026nbspand still having a very realistic shot at that first pick in next season’s draft. The tank\u0026nbspis still more or less on track.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But they missed it the first time around, making it one of a number of objects that the team hopes to go back and have a proper look at.The rover already snapped a photo of the object, showing its shiny coating amid the dust and rocks of the Martian surface.But it will investigate it further with other tools in an attempt to understand its chemistry. That will be done using the onboard ChemCam, a set of tools that can examine objects remotely.In the same journey, it will have a look at a number of other interesting specimens. One very small piece is “Flanders moss”, which has an interesting, dark coloured coating which the team hope to come to understand by examining its chemistry.All of the work comes after Curiosity welcomed another visitor to the planet from Earth, the InSight rover. Curiosity played Mr Rogers’ song “Won’t You Be My Neighbour”\u0026nbspto welcome its fellow visitor.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

This has never been done before, said astrophysicist Marco Ajello​, who is lead author of the paper. Most of this light is emitted by stars that live in galaxies. And so, this has allowed us to better understand the stellar-evolution process and gain captivating insights into how the universe produced its luminous content.The calculations allowed scientists to work out the total number of photons ever emitted.Expressing the number they found is very difficult, in part because it relies on a number of variables. But it is also literally difficult to write out, because there are so many zeroes.In all, there have been four and then 85\u0026nbspzeroes of them.Despite that vast amount of light ever emitted, very little of it ever gets to us beyond the light we see from our own sun and galaxy. The brightness of the universe as it reaches us is roughly equivalent to looking at a 60-watt lightbulb in complete darkness, from 2.5 miles away.That is because the universe is so vast and distant. But the Fermi telescope allowed the researchers to look at the dim swirl of light that comes from stars, and in so doing calculate how much light was being absorbed and therefore how much there might ever have been around.The new discovery will now allow scientists to peek out into the very beginnings of the universe.The first billion years of our universe\u0027s history are a very interesting epoch that has not yet been probed by current satellites, Ajello said. Our measurement allows us to peek inside it. Perhaps one day we will find a way to look all the way back to the Big Bang. This is our ultimate goal.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But by the time he achieved that year’s stunning double-punch of Jurassic Park and Schindler’s List –\u0026nbspthe latter of which had its world premiere 25 years ago this week – the director was already Hollywood’s undisputed miracle-worker, operating at a level far beyond even his most acclaimed contemporaries.Perhaps that’s why the audacity he demonstrated filming and releasing two wildly different, equally boundary-breaking blockbusters within 12 months of each other passed almost without mention. He had carried off the apparently impossible – and the world considered it more or less banal.\u0026nbspJurassic Park has long been considered both a popcorn classic and towering feat of filmmaking. The dinosaur romp to rule them all ushered in a new era of computer-generated effects. Loud, dazzling, occasionally terrifying, it is arguably second only to Jaws in the countdown of Spielberg’s great thrill rides.\u0026nbspBut as it marks its quarter century, Schindler’s List surely stands as the more impressive achievement. It respectfully honours the victims of the Nazi genocide, yet is also a riveting drama, with Ralph Fiennes, as real-life concentration camp commander Amon Goth, one of the most skin-crawling villains in recent cinematic history.\u0026nbspThe Holocaust movie had been Spielberg’s ultimate grail for decades. It was all the way back in 1982 that he was first alerted to the true life story of Oskar Schindler, the gadabout Moravian industrialist who, during the Second World War, saved the lives of an estimated 1,200 Jews in Nazi-occupied Krakow by putting them to work in his factories.Yet Spielberg fretted for years that he was too flashy – too much a creature of Hollywood – to do justice to a real story about real suffering. Only after turning 40 and enduring relative failures such as The Color Purple and Hook – the lukewarm reviews of which cracked his wunderkind reputation – did he feel at last prepared to tackle the greatest challenge of his professional life.\u0026nbspDern and Sam Neill in ‘Jurassic Park’ (Rex)Jewishness was complicated for Spielberg. He was raised by Orthodox parents in Phoenix, Arizona. But growing up “ethnic” in the American sun belt in the Fifties and Sixties was not straightforward, as he was reminded on a daily basis.\u0026nbsp“People coughed the word ‘Jew’ in their hand as they passed me in the hallway,” he told The New York Times. “Pennies were thrown at me in the study hall in a very quiet room of 100 students ... We couldn’t stop it. So my mom picked me up in her car every day after school and took me home.”He was very familiar with the Holocaust throughout his childhood. “We lost cousins, aunts, uncles ... My life has always come back to images surrounding the Holocaust,” he would recount. “The Holocaust had been part of my life, just based on what my parents would say at the dinner table.”\u0026nbspSchindler’s List’s journey to the screen was long and tortuous. The original Thomas Keneally nonfiction book, Schindler’s Ark, was inspired by a chance conversation the author had in 1980 with the owner of a leather goods shop in Los Angeles.Leopold Page’s real name was Poldek Pfefferberg: he was one of the “Schindler Jews” saved by Oskar Schindler. Upon discovering Keneally was a writer, Page insisted on sharing the entire tale – “the greatest story of humanity man to man”.\u0026nbspKeneally was hooked and, working initially from documents furnished by Page, assembled his eventual bestseller. But when Hollywood sought to option Schindler’s Ark it ran into problems. Page had been attempting to turn a spotlight on his saviour for decades and, in the Sixties, sold the rights to his version of events to MGM producer Marvin Gosch for $50,000.\u0026nbspThat project eventually sputtered out, but not before Gosch had hired Casablanca co-writer Howard Koch to write a script and interview Schindler Jews around LA. Spielberg, for his part, was alerted to Schindler’s Ark as he was toiling on ET. His mentor Sidney J Sheinberg, then president of MCA, gave him a copy of the Keneally tome. “It’ll make a helluva story,” Spielberg supposedly responded. “Is it true?”Neeson in ‘Schindler’s List’ (Rex)Reluctant to bring Schindler to the screen himself, Spielberg instead touted the idea to his old movie-making pals. Roman Polanksi and Brian De Palma said no, but Martin Scorsese expressed an interest and was eventually attached to direct. Then, surrounded by pirates and clockwork crocodiles on the set of Hook, Spielberg had an epiphany.He had, he believed, matured sufficiently as a filmmaker and was ready to adapt Schindler’s Ark. Indeed, it was arguably the undertaking towards which his entire career had been leading. All he had to do was win back the rights from one of the greatest directors of his generation.\u0026nbspAcross town at the Beverly Hills HQ, home to the almighty CAA agency, a Holocaust biopic was the last thing on the agenda. CAA’s co-founder Michael Ovitz, however, had a dilemma he would have regarded as no less pressing than Spielberg’s desire to wrest back ownership of Schindler’s List. How could he persuade Steven Spielberg, Hollywood’s most unassailable hit-maker, to sign with him?\u0026nbspHe had an idea – and it hinged on proposition his old friend Michael Crichton had brought to CAA. Ovitz and Crichton were close, the agent having shielded the author and director from prurient attention when he went through two years of devastating depression. Now Crichton was gung-ho about a new concept for a novel – to be set in a theme park where genetically engineered dinosaurs go on the rampage.\u0026nbspHow Jeff Goldblum stole the first Jurassic ParkSpielberg beat James Cameron to Jurassic Park film rights by hoursIt would, Ovitz immediately appreciated, make for a cracking read – and an even better movie. And who better to direct that the doyen of rip-roaring family entertainment, Steven Spielberg? He wasn’t representing Spielberg – who famously did not have an agent at that time. But with a little persuasion, Ovitz hoped to remedy the situation and have Spielberg both make the movie and sign with CAA. Thus Ovitz would have landed the biggest fish in Hollywood.\u0026nbsp“We offered Jurassic Park exclusively to Steven Spielberg – who still hadn’t signed with CAA,” Ovitz writes in his autobiography, Who is Michael Ovitz?. “Steven was the one director Michael and I knew who possessed both the technique and the sense of wonder to pull the plot off. Playing favourites on this one would alienate a lot of our other filmmakers, but it was worth it.”Spielberg blazed through the (still unpublished) novel in a single evening and, for the first time in his career, attached himself to a picture that was unfinanced and had yet to receive a studio green light. At that moment, the only people in on Jurassic Park were Crichton, Ovitz, Spielberg and his producing partner Kathleen Kennedy (today, dark lord of Disney’s Star Wars franchise).\u0026nbspOvitz next called Sheinberg – the very mogul who had introduced Spielberg to Schindler’s Ark a decade previously. He explained to the producer, now honcho-in-chief at Universal, that he had “good news and bad news”.In any other industry, the scenario would have seemed farcical. In Hollywood, it was business as usual. Spielberg wanted to make Schindler’s List but Scorsese held the rights. Sheinberg, who had turned Spielberg onto Schindler’s List, wanted to make Jurassic Park – but Spielberg and his collaborators had it in their back pocket. Meanwhile, Spielberg was attached to a mooted remake of the 1962 Robert MitchumGregory Peck thriller Cape Fear – a project he was keen to pass on to Scorsese, despite his old pal’s strict “no-remakes” rule.\u0026nbspScorsese\u0026nbspinto swapping ‘Schindler’s List’ for ‘Cape Fear’ (Rex)This being Hollywood, a solution beneficial to all parties was hammered out. Spielberg talked Scorsese into swapping Schindler’s List for Cape Fear – the carrot being that he could cast Robert De Niro as the villain played in the original by Mitchum and thus reunite with his favourite actor. Meanwhile, Universal agreed a complicated profit share with Ovitz, Spielberg and Crichton. They would walk away with nothing if Jurassic Park flopped – but enjoy a lucrative slice of the box office should it do well.\u0026nbspSheinberg also agreed to let Spielberg adapt Schindler’s Ark, even assenting to a three-hour running time, black and white photography and a comparatively hefty £23m\u0026nbspbudget. There was a\u0026nbspcaveat, though – he had to do Jurassic Park first.\u0026nbspAs 1992 began, Spielberg was thus juggling two remarkably different undertakings. He’d decided to forgo a fee for Schindler’s List. Payment for telling the story of the Holocaust would, he felt, be tantamount to “blood money”.\u0026nbspHe also had to find his Schindler, and rejected pressure to cast a star (Kevin Costner and Mel Gibson both auditioned). Warren Beatty talked his way into a script reading – but was ultimately rejected because, according to Spielberg, he would have ended up with Oskar Schindler-as-Warren Beatty rather than the other way around. In the end, he went with the comparatively unknown Liam Neeson, who had impressed Spielberg in a Eugene O’Neill play on Broadway.An even bigger headache was bringing realistic dinosaurs to the screen. Spielberg had assumed early on that Jurassic would utilise “go motion” – an updating of the ancient “stop motion” effects as featured in King Kong and immortalised in the Fifties and Sixties by the “creature features” of Ray Harryhausen.\u0026nbspThe creator of “go-motion” Phil Tippett – celebrated in Hollywood for creating the Imperial Walkers in The Empire Strikes Back – was hired and test sequences of the famous T rex and velociraptors-in-the-kitchen scenes were shot. Spielberg’s children were entranced when he showed them the footage. Yet something nagged at the director. King Kong was 60 years old. Surely technology had moved on?\u0026nbspEnter Industrial Light and Magic, which presented Spielberg with a primitive CGI showreel of a walking T rex. Even in rough form, it was many times more realistic than go-motion. Spielberg turned to Tippett and quipped:\u0026nbsp“You’re out of job.”\u0026nbsp“Don’t you mean extinct?” Tippet shot back – a line Spielberg put in the script (Tippett stayed on as “dinosaur supervisor”).Schindler’s List’ (Rex)Filming on Jurassic Park had wrapped but special effects were still unfinished when Spielberg arrived in Krakow in March 1993 for the 72-day Schindler’s List shoot. He had put himself under time pressure because he wanted to make the Holocaust movie in the bleak Polish spring. He could, it is true, have waited another year. But he feared that if he delayed (and especially if Jurassic Park flopped), the studio would reconsider bankrolling his passion project.\u0026nbspSchindler’s List was intensely personal for the director –\u0026nbsptraumatic simply by dint of the subject matter. Day after day, he would recreate the horrors of the Krakow ghetto and of the nearby Płaszow concentration camp, presided over by monstrous SS second lieutenant Goth (Fiennes’s mere presence in a Nazi uniform is said to have reduced Holocaust survivors to tears on visits to the set).\u0026nbspThen\u0026nbspat night\u0026nbspSpielberg would communicate via satellite uplink with Industrial Light and Magic in San Francisco. Here, he was required to make final decisions over how the T rex ought to roar and whether a brachiosaurus should rise on its back legs when eating. It was difficult and depressing – and Spielberg grew to resent Hollywood for putting him through the mill in such a fashion.\u0026nbsp“When I finally started shooting ... in Poland, I had to go home about two or three times a week and get on a very crude satellite feed to northern California ... to be able to approve T rex shots,” he remembered at an anniversary screening of Schindler’s List at Tribeca Film Festival.\u0026nbspOne of his methods of coping was to call Robin Williams, whom he had befriended making Hook. Never one to refuse an audience, Williams took it as his mission to cajole Spielberg out of his blue moods.\u0026nbsp“Robin knew what I was going through, and once a week, Robin would call me on schedule and he would do 15 minutes of standup on the phone,” Spielberg said. “I would laugh hysterically, because I had to release so much.”Neeson (Rex)With laughter and determination, he got through it and achieved one of the remarkable one-twos in film. Released on 11 June 1993, Jurassic Park became the monster that devoured the box office whole, earning nearly $1bn. Of that, Spielberg pocketed an estimated $250m\u0026nbspthanks to the deal Ovitz had thrashed out in pre-production.\u0026nbspAnd then, on 15 December, Schindler’s List opened in US cinemas, revealing a very different side to Hollywood’s great conjurer. (It would open in the UK in early 1994.)\u0026nbspThe movie was powerful, haunting and lacking the trademark sentimentality that Spielberg for so long feared made him temperamentally ill-suited to directing it.\u0026nbspBoth films were universally adored. The New York Times praised Jurassic Park as\u0026nbsp“a true movie milestone, presenting awe- and fear-inspiring sights never before seen on the screen”. The Independent approved, too: “The best thing about Jurassic Park is the way that fear never drives out wonder, wonder at the special effects that have realised dinosaurs so convincingly, but also at the dinosaurs in their own right,” it said.\u0026nbspSchindler’s List received an even more positive response. “Schindler’s List, with its grave documentary thoroughness and moral complexity, rewrites film history,” said The Independent. “It is one of the cinema’s finest achievements.” “Rising brilliantly to the challenge of this material and displaying an electrifying creative intelligence, Mr Spielberg has made sure that neither he nor the Holocaust will ever be thought of in the same way again,” added The New York Times.\u0026nbspJurassic Park and Schindler’s List went on to clean up at the Oscars the following year. Jurassic Park won for best sound editing, sound mixing and special effects. But this was eclipsed by Schindler’s List, which finally lifted the Academy Awards curse that had hung over Spielberg since ET was trumped by Gandhi a decade previously.\u0026nbspAmong the seven Oscars awarded to it were ones for Best Film and Best Director. Yet far from exulting, James Cameron-style, in his sweep, Spielberg cut a sober figure. The presence beside him on the podium of producer Branko Lustig – who as a child had spent two years at Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen – was a reminder there were more important things than accolades and ovations.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Six actors – Cate Blanchett, Heath Ledger, Christian Bale and Ben Whishaw among them – portrayed Dylan at different stages of his career as part of an appropriately freewheelin’ approach to narrative.To convince director Oliver Stone to give him the part of Jim Morrison, Val Kilmer undertook hours of extensive research into his hero, learning 50 songs to mimic his singing voice. When the surviving members of the Doors assembled to hear a recording of Kilmer, none could tell which was the impersonation and which the real Morrison. The Doors was not loved by all but the great Kyle MacLachlan and Meg Ryan were memorable in supporting roles as keyboardist Ray Manzarek and Morrison\u0027s girlfriend Pamela Courson respectively. Gary Oldman was a dead-ringer for the late Sex Pistols guitarist Sid Vicious in director Alex Cox’s appropriately grotty account of the punk star’s pointless death from heroin following the overdose of his girlfriend Nancy Spungen (Chloe Webb) in New York’s Hotel Chelsea. Bandmate Johnny Rotten was predictably dismissive of the project but understandably annoyed that Joe Strummer of The Clash had been consulted but not him.410 7. Get on Up (2014)Like Rami Malek, Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman faced a seemingly impossible task in portraying soul superstar James Brown, “Mr Dynamite” himself. He acquitted himself well, however, in a film that largely conformed to genre formula but offered strength in depth with Dan Aykroyd, Viola Davis, Lennie James and Octavia Spencer among the supporting cast.510 6. What’s Love Got to Do with It? (1993)Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne were superbly matched as Tina and Ike Turner in Brian Gibson’s unflinching account of their rise to fame and abusive marriage. Adapted from Tina’s memoir I, Tina, the movie follows Ike’s violent attempts to dominate her before a conversion to Buddhism gives the soul star the strength to break free and go it alone.Depicting the rise of game-changing LA rappers NWA in the late 1980s, Straight Outta Compton appeared in 2015 and was a smash hit, making $200m (£153m) at the box office on a $50m (£38m) budget. While F Gary Gray\u0027s film lost its way in its second half, becoming bogged down in contract disputes, overall it did a superb job of capturing the vitality and righteous anger of the album of the same name. O\u0027Shea Jackson Jr\u0027s performance as his own real-life father, Ice Cube, was a revelation.Jamie Foxx was ideally cast as Ray Charles in Taylor Hackford’s telling of the life of the blind soul star, charting his rise from poverty in rural Florida to worldwide acclaim. A sample of Foxx singing “I Got a Woman” provided the unlikely basis for Kanye West’s huge hit “Gold Digger” in 2005.810 3. Walk the Line (2005)James Mangold’s film, in which Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon excelled as Johnny Cash and June Carter, was a highly accomplished period piece and swept up its fair share of awards. Admittedly conventional - containing at least three eureka moments in which the leads are inspired to write their best known songs - this is solid and fair-minded stuff.Marion Cotillard became an international star and was named Best Actress at the Oscars for her incredibly emotional turn as tragic French chanteuse Edith Piaf in Olivier Dahan’s 2007 film. Covering the central events of her life from childhood to middle age, the biopic captured the defiant, uncompromising character of its subject, as expressed by her signature song “Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien”.The directorial debut of Anton Corbijn, who had photographed Joy Division in their prime, Control married the British kitchen sink realism of the 1960s with the doom-laden atmosphere of Ingmar Bergman to appropriately eerie effect. Todd Haynes followed his glam rock pseudo-biopic Velvet Goldmine (1998) with this inventive exploration of the many sides of Bob Dylan. Six actors – Cate Blanchett, Heath Ledger, Christian Bale and Ben Whishaw among them – portrayed Dylan at different stages of his career as part of an appropriately freewheelin’ approach to narrative.To convince director Oliver Stone to give him the part of Jim Morrison, Val Kilmer undertook hours of extensive research into his hero, learning 50 songs to mimic his singing voice. When the surviving members of the Doors assembled to hear a recording of Kilmer, none could tell which was the impersonation and which the real Morrison. The Doors was not loved by all but the great Kyle MacLachlan and Meg Ryan were memorable in supporting roles as keyboardist Ray Manzarek and Morrison\u0027s girlfriend Pamela Courson respectively. Gary Oldman was a dead-ringer for the late Sex Pistols guitarist Sid Vicious in director Alex Cox’s appropriately grotty account of the punk star’s pointless death from heroin following the overdose of his girlfriend Nancy Spungen (Chloe Webb) in New York’s Hotel Chelsea. Bandmate Johnny Rotten was predictably dismissive of the project but understandably annoyed that Joe Strummer of The Clash had been consulted but not him.410 7. Get on Up (2014)Like Rami Malek, Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman faced a seemingly impossible task in portraying soul superstar James Brown, “Mr Dynamite” himself. He acquitted himself well, however, in a film that largely conformed to genre formula but offered strength in depth with Dan Aykroyd, Viola Davis, Lennie James and Octavia Spencer among the supporting cast.510 6. What’s Love Got to Do with It? (1993)Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne were superbly matched as Tina and Ike Turner in Brian Gibson’s unflinching account of their rise to fame and abusive marriage. Adapted from Tina’s memoir I, Tina, the movie follows Ike’s violent attempts to dominate her before a conversion to Buddhism gives the soul star the strength to break free and go it alone.Depicting the rise of game-changing LA rappers NWA in the late 1980s, Straight Outta Compton appeared in 2015 and was a smash hit, making $200m (£153m) at the box office on a $50m (£38m) budget. While F Gary Gray\u0027s film lost its way in its second half, becoming bogged down in contract disputes, overall it did a superb job of capturing the vitality and righteous anger of the album of the same name. O\u0027Shea Jackson Jr\u0027s performance as his own real-life father, Ice Cube, was a revelation.Jamie Foxx was ideally cast as Ray Charles in Taylor Hackford’s telling of the life of the blind soul star, charting his rise from poverty in rural Florida to worldwide acclaim. A sample of Foxx singing “I Got a Woman” provided the unlikely basis for Kanye West’s huge hit “Gold Digger” in 2005.810 3. Walk the Line (2005)James Mangold’s film, in which Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon excelled as Johnny Cash and June Carter, was a highly accomplished period piece and swept up its fair share of awards. Admittedly conventional - containing at least three eureka moments in which the leads are inspired to write their best known songs - this is solid and fair-minded stuff.Marion Cotillard became an international star and was named Best Actress at the Oscars for her incredibly emotional turn as tragic French chanteuse Edith Piaf in Olivier Dahan’s 2007 film. Covering the central events of her life from childhood to middle age, the biopic captured the defiant, uncompromising character of its subject, as expressed by her signature song “Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien”.The directorial debut of Anton Corbijn, who had photographed Joy Division in their prime, Control married the British kitchen sink realism of the 1960s with the doom-laden atmosphere of Ingmar Bergman to appropriately eerie effect. Hanks, a two-time Oscar winner, will appear as TV personality Fred Rogers in\u0026nbspYou Are My Friend, a drama about the beloved host of Mister Rogers\u0027 Neighbourhood, coming in October 2019.He also plays the lead in\u0026nbspGreyhound, a World War II film set to be released in March 2019 (for which he also wrote the screenplay), and voices Woody in\u0026nbspToy Story 4, scheduled to debut in June of that same year.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The Brexiteers may lose their Brexit.”Ms Rudd also cast doubt on Ms May’s plans to seal the Brexit deal at a summit with EU leaders on Sunday, acknowledging there are still obstacles in the way.“Hopefully it will get through this week,” she said, adding: “There is still a negotiation going on in terms of actually getting this agreement through.”The comments make Ms Rudd the first cabinet minister to rule out a no-deal Brexit – and the first to suggest an agreement at European level could yet be derailed.They came as the prime minister prepared to head to Brussels for talks with Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission, under huge pressure for further “wins” in the final text.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

To compound this disaster, we will have to pay out billions to replace the project.”But Ms May defended the decision, saying: “Given the European Commission’s decision to bar the UK from being fully involved in developing all aspects if Galileo, it is only right that we find alternatives.“I cannot let the armed forces depend on a system we cannot be sure of. That would not be in our national interest.“And, as a global player with world-class engineers and steadfast allies around the world we are not short of options.”\u0026nbspMPs reject Theresa May agreement, EU president Donald Tusk saysThe announcement came after the EU piled further pressure over Brexit, by rejecting the prime minister’s surprise suggestion that her deal could be renegotiated, if MPs throw it out.Donald Tusk, the European council president, said there was no other deal on offer and the only options were to leave with no deal – or to remain in the EU.“If this deal is rejected in the Commons, we are left with, as was already stressed a few weeks ago by prime minister May, an alternative. No deal or no Brexit at all. I want to reassure you that the EU is prepared for every scenario.”Meanwhile, the prime minister ducked two chances to say she can still win the crucial vote on her Brexit deal, amid mounting evidence that MPs will reject it on 11 December.She also came under pressure to push harder for the truth behind the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, after Emmanuel Macron demanded an international investigation.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

A number of junior ministers also resigned over the deal.Mr Gyimah\u0026nbspsaid a deciding factor in his resignation was\u0026nbspthe EU’s continued squabbling over the Galileo satellite navigation system.Britain has given up efforts to gain access to the project for defence and critical national infrastructure purposes after being frozen out by Brussels because of Brexit.\u0026nbspIt is unclear whether the UK will get back the £1.2bn already sunk into the project and could face a potential £5bn\u0026nbspbill for a new system.Created with Sketch.

They\u0026nbspwere asked their opinions on their bank’s current account, and how likely they were to recommend the company. TSB’s overall score was 58 per cent, putting it in joint last place with Bank of Ireland, which was bottom of the table for the second year running. TSB sheds 20,000 current accounts in wake of massive IT failure Monzo to launch new crowdfunding round as it seeks $1bn valuationTSB boss Paul Pester steps down after new IT problemsTSB, which came in fourth in last year’s ranking, has suffered a crisis this year after a series of major IT failures, which caused\u0026nbspthousands of customers\u0026nbspto leave.Chief executive Paul Pester\u0026nbspstepped down over the tech meltdown and the chaos prompted a parliamentary inquiry. More than half of the TSB customers surveyed by Which? said they had experienced technical issues in the last year. The bank also scored poorly on customer service, telephone and online banking and complaint handling. “TSB’s slump suggests that customers felt outraged to have endured the prolonged IT issues that left millions locked out of their accounts,” said Gareth Shaw, money expert at Which?A TSB spokesperson said: “We’re sorry for the problems customers experienced as a result of our IT switch.“Regrettably this is why our scores are low in this poll. Our priority is putting things right for our customers and we’ve made significant progress.”Meanwhile, Monzo came out on top after reaching a large enough sample size for the first time since it launched in 2016. The\u0026nbsponline-only bank scored full marks for both communication and its app. With a total customer satisfaction score of 86 per cent, it narrowly beat telephone and online-only First Direct, which scored 85 per cent. Nationwide\u0026nbspcame in third\u0026nbspwith 79 per cent and challenger\u0026nbsp Bank was fourth with 76 per cent. Which? said this year’s ranking showed challenger banks were gaining favour. Mr Shaw said: “Impressive results from challenger banks place them well ahead of many of the biggest banking brands in Britain, showing that innovation and modern ideas are shaking up the market, with good customer service truly valued by customers.“Our research shows a clear gap between the best and worst providers and should act as a catalyst for customers unhappy with their service to switch banks – as it’s never been easier.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Used for conditions such as myopia and cataracts.It was not only the power of the seismic waves which puzzled scientists when they began to examine the readings, but also the curiously regular shape of the waveform.In a typical earthquake, the rapid crash of a tectonic plate movement sends out what is known as a “wave train”, composed of several types of waves moving at different speeds from the epicentre of the quake.Seismographs measure the fastest waves first (the primary or P waves), which arrive in an abrupt cluster, then the secondary (S waves), and finally, rumbling along later, come slower low-frequency surface waves. In a powerful quake, these can move across the surface of the planet several times.The wave pattern seen on 11 November resembled these slow-moving waveforms usually seen following large earthquakes - only, in this case,\u0026nbspthere had not been a perceptible earthquake.At least 700 people injured after 6.3-magnitude hits western IranUnderwater tremor was most powerful earthquake to strike NorwayFracking earthquake laws could be relaxed to encourage drillingThe bizarre waveform is what scientists call “monochromatic”. Earthquakes normally produce waves of so many different frequencies, the wave readings appear more jumbled.But the mystery waveform from Mayotte was a crisp zigzag, which repeated after steady 17-second intervals.“They\u0027re too nice. They\u0027re too perfect to be nature,” joked the University of Glasgow’s Helen Robinson, who is study for a PhD in applied volcanology.Speaking to the National Geographic, she added the location of the island means industrial sources for the unusual wave - such as oil drilling or from wind farms -\u0026nbspcould be ruled out. Founder of UK Earthquake Bulletin (UKEQ) Jamie Gurney, who was among those who began looking at the waveform, saying\u0026nbspon Twitter he had “no idea if a similar global signal of this nature has ever been observed”.So what could cause these regular slow waves? Could it have been a meteor strike? An illegal weapons test? Previously undiscovered sea monsters? Mayotte lies between Tanzania and Madagascar (Google)Despite the mystery, scientists do have clues as to the cause of the seismic event. Mayotte, an inhabited French island, was formed as a result of volcanic eruptions around 4,000 years ago, but since then, the area has largely remained volcanically inactive.However, since May last year, the island nation has been rocked by hundreds of earthquakes, all of which have emanated offshore and the largest of which measured 5.8 on the Richter scale. The island is believed to be moving about two inches southeast each year.But in recent months, seismic activity has declined, and on the 11 November, no traditional quakes were detected. According to the National Geographic, analysis by the French Geological Survey suggests the new activity may point to huge movements of magma beneath the earth’s crust, miles offshore and under thousands of feet of water.Large movements of liquid rock, or reverberations through the magma chamber can cause waves similar to those measured in this instance.GPS measurements of Mayotte’s slow movements indicate a magma body measuring about a third of a cubic mile is pushing through the subsurface, and this could be the source of the weird waves.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.US President Donald Trump, Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Theresa May, French President Emmanuel Macron and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wave hands in front of other leaders during a family photo at the G20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires, ArgentinaFirefighters battle a blaze on Fingerfield road at the Deepwater National Park area of Queensland.

Now ministers are set to use the time to fix problems in the system - but the programme wont be halted or scrapped.A series of documents revealed that a whole raft of new changes could be coming to make the transition easier for Brits -they are signed off by the Treasury.It comes after a revolt by Tory backbenchers who demanded that extra cash be put in to soften the blow for Brits on benefits.Plans have been drawn up to spend hundreds of millions of pounds to continue paying some benefits to claimants for two weeks after their new Universal Credit claim has been made.Housing benefit tenants can already get this two week space, after reports of Brits going into debt at last years Budget.The documents also revealed that more help would be given to the self employed, and that the advance payments will be spread out and paid back over a longer amount of time.Labours Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Margaret Greenwood said today the news was proof that the government have quietly accepted that their flagship social security programme isnt working.She went on: The Government must stop the roll out of Universal Credit immediately. We need urgent answers from Esther McVey about whats going on and what action the Government will take to tackle the many flaws in the system.And ex-Labour MP Frank Field said the changes that could take place arent enough - and demanded benefits must continue until the new benefit is up and running into your bank account and that paying back advance payments more slowly should include other historic debts too.Dame Louise Casey said the design was flawed from the outset and it had pushed people further and further into debt because it tried to force people to be paid monthly.She told Radio : The poorest people are often paid weekly and fortnightly - those are the people we need to help... Civil servants are telling ministers this is a mess, and it needs fixing.Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently , or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children.

The British people will rightly expect a goodon that money.Yet, when it comes to taking back democratic control over our laws, the final terms are worse than membership of the EU.We would still be bound indefinitely by EU-imposed rules on customs, trade, employment, social policy and tax – with no say over those rules, and no ability to exit the regime.The government rightly resisted pressure to accept Free Movement of people from EU countries, to allow us to regain control over our immigration policy.But, the current deal leaves it open for the EU to refuse a permanent trade deal unless we cave in during the second phase of negotiations, after March.As for the dream of a global Britain trading more energetically from Asia to Latin America, the EU has tied our hands, hobbling those ambitions.Much has been made of the Northern Ireland Protocol. No-one wants to see ato the hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.Instead, the EU’s real game is to try to prise Northern Ireland away from Great Britain, aligning its laws with the EU – a direct threat to the integrity of the UK.Scenting weakness, the EU is now threatening to exclude Gibraltar from a future trade deal.We are being blackmailed and bullied into a flawed deal. The EU has used the negotiations to stle the opportunities and optimism that fired people up to vote Leave in .In truth, there are risks in any course of action we take now. But, by far the gravest is to succumb to the EU’s terms, stay tethered to Brussels, and accept a deal that prevents us from becoming masters of our own destiny.Over the long term, that would drain the strength of our economy, when Brexit should be a boost for workers and consumers. And those who voted Leave would feel cheated, shredding trust in our democracy.Of course, the EU were never going to welcome Brexit. Some sour grapes were inevitable. That’s why we worked hard to leave on positive terms, extending the arm of friendship.In , the EU has taken every concession and gesture of goodwill as a chance to try to bully and control us – at times treating our Prime Minister, and our country, with outright disdain.We need to be honest about the situation: there are risks in a No Deal scenario.But, they can be mitigated and managed by the government -it exercises grip and demonstrates political will. So, let us steel ourselves, and reject this miserly deal.We should make our best final offer to Brussels, then ready ourselves to leave the EU on  March - whatever their response.That way, we can deliver on the verdict of the people, and grasp the opportunities of Brexit.

I only want to be with her. I can never wait to see her.”Cue the nation emitting a collective swoon and ’Arry becoming odds-on favourite to take the jungle crown.“Aw, he’s sooooo lovely,” gushed one twentysomething TV commentator, asHarry had just bequeathed all his worldly possessions to help save an endangered species.Given the borderline hysterical response to this “man still loves we after  years” declaration, he might even be considered one himself.But is it really so unusual  To those dating in this Tinder-centric age where people start swiping right the second there’s a minor hiccup, perhaps. But to my generation, less so.Shortly after my Uncle Jack died in his early eighties, my Aunty Mabel announced that she wouldn’t be around for much longer because she couldn’t bear to be without him. Sure enough, she literally lost the will to live and died soon after.It was the same story with my godparents and, as a trainee reporter, I interviewed countless golden wedding coupleswho had endured all manner of marital bumps in the road but lasted the course.How many of today’s liaisons will reach that -year milestone When Harry and Sandra took their vows, they clearly both understood the now largely outdated concept that love is a decision, not just a feeling.In other words, there might have been plenty of niggles and quarrels along the waybut they pushed on through in the knowledge that reaching old age with your spouse and best friend by your side is one of le’s greatest pleasures.The shared experiences, the joy of shared memories, the private jokes, the non-awkward silences and the companionship — bliss.Interestingly, Harry and Sandra’s marital set-up is one that’s increasingly regarded as outdated in this supposedly “progressive” day and age — that of the man bringing home the bacon while the woman runs the house and does the lion’s share of parenting.Consequently, Harry, now , freely admits he can barely make a cup of tea because Sandra does everything for him.It wouldn’t be my, er, cup of tea, but it has worked for them and perhaps it’s because Harry clearly doesn’t view Sandra as “just a housewe”he sees her as the boss and someone whose input he values and respects.And therein lies the key to a happy marriage. It doesn’t matter what the dynamic is as long as each feels appreciated and respected in their chosen role.Harry is what many might consider to be an old-fashioned gentleman, when men were allowed to be one without fear of being branded patronising.He turned away from the female contestants while they were showering and, whenever he gets the chance, awards “the ladies” the rare camp comforts on offer instead of the men.A magnanimous gesture, I notice, that they all accept readily without a passing thought that it might be unfair to the male contestants in these times of supposed equality for both genders.Ashley Roberts danced her bobby socks off in the Lindy hop on Saturday’s Strictly and performed a crackingly good samba too.But she ended up in the bottom two.Why  Because the public never like what they think might be a foregone conclusion.And however much the show tries to dress her up as a plucky amateur, her previous dance experience makes it as implausible as putting Bear Grylls in the I’m A Celebrity “jungle” and seeing him scream at the sight of a cockroach.Remember that moment in Crocodile Dundee when a yob pulls a blade on Mick Dundee in New York and he responds by saying “That’s not a kne”– “that’s a kne”.Fast forward  years and consider the story of Alun Powell, of Newport, Gwent, who takes part in medieval role-playing contests as “Sir Fightalot”.A court heard that when he arrived home to find his father being plagued by a gang outside the house, he pulled a sword, axe and knuckleduster from the boot of his car and “took up a fighting stance”.The prosecution added: “They saw the weapons and got so frightened that they left as quickly as possible.”Job done. End of. Right Nope. Alun ended up in court, convicted of possessing bladed articles in public and given  hours of community service.Perhaps this is why more members of the public don’t get involved when they see trouble.Becausethey don’t have a weapon themselves, they could get hurt.Andthey do happen to have one in their house or car, and brandish it in self-defence, there’s every chance they’ll end up in court themselves while the troublemakers get away scot-free.Robert de Niro is the new face of Warburtons bread.It’s hard to choose my favourite movies starring this acting titan, but Midnight Bun would be top, followed by The Kingsmill Of Comedy and Jackie Brown Bread.Posh store Anthropologie has been ridiculed for selling a bunch of twigs for £.But is the laugh on them or the idiots who buy them In the words of the marvellous Harry Enfield, it must include “we saw you coming” tax.Following on from the debate on whether or not they should have built a ramp to rescue stranded penguins, the crew of BBC’s wildle series Dynasties are in the news again for helping a stricken lion cub.As a rule, those who film such programmes are discouraged from intervening in the events they are trying to capture on the basis that nature should be allowed to take its course.But the cub was shown collapsing and spasming after eating bait laced with poison by tribesmen who had lost their cattle to a lion a few days earlier.So perhaps the new “rule” could be that human intervention is allowed when it’s human intervention that caused the crisis in the first place So how come a -year-old Iranian man – pretending to be  – was blithely placed in a class full of GCSE pupils in Ipswich without so much as a routine dental check Education Secretary Damian Hinds has added to the curriculum certain feats he wants primary school children to achieve before they move up to secondary.He says pupils will be urged to climb trees, explore caves and watch the sun rise to help build character.A good idea, but how depressing that all the things most of us did as a matter of routine in our youth now have to be actively prescribed.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

and has been threatened with eviction in the meantime.She told The Sun Online: “I couldn’t even afford a loaf of bread this week - my family had to give me money and cook for us.“It was my daughter’s birthday and I had to borrow the £ she was given.“I feel so guilty, I haven’t got another option.”Joanne, who can’t walk far because of her illnesses, had to visit her job centre several times to provide reams of proof before she got help - and had to beg for lts from family and friends to get there.Her husband previously sorted out her finances, but has now moved out of the family home leaving her and their two kids Hannah, , and Zoe, , behind.Joanne, who lives in the West Midlands, is just one of hundreds of Brits who say that going onto Universal Credit has pushed them into debt.In last month’s Budget the Chancellor announced a raft of measures to help ease their struggle - but they won’t come in for months.New DWP Secretary Amber Rudd has vowed to “fix” the problems with the flagship benefits system, which rolls six payments into one.Last week she even hinted she could slash the five-week wait to try and help those who are desperate waiting for their first payment.Joanne’s got letters and phonecalls saying she is almost £ in debt on her rent alone - and could face eviction from her houseshe doesn’t pay soon.She opted for a £ advance to help her while she waited but soon struggled with making ends meet.“I’m struggling to pay for anything including food for my girls,” she added.“I’ve been worried to death, I haven’t had anything to eat some days.“I’ve been going around to my family to get food - it makes me feel so bad.“Dad paid for us all to come over with a taxi so we could have a meal.”After waiting five weeks for her benefits to come through, she is now set to get around £, a month from UC - and her PIP disability payments are paid on top ofBut it was the “huge struggle” of waiting for it all to come through which really put a strain on the family, she said.Joanne’s former partner used to do everything beforehand for her, adding: “I never really did any shopping - or even had a bank account.”She’s slashed her bills to the minimum amount she feels is possible but still is struggling to pay the bills.“Universal Credit has been a nightmare, the benefits system should have been left how it is,” she added.“It’s caused me so much trouble and stress.”A DWP spokeswoman said: “We offer advances of up to  per cent of the first Universal Credit payment to help people who need extra support, and we’ve announced a £m partnership with Citizens Advice to support vulnerable people with their claims.“Other benefits, such as Personal Independence Payments, are available for people with mental and physical health conditions to help with additional costs.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0004516094471-e1543445105186.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"britain needs brexit leaders steve hilton opinion","story":"It says: “Consider the possibility we are led by idiots.”When you look at the shambles Brexit has become, as far as Britain is concerned it’s not a possibility but a downright certainty.Let’s review the idiocy.It began with David Cameron stomping off in the biggest and most ruinous huff in history, leaving a sleep-deprived and shell-shocked Tory party scrambling to find a new leader overnight.Then Boris Johnson and Michael Gove threw away a golden opportunity as potential PM and deputy to achieve the vision of a positive, outward-looking, go-getting, post-Brexit Britain.Over a bizarre few days they stabbed each other in the back, shot themselves in the foot and indulged in whatever other self-harming metaphor you can think of.Their antics landed us with hapless and hopeless Theresa May, so desperate to prove she could deliver Brexit despite opposing it that she rushed into announcing the end-point without the faintest idea how to get there.More misguided Remainer pandering came from then-Home Secretary Amber Rudd, with her ludicrous plan to force businesses to list their foreign workers.This offensive announcement alienated Remain voters who might have given Brexit a chance and helped set in stone the horrible isiveness of the past two years.As Foreign Secretary, Boris made one gaffe after another, starting with the most heinous: Sticking to his silly remark about having your cake and eating it — guaranteed to wind up the EU bigwigs and make them even more determined to give Britain a rotten deal.On and on the idiocy has gone — from Philip Hammond trying to prove his discredited Project Fear predictions were right all along by being the most anti-businessConservative Chancellor anyone can remember, to Matt Hancock’s hysterical claims about people dying from a lack of medicineswe leave the EU without a deal. He is the Health Secretary, for God’s sake. Why doesn’t he get the medicines, instead of issuing stupid threats At least Michael Gove’s pitul descent into Project Fear ignominy, with his own Hancockian warning about running out of drinking water, turns out to be fake news — or so I’m told.And where has all this left us With a Brexit “deal” that is not really a deal and doesn’t actually deliver Brexit. The transition period leaves Britain subject to most EU rules, and there is no agreement on what comes next — just an agenda for more negotiations.How dare Mrs May say last Sunday, “The British people don’t want to spend any more time arguing about Brexit. They want a good deal that fulfils the vote” Her plan guarantees years more “arguing about Brexit” and obviously doesn’t fulfil the vote. I know politicians spin everything but this is in a dferent league. It’s not spin, Prime Minister — what you are saying is a bare-faced lie, and you know it.It is also disgraceful that the civil service is helping push out this lying propaganda at taxpayers’ expense with its Cabinet Office “Project Vote” operation.But we shouldn’t be surprised. The senior civil service has catastrophically mishandled Brexit all along, finally exposing as self-serving fiction the idea that it is the professional, reliableof the national interest, there to save the nation from the half-baked schemes of here today, gone tomorrow politicians.Yes indeed: “Consider the possibility we are led by idiots.”But now what, you might say. It’s easy to criticise — what would you do Well, I’ve said it before : Pursuing a “deal” with the EU is a waste of time. Of course you can’t stay in the single market but regain control of immigration. Of course you can’t stop paying membership fees but still set the rules. And as President Trump noted, of course you can’t strike new trade deals unless you fully leave.There is no such thing as a “soft Brexit”. There is Brexit, without adjectives — or staying in the EU in some form. “Fulfilling the vote” now requires two things: Preparing for a clean break and counteracting the inevitable short-term disruption.Disgracefully, and cynically, the Government refused to prepare for a clean break over the past two years, so now we are behind. But that doesn’t mean we can’t do it — it just means an all-out effort must be made, andnecessary the exit date pushed back.However solid the preparations, though, there is bound to be economic turbulence. But here too, we can be proactive. The Government could almost instantly make Britain the world’s top destination for business and investment.Slash corporation tax and regulations. Roll out the red carpet for entrepreneurs, scientists, investors. Commit to building the world’s most modern infrastructure and best-trained workforce.Business hates uncertainty more than anything. That is why Theresa May’s deal is a disaster — it prolongs uncertainty.A clean break and a radical pro-enterprise agenda would end uncertainty and counteract the short-term shock of departure.Once we have left, and shown how dynamic post-Brexit Britain can be, we will have much more leverage to negotiate a trade deal with the EU.Objectors will say: This is fantasy — there is no majority in Parliament for a clean break. But there is no majority for anything  either, and in any case, with a clean-break scenario the EU Withdrawal Act does not require a vote that binds the Government.But perhaps the biggest question is: Who can make this happen My idea of bringing back Cameron went down like a lead balloon. After the Rees-Mogg rebellion flopped, we are stuck with Mrs May — evenshe loses on December . No one can see a way out.There is only one answer. Pro-Brexit MPs, inside and outside Cabinet, must develop a spine, step up and unite to offer a positive alternative. Unite to get rid of TheresaMay, then make the case with passion and conviction for a clean break and a radical pro-enterprise programme.Right now, Britain needs leaders.

But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord.

You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.Other benefits like Carers Allowance, Personal Independent Payments, and Child Benefit are still separate to Universal Credit and wont be part of your lump payment.But the income from that could affect your Universal Credit amount.You might need to book and attend an interview at your local Jobcentre before you get your first payment.Once you have successfully applied and have given all the relevant information, it will take five weeks for your first sum to come through.But you can apply for an advance  you dont feel youll be able to manage financially until that happens.

governments money and exploiting their natural resources","story":"As well as getting an important military foothold, Russia most likely also has its eyes on the continents impressive mineral wealth.Already the European giant has upped its military presence in the likes of Ethiopia, Libya, Niger and Chad, all at a time when the US is pulling out.It’s upped its political influence in Zimbabwe, Madagascar and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and is working on oil and gas projects from Algeria to Nigeria.Its increasing influence comes as the United States reduces its troops across the continent by  per cent over the next few years to counter threats from Russia and China in other areas.The man spearheading Russias African rise is Yevgeny Prigozhin, according to Bloomberg.He’s the same man who was indicted for interfering in the  US election.The Russian businessman is also alleged to have helped Russia seize parts of Ukraine and turn the tide in the war in Syria.Prigozhin and his army of soldiers and operatives are offering security, arms training and electioneering services in exchange for increased control of the region, the media company reported last week.This can be seen across the continent.In Sudan, the Wagner group has reportedly won gold and diamond concessions.Egypt has been given a  billion Russian loan to build its first nuclear power plant.Over in Eritea, Russia is planning to build a logistics hub close to Chinese and US bases in Dijbouti.In Guinea, Russia is supporting a bid by President Alpha Conde to scrap term limits so he can seek to stay in power after , similar to what President Xi Jinping did in China.On the island of Madagascar, Russian election consultants are reportedly involved in a tight presidential race between Marc Ravalomanana and Andry Rajoelina for the top job.The country is also yielding political influence in Zimbabwe, where Prigozhin’s consultants advised President Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa on his disputed election win last year.Prigozhin and his men are also expanding their reach into the Democratic Republic of Congo, the continent’s second-largest country and one of the world’s richest in minerals.Russia appears to be trying to revive some of the relationships that lapsed after the Soviet Union’s collapse.It joins a number of countries such as Turkey and the United Arab Emirates looking to set up bases in Africa, mediate in diplomatic stand-offs and strike business deals.China has long had a major economic presence in Africa but it has shied away from any military involvement.It did go a step further last year, however, opening its first military base outside China in Djibouti.Near the world’s busiest shipping lanes, Djibouti is also home to a large French base, the only U.S. base in Africa, an Italian camp and Japan’s only overseas base.Djibouti blocked Russian attempts to set up a base, however, saying it wanted to avoid becoming the terrain for a proxy war.Moscow is now planning to build a logistics center at a port in neighboring Eritrea.As part of Russia’s renewed push, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov went on a five-nation tour of Africa in March this year, attended a summit in South Africa in June and visited Rwanda, chair of the African Union.Russia has also struck military cooperation deals with many African countries since , though some have yet to come into force.The agreements typically involve providing weapons and training in areas such as counter-terrorism and piracy.Analysts caution that the deals often appear more symbolic than transformative and say it’s not clearRussia has the resources to continue expanding its presence.But as in the Cold War, military deals can come alongside economic links, such as mining and energy agreements.Russian firms have signed mineral deals in Sudan, which cooperates with Moscow in defence technology, and Russia is looking at diamond and platinum projects in Zimbabwe as well as energy projects in Chad.Over the past decade, Russian trade with sub-Saharan Africa has increased fast, albeit from a low base.From -, total trade rose to . billion a year from . billion, according to the Center for Strategic  International Studies.During the same period, China’s total trade with sub-Saharan Africa nearly doubled to  billion while U.S. trade more than halved to

A growing number of other ministers share this concern.Theresa May, of course doesn’t want no deal. She wants Parliament to approve the deal she has negotiated.But, right now, it is hard to see how it passes.The DUP have said they won’t vote for it, denying the Government its majority, and  Tory MPs have declared they will vote against it — ­suggesting the Government is on course for a heavy defeat.“It is increasingly dficult to see what rescues this,” said one of those charged with getting it through.Given thatthe withdrawal agreement is defeated and nothing is put in its place then this country leaves the EU without a deal, it is foolish not to massively intensy planning for that outcome.At every point since the ­referendum, the Government has put off crucial decisions on no-deal planning.This has weakened the UK’s negotiating position and means the UK is now ill-prepared for what Mrs May admits is one of the three most likely outcomes.The situation is so serious that one member of the Privy Council told me this week that the military should be drafted in to help.This former Cabinet minister’s argument was that only the military had the logistical know-how to ensure that ­critical supplies make it all around the country in time.May still hasn’t given up on getting the withdrawal agreement through Parliament.But there is little sign of a decisive sht in her favour.Cabinet ministers are still talking in terms of the scale of defeat, rather than of victory.The expectation among ­ministers is thatMay loses the vote by  or less, she will seek clarication on the ­backstop and then try and bring it back to the Commons.But, as one leading member of the Cabinet warns, May will have to move fast.If she loses the meaningful vote she “could face the  letters and a vote of no confidence in short order”.THE Housing Secretary, James Brokenshire, has scored a ­signicant victory over the Chancellor.Brokenshire wanted to reduce the maximum deposit that renters would have to pay from six weeks’ rent to five.The idea was that this would be fairer on tenants who must find the money for the deposit up front. But Philip Hammond objected.The Chancellor wrote to Cabinet colleagues that “I cannot agree to the proposed concession to lower the deposit cap from six weeks’ rent to five weeks’ rent.“Six weeks’ rent was already placing landlords at risk of uncovered loss for damage to property, as well as risk of loss of rent.“This bill was always a high- risk measure. A cap of six weeks’ rent was already a major concession and I believe we have to hold the line at this level.”However, Hammond’s objections have not carried the day. The Government will now back reducing the deposit cap to five weeks for all but the most expensive properties.One of the Tories’ biggest problems is being seen as the landlords’ party. Hammond himself declares rental income of more than £,.In , the Tories were more popular than Labour among those who rented in the private sector.But at the last election, ­Labour had a -point lead over the Tories among private renters.The Tories won’t win these voters back by dragging their feet on measures that make le easier for tenants.SENIOR Labour figures are plotting a route to an early General Election that doesn’t involve having to get two thirds of the Commons to vote for it.One close ally of Jeremy Corbyn in the Shadow Cabinet tells me that the plan would be to defeat the Government in a confidence motionthe ­Government loses the meaningful vote.The idea would be to persuade the DUP to join with Labour and the other opposition parties in voting against the Government. This would result in a narrow defeat for Theresa May.At that point, the Fixed Term Parliament Act allows  days for the Commons to approve an alternative government.In these circumstances, no government could be approved – the DUP wouldn’t actively put ­Corbyn into No  while no Tory leader could be elected in that time who would meet the DUP’s requirements on the backstop.The result of all this would be that with ­Parliament deadlocked, there would have to be another General Election.How realistic the Labour front bench consider this scenario is crucial. For there is mounting tension in the Shadow Cabinet about whether or not Labour should formally back a second referendum.At the moment, Labour’s policy is to push for a General Election above all .But this week, John McDonnell – the Shadow Chancellor – admitted that securing a General Election was “very dficult” so the party may well back a second referendum instead.TORY party donors have received a letter from party HQ defending the deal that Theresa May has ­negotiated.Attached to the letter is a rather revealing document setting out why “the backstop is needed in all scenarios”.It lists four future scenarios for UK EU relations – a Canada-style trade deal, EEA membership, a UK EU customs union and the UK being in both the customs union and the single market.Three of these four options would be deemed unacceptable by most Brexiteer MPs.WHEN the then Culture Secretary Matt Hancock scrapped Leveson , the next stage of the inquiry into the Press, critics claimed that either Parliament or the courts would force him into a U-turn.But the key votes in the Commons were won, and this week the courts rejected the appeal for a judicial review of the decision.With Labour having gone cold on Section , which would have forced newspapers to sign up to a state regulator or pay both sides’ costs in disputes, the freedom of the Press remains.The challenge now is never to allow it to be threatened in this way again.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Conservative-run Northamptonshire became the first council in  years to ban all new spending when it ran out of cash in February. It still needs to plug a pound million budget gap before the end of March to avoid falling into insolvency for the third time. And now ministers have launched a consultation on breaking the crisis-hit authority up. Usually councils are banned from using income from the sale of buildings to pay for day-to-day expenses. But in move thought to be unprecedented, the Government has granted permission to Northamptonshire Council to do so in a bid to avoid going insolvent for the third time in less than a year. But opposition councillors said it was a political move to avoid ministers having to step in directly to bail out the council.   Labour group leader Mick Scrimshaw told the : “It is clearly politics. The Conservative government did not want the political embarrassment and for that reason they have been allowed to use these capital receipts.” One plan to balance the books, first mooted in February, is selling the councils new poundmillion headquarters in Angel Square, Northampton, and then leasing the building back. Government-appointed commissioners asked for permission for what is known as a capitalisation request in its first report to Communities Secretary in September. The Government said it would allow the council to tap its capital receipts, calling it a signicant step. Under the usual rules, there must be a clear separation between capital income - like sales on council-owned land and buildings - and revenue, including wages, salaries and running costs. But commissioners said finding an alternative to plug the revenue hole was unavoidable. The commissioners were sent in on May  to bring the councils finances back under control. In July, an initial audit revealed the councils finances were considerably worse than first thought and the local authority was on track to have a deficit of between pound million and pound million by the end of the financial year. Commissioners have already overseen the appointment of a new chief executive and finance director.   In a statement Communities Secretary James Brokenshire said: Clearly, the situation in Northamptonshire is very serious. I am grateful to the commissioners for uncovering the councils true financial position and the robust steps they have taken to improve its financial management and governance. There is still much to do, but I fully support their resolve to ensure the people of Northamptonshire receive the efficient, effective and sustainable services they deserve. Separately, the Government launched a consultation on proposals to break up the local authority, creating two new unitary authorities covering the north and west of Northamptonshire. That plan would create one authority area encompassing , people, including the towns of Kettering and Corby, and a second area including Northampton and managing services for , people. The proposals could save pound million by . But transition costs were estimated to reach up to pound million,the plans got the Government go-ahead. In a statement to the House of Commons on Thursday, Mr Brokenshire said he would make a final decision on whether to implement the proposals after the consultation ends in late January.

Bush will go down in history as the president in charge at the end of the Cold War who took the United States into the first Gulf conflict. The -year-old, who died on Friday, was elected as the st President in  and served a single term before losing his  re-election bid to Democrat Bill Clinton. Months into his presidency he was faced with the dissolution of the Soviet Union and he oversaw the removal of Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega. In August  he responded to Saddam Husseins invasion of Kuwait, creating a national coalition led by the US that liberated the oil-rich yet tiny nation but stopped short of toppling the Iraqi dictator. It was during the presidency of his son, George W Bush, that Saddams rule would eventually end.  Bush Snr, a Second World War veteran, was born George Herbert Walker Bush in Milton, Massachusetts, on June  . He enlisted on his th birthday and was the youngest pilot in the US Navy when he received his wings and went on to fly  combat missions.  One saw him shot down by Japanese anti-aircraft fire over the Pacic, leaving him to be rescued by a US submarine. He was later awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for bravery in action. In January  he married Barbara Pierce, with whom he went on to have six children - George, Robin , John , Neil, Marvin, and Dorothy.  His political career saw him occupy a number of positions including congressman, CIA director and Ronald Reagans vice president for the Republican Party before becoming the first member of the Bush political family to reach the nations top office.  George W Bush would go on to be elected president in  after Mr Clinton and served two terms.  Another son, Jeb - a former Florida governor - made an unsuccessful bid for the Republican nomination in . Only one other US president, John Adams, had a son who also became president. In , Bush was honoured with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama.  In his later years he developed a form of Parkinsons disease and used a motorised scooter or a wheelchair for mobility. Bush was admitted to hospital in Maine in  after falling at his summer home and breaking a bone in his neck. He was taken to hospital the previous December because of shortness of breath and spent Christmas  in intensive care for a bronchitis-related cough and other issues.

Universities minister Sam Gyimah becomes seventh minister latest to quit over Brexit dealIn a sign of simmering tensions between No  and industry, the Prime Minister hit out at executives who claim a post-withdrawal clampdown on overseas workers will stle their business. Tackled about the complaints from managers and directors that it will be too dficult to fill low-skilled positions, she fumed: “We have seen a huge, signicant creation of new jobs in our country and we have also seen from work the Government is doing, our encouragement of people into the workplace. “What I hope to see – and what Im sure we will be seeing - is opportunities for young people in the UK, opportunities for training and skilling young people in the UK. “But we recognise that there are businesses who want to bring people in from the rest of the world, particularly in highly-skilled areas, and our immigration system will reflect that.” Pointing to the findings of the Migration Advisory Committee, she suggested highly-skilled foreigners would stand a better chance of finding a job in the UK than less-skilled counterparts after Brexit.  “They have said they think a skills-based immigration system is the way to go, and thats what we will be doing,” said the PM, as she flew to Argentina for the G summit. “We are talking to business about their needs.” No  has refused to say when it will publish its long-term immigration policy.But ministers have repeatedly pointed out Brexit will finally allow the Government to treat EU migrants the same as those from outside the bloc.Quitting the EU would allow the UK to stop unlimited migration from the continent, she added.“Crucially we are bringing free movement to an end,” said Mrs May. “It enables us to have one system for people coming from across the world, and that is skills-based and recognises the needs of the economy.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mohammed bin salman tells macron","story":"NewsMohammed bin Salman tells Macron dont worry in tense talk about Khashoggi murderEmmanuel Macron confronted Saudi Arabia Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman regarding the murder of Saudi dissident journalist Jamal KhashoggiShareCommentsByTom DavidsonOnline Reporter:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video mbs-tells-macron-dont-worry-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:\"\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailEmmanuel Macron confronted Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman over the murder of Jamal Khashoggi at the G summit. The French President told the de-facto Saudi ruler that international experts need to be involved in the investigation into his death. Mr Macrons demand came shortly before Theresa May held face-to-face talks with the crown prince in which she promised to send a robust message about the murder, as well as the war in Yemen. Bin Salman has appeared isolated among fellow world leaders at the G summit in Argentina, with the exception of a vigorous public handshake from Russias Vladimir Putin - himself treated as a pariah by some of those present. The crown prince was filmed in an apparently tense conversation with Mr Macron, telling the French president not to worry. Mr Macron responded: I am worried...You never listen to me.   The widely-shared video showed bin Salman replying: I will listen, of course. It concluded with Mr Macron saying: I am a man of my word. Later, an Elysee Palace official said the president had conveyed a very firm message on the need for international involvement in the Khashoggi investigation, currently the subject of two separate probes by Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Mrs May said she would use her meeting to press Britains call for a credible and transparent investigation into Mr Khashoggis death in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October and urge Mohammed to ensure his country offers full co-operation to the Turkish investigation.   Mrs May was also pressing the Crown Prince to ensure his countrys engagement in talks in Stockholm next week to find a political solution to the bloodshed in Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition is fighting Houthi rebels. Amnesty International UKs director Kate Allen said Mrs May should politely but firmly insist that only a UN investigation into the grisly murder of Jamal Khashoggi is going to be sufficient. Speaking to Sky News ahead of the meeting, Mrs May said: It is the relationship we have with Saudi Arabia that enables me to sit down with him and be robust on our views on two issues. On the Khashoggi case, she said Riyadh must ensure that their investigation is a full investigation, that it is credible, that it is transparent and that people can have confidence in the outcome of it and that those responsible are held to account.   And she said she was very concerned about the humanitarian situation in Yemen resulting from the long-running conflict. Now is the time, there is an opportunity to find a solution, said the PM. I will be encouraging all parties, including the Saudi Arabians, to ensure that they sit down at the upcoming UN-led talks in Stockholm in the coming days and weeks and find a way through this, find a political solution for a stable future for Yemen. Mrs May also held talks with the summits host, President Mauricio Macri, at which the long-standing dispute over the sovereignty of the Falklands took a back seat as discussions focused on trade.   Mrs May presented keen Queen fan Macri with a book about the rock band, while the Argentine president gave her a special cup for drinking national beverage Yerba Mate herbal tea. Mrs May is the first Conservative Prime Minister to visit Argentina since the  war, and only the second serving PM to do so, after Tony Blair briefly crossed the border from Brazil in . Mr Macri has toned down official rhetoric over the islands Argentina knows as Las Malvinas since taking over from Cristina Kirchner in . This weeks announcement of a new air link between the Falklands and the South American mainland via Argentina has been greeted in London as an indication that relations are headed in a positive direction. Speaking during her flight to Buenos Aires, Mrs May said the establishment of the flight showed a dferent relationship developing. I am talking to President Macri about issues about trade and opportunities for trade, but our position on the sovereignty of the Falklands hasnt changed and will not change, she added.

Next to her, Declan Donnelly - in a gorgeous pink floaty ballgown perfect for the Viennese waltz - shouts: Its politics week, and our final contestants are going head-to-head in the shout-off. Please welcome, Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn!The studio audience clap despondently in the trees as Theresa abseils to the ground dressed as a giant sequinned eagle . Jeremy joins her in a small wheeled kayak filled with cockroaches all muttering about Palestine.The two take up position at podiums in the centre of the dancefloor, as forest rangers screw large, transparent plastic boxes to their heads.

For legal reasons, I must warn you they can bite, but will probably not manage a decent coup detat.Dec turns to her opponent. Jeremy, your box contains enough oxygen for you to survive. But every time you do that shouty geography teacher thing, ask Diane Abbott for help or fail to pick a side, some of your oxygen will be removed. He continues: Keir Starmer will also stand behind you, whispering things you dont understand.

Please welcome our judges, who will deliver their verdict on your technical performance. You will be subject to a phone vote and at the end of the show one of you WILL be leaving the contest. Spotlights fall upon the pair, and Theresa speaks first. Im standing up for Britain, she begins, then squeaks as a Jacob bites her on the nose and tells her shes hysterical. This is a deal that will give us control of our borders, she continues, while an Arlene crawls into her ear demanding Northern Ireland has special treatment but is also treated just the same. This is the best we could hope for, she adds as a Boris slithers down her blouse looking for his point.Jeremy then takes his turn. We respect the referendum, but were going to stop the government acting on it, he says, with a cough. Theresa has botched the deal, and we could do a better onewe just go back to the start again, he gasps.

You are the one to beat, but I must admit my darling the footwork was a little illogical, you havent really sold it to me. The camera pans to Craig, whose face resembles the morning after a whisky bottle and a bad break-up. The whole thing has been a dis-AAAAAAAA-ster, darlings.

Jeremy, you got... NO votes of approval. Theresa, you got... NO votes of approval. So we go to the votes of disapproval, she says.She takes a deep breath. Jeremy, you got disapproval votes from the majority of your shadow cabinet, your parliamentary party, and your party membership as a whole.

So we go to sudden death.A crash of drums, and a spotlight falls upon stage left. Dec says: You will now present your business plans to Claude Littner. Claude enters, flanked by feather-covered dancers. This is a bloody disgrace!, he barks. Theresa, none of your figures add up. Ive read through your deal and its exceptional. Exceptionally BAD, that is. If this had been suggested on day  it would have been laughed out. And Jeremy. Youre talking nonsense, arent you  Quite clearly the statements youre making are ludicrous. Youre not a big fish. Youre not even a fish! Frankly, youre both parasites. This contest is terminated.Claude exits. Tess and Dec look at each other and the cameras, uncertain of what to do. In their earpieces, a producer wonders about the wisdom of getting Mr Blobby on with a bucket of crocodile eyes. Bollocks to this, says a member of the audience, standing up. Youre all hopeless. No-one voted for the Tories to disentegrate, no-ones pointed out this is a transition agreement, not the actual deal. If youre all this hopeless just limbering up, what hope do we have of winning the thing  Ive heard enough. Youre all bloody fired.  We wont get any that, of course. Those who organise political debates rarely include a gunge machine, and politicians who behave like infants whove lost a rattle ironically think such stunts would be childish.Instead, the broadcasters will put the debate on just before the Im A Celeb final or after the Strictly semi-final. The question is not who gets voted out, but whether its a BBC audience, a more-plebby ITV one, and whether anyone will watch for more than  minutes.Which is a shame, because as a country we have more faith in X Factor phone votes than we do the ones cast in the ballot box.

But Rail, Maritime and Transport union general secretary Mick Cash said the latest fare rise is “another kick in the teeth for passengers on Britain’s rip-off privatised railways”. A Mirror investigation has found that the best paid bosses of private rail operating franchises pocketed an average salary of pound, – more than double the amount paid every year to Prime Minister Theresa May. That is a payrise of pound, on average from the previous year when rail bosses typically earned pound, each. The Mirror has examined the accounts of  separate rail companies which run Britain’s biggest networks. The company accounts for First Greater Western reveal that the best paid director received pound, last year, including a pound, bonus. That is an increase of % or pound, from the previous year. The best paid director of French owned Keolis , which runs a string of UK rail franchises, got paid pound, last year, a payrise of %.   The best paid Virgin Rail boss took home pound,, up %, despite the collapse of its East Coast rail service with Stagecoach. One director at Govia Thameslink, which faced calls to lose its franchise after delays, got paid pound, last year, up %. The best paid boss of a rail and transport group, Go Ahead’s chief executive David Brown got paid pound.m last year, up %. The RMT’s Mick Cash added: “We are constantly being told there is not enough money to employ station staff and guards but when it comes to boardroom pay on Britain’s rip-off railways the sky’s the limit. “This news will just add to passenger anger after the latest fare hike.” From January  next year, the price of a season ticket from Brighton to London will go up by pound to pound,, while one from Gloucester to Birmingham goes up pound to to pound, and one from Manchester to Liverpool goes up pound to pound,. The average rise will be the second highest since January , according to industry body the Rail Delivery Group . There have been calls for prices to be frozen following chaos caused by the implementation of new timetables in May. Fewer than halfof passengers are satisfied with the value for money of train tickets, according to a survey by watchdog Transport Focus. Its chief executive Anthony Smith said passengers want a reliable service offering better value, adding: “They shouldn’t have to wait any longer for that.   “Some passengers will have memories of the timetable crisis in the summer. We’ve got ongoing very patchy performance. All this is causing problems.” Some % of services failed to meet the industry’s punctuality target in the  months to November . -year-old passenger Verna Dilley, from London, said trains are “incredibly expensive” and fares are “becoming ridiculous”.   She added: “I don’t think it’s value for money. I think quite regularly when you have to stand for a long journey, why should you have to pay a fare ” Paul Plummer, chief executive of the industry body Rail Delivery Group, said: “Money from fares is underpinning the improvements to the railway that passengers want and which ultimately help boost the wider economy. “That means more seats, extra services and better connections right across the country.”   A Department for Transport spokesman said that “any fare increase is unwelcome” but insisted it is “not fair to ask people who do not use trains to pay more for those who do”. He added: “Taxpayers already subsidise the network by more than pound billion a year - meaning that % of our transport budget is spent on the % of journeys that the railway accounts for.” Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald claimed the increase shows “a Government and rail industry out of touch with passenger concerns”.A spokesman for the Rail Delivery Group, said: “Director’s pay is set according to market rates to attract the people needed to run big,complex safety-critical companies that move millions of passengers every day.”"},{"url":null,"title":"first picture baby boy who","story":"NewsFirst picture of baby boy who died of head injuries as dad denies murderSamuel Gildea, , denied murdering son Alfie at Manchester Crown Court this morning and was remanded into custodyShareByAndrew Bardsley:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsAlfie Gildea, who died after suffering signicant head injuries \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA dad denied murdering his four-month-old son in court this morning.

The competition to design and construct the Fleet Solid Support vessels for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary unleashed a major political row after the Tories claimed they were not warships – even though they will be armed and steam into battle zones. That meant the poundbillion deal to build two, possibly three vessels, could be offered to foreign shipyards – potentially denying British workers and firms a massive windfall. The MoD said companies from Italy, Spain, Japan and South Korea were in the running for the bumper contract – with a UK consortium also shortlisted.   The British team is made up of leading manufacturing and engineering companies Babcock, BAE Systems, Cammell Laird and Rolls-Royce. They join Italian firm Fincantieri, Spanish company Navantia, Japan Marine United Corporation, and Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering of South Korea as the firms invited to submit a tender for the competition. Defence Minister Stuart Andrew said: “The widespread interest in this competition shows that our Royal Navy and Royal Fleet Auxiliary remain among the most prestigious in the world.   “These support ships will be vital for supporting our formidable Queen Elizabeth-class carriers and will ensure our warships can deploy in a range of challenging environments and across huge distances, wherever they are in the world.” The winning bidder will be announced in . Unions and Labour have called for the ships to be built in Britain to boost UK industry and give a steady workflow to skilled British employees. The vessels will restock Navy destroyers, frigates and aircraft carriers at seas with food, ammunition and other supplies.   They are due to enter service in . Shipbuilding and Engineering Union general secretary Ian Waddell said: “The Government are insisting that these ships are not warships so that they can open the contracts up to international competition in order to save money.   “The reality is that since the end of the aircraft carrier project  shipbuilding jobs have been lost in the UK, one yard has been closed and another is under threat. “By classying these ships, which carry weapons and support the carrier strike capability, as warships, which they do in other EU countries, we can design, manufacture and maintain these ships in the UK and guarantee jobs for a generation.

When the call handler asked the youngstershe was there alone, the youngster replied: Its just me. And a dog and a kitten. Kaitlyn tried to direct the operator to the family home by telling them to go down the big hill and up the other side. The operator was able to trace the call and ambulance paramedics rushed to the address in Askerswell, near Dorchester, Dorset.  Luckily Charlene recovered by the time the ambulance turned up  minutes later and she was checked over. The -year-old said today: I just cant explain how very proud I am of Kaitlyn. I am the proudest mum in the world right now, shes just wonderful. It was quite scary for Kaitlyn to see me have a fit but she was so calm and chilled about it. Charlene suffers from fibromyalgia syndromewhich leaves her in constant pain and prone to regular seizures.  Because of her condition she had spoken to all three of her children and practiced how to call for an ambulance so they knew what to do in an emergency. Charlene said she is rarely home alone with just Kaitlyn but on this occasion her older daughter Ky, , and Kayden, , were out. Charlene said: Kaitlyns dad had seen her in the morning and then brought her back home. He askedI wanted some shopping and I said yes. Kaitlyn wanted to stay at home with me, we wouldnt normally be at home just the two of us, I try to avoid it in case something does happen.  I was lying in bed and felt quite comfortable at the time but Id had a bad week and had been in a lot of pain. The pain gets so much that my body basically reboots like a computer because it cant handle the level of pain. The next thing I knew was the paramedic looking at me. I dont really remember much. Ive been having the seizures for about five or six months and taught all the kids what to do, weve practiced on the phone, pretending to call  so theyd know what to do.  During the phone call Kaitlyn tried to direct them to the house,telling them to go down the big hill from the A and up the other side.

Top Tories meeting in No were wrongly told none of the dead passengers were British and that the houses of victims on the ground would be insured, a confidential memo reveals. It would emerge  of the  passengers on the doomed flight were British, as was one of the  crew. Another  perished in their homes when wreckage from Pan Am Flight  hit the Scottish village of Lockerbie  years ago this month. Jim Swire, , whose daughter Flora died in the bombing, described the document as “callous and calculating”. It comes as another confidential memo revealed officials thought families of Lockerbie terror attack victims needed “careful watching”. Relatives, including Dr Swire – a vocal critic of the Government’s response to the attack – claim they have been repeatedly bugged by security services. The Mirror has unearthed a confidential minute of the Cabinet meeting at .am on December , , the morning after the tragedy.  Ministers were told “there would be a general expectation that a disaster fund would be established” that “the Government would contribute to it” and that “it would be a mistake to preicate over this”. But a memo found in the National Archives continues: “On the other hand, neither the aircraft nor its passengers were British and it was not yet clear that many people on the ground would require assistance. “The private houses affected would presumably be covered by insurance.” There was no mention in the document that the Government should feel morally obliged to help or that it should take the lead and set up a fund.  Instead, Mrs Thatcher told colleagues the Government would make “an appropriate contribution”a fund was opened. An emergency fund was announced by the local council that same day and then Transport Secretary Paul Channon told the Commons “the Government will contribute in the normal way”. The minutes also reveal Mrs Thatcher ordered Mr Channon to spin the response to the atrocity. She said he “should give as much detail as he could about major shyoperations that were being mounted in response to this tragedy” and “it was important that it should be as positive as possible”.   The Government was soon engulfed in criticism that it failed to pass on a warning from American authorities on December  that a Pan Am flight from Frankfurt to the US could be a terror target within two weeks. Mr Channon said this information was not passed on to British airlines or airports as it had little credibility. Dr Swire, a GP who became the face of a campaign for a public inquiry into the atrocity, said of the memo: “If I had known about it at the time my first response would have been shyastonishment and fury.   “It seems callous to me and calculating that hours after the bombing the Government is counting the cost to itself, and looking at ways of minimising that cost. I would have thought that the Cabinet would have been urging their most powerful investigators to discover whether they played any part in allowing this atrocity to happen. You couldn’t make it up, could you  It is stunning.” Medical student Flora Swire, , was sitting in seat D on Pam Am Flight . Dr Swire added: “I was completely done on that day. It took me a long time to recover my voice.”   He and another Lockerbie relative claimed they were bugged as confidential documents revealed they needed “careful watching”. The grieving dad said: “They have been listening in to our communications and concealing something they didn’t want us to know.” Mrs Thatcher had been warned families were getting increasingly organised and it was suggested they should be put under observation. A letter from the Foreign Office on August , , to Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, shyScotland’s most senior law officer, said: “Another aspect which will need careful watching is the activities of relatives of Pan Am  victims.   “The US relatives have for some time been well organised and vocal. More recently the UK relatives have formed the group UK Families Flight  and have written to ious ministers. We must be totally consistent in our responses.” A copy was sent to Mrs Thatcher. The Crown Office said the criminal probe into the disaster remained live, while the Foreign Office added: “We will not be commenting on the contents of our archive files.”   Only one person has been convicted over Lockerbie, Libyan Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, jailed for le in . Co-accused Lamen Khala Fhimah was acquitted. Al-Megrahi died in , aged , after being freed on compassionate grounds three years earlier. Dr Swire and a number of British victims’ families believe he may have been wrongly convicted. In , the Mirror revealed a security guard at Heathrow – where the New York-bound plane made a stop – discovered a break in at the Pan Am baggage area on the day of the attack. This was not revealed during the trial. Libya was suspected early in the probe as former leader Muammar Gaddafi is believed to have wanted revenge for the US bombing of Tripoli in .  But the finger of blame was also pointed at Iran. In July , a US Navy warship in the Persian Gulf shot down Iran Air Flight , killing  civilians, including  children. The Lockerbie Air Disaster Fund raised pound.million, of which nearly half was spent compensating victims and the rest went on projects in the town. Libya’s regime eventually accepted responsibility for the attack and agreed in  to pay pound.billion in compensation infor the lting of international sanctions.

After initially being wowed by ex-actress Meghan, royal sources suggest people behind the scenes are now feeling the strain of her “authoritative” nature. And while many felt she would be the breath of fresh air the royals needed, there is a certain feeling of frustration developing. Rumours of a falling out with sister-in-law the Duchess of Cambridge, a frequent “abrupt tone” and her apparent demands on staff have led to the Queen intervening. And the very public fallout with her dad, followed by the rows with her extended family, have “raised more than a few eyebrows” among the family known as The Firm. Even a quiet word from Her Majesty in Harry’s ear after his apparent “What Meghan wants, Meghan gets” outburst has done little to quell the “whirlwind” blowing through the household.  With an unrelenting schedule and a perfectionist’s attitude, it is clear Meghan, , has thrown herself into royal le. One key source revealed that when she revealed her intentions to “hit the ground running”, she gained much admiration. But her attitude is since said to have changed from the “smiling, bright- eyed Meghan into something more imperious”. Others suggest she has seemed particularly keen to shed her image as an actress who did racy photoshoots and steamy sex scenes, with her former career a “total no-go area” for conversation. A source said: “On the face of it, Meghan does have it all. She’s intelligent, enthusiastic and has a dferent way of doing things, which can be very exciting. But the constant ‘go-getter’ persona is wearing thin among some members of the household. Her attitude from the off was, ‘I want to know everything’. While that’s admirable, the whirlwind nature of it all is just not possible. There is so much to get to grips with. People feel she is putting too much pressure on herself and needs to realise there’s more to royal duty than learning the steps, making speeches.   “Some staff have even discussed how they can encourage her to slow down but, so far, it has been dficult.” Details of her unrelenting schedule have emerged, revealing apparent am texts, emails and even dawn calls to staff with ious demands. Then there is the row over an emerald tiara Meghan wanted to wear for her wedding and reports emerging of a rt with the Duchess of Cambridge. Kate was reportedly reduced to tears after Princess Charlotte’s bridesmaid dress fitting in the run-up to Meghan’s May wedding. The -year-old, who had just given birth to Prince Louis, was said to be “feeling quite emotional”. Another source added: “It’s obvious the two women are pretty dferent and while they haven’t been involved in a soap opera-style falling out, they aren’t exactly the best of friends.  “But their lack of closeness could also be to do with the two brothers wanting to pursue their own lives and there’s no real desire to be spending every waking minute together.” The Daily Mirror understands Meghan and Harry’s move to Frogmore Cottage at Windsor Castle was partly to do with William’s ambitions for Kensington Palace. The couple were reportedly set to enter opulent Apartment  at the shypalace, which will be renovated after the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester shyvacate it in the new year. However, one source suggests that after William and Kate opted to remain in the palace once Charles becomes King, they also decided they want to have -room Apartment  and turn it into an array of “state rooms”. A source said: “The plan would be to use the rooms for banquets and welcoming heads of states, and honoured guests. Harry and Meghan were offered other accommodation within the palace but saw this as the perfect opportunity to get out of London and start afresh.” Though both families will keep their offices at the palace, Meghan and Harry will face a -mile comshyshymute into London. The source added: “On the one hand it’s felt the breathing space will be a good thing for all involved. But on the other, those early-morning calls just might get a little earlier.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum saved 50000 benefits payments","story":"NewsMum who saved £k in benefits to enrich sons le convicted of fraudKayann Phillips, , was entitled to social security benefits but failed to declare her savings to the Department of Work and PensionsShareCommentsByLiz Day:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsKayann Phillips, , was found guilty of benefit fraud at Cardf Crown Court \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum who saved up pound, in benefit payments but failed to declare them has been convicted of fraud and told she may be forced to pay the money back. Kayann Phillips, a carer for her -year-old son, was absolutely entitled to claim social security benefits between August  and September , the court heard. After building up more than pound, in savings at one point she has now been convicted of benefit fraud, reports Wales Online. Phillips, , had failed to declare the savings when applying for benefits. Speaking atCardf Crown Court, Judge Jeremy Jenkins said: “I find that this is an unusual case.” In his sentencing remarks Judge Jenkins said: “Unusually you were not spending those benefits to the full extent but you were saving part of the money you received.   “You were saving, I have no doubt, for a very noble purpose – to enrich your son’s le.” The court heard her adult son has “considerable dficulties” and she has been caring for him since he was born. Benefit claimants must inform the Department for Work and Pensionsthey have savings. The authorities then make deductions according to the amount involved. Prosecutors said at one stage Phillips had more than pound, in savings but failed to declare them on her claim forms. Judge Jenkins said: “As a result you were not entitled to the full benefits you continued to receive.” Nuhu Gobir, prosecuting, said the total overpayment was more than pound, and there will be a hearing under the Proceeds of Crime Act on February . Clare Wilks, defending, described the circumstances as “unusual” and said the Probation Service found her client to present a low risk of re-offending. The court heard the defendant only has access to her current account as her other accounts have been restrained. Judge Jenkins said: “I find that this is an unusual case, albeit the charge of fraud is clearly made out.” He noted the amount involved as “considerable” and said the forms made it “abundantly clear” the defendant should have declared any savings. The judge described Phillips as a “dedicated” mother who had previously led an “unblemished” le. He added: “You are  and you have never before come anywhere close to getting into trouble.” Phillips, from Llanharan,Pontyclun, was given a -month prison sentence suspended for  months.

Ella Daish, , hit the headlines back in July when she spoke out about her desire for more women to use eco-friendly sanitary products. Over the past year she has been campaigning for more women to use eco-friendly alternatives. When working as a postwoman in the Vale of Glamorgan she was appalled by the volume of rubbish on the streets on refuse collection day. It made her reflect on the types of products she was using as a woman and she decided to take a stand. Ella, from Cardf, has decided to do something to tackle the issue of period poverty this Christmas. She said: Ive met lots of people over the last year, and heard lots of dferent stories about period poverty, and I was starting to think about Christmas.  Instead of spending money on Christmas presents for my family Im spending it on eco period products to give to people in period poverty. Its not something people should have to go through. Its wrong that people are faced by it. A study by sanitary product company Always revealed that more than , girls miss out on school each year because they lack access to sanitary protection. In March  a survey carried out by childrens charity Plan UK revealed that two fths of girls admitted to relying on using toilet roll at some point to help control their period - simply because they have been unable to afford sanitary products. During the investigation the charity interviewed , girls and women between the ages of  and , and it revealed % of the participants who had started their period confirmed they have had no option but to make their own sanitary-wear. Shockingly, up to % of girls also said they had used socks, other materials or things like newspaper to try and manage when they are menstruating. To try and help tackle the issue, Ella has invented her own unique advent calendars to try and help women in need - and she wants other people to get on board.  Ella says you can make any type of box at home. Using a cardboard box, every day between December  and December  you add an eco-friendly sanitary product to her reverse advent calendar. Ella hopes to fill a number of boxes herself but is encouraging others to join her however they can. Im putting products in a day, but I dont expect everyone to do that, she added. How people do it is up to you. You can put one product in a box or a packets of pads - its up to you. Its quite a lot for people to give. I am doing it this way but Im not giving anyone Christmas presents this year - Im just doing this instead. Its the money I would have spent on gts for my family. Ellas homemade calendars, dubbed the Eco Period Box, can be made with any old box at home. But shes encouraging people to use environmentally friendly products to aid her initial campaign. Following months of campaigns from people like Ella, eco-friendly products are now available in major supermarkets like Tesco and Sainsburys.  She says they are around the same price as major branding products - but they wont be as cheap as supermarket versions. Ella added: I want to address poverty, but I want to address it in my own way. I believe everyone deserves a choice in what they use which is why I am doing this. This is why I wanted to promote eco-products. Im so passionate about this because period poverty shouldnt be impacting people. It shouldnt prevent people from getting an education and they shouldnt have to miss out. It shouldnt exist in  which is the reason I started the period box. Christmas is a time where we give so why not donate a gt of this - especially during the festive season when people need them. The Eco Period Box scheme will start on December  and end on December . At the end of the month the boxes can be donated to charities such as the Red Box Project, Bloody Good Period, Freedom  Girls and local food banks such as the Trussell Trust.

Wesleigh, , and Vince, , were attracted to each other from the get-go after meeting online and realising they had a lot in common - including a shared love of Disney. They have now been together three years, recently welcoming a baby girl, and credit action in the bedroom as being one of the key components to the success of the marriage. Sex with an older man is better, that is something that you don’t get from somebody your age, said Wesleigh, who is two years younger than Vinces son.  They don’t really care or they just assume that they are doing it right and women are very complex creatures.” Vince added: “Wesleigh is very intimate, she is very loving, she treats me like a man, she makes sure that all of my needs are met, she also makes me feel loved which is very important, sex without love is not really a connection.” Wesleigh has always been interested in older men and was looking for a protective, older male figure to fill the emotional void left when her father died when she was a child. And when she met Vince she fell straight in love with him because he is a dferent type of man.”  But Vince had never dated signicantly younger women and admitted that this is his first age gap relationship. He said: “I was attracted to her blonde hair, she had a beautul smile and then, of course, she used the word Disney in her profile and I thought well, she has to be a Disney fan, otherwise everything is off, because I’m kind of a Disney aficionado. “I have never really thought that it would be a long-term thing. “There were some things in my previous marriage that were lacking and I felt that a younger girl would be able to provide those for me, but at the time I didn’t realise that I was going to fall so hard for Wesleigh.”  Wesleigh’s mother, Paige - who is only a year younger than her son-in-law - said that it took her a while to get used to her daughter’s husband, even though she knew that Wesleigh has always been interested in older men. Paige said: “Wesleigh has never done anything by the book. As a mom, you want your kids to comply but you want them to do their own thing and find their own place. The couple, from Little Rock, Arkansas, admit that their romance has raised some eyebrows.  Wesleigh said: “A lot of middle-aged women think that I am with Vince just for money, because of the way I look. “I feel likeI look dferent then your typical cheerleader or whatever girl next door then we probably wouldn’t get as many nasty looks.” Vince added: “To be someone younger especially that much,  years younger than you it’s not the norm and when things are not the norm many people will feel uncomfortable, just dont want to associate with you.” Doctors told the couple they may have trouble having children, so when Wesleigh fell pregnant, it was a very pleasant surprise for both parents. And Wesleigh says that motherhood has changed her. Vince is orced and has a -year-old son, Jeff, who, according to the couple, gets along very well with his new younger stepmother.  Speaking about what the future might bring, Vince said: “Having the age gap and knowing that I have a young we and a very young daughter at my age, the depressing part for me is the fact that I won’t be able to see her as a grown up and maybe I won’t be able to see her having children.” Wesleigh said: “I have somebody that is constantly guiding me in the right direction. If I need advice I don’t really need to go to my mom, I can go to Vince. I have somebody there to constantly provide support for me which I wouldn’t getI was with somebody of my own age.” Vince added: “I have a number of dferent hats now as supposed to just being a husband, I kind of feel like I am a mentor. I feel like I can teach and bring items into Wesleigh’s le that I have gone through and my experiences to somewhat make her a better person.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum asks knee length dress","story":"NewsMum asksdress is appropriate for funeral after husband says its \"too much\"The woman was planning to wear a black wrap dress which is \"practically knee \" on her because shes only ft tall from ASOSShareCommentsByZoe ForseyActing Audience Editor:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsIt can be hard to know what to wear\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailDressing for a funeral can be dficult, especiallyyou dont know your loved-ones friends or family too well. You want to look smart while being comfortable, without doing anything which could upset or offend any other mourners. One woman found herself in this dilemma after her husband told her the dress she was planning to wear to a funeral wasnt appropriate. The anonymous mum picked a black wrap dress which is practically kneeon her because shes only ft tall from ASOS - but he said it was too much. She shared a photo of the dress on the parenting website Mumsnet to see what other people thought. She wrote: AIBU [am I being unreasonable] to wear this dress to a funeral   I already have this dress and have a funeral next week. I intend to wear it with black tights and black ankle boots with a small heel. Also I am  foot tall so it is practically kneeon me.I thought it was perfect but DH [darling husband] seems to think its too much.She later added: Ive worn it before and it doesnt gape, it fits nice. I did consider it maybe looking too dressy but I thought opaque black tights and a neutral tone scarf would make it a little more daytime Also its certainly not what I would wear of a night out but I am a fairly formal dresser, I wear similar dresses on weekends. Her dilemma caused a debate online with parents sharing very dferent opinions on the dress. Many believed it was completely fine, especially as shes planning to wear tights. One wrote: Keep jewellery and make-up simple and make sure the tights are opaque. Its totally fine.  While another said: I think its absolutely fine. I also have noticed more recently that fewer people of all ages actually wear black. One woman pointed out: I think most people who are bereaved dont even notice what people are wearing. Its fine it you put some black tights with it. But others disagreed and thought she should find something  to wear. One mum wrote: Hmm, I dont really think its suitable funeral attire either. Its the sort of style Id wear on a night out. Another member replied: Its a bit frilly for a funeral for me. Id wear something plainer tbh. To the bemusement of a number of other commenters, one person suggested: It is a bit short for a funeral tbh. DO you have a pair of black jeans or trousers you could wear underneath  That would be more suitable than tights. Also could you wear a vest or crew neck Tshirt underneath  If not then perhaps a broach at the top of the neckline to close it  Any other situation it would be lovely but I feel that there is a bit more flesh on show than there should be for a funeral, lovely though it is. In the end it seems the woman decided to wear the dress, thanking parents for their advice. She wrote: Thank you everyone! I feel alot better, I havent been to a funeral before so was unsure. Also, I promise not to pout or wear jeans underneath.

It was a relief when he passed me by, but next thing I heard loud, heavy footsteps behind me.“There was a nanosecond of silence when the footsteps stopped and I just knew that something bad was going to happen.“I turned around and he was running towards me.“I had no chance to react before he struck me on the right-hand side of my head.“The blow stunned me and immediately I felt lethargic but I also realised immediately that I was going to have to fightI was going to survive.”It was at that moment that Linda pleaded with MscIntosh not to go through with whatever he had planned.She added: “I said to him: ‘Please don’t do this’.“He was expressionless but he also looked like he was enjoying me begging for my le.“I knew he was going to strike again and I decided I was going to have to scream and make a noise.“Then the blows continued and I felt warm blood.“I couldn’t see and thought I was going blind.”#Le should mean le#: Dundee killer Robbie McIntosh#s victim out to ensure he is NEVER released\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp le-should-mean-le-dundee-killer-robbie-mcintoshs-victim-out-to-ensure-he-is-never-released embed # secrethIGSeyC\" data-secret\"hIGSeyC\" width\"\" \"\" title\"##Le should mean le#: Dundee killer Robbie McIntosh#s victim out to ensure he is NEVER released# # Evening \" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Linda recalled that McIntosh then grabbed hold of her ankles as she lay on the ground and dragged her off the path and into a wooded area.“I must have passed out because I came round and was aware I was on my tummy, being dragged very quickly into the wood,” she said.“The clothes on my upper body were off and I thought he was going to rape me. He was leaning over me and it was at this point I decided to stop breathing and play dead.“I took myself somewhere  and at that point I felt peaceful and had no pain.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13662436.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS168584632.jpg","title":"ayrshire sands mark 30 years","story":"NewsAyrshire SANDS mark  years of support and prepare for Christmas bauble serviceThe voluntary group has been offering an invaluable support network to bereaved parents across the county for three decades.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV NewsSANDS team Marion Boyd, Jenner Stamp, Sarah Spiers and Alison McNeil \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThat they are needed at all is a matter of huge regret. But to those within Ayrshire SANDS, a common bond and desire to unite burns bright. Behind this voluntary group for bereaved parents lies many a heartbreaking story. The Stillbirth and Neonatal Death organisation is there, in the first instance, to reach out to those in desperate pain. As a support network, mums and dads who have been in the darkest of places are often the very people best placed to act as rocks for those perishing behind them. But back in , when the Ayrshire branch of this inspiring group formed, few could have imagined the size of their task  years on. Local chair, Marion Boyd, explains: “Our first meeting had only a handful of parents and the whole topic of losing a baby was very taboo. “Thankfully the world has changed a lot since then, and people have become far more open about their loss. “But there’s no doubt that back then, you were not encouraged to speak about it.” For newly grieving mums like Marion, having a place to turn was not in the script of the s. And her experience – along with those of many others – has helped drive the st century changes to hospital support.  Marion, , said: “I had to share a room with another mum who had just given birth. “Watching her push her baby around and hear the cries of a newborn was heartbreaking. “But that was the reality back in those days. “It was almost like you had to dust yourself down and get back to normal as soon as possible. “Then there were the people who wouldn’t know what to say to you...so they’d maybe say nothing at all.” Marion and fellow committee members in the Ayrshire branch of the SANDS group are among Britain’s longest serving. Along with fellow parents, they have raised thousands during the intervening three decades and made friends through their grief. New facilities, latterly built at the Ayrshire maternity unit in Crosshouse, now give newly grieving parents their own space – with SANDS instrumental in their set-up. Treasurer Alison McNeil, , said: “Each of us has our own personal story which brought us together, and obviously they are very sad. “But through the years a special bond has grown between so many of the parents here. “Some of us have become friends for le and we’re just glad we can be here to offer support to others now. “But one stillbirth or neonatal death is one too many and it’s a sad reality that our group continues to grow like it does.” From the handful that began the journey in , so many more have passed through the hands of Ayrshire SANDS since then. And on Sunday, hundreds will attend the group’s annual bauble service at Prestwick’s St Nicholas Church. And such is the growing need for the team, they even have their own social media officer. Mum Sarah Speirs, , added: “The best thing is that nobody will judge you. “Ultimately, the only person who can truly understand what it’s like to lose a child is another parent who’s experienced the same thing.” And Marion said: “We were very keen from the outset that we had NHS involvement in the group. “We have an office on site at Crosshouse and work closely with midwives. “Perhaps they could have been wary of us at first, thinking that some parents would want to criticise them. “But they quickly realised that we are all here for the same thing and it’s a relationship that has worked very well. “Ideally the need for our group wouldn’t be there at all, but we’re just glad it can do some good.” •Parents wishing to attend Sunday’s service can bring their own bauble to hang on the Christmas tree.

Whilst providing a first-class service to her clients and the long hours spent in the office, Margo manages to achieve the perfect work-le balance for her family. This is one of the many reasons that she is one of just three finalists for Solicitor of the Year at the Law Awards of Scotland . The ceremony is this Thursdayat the Hilton in Glasgow. Growing up on the family farm in Maybole, Margo has been involved in agriculture since a young age and knew that her career path would lead her into the agricultural industry. Starting her legal career in the city, Margo worked at MacLay, Murray and Spens in Glasgow before moving closer to home at Howat’s Associates in Mauchline, to spend more time with her husband and two sons. Margo then moved to become a Partner at Lockharts in Ayr, and now heads up their Agricultural and Estates Team. Margo was nominated by one of her long-standing clients and will be attending the Awards. Her firm Lockharts are presently rebranding their office and operation at Beresford Terrace. Peter Lockhart told the Post: “The Partners and staff are proud of Margo. This is particularly so, given the two other finalists are high profile City Centre Lawyers.

It follows a kne attacker plunging terror through the health network at the Ailsa Hospital. The wooly-hatted suspect remains at large after escaping past CCTV cameras switched off for  years. Community worker Donna Maxwell, , was stabbed en route to her car on Thursday morning. Now the Post can reveal cameras are also out of order at Girvan Community Hospital – a building shared by the town’s police. Police are still hunting the Ailsa suspect, understood to be a patient at the unit. But they have been forced to launch a desperate appeal for dashcam footage caught on nearby motors. The frantic search has failed to produce a result – despite the alleged culprit being known to Ailsa staff.  One NHS source told the Post: “The woman who did this is no stranger to staff at the hospital. “She had requested to speak to a particular person on Thursday and was told they weren’t there. “That seemed to agitate her and when she got outside she carried out this random attack in the car park. “Luckily she didn’t get any of Donna’s vital organs or this could have been a whole lot worse.” Mum-of-one, Donna, of Irvine, is believed to have stumbled back into the Ailsa after the attack. She was transferred to nearby Ayr Hospital for treatment. Both the Ailsa and Ayr Hospital were put on lockdown as police dog teams raced to the scene and a force chopper circled the skies. And despite an arrest on an “unrelated matter” being made later that night, police admitted on Tuesday the suspect had not been caught. A force spokeswoman said: “There has been no arrest and inquiries are ongoing.” Donna, who was released from hospital on Friday, is now recovering at home.

Everything is a bit raw at the moment. “We have been asked by the police not to say anything about what happened or make any comment.” Now a furious union claims staff and patients have been “misled” by NHS bosses over cameras being turned off. UNISON President Gordon McKay, who worked at Ailsa Hospital for many years, said: “Our first thoughts are for the member of staff and her family. “It is shocking that someone who is dedicated to providing high-quality healthcare to the people of Scotland should be attacked at work. “In the longer term, serious questions need to be asked and answered by senior management of NHS Ayrshire and Arran over why it would appear they were leading patients, relatives and staff in the hospital to believe that CCTV was operating as a safety measure when they knew it wasn’t. “Anyone who takes a decision which misleads people about safety matters must be held to account.” When pressed by this paper, NHS chiefs insisted cameras at all of Ayrshire’s major sites were in working order. However, they were forced to concede cameras at Girvan were “working but not currently recording”. And a spokeswoman admitted: “The analogue CCTV system at Ailsa Hospital has not been operational for a number of years. “We have an ongoing review of how to make best use of CCTV across all our sites.” Scotland’s health secretary, Jeane Freeman, has the hospital within her Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley constituency. She said: “The Scottish Government has been in constant contact with NHS Ayrshire and Arran throughout recent days, and has offered any support that might be required. “The Health Resilience team has also been in touch regarding the site CCTV system. “As the MSP covering the Ayr Ailsa Hospital campus, I have contacted the management of NHS Ayrshire and Arran to seek their assurances that they’re taking all reasonable steps to protect the safety both staff and patients.” Police say the suspect is about ft in to ft in tall and aged -.

Scores of jobs are under threat as bosses battle to save its future. Senior sources say at least  full time posts face the axe amid a financial crisis.  Staff have been given the stark warning by outgoing Principal, Heather Dunk. It comes as the college leaks cash on a costly PFI deal for its campus at Kilwinning. A source said: “Mrs Dunk announced to staff that the college will run out of money in a few short years. “She blamed this entirely on the funding council, the Scottish Government and the PFI at Kilwinning. “In a blatant attempt to essentially threaten staff against pursuing the cost-of-living pay rise, she made clear that at least  full time jobs would need to go to pay to keep the college afloat.” The warning comes as Mrs Dunk prepares to step down in the Spring. And a row has engulfed management as they prepare to appoint her successor. We told last week how the recruitment agency leading the search includes the we of college chair, Willie Mackie. A College spokesman said: “The Principal recently met with all staff to provide an update regarding the financial challenges facing the college due to increased staff costs arising from national bargaining and the excessive costs of the PfI campus in Kilwinning. “The College is working with the Scottish Funding Council to find a solution to the dficult financial position, however,additional funding is not available, the outcome may be the loss of jobs to reduce expenditure. “The Principal continues to update the trade unions, the student association and staff on a regular basis to ensure openness and transparency. “All staff are aware of the challenges the Colleges faces and have contributed to a consultation regarding potential efficiencies and opportunities for income generation.” Ayr MSP, John Scott, wants to see the college backed by the Scottish Government until the end of its PFI contract. But he said: “Unfortunately, the response I have so far received from the Scottish Government to this request has been negative. “But I will continue to argue the case for additional funding to be allocated to the College in order that their ongoing commitments can be met and the loss of staff avoided.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"famous tower blocks almost certain","story":"NewsFamous tower blocks almost certain to be flattenedThe trio of -storey Riverside Place towers have been a landmark since .ShareByStephen Houston:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsThe only towers in South Ayrshire are doomed \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr’s famous tower blocks are almost certainly to be flattened after a repair bill landed for up to pound MILLION of work. The astonishing figure - which works out at pound, for each flat - is being seen as hopeless to fund. The trio of -storey Riverside Place towers have been a landmark since .   Their destruction will mean the loss of  one-bedroom flats and tenants will have to be farmed out to new homes. An insider at owners South Ayrshire Council said: “The price is too high and unless there is a money miracle, they will come down. “Officials have been taken aback at how much money they need. To save them would be financially ridiculous.” Ironically the council has already sanctioned pound million worth of initial work which has already begun. Housing staff say that to build a brand new flat either on the same riverside site or where in the area is just pound,. Each of the blocks has  homes and  have been deliberately left empty as the scale of repair emerged. One-to-one consultation is to take place with the tenants - most of whom are elderly - over the next six months. Councillors heard about the state of the “essential and advisable” works at a meeting yesterday . These include the removal of the external cladding, existing timber and aluminium windows, and pitched roof covering new insulated render system full rewiring new heating and hot water systems upgrading the sprinkler system and upgrading passenger lts. One long-time tenant told the Post: “If it is going to cost about pound, to build a new flat for me to rent, I have a money saving plan. “Give me pound, and I’ll buy my own we place in Ayr. Job done.” If repairs were sanctioned tenants would need to be decanted for a year. Housing boss Donald Gillies said: “As we consider what happens next with the high flats in Ayr, our tenants will continue to be our focus at all times. That’s why we’re asking councillors to approve a formal consultation where we can sit down on an inidual basis with each and every one of our tenants in Riverside Place and discuss their specic needs and preferences. “If Councillors agree, we’re also seeking approval to appoint two dedicated officers to lead on the consultation and engagement exercise, which would get underway in the new year with a further report to Councillors in June. “It would only be then that any decision on the future of the flats would be taken and tenants would be involved in discussions every step of the way.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13663409.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_231118pets_04JPG.jpg","title":"hopping mad mauchline miss doolittle","story":"NewsHopping mad Mauchline Miss Doolittle issues Christmas pleaPoppy Wyllie owns a whopping  bunnies so she knows a thing or two about caring for them.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  NOV NewsPoppy with guinea pals Ginny and Delilah and cabbage-eating rabbit Jasper. \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA hopping mad seven-year-old is warning others that rabbits are pets for le and not just Christmas.

Council has published a belated update on its much-anticipated school estates review, and it reveals that Galashiels is the top priority to receive new investment, with Hawick second, Selkirk third and Peebles fourth.Education chiefs are recommending that councillors approve plans for a pound.m cross-generational campus in Galashiels, which would be due to open in .The plans would see , secondary school pupils,  additional support needs students,  primary school pupils and  nursery children educated across the campus, to be split between the new Langlee Primary School and a new building at either Scott Park or Netherdale.Although the cross-generational campus is the preferred model outlined by council officers, there would be a public consultation which would explore alternative options, which includes a new standalone secondary school building which would cost pound.m.The costs outlined in the report are currently indicative but would be confirmed once a detailed delivery strategy is drawn up.The report states: ldquoWhile both Galashiels and Hawick high schools are both classed as grade C in relation to their condition, Galashiels will require signicantly more financial investment on an element-by-element fabric basis in order to remain a fully ing asset with no impact on the delivery of the curriculum.ldquoIt is recommended therefore that Galashiels is the first priority for investment given the current condition and suitability of the existing school in relation to the rest of the estate.If the report is approved by councillors, Hawick would be the second town to receive investment in its school estates.As in Galashiels, council officers are recommending the construction of a cross-generational campus, due to open in , at a cost of pound.m.The campus would cater for  secondary school pupils,  additional support needs students, , primary school pupils and  nursery children.Again, the option to create either a cross-generational campus or just a stand-alone secondary school at a cost of pound.m would be discussed with Hawick residents.However, issues relating to flooding risk and available space have led to Hawick missing out on first priority place as council officers do not currently have a concrete plan for where any new campus would be sited.The report continues: ldquoThere are other complex issues within Hawick aside from questions of scale and accessibility, in particular with relation to flood risk.ldquoWhile the existing high school site in Hawick has been included within the options appraisal, it is noted that further detailed investigations are required regarding the currently proposed flood prevention works at this site and the nature of permissible development works which could render this and other adjacent town centre sites undevelopable for an education project of this scale.ldquoThe Hawick flood protection scheme will deliver protection to the town generally at a level commensurate with one in -year flood events.ldquoEarly advice is that any new school provision on the same site or at the same level would require to achieve, a higher level of protection commensurate with its classication as a strategic asset.ldquoIn addition, other sites are already identied within the local development plan in terms of business, mixed use or industrial zoning, and this could have a detrimental impact on the wider economic health of the townutilised for educational purposes and an analysis would therefore be required.Selkirk would be the third priority for new investment, with council officers recommending a pound.m cross-generational campus, potentially due to open in .As with the campus recommendations at Hawick and Galashiels, there would be a public consultation that would consider just building a replacement secondary school, at a cost of pound.mThe report states: ldquoFrom experience with the Jedburgh intergenerational campus model, it is considered appropriate that a three-to- campus option could be considered for the Selkirk cluster.ldquoThis could comprise all the schools within the town and potentially a partial inclusion of the rural schools within the cluster, as was suggested during the pre-consultations, with pupils from P and P transitioning to the campus.,params: .pushldquoPrevious consultation with the community has focused on secondary education. It is therefore proposed that further consultation is undertaken with the community, parents, pupils and staff to determine the preferred option in terms of educational model.ldquoThis will help develop a proposal to take forward to the next stage of the process. Discussions will also be progressed with the public, private and third sector regarding the potential for other services to share services and facilities.Peebles has been designated as the lowest priority for a new school but it would receive the largest investment, with council officers recommending a pound.m campus to be opened in .The alternative would be a new secondary school building at a cost of poundm.The report continues: ldquoPrimary and secondary schools within Peebles currently have limited capacity for increased roll numbers, which is the main concern in this location as opposed to issues of condition at Galashiels and Hawick.ldquoBoth Priorsford and Kingsland primary schools are operating at  per cent capacity and Peebles High School at  per cent capacity, and further work on projected roll figures is required.ldquoIt is recommended that any decision to build a new school or campus model must form part of an overall Scottish Borders Council masterplan for the town taking cognisance of projected housing developments, transport links, infrastructure, including flood risk, and the local development plan.The campus model is favoured by council officers and the elected administration as consolidating educational provision in one or two locations would allow the closure of disused school buildings and reduce annual running costs.The report will be presented at the next full council meeting, to be held next Thursday, November , and councillors will be asked to approve the priority and sequence of investments."},{"url":null,"title":"50k-boost-for-museum-from-festival-of-speed","story":"MORE than pound, has been donated to a Borders museum by organisers of the Goodwood Festival of Speed.And a

But hersquos smarter ndash intellectually and emotionally ndash than his image might suggest.He has just been on a trip to London to take his youngest daughter to boarding school there. But when we talk he is still in Sweden, his homeland. A good place, perhaps, for him to take stock of the first act of his le. The days growing up under the shadow of an abusive father, his wild days with Grace Jones and an unexpected movie stardom that was not what he had been planning. Fame, fatherhood, orce, therapy. Theyrsquore all part of the story.Talking about all of this Lundgren makes for entertaining, wryly amusing company. He doesnrsquot shy away from the damage wrought on him and by him, but he has a kind of Calornian hippy laissez faire attitude to it all now.It is fair to say that, back when he first became a star, some of us never really looked beyond the muscles. To be honest, it was something of a revelation to me to read Grace Jonesrsquos autobiography and learn that before they met Lundgren had a degree and a masterrsquos in chemical engineering and had won a Fulbright scholarship to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston. A road not taken in the end.Therersquos a mind there that has been ignored by most of us. ldquoHah, yeah, it gets ignored a lot, he laughs.ldquoI think I have suffered from that inner confusion, he adds. ldquoDid I do the right thing  Why do people look at me in a certain way  And then, of course, you look at Ivan Drago. As a character hersquos a guy in red shorts who beats people up. You look at He-Man. His outfit is the size of a stamp. He carries a huge sword and he chops people up. I understand why people look at me in a certain way.ldquoI look back now at what I looked like when I was that age and Irsquom a little bit amazed. Wow, I look unreal. And this was before Photoshop.ldquoPeople couldnrsquot imagine that guy was a Fulbright scholar and I understand. I couldnrsquot have imagined it either.Who was that young science student  A boy whose le had been shaped by his father in many ways.Karl Johan Hugo Lundgren was an engineer who had also spent time in the military. You can see the influence of the father on the sonrsquos choices. Perhaps in the circumstances that is not a surprise.ldquoHe was a very strong man. He was a big guy. He was an officer and a gentleman in some ways, Lundgren says. ldquoHe was a snappy dresser. He was a scholar.ldquoAnd he also had a really dark side.The stain of that is something Lundgren himself has been dealing with all his le. Dealing with mental and physical abuse.ldquoWhen he got older, when the dark forces came, he took it out on me and my mom. He beat me a lot. And my mom too.He understands things more now, he says. His father had been abused as a child himself. ldquoAs a young boy you try to handle that. I had a lot of trauma. I still have some.The teenage Lundgren channelled some of his rage into boxing and martial arts and later acting. ldquoBut like somebody said, you hijack the emotion and you take it and use it. I donrsquot react from that place, which I did a lot in the past.Well, yes. The fact is that his fatherrsquos violence shaped much of his le for years, decades even. ldquoI was angry with him and I had plans to take revenge physically on him, Lundgren admits. ldquoBut I never carried those through because it just didnrsquot make any sense and by the time I was a martial artist I had other values of respect and a little more wisdom when it came to violence.ldquoI forgave him early on and I still forgive him, and I meditate for what he did.He goes off at a tangent for a moment. ldquoI think when you look at somebody who bumps into you or cuts you off in LA traffic itrsquos easy to say lsquohey, F you, man.rsquoldquoYou think you want to kill that person. You donrsquot even know them.ldquoAnd then, when I take a deep breath, I realise: lsquoHang on a second, thatrsquos why we have wars, thatrsquos why young men and young women are being blown to pieces all over the place because people donrsquot take time and take a breath and say: lsquowell, maybe it wasnrsquot that guyrsquos fault. Maybe he had a bad day. And he wasnrsquot doing it to me. It wasnrsquot personal.He is candid when he talks about the impact his fatherrsquos behaviour had on his own when he himself became a father with his now ex-we Anette Qviberg. Because what does it mean when an abusive man is your paternal role model ldquoYeah, it was dficult for me. Luckily, I had two daughters. Therersquos no sense of competition. But, yeah, I didnrsquot handle it well. I mean. I was always loving to them. I never beat them or anything.ldquoBut I did abuse myself. I was drinking too much. I was absent a lot early on in their upbringing and it was because I was dealing with my own demons.ldquoBut at some point, about  years ago I started doing therapy and I started meditating I became wiser about what had happened, and I went back to them and I spoke to them and also my ex-we and I asked for forgiveness. I told them about my dad and they started crying.ldquoNow they understand that, yes, a big strong guy like their dad can make mistakes too. You can ask for forgiveness for things yoursquove done.Of course, before Lundgren even became a father you also need to factor in fame and success into the mix. Unexpected fame it must be said. ldquoI donrsquot know why it happened that quickly, but it did.Lundgren met Grace Jones in Australia and soon was accompanying her to Studio , hanging out with Andy Warhol and trying out for a role in the James Bond movie A View to a Kill because his girlfriend already had a role in it. Next thing he knew he was cast in Rocky IV as Ivan ldquoI must break you Drago.ldquoSomebody said: lsquoYou got famous overnight.rsquo And I said lsquoNo, I got famous in  minutes. The movie lasted  minutes. When I walked in nobody cared about me. They were taking pictures of Grace Jones and trying to get me out of the way, so I wouldnrsquot block the view.ldquoAnd then as I was coming out people were taking pictures of me and it took me years to get over that. Itrsquos not like Irsquod been an actor waiting tables dreaming of success. Irsquod been at MIT in Boston a year and a half before that deciding to give up my scholarship.At the time his le was one of sex, drugs and disco in the days before Aids started cutting swathes through the people he knew. Hersquos talked before of Jonesrsquos appetites: for drugs and group sex. The partying lestyle led to inevitable clashes with Sylvester Stallone who was acting and directing Rocky IV and wanted his co-star to turn up early and bright-eyed .Lundgren was being pulled in two directions and in the end his relationship with Jones was pulled apart.That said, Jones has nothing but good things to say about Lundgren in her  memoir. In fact, therersquos a line in it, I remind him, where she writes: ldquoI would say Dolph saved my le.ldquoShit, really  I havenrsquot read it. Wow. Thatrsquos beautul, he says. ldquoYou know, I didnrsquot think I was in it.ldquoWhy did I save her le  Well, I know what happened was she met this young man, a young student karate fighter in Australia, and two years later he was a movie star. I donrsquot know why it happened so quickly, but it did. It put a lot of strain on the relationship and we broke up a year later.ldquoI think she suffered a lot for that. And I didnrsquot know how to save it. I wasnrsquot smart enough and it fell apart and at that point she went through a lot of problems. And I did help her a few times when she was in trouble.These days Dolph Lundgren might start the day with meditation and some cardio before breakfast and maybe weights later in the day. Hersquos older now. He had hip surgery in June and hersquos doing physio for that too.ldquoI donrsquot push myself physically the way I used to do. Apart from that I try to eat every four hours, so I donrsquot snack too much. Ifrsquo Irsquom filming Irsquom on set,not I try to chill out with my two daughters.I wonder what his definition of masculinity is now  What, Dolph, should a man be  ldquoA man  Oh boy. Well, I think itrsquos a number of things. Hersquos certainly an inidual who has to be strong and protective and caring about the people around him and at the same time he has to be loving and understanding and compassionate and, I think, forgiving. Otherwise, you canrsquot forgive other people. You end up fighting all the time and thatrsquos dangerous for yourself and for the world.And yet the movies ndash and letrsquos be honest, his movies ndash prefer the fighting to the forgiving. ldquoYeah, yoursquore right. A lot of films Irsquove been in portray violence and revenge in a sort of cartoonish way where itrsquos portrayed as something you have to do and there are no consequences to it. No negative consequences.ldquoBut both of the films Irsquove got coming out this year, Aquaman and Creed  Irsquove been lucky. I was fortunate enough to play characters who are dealing with that situation, with that struggle within. Both Drago and the king I play in Aquaman are asking: lsquoShould I forgive  Should I break the cycle of violence rsquo And I think both characters make the right choice.ldquoI tried to hone in on that part of the characters because thatrsquos how I look at le now.Creed  is in cinemas now. Aquaman goes on general release on December ."},{"url":null,"title":"retire-from-what-why-paul-mccartney-keeps-on-going","story":"In the last  months, Elton John, Ozzy Osbourne, Neil Diamond, Kiss and the grizzled remnants of Lynyrd Skynyrd have announced end-of-the-road tours. Paul Simon has already embraced the sound of silence with a final show in September in New York while fellow Sixties luminary Joan Baez is also packing away the touring set list for good.But for all those happy to exit stage left after decades of strutting vanity, there are still others who continue to rage against the dying of the light and the onset of their twilight years. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Robert Plant, Neil Young and Bob Dylan are still rocking well into their eighth decade, having long ago sold their souls for rock lsquonrsquo roll in some kind of Faustian pact.Itrsquos hard to imagine James Paul McCartney making a deal with the devil to prolong a career that now stretches back  years to the day he first met a fellow teenager called John Lennon on hallowed ground at a church fete in Liverpool. But a rummage around his attic for a Dorian-Gray type image might offer up a clue.On Friday, December , the former Beatle brings his Freshen Up tour to Glasgowrsquos SSE Hydro, the latest staging post of a -show itinerary that takes in America, Japan and Europe. By the time it reaches its climax next June in Phoenix, McCartney will have turned .A born performer, the musician has never met a stage he didnrsquot like. Still driven by a relentless work ethic, he steadfastly refuses to surrender to the notion that it might be time to finally hang up his famous Hofner bass and swap the le of a pensioner rock star for a rocking chair. Itrsquos a subject that occasionally rankles. He prefers instead to still consider music more as a hobby than anything approaching the nine-to-five.ldquoI was talking to Willie Nelson, about this whole retiring thing, because hes older than I am, even, he said. ldquoAnd he says, Retire from what  And I think that just says it. Retire from what The only concession to the march of time has been to finally let the grey in his hair grow out. Other than that, itrsquos business as usual and business this year has reaped a particularly bountul harvest. A media blitz for Egypt Station, his th solo album, was rewarded with impressive reviews and brought him his first American Number One in  years.And it was followed by the th anniversary reboot in November of the Beatlesrsquo White Album, which again showcased the imperishable legacy of his old compadres and the unbreakable chains of his ever present past.His Carpool Karaoke with James Corden saw him visiting childhood haunts in Liverpool and introduced him to an entirely new audience of millennials. According to YouTube, the footage has been seen by million people.In September he took over New Yorkrsquos Grand Central Station for a surprise show that literally did stop the traffic. And now here he is hitting the boards once again, maintaining the kind of pace a man half his age would do well to muster.Rumours persist of a headline-grabbing appearance at Glastonbury next year. His Scottish gig comes  years after the Beatles first played in Glasgow at the Odeon and his first since Hampden in , but oddly it will be only his ninth concert appearance overall in a city he once name-checked in the song Helen Wheels.McCartney has been famous at an unimaginable level longer than nearly anyone  alive. To put an astonishing le into context, he wrote Yesterday, the worldrsquos most covered song, in  when he was just  years of age. He was a Fab Fab Four millionaire by the time he was  at a time when the Treasury was trousering  old pennies from every pound he earned and is today unchallenged as the worldrsquos richest musician with a fortune estimated to be not far south of a billion pounds.The legacy of his songwriting alliance with Lennon continues to shimmer down the decades Deezer last week revealed more people under the age of  currently stream Beatles tracks than those who would have been around in their Sixties pomp. And the legacy of his prodigious post-Beatles output with Wings and his solo output garners more plaudits as the years tick down.There have, though, been plenty of tears in the rain. He was scarred by the death of his mum Mary ndash the hymn-like subject of Let It Be - from breast cancer when he was just . He slipped into a post-Beatles funk at his Argyle farm on the Mull of Kintyre before being pulled out of the blackness by his we Linda.Lennonrsquos dreadful assassination at the hands of a deranged fan in  saw McCartney retreat to the margins ndash he turned his back on touring for nine years. His -year marriage to Linda was tragically ended by cancer in  before the same illness claimed the le of fellow Beatle George Harrison three years later.Wersquoll gloss over the mis-step of his subsequent marriage to the former model Heather Mills and the toxic ndash and expensive - aftermath that was played out so dramatically in the orce courts. Today, McCartney is happily married to third we Nancy Shevell, a publicity-shy American who provides the reassuring comfort blanket for a man who has never been without a female companion since the age of .He takes enormous pride in his four children ndash the youngest from his marriage to Mills - and an extended family that also includes eight grandchildren. Yet there remains a sense that McCartney has been underestimated by history, a man who, despite his undoubted musical genius, is in his own way as insecure and vulnerable as Lennon was his seeming total opposite.Music continues to nurture and nourish his le. But his most recent work has caught a man looking wistfully in the mirror and perhaps reading the runes of his own mortality. And this sombre self-examination is played out in the first track on his latest album, his voice frail and aged. On ldquoYesterday, he sounded like a wounded youth. On ldquoI Donrsquot Know, he naturally sounds like an older man, his vocals now able to convey sadness not as an effect but as a fact.His voice was once one of musicrsquos most powerful instruments, as potent in its own way as Jimmy Pagersquos guitar or Clarence Clemonsrsquo saxophone. But the debacle of his sub-par performances at the closing ceremony for the  Olympics and the Queenrsquos Diamond Jubilee the same year handed critics a gilt-edged cudgel. The court of public opinion also delivered a damning verdict.McCartneyrsquos response was simply to circle the wagons behind the band that has been the mainstay of his live shows for almost  years and carry on regardless. The high notes are unquestionably harder to hit but he remains dedicated to his craft, in and outside the studio.His  collaboration with Kanye West and Rihanna on the song FourFiveSeconds may have mortied traditional fans but it gained him kudos with a new audience. These days more than any other McCartney seems to take shelter in the solace of live shows, asthe stage still offers an escape route from lersquos problems. On another Egypt Station track, he wistfully talks about having been ldquobroken in so many places, held together by a sea of faces.Which brings us to an inevitable question  Is this tour the full stop on Paul McCartneyrsquos performing career and will Decemberrsquos show at the Hydro mark his farewell to his Scottish fans  Wersquove been here before, of course. Final show. Final encore. Final bow.But this time feels like the end of a long and winding road, especially given the eight years that have elapsed since his last Scottish concert. Even for rock stars, the fat lady eventually has to have the final word. Yesterday really did come suddenly.Paul McCartney plays the SSE Hydro in Glasgow on December "},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-15-best-cosy-coffee-shops","story":".

Irsquoll only be told that when I eventually make it to the long, low metal-topped counter through a sardine can of sprawling, leaning, chatting, arm-on-each-otherrsquos-shoulders customers.Then while ordering Irsquoll ask the man where all these people are originally from and hersquoll say mainly Syria, but all over really, and theyrsquore talking Arabic.Ours will be a brief conversation because hersquos busy and because all the time I am being gently pushed, slightly bumped, harmlessly nudged back down the counter by the surge of clippered-side-shed hairstyles with gelled-back qufs.My slow journey there had been enhanced though, by watching pirouetting chickens dance, bubble and brown on burners so hot I can feel them pleasantly toast my face on this bitterly cold November night.Its not what I came in for but I have to have me some of that chicken. Served with salad, the famous Muhammara sauce from Aleppo, Saj bread and rice please.ldquoA least  minutes til theyrsquore ready mate,\" says the man switching to Glaswegian. I shake my head at the prospect of another wait and order instead the Arabic Shawarma Wrap at just over pound.What I donrsquot realise is that all the young dudes havenrsquot got their food yet and by the time theyrsquove got theirs and Irsquove got mine that rotisserie chicken will be completely ready. So I will have one of them too.Now. Of all the wonderful things that immigrants bring and have brought and will hopefully continue to bring to this city over the years, their food has surely got to rank super high up there. Look about. Itrsquos everywhere.And when you can step off a pavement in downtown Glasgow, just round the corner from St Enoch Square, and culturally anyway yoursquove stumbled into Syria from a better time and its going like a fair, well it livens up an otherwise dull Tuesday night doesnrsquot it I know what yoursquore thinking. Yoursquore thinking: a shawarma  I thought that too. Until I got mine. Juicy chicken straight from the grill, chopped, doused in sauce, wrapped tightly in the flatbread they make freshly themselves in here then the whole thing placed on another grill. And big old iron weights put on top of it. To flatten it down. To deliciously crisp that flatbread up.Itrsquos then sliced across the grain. Into surprisingly elegant finger-size bites. And served with Syrian Garlic Cream, more chilli sauce, and those sour and salty pickles that they make themselves. Outstanding.On those pickles by the way: try the Pickled Scottish Turnip. Crikey, who knew  Most dudes are having chips with their shawarmas tonight, but this dudersquos having that buttery rice, full of the flavour of cardamom.And the chicken  As good as it looked. Just-cooked, moist and sweetly tender. I wont eat it in here but take it home for the family to try, dipping torn off pieces of the Saj bread and chicken into that deep, dense Muhammara of peppers, walnuts, chilli and possibly even pomegranate.It would have been easy to walk past Lazord on a night like this without even noticing it. It looks like any one of the scores of kebab shops in the city centre. They keep the shutter down too on the side with two big tables.I probably wouldnrsquot have come in at allI hadnrsquot had a number of emails suggesting I brave the steady rush. Even then itrsquos hard to get a seat at one of the tables and simple, utilitarian and not hugely comfortable when I do.But still better to experience the Arabic Shawarama on site - to understand the crispness of the fresh flatbread, its all round juicyness. That crispness goes when its placed in a takeaway box.I know all this because of course Irsquove now been more than once. And will be back again. And probably again.Menu: Whole rotisserie chicken with that famous Aleppo Muhammara and Saj bread and those Arabic Shawarmas. What  do you need  Service: Worth the wait. Can feel like every man for himself in the surge to get served but persevere andthe counter staff get a minute theyrsquore pleasant, friendly and immensely proud of what they do. Atmosphere: Itrsquos a buzzing kebab shop with just two biggish tables, rotating chickens, flaring burners and faststreet food. I liked it. Price: Factor in the care they take over preparation and at pound for an Arabic Shawarma meal, pound for the whole chicken with Muhammara and Saj,   doesnrsquot do it justice. Food: Come for the elegant Arabic Shawarma with its dainty sections, crisped up deliciousness, juicy meats and carefully made pride.

Security minister Ben Wallace said No Deal could put the country at greater risk of crime and terrorism. And Scottish Secretary David Mundell doubled down on his claim that No Deal would be ldquocatastrophic for the Union.So dire have been the worst-case scenarios that MPs have united to block No Deal. The apocalypse appears to have been cancelled.Mrs May also made the ldquonational interest her yardstick on Brexit. But in what circumstances would the national interest be best served by No Deal  How could she argue it would be in the national interest to enter recession, choke the ports, disrupt the food supply chain, upend industry, risk social unrest, and jeopardise her precious Union, as her own cabinet has warned She has killed off her bogeyman. Instead of No Deal warnings making it more likely MPs will back her deal, it has made them more likely to reject it, as they no longer feel a chaotic exit hanging over them.They now reckon they have more space to explore other options - a softer Norway-style Brexit with single market and customs union membership is the current favourite, or a Peoplersquos Vote, the option increasingly favoured by Labour.Some politicians point out that, although Mrs May and the EU say the current deal is the only one on offer, it is more accurate to say it is the only negotiated deal. That doesnrsquot mean itrsquos the only option. Off-the-shelf plans, such as EFTA membership, are out there too.Nicola Sturgeon always said it was a ldquo choice between Mrs Mayrsquos deal and No Deal, and Mrs May and cabinet have proved it. Brexit is rich with unintended consequences.Another unintended consequence applies to Ms Sturgeon. The First Minister recently announced her MPs would vote in favour of a Peoplersquos Votegiven the chance. It was not a universally popular idea.Pete Wishart, the longest serving SNP MP, warned it could work against the independence cause, setting a precedent that could see Unionists demand a re-run of a referendum ending in a Yes vote.Alex Salmond raised the same point on his TV show last month.Irsquom not sure about this argument. The SNP conceded the principle that referendums can be rerun as soon as it lost the  vote. ldquoThe dream shall never die, as Mr Salmond said in his resignation. Then Ms Sturgeon called a second referendum in March  over Brexit to reverse the No vote.The argument seems more about timing than principle about how long to wait before voters will put up with another referendum.But there is a more pressing aspect to Ms Sturgeon supporting a Peoplersquos Vote. If her MPs back it, they will be voting against another independence referendum. Not directly, of course. But the former would surely preclude the latter.Imagine the Prime Minister is defeated on December  and the upshot, after much wailing and gnashing of dentistry, is that MPs decide to palm the mess off onto you and me. Sorry, I mean trust the people to decide what to do next. This would not be a speedy process.The EU would have to agree to extend the Article  process by a year or more to put Brexit on ice. Another referendum means a bespoke Bill going through Westminster. The last one took seven months. A second referendum Bill would be resisted at every turn by apoplectic Brexiteers. There would be a furious debate about what would be on the ballot paper.Would it be a choice between Leave and Remain again  Or a multiple choice  Perhaps the UK governmentrsquos deal versus a dferent deal , staying in the EU or a sod-it No Deal.If it was first-past-the-post, the winner would almost certainly get less than the % that gave Leave victory in . Imagine the stink that would cause. If it was decided by proportional representation, transfers might see most peoplersquos second choice come out on top. That doesnrsquot sound like a recipe for clarity and contentment either.The Electoral Commission would need weeks to mull it over. There would then be another four months of campaigning, and a potentially long and messy aftermath.The process could be doubly confused by a Tory leadership contest and a winner shting the government position mid-stream.This would all take time, time Ms Sturgeon doesnrsquot haveshe wants a second referendum before her ldquocast-iron mandate runs out in .As Irsquove written before, the First Minister has to make a call on Indyref by mid-it is happen in this parliament, because of legislation and campaign time. Butthere was a second EU vote she would have to wait till that was over, and by then it would be too late.She canrsquot have two referendums running at once. That would be a dogrsquos dinner. But nor can she have one after the other because therersquos not enough time for both by .The Scottish Tories claimed this week that Ms Sturgeon is backing a Peoplersquos Vote to cause chaos and boost the prospects of the Yes movement. But Irsquod say a Peoplersquos Vote is more likely to stall the Yes movement, at least for a few years.Faced with this choice between two referendums, I wonder how SNP MPs will vote in the end."},{"url":null,"title":"prestwick-under-pressure-after-advertising-jobs-below-real-living-wage","story":"But five years on, Glasgow Prestwick Airport is under fresh pressure after it emerged it is still advertising jobs which fail to pay the real living wage, despite Nicola Sturgeon urging all employers to do so.Opponents have now accused Ms Sturgeon of ldquorank hypocrisy after she criticised the Ministry of Defence for paying more than  civilian staff less than the living wage during First Ministerrsquos Questions on Thursday.She said: ldquoThe MoD and all Government agencies should pay the real living wage.

To be honest, I didnrsquot realise what I was getting into.Tonight MacLeod will join around  guests at the SEC in Glasgow for the th SSE Scottish Music Awards, the annual celebration of tartan-trimmed pop and rock music that has become a key feature of the nationrsquos musical calendar.From tiny beginnings ndash the first awards ceremonies were held in Glasgowrsquos City Chambers with no live performances and just a handful of well-oiled guests ndash it mushroomed to provide a stage for a whorsquos who of Scottish talent, from srsquo pop legends the Bay City Rollers to the high energy of The Snuts, Lulu to Amy Macdonald.At the same time, the awards have boosted what was a tiny Scottish music therapy charity with just three therapists, to help create a national service that uses sound, rhythm, song and melody to bring pleasure and a means of communication to people in the grip of a range of physical and mental conditions.Indeed, just as the awards have ballooned over two decades, so has Nordoff Robbins Scotland. From its original small base in Roslin, East Lothian, and with a trio of therapists on its books, thanks in part to funds raised by the Tartan Clef awards, it now has  fully-trained music therapists who deliver more than  sessions to people aged from one to  around central Scotland, in schools, community settings and at centres in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee and Fe.Itrsquos a success story that still leaves MacLeod, owner of Glasgowrsquos Garage and Cathouse music venues and whose CPL Entertainment Group has promoted extravaganzas at Braehead and Hampden, a little surprised.ldquoThere were just  people at the first awards, he remembers. ldquoWe were at the City Chambers for a couple of years but I think we were all too drunk and a bit too rock and roll for that venue.ldquoBesides, the awards had started to grow. We moved up to holding it in hotel rooms, more artists started to get involved. The first year we had a live performer ndash a guy played the piano but I canrsquot remember who it was ndash we left enthused, convinced we could grow this even more.The Scottish live music scene was flourishing too, led by T in the Park and King Tutrsquos Wah Wah Hut while acts like Franz Ferdinand, The Fratellis and The View were on the rise and favourites like Annie Lennox and Wet Wet Wet were still pulling in the crowds.The awards became established at The Old Fruitmarket, where one year Paolo Nutini sang and danced on MacLeodrsquos table and in the year of the Homecoming, Donnie Mclean led the crowd in a tear-stained version of Caledonia, assisted by dozens of bottles of whisky distributed among the tables.ldquoOne year Joe Elliot of Def Leppard came and sang some Alex Harvey numbers, remembers MacLeod, whose lsquowish listrsquo for future performers includes The Proclaimers, Rod Stewart and Churches andappearances from Annie Lennox and Franz Ferdinand.Mary Brown, music services manager with charity Nordoff Robbins Scotland recalls her favourite moment. ldquoHearing Jimmy Somerville singing was a real lsquostick outrsquo moment and a personal favourite, she says.ldquoBut what people donrsquot see is what the artists often do behind the scenes.ldquoWhen someone like Marti Pellow or Amy Macdonald, with all their experience and talent, go to visit a therapy session to see what goes on, well, itrsquos something we just canrsquot buy.She says artists are keen to share their passion for music and see the real benefits it brings to people facing a range of communication problems, mental and physical disabilities, she adds.ldquoPeople come to us with all sorts of issues autism, dementia, mental illness. The underlying premise is that music can make a dference.ldquoA lot of people who come are very isolated, they canrsquot speak or find the words to say what they want. And music can help them.Previous years have seen Letime Achievement awards for ndash among others - Orange Juice and Simple Minds.

Government, launched the campaign.A new survey has revealed one in five Scots have not heard of a credit union.Currently, around , people across the country are part of a credit union some seven per cent of the population.The survey revealed also that only two-fthsof people questioned thought they would be eligible to be a member of a credit union, and that one in four peoplewrongly believe they make profits for shareholders, just like banks.The campaign will highlight credit unions are not-for-profit organisations providing loans and savings, and most people would be eligible to join at least one credit union based on where they work or where they live.A new website has been launched to help people find out which credit union they could be a member of.Ms Campbell said: \"In helping build a fairer Scotland, we want to protect people from getting into unmanageable debt and falling into the hands of predatory, high-cost lenders.\"A key part of this is making sure that people are aware of the financial services and fair alternatives available, including credit union membership.\"Our new campaign will highlight the benefits of joining a credit union and I would encourage everyone to visit the new website to find out more.\"Michael Sheen, actor and social activist, who is a credit union member, has worked with the Scottish Government to produce a short video explaining

These concerns were echoed by the group of experts giving evidence to the Committee this morning.Speaking after the committee meeting, Mr McArthur said: “Today’s evidence session left no doubt at all that the Scottish Government is now isolated over its approach to tackle fuel poverty in rural and island areas. It is increasingly clear that Ministers will have to think again and ensure their proposals are properly #island proofed#.“In a desperate move yesterday evening, the Housing Minister issued a briefing to MSPs seeking to justy his decision not to include a rural Minimum Income Standard in the revised definition of rural fuel poverty.  This attempt by the Minister to get his retaliation in first backfired, however, as the Committee heard again today how this approach flies in the face of all the advice.“The Rural Fuel Poverty Task Force, the government’s own Independent Panel of Advisers and every organisation across the Highlands  Islands involved in housing and fuel poverty have made plain that excluding a rural MIS risks support not going to the people and communities who need it. As a result, the government’s own targets for combatting fuel poverty across the country will be undermined.“While fuel poverty is not simply an island issue, all the evidence shows that it affects rural and island communities more than others. Hopefully, today’s committee evidence session will persuade ministers to think again. If not, it will be up to parliament to force the government to do the right thing”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Golspie is operational   three days a week.\"The writer states that the letter represents the feelings of paramedics and technicians in Easter Ross, and they are calling for six more staff to make Alness and Tain   and ldquogive the residents of Easter Ross a fighting chance in their hour of need\".The Scottish Ambulance Service hit back however. A spokesman said: ldquoThe claims are untrue. We have ambulances working a   sht at Dingwall, Golspie, Lairg, Wick and Thurso ndash a crew is also available at either Tain or Alness stations and often both at the same time, depending on sht patterns.ldquoPatients in this part of Scotland can also rely on the air ambulance helicopter, a team of emergency response doctors based in Tain, Dornoch and Dingwall, and our teams of community first responders to provide an emergency response within a matter of minutes.ldquoWe closely and continuously monitor our staffing levels, through our demand and capacity review, to ensure we can provide safe patient care in all parts of Scotland and continue to invest in our workforce.Contacted for comment, Highlands and Islands Labour MSP Rhoda Grant said: ldquoStaff have raised concerns with me which I in turn have raised with the ambulance service. I believe that we do require more ambulance resources throughout the Highlands and Islands.ldquoCrews have to travel long distances to transfer patients and with specialist services becoming more centralised that will only increase.ldquoIt is right that crews who are fatigued sign off and ideally we should have more stations covered without the use of on call staff, who are in greater danger of becoming fatiguedthey have already undertaken a long transfer.ldquoI know from SAS that they are using Inverness crews to do some of these transfers where that is clinically safe.ldquoObviously in an emergency the nearest crew must respond.

Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

stand-off.The breakthrough follows \"extremely positive and constructive\" high-level discussions between the hotel group and Highland Council.Local Highland High Leusers have been unable to use the leisure pool since the end of August when access ended because of a funding wrangle.Macdonald Hotels chairman Donald Macdonald and deputy chairman Gordon Fraser met with the councils new chief executive Donna Manson in Aviemore on Tuesday and reached a one-year agreement to resolve the stalemate.HLH users will not have to pay any additional charges which had been one of the options on the table as attempts were made to break the deadlock.There is further good news with confirmation that HLH swimming lessons for children and aquafit will also resume.Details of the funding arrangements

November, in which Councillor Ian Cockburn put forward a motion whereby the local authority would determinefunds were available for design work to begin on replacement options to the bypass. This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

Author of short stories, plays, poems and a novel, The Weaver’s Grave which was his masterpiece, O’Kelly’s le was cut short because of his commitment to Irish freedom. The O’Kelly family of Loughrea were flour millers. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age. He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in .

While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers.

In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The pair of Sir Knights enjoyed their first mock battle between King William and King James, in their respective roles, during the summer.Craig, from Richhill, admits the Scarva showpiece is a particular personal highlight, having assumed such office.He said: “I enjoy the interaction and opportunity to meet other people. We were fortunate to have been invited by the outgoing Lord Mayor to launch the Thirteenth, and promote our official charity. It is very rewarding to walk in front of the banner at Scarva, after months of planning, seeing all the spectators and Sir Knights enjoying themselves, with preferably nice weather!”The project coordinator, who only recently got married, acknowledges the extra responsibility of preparing for one of the flagship events of the parading season.“There’s a lot of meetings! We liaise with ious stakeholders in order to make the day possible, which means a lot of evenings are taken up, especially the closer we get to July. I must admit, I didnt appreciate the work that goes into organising the event until I was elected into office. “The deputy master and I are only two cogs of the wheel though, as there is a dedicated team who work tirelessly, giving up their time without any hesitation to put on the best parade of the year. “However, when you hit the Demesne, and see the tens of thousands of people enjoying themselves, it makes it all worth it.” Craig maintains he and Andrew have a close bond, having a shared interest in sport, and more importantly both “wanting the best for the preceptory”.As for their partnership demystying the perception that the Royal Black is an “older man’s” organisation, Craig retorts: “Yes, I would say so. I know many of my friends are all active members throughout the organisation. For those that argue it is an old mans organisation, I would say, join, get involved and help change that perception.”Andrew, from Donaghmore, said he enjoyed holding office with the Scarva preceptory.“There are not many preceptories with a young leadership like RBP  but it’s important to have experience from the older members to guide us in our decisions and actions,” he said.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson: Libya trade envoy role ‘very interesting’Temperatures set to plummet tonight Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“If the presence of Craig and myself encourages younger people to join the Institution, then that can only be a positive.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"four generations during four decades","story":"JOHN Paul II Youth Club in Ardoyne was founded in  amidst violence that would mark the year as one of the bloodiest of the recent conflict.The youth club’s first home was in a disused shop on Herbert Street, just yards from where a number of nationalist were burnt out of their homes just a few years earlier.Jacqui Maguire, a senior youth worker at John Paul II, was just nine years old when she attended the club’s first ever event on Halloween night in its formative year, and has been involved with the club ever since.Reflecting on those early days, Jacqui recalled how, in the hardest of times, local people rallied to provide a safe haven for young people who needed refuge from regular rioting and shootings on the nearby Crumlin Road.“The kids needed social interaction, but they were getting out of school and then going into the house because of the shooting and the rioting,” she explained.“There was an old shop that they cleared out and used for discos and wee parties.“The word went about that there was a youth club opening and everybody came from everywhere. In the beginning it was just used as a place for the kids in the street to play, but it just got bigger and bigger.“It was used as a nursery and mothers would meet there at night-time. It was like a social club rather than a youth club.“At the time Mr McLaughlin in St Gabriel’s said there werelads at the school who needed apprenticeships, so he would have brought them down and they were doing a bit bricklaying and plumbing and cleaned up the building.”Despite its less-than-humble beginnings, Jacqui’s early memories of the youth club are happy ones of a community that did its best in dficult circumstances. She recalls discos in Herbert Street, sports competitions and – despite it being the height of the Troubles – cross-community trips away. It was also those formative years that set Jacqui on the path to youth work. “Every night there was something dferent going on,” she recalled.“We also went on cross community trips, and we went to Cork with Cedar Lodge Youth Club. We used to go to Cork in the week of July. Later on we would have gone to Donegal. It was really a way to keep us off the streets.”She continued: “The club got us to do wee junior committees, got us to volunteer and help the young ones, and it stopped us being out there causing trouble. That’s the way we run this club as well. There are all dferent age groups that help with the younger ones. It’s called peer leading now, but it wouldn’t have been called that in those days.”Moving from an old disused shop to two burnt-out houses in the area that were renovated, the youth club eventually got its own purpose built building, which was opened by Liverpool and Ireland player Steve Heighway in . That came after local people, including Jacqui’s father Owen Maguire, and her late mother Bridie Maguire, lobbied the then Secretary of State, Lord Melchett, to obtain £, in funding for the club’s new home.While kids with few other facilities flocked to John Paul II Youth Club in its early days, the club has only grown since then. Two years ago a new extension was built at the club and plans are already under way to build a new amphitheatre and all-purpose sports pitch in early .John Paul II Youth Club has been an integral part of the lives of many people in Ardoyne. Jacqui represents just one of four generations of her family who are currently involved with the club and said its growth is a real source of pride to her.“It’s hard to believe that a group of women way back in the s even knew about social policy, or knew how to take those steps to build a club,” she said.“I will also say that it has been the members and the community that have been the backbone of the club. We could see what it did for us and we want to make sure pass that on to the next generation and the generations after that.“It’s a safe haven for the kids. Our young people know they can come in and there is enough staff of dferent ages and dferent levels for them to work with them. Young people will have particular staff that they will really gel with. We have a lot of programmes, a lot of personal development, a lot of buddy programmes, but it doesn’t all have to be high-flying – sometimes it can just be sitting down with somebody to talk.”Like all community groups, John Paul II Youth Club has had its challenges, particularly in the area of funding. However, volunteer hours, care and hard work from staff members combine to keep the club open six days a week. For the young people, the outcome is better social lives, learning opportunities, and the instilling of a strong set of values amongst which empathy is to the fore.“Our motto is sharing is caring,” Jacqui said.“They learn acceptance and understanding of others. It doesn’t matter who they are or what they are – you respect them. It doesn’t matter what anybody’s issues are, you always give them a second chance, because we can all mess up first chances.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"storm diana set to batter the north","story":"THE tail end of Storm Diana is set to sweep across the north todaywith strong winds of up to mph in some places.A yellow warning has been put in place by the Met Office from am to midnight.The warning adds that some delays to public transport are likely and some journey times could take longer.

It would be better, he said, to allow time for more negotiations that may yield a better deal, rather than risk the future of the Union for the sake of meeting the Article  deadline.Mr Swann added: \"We will look at alternatives and assess their merits, but the bottom line for the Ulster Unionist Party is that any solution must be UK-wide in its entirety.\"He also cautioned against leaving the EU on World Trade Organisation terms, which he said could have \"potentially dire consequences\" for Northern Ireland."},{"url":null,"title":"apprentice boys set to mark lundys day with annual derry parade","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

BelfastBrexit survey: Have your say and you could win a £ Amazon voucher It came as Prime Minister Theresa May accused Labour of planning a “betrayal of the British people” by voting down her Brexit deal and pushing the country towards a no-deal departure from the EU.With  days to go to the historic House of Commons vote on her plan, the Prime Minister urged all MPs — including  or more Tories who have said they may rebel — to cast their vote “in the national interest” and back a deal which she said would deliver Brexit while protecting jobs.The DUP has said Mrs May’s Brexit plan is “worse than no deal”, and has vowed to vote against it on December .In an address to Royal Sutton Coldfield Conservative Association last night, Mrs Foster said: “We are not campaigning for a no-deal exit nor do we want barriers to trade between Northern Ireland and our neighbours in the Republic.“No one will erect hard borders between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.“Indeed, it is interesting to note that the only hard border erected is against Northern Ireland fishermen by the Irish which ensures Northern Ireland fishermen cannot fish in Irish coastal waters. This is not acceptable and runs contrary to their argument around no hard borders.“Does anyone for a moment think that the EU states don’t desperately want a deal by March  It is wrong to assume that the UK has no leverage, but we have to ensure we use it.”On a visit to Co Down yesterday, the Secretary of State said the draft deal would place Northern Ireland in an “unrivalled” global position to attract future foreign investment.Addressing business representative, Karen Bradley said that while the agreement on the table could deliver an economic boon for the region — she warned that a no deal would threaten jobs and create more ision in society.Outlining her view of the deal’s potential benefits for the UK, she said: “We will be able to strike free trade deals around the world and let me just put this in context for Northern Ireland.“Northern Ireland with a land border to the EU and trade with the EU, but being able to access free trade deals around the world puts Northern Ireland in an unrivalled position in the world as a destination for foreign direct investment and that is what I want to see for Northern Ireland.”She added: “If we reject this deal we will go back to square one.”Separately, at the G summit in Argentina, Mrs May declined to discuss whether she might offer a ‘plan B’her deal is voted down, or whether defeat could mean her resigning or being forced out.“It’s not about me,” said Mrs May. “This is about what is in the national interest. It’s about delivering the vote to leave the EU and doing it in a way that protects people’s jobs and livelihoods and protects our security and our United Kingdom.Turning her fire on Jeremy Corbyn, she said: “What I see from Labour is an attempt to frustrate what the Government is doing to deliver Brexit for the British people.“That is actually a betrayal of the British people.”Speaking at the G, European Council president Donald Tusk warned that Mrs May’s withdrawal agreement is “the only possible one” and voting it down will either lead to a no-deal Brexit or no Brexit at all.In a blow to Mrs May last night, Sam Gyimah, the universities and science minister, resigned in protest at the Government’s “naive” Brexit plan, saying that any deal we strike with Brussels will be “EU first”.He is the seventh member of the Government to quit since the PM unveiled the draft Withdrawal Agreement."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37580746.ece/6b8ce/AUTOCROP/w620h342/8_Prince_Harry_enga.jpg","title":"harry and meghan turn down invite to northern ireland town","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Brexit: Ulster Farmers Union remain amenable to alternate Withdrawal Agreement proposal \"But for us it would be worse, because the Norway plus that is being talked about would additionally keep Northern Ireland in the customs territory of the EU - completing the repudiation of the Brexit that was voted for. Thus, the backstop would essentially still apply.\"Mr Allister continued: \"The core of the backstop is that Northern Ireland alone remains part of the customs territory of the EU.\"With the EU likely to only agree a Norway-style deal which had this add-on, it would leave us incarcerated in the EU in perpetuity.\"The UUP did not appear to rule out a Norway plus style arrangement. Mr Swann said: \"The Ulster Unionist Party cannot give our support to the Withdrawal Agreement and its disastrous backstop. However, we will look at every option and assess its merits - but the bottom line for the Ulster Unionist Party is that any solution must be UK-wide in its entirety.\"Sinn Fein MLA Mairtin O Muilleoir said: \"There already is a deal on the table - its not perfect but it avoids physical infrastructure on the border.\"The DUP cannot negotiate their own deal. Nor can they back a deal that isnt there.\"The EU has recognised that a unique solution is needed for the north because of our historical and geographical concerns. The backstop recognises that - that must be maintained.\"Mrs Foster told Radio  that Mrs Mays deal would see Northern Ireland \"erge off from the United Kingdom\" and she urged the Prime Minister to \"look for a better deal\" that \"takes back control of our money, of our borders and of our laws\".The DUP leader said: \"All the things that made us vote for Brexit are the things that are going to be imposed on Northern Ireland.\"Reiterating that the DUPs  MPs would not back the Withdrawal Agreement on December , Mrs Foster said it would create a \"huge democratic deficit\" in Northern Ireland.Mrs May yesterday rejected a suggestion that the failure to get a deal with the EU would see the UK stuck with the Northern Ireland backstop plan permanently.She was responding to Andrew Murrison, the Tory MP and chair of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, who compared it to a \"post-war pre-fab\".He said: \"Its sold as temporary, its built to last, and its likely to outlive us all.\"However, the PM dismissed his comments and told the House of Commons Liaison Committee it would only ever be a temporary solution.She added: \"Neither side thinks the backstop is a good place to be.\"Mrs May admitted that it would not be possible for the UK to unilaterally withdraw from it, though. But she said this was a guarantee to the people of Northern Ireland there would never be a hard border in place.Mrs May also rejected the claim that passing her Brexit deal in Parliament without the DUPs support would lead to the end of her partnership with Mrs Fosters party.\"Actually, the DUP have themselves said that the confidence-and-supply agreement remains in place,\" she stated.Mrs May refused to be drawn on what would happenMPs down the Withdrawal Agreement. But she insisted a second referendum was not an option as it could not be held before March ,  when Britain leaves the EU."},{"url":null,"title":"raven at toronto zoo shows off intelligence as it plays with childrens toy","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

are situated adjacent to Prehen Woods but a road connecting the new development to Prehen Park had to be constructed which campaigners said resulted in the removal of ‘scores of trees’ from the ancient woodland.A petition was posted on Change.org to highlight the ‘anomalies’ throughout the planning process and ‘disregard’ shown towards the revocation order, Mr McLaughlin said.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshIt has garnered

and The Undertones.Chris Packham filmed in Derry recently and has taken a great interest in this campaign as well as the wider need to save ancient woodlands.In a statement, Mr Packam, pictured above with local campaigner George McLaughlin, said there had a ‘catastrophic failure’ in terms of accountability in relation to the plans.“This is not just about four houses and one beautul old wood full of bluebells and wonderful wildle,” he said, “this is about a catastrophic failure in the accountability of politicians, greed and idiotic short-termism. “We must preserve space, green space for the benefit of future generations, space which benefits our physical and mental health, space to ensure that we can retain the al ecosystems we rely upon to produce our food and other resources. “To progress here would spit in the face of democracy, tarnish the reputation of the council forever and ruin the sanctity of a precious part of our planet and set a precedent for a cascade of further abuses of power.”"},{"url":null,"title":"update victoria road derry re opened following earlier collision","story":"The Victoria Road in Derry has re-opened following an earlier

The latter opened last year at a cost of poundm.ldquoSuch facilities are important in the provision of sport and recreation, especially to young people who are just starting out in their sporting activities, the council chairman continued.ldquoFacilities like the Down Leisure Centre provide a gathering place around which social activities occur. They provide a sense of pride of place and belonging that can add value to community and indeed the entire district.ldquoThe council is committed that all people in Newry, Mourne and Down enjoy good health and wellbeing via the districtrsquos community plan and that the lsquoBe Activersquo campaign is a superb way to help support this outcome.Cllr Murnin added: ldquoA healthy and active lestyle contributes positively to physical, mental and social wellbeing and as an organisation we want to encourage all our citizens to be active every day.Council officials are delighted with the new centre and the initial reaction of the public to date.One of the key features is the teaching pool which will allow the new centre to provide more swimming classes and education training for teachers, allowing full access to the main pool for other swimmers.Mains gas has also been connected to the new multi-million pound building which also boasts a combined heat and power source, helping minimise its carbon footprint. Photovoltaic cells which have been fitted on the roof help heat the water in the pools and shower systems across a number of changing room areas.In addition, air source heat pumps sucks in cold air from the outside and turns it into warm air, while so-called ocalux glass allows natural light to stream into the building, with everyone associated with the new centre, from the designers to builders and the councillors who supported it financially, delighted at the opening of a new chapter in the history of local leisure provision..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballygalget on the ball helping families dealing with dementia  ","story":"BALLYGALGET GAC has been recognised for its effort in helping people who live with dementia in an award ceremony recently.John Mitchelrsquos GAC received the award after teaming up with the Alzheimerrsquos Society to become the first GAA club to take on the Dementia Friendly programme.This award recognises the work members do to ensure everyone affected with dementia in their parish and beyond gets the support they need.Brendan Birt, a spokesperson for the club, explained that the club had been crossing every cultural and religious ide since it was founded in .He said that in that time the club had attended to the needs of everyone who live in what is a very rural part of the Ards Peninsula.ldquoWe are delighted to win this award in recognition of the work that has been done by our club and in the community, he remarked.ldquoThe first initiative of our new award-winning health and wellbeing centre was to become a dementia friendly community.

Conor Kelly was the only signicant absentee, with Richard Reaney taking his place on the wing.Banbridge were without most of their Ulster contingent, fielding the team which had propelled them through the leagues over the past few seasons, and they will feel that they should have beaten a jittery home side.Defence dominated an attritional match and both sides were guilty of giving away penalties when in strong positions. Nelson kicked his side into the lead after five minutes, following a positive start, but Banbridge cranked up the pressure and had an excellent ten minute spell. They were held up over the line following some excellent driving play and continued to pile on the pressure, a charge down leading to a succession of m scrums. Despite some heroic defence, Banbridge scored when Stevie Irvine was driven over in the nd minute.Ballynahinch followed this with their best spell of the match, with excellent carrying from forwards and backs, pinning Banbridge in their own . When it seemed they had finally stretched the Bann defence to the limit, a knock-on gave the away side some respite.As lsquoHinch began to build another wave of attacks, scrum half Rhys OrsquoDonnell spotted a gap around the ruck in the centre of the pitch and ran under the posts untouched for an excellent try.Nelsonrsquos simple conversion made it -, but lsquoHinch failed to push on and there was more defending to before half-time. Banbridge missed a penalty just before the break and the home side turned round with a narrow three-point cushion.McPhillips replaced Hilton Gibbons at half-time and knocked over an excellent penalty early in the second half to stretch the lead to six points. However, Banbridge had already shown their intention to move the ball and they looked increasingly dangerous with ball in hand, especially from scrums.Centre Andy Morrison looked dangerous every time he received the ball and Banbridge upped the tempo with lsquoHinch looking increasingly nervous.

A motion on the issue will be tabled at next monthrsquos meeting of the local authority.The council chairman was presented with a consultancy report on the merits of the proposal and the minor costings of delivering the scheme which have not yet been made public.The delegation was led by Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright, who was joined by David Flinn, from the Ulster Ramblers Association.The report on extending the existing Quoile River walk into Rowallane was commissioned by the Downpatrick-based Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, which was represented at the meeting by Anthony Trainor.Also taking part was Peter Smyth from the Downpatrick Community Collective, a body which represents all community and residentsrsquo associations in the town. It is also supporting the proposed initiative.Cllr Enright described the off-road paths proposal as a ldquosimple, affordable and detailed plan to restore linkages lost in the s and s.He continued: ldquoIt has long been the desire of all political parties to restore the Ulster Way and reconnect Killyleagh, Delamont Country Park, Downpatrick, Castle Ward and Strangford.ldquoImplementing the reported does not require actual money at all, but simply the local council using its powers under the Countryside Order to remove some of the obstructions that have grown up in recent years.Cllr Enright said the network of paths would reconnect Delamont and Castle Ward with Downpatrick. He explained the route would require two or three short sections of boardwalk similar to those near the Belfast Road to reconnect paths or overcome boggy ground.ldquoAll this needs is a resolute approach by council management to reflect cross-party consensus over the priority of this project, he added.Cllr Murnin said the loss of official Ulster Way status in  for an area stretching from Killyleagh to Downpatrick and from Downpatrick to Strangford was a ldquohuge blow to East Down.He continued: ldquoSince then, local authority staff have intended to re-assert off-load links to recreate these vital routes, but this project has not been prioritised.ldquoWe can re-establish East Down as the centre of a network of off-road community trails that would be both regionally and nationally signicant. I will be lending my support to the cross-party motion in council to prioritise these three inter-linked routes.Mr Smyth said funding for the off-road paths study was obtained though the Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, with the project supported by the Downpatrickrsquos Collective which surveyed hundreds of users of existing pathways around Delamont and the Quoile River.He added: ldquoThere is clearly overwhelming public support for this proposal that would cost a small fraction of the money recently invested in providing so-called greenways in the Newry, Warrenpoint and South Armagh areas to link into the Cooley mountains..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Congratulations all round at Saintfield High School  ","story":"SIXTY years of providing outstanding education are being celebrated at Saintfield High School.The school proudly opened its doors in  as Saintfield Secondary Intermediate School with  pupils and five teachers.The school has seen many changes, including extensions and additions, the subjects offered to pupils, the ied members of staff and, of course, the generations of pupils.Miss Sarah-Lucy Hynds, principal, said the th anniversary was being marked ldquowith a real sense of pride in our past, and an excited and positive outlook for the future.She continued: ldquoIt is an absolute honour and privilege to lead such a thriving and active school community a school with a highly commended academic, pastoral, sporting and cultural history.The school has been instrumental in the development of the wider community during the last  years mdash in the citizens that it has produced and in the many and ied achievements of pupils, both past and present.Mr Johnston Young was appointed as the schoolrsquos first principal in .

When he was included in the play, he was absolutely lethal and too hot for Killough to handle.Alas, Killough were masters of their own downfall. They had the major share of possession throughout a feisty encounter, but were never going to be as ruthless as Celtic up front with too many chiefs in midfield and not enough Indians up front and any time they did threaten, goalkeeper Nathan Curran was there to deny them.Celtic started in a hurry and were - up after only four minutes. Stevie Galbraith, who led the line with distinction, linked up with McCoubrey out on the left before cutting inside Chris Fryer.He had only one thing on his mind as he entered the box and an angled right-footed curler, that seemed to take a bit of a deflection, beat Gerard Gormley all ends up.Killough tried desperately to get back on level terms and with seven minutes gone they went close when Fryer let loose from just outside the box. Curran did well to take the sting out of the shot and did even better to retrieve the loose ball ahead of the lurking Tony McIlhone.Two minutes later at the other end a McCoubrey cross was met at the back post by Sean McMahon, but he failed to get a good connection with his head and the chance was wasted.With  minutes gone the same combination dovetailed perfectly again, but McMahonrsquos cross hit the crossbar. McCoubrey was back in the thick of things minutes later when he had a shot well saved by Gormley, but Killough continued to threaten at the opposite end as well with McIlhone again being denied by Curran.Killough were starting to edge midfield and with  minutes gone Curran prevented Liam Graham from equalising after a tidy pass from Michael Burns. Just as Killough started to believe they could get back into the game, they shot themselves in the foot.As they dithered at the back, getting the ball forward, Celticrsquos pressing game bore fruit and McCoubrey took full advantage to race away and beat Gormley with a clinical strike.Four minutes into the second half McCoubrey made it - after Galbraith picked him out with a delightful pass that split Killough wide open.The exciting teenager could have added to his tally on a couple of occasions as Killough gamely tried to get back into contention, but he was out of luck with two cheeky efforts that went narrowly wide.McCoubrey eventually completed his hat-trick in the th minute when Celtic again caught Killough napping at the back and there was only going be one outcome when the talented youngster raced through to beat Gormley.Celtic Bhoys: Nathan Curran, Sean Megahey, Conor Doherty, Matthew Carson, Michael Rice, Jordan Curran, Jordan McCoubrey, Ricky Kerr, Stephen Galbraith, Sean McMahon, Chris Mullan, Subs: Terence Bell, Caolain Boyd, Andy Baggley.Killough: Gerard Gormley, Chris Fryer, Conor Black, Michael Burns, Colm Stranney, Kevin Groves, Liam Graham, Tony McIlhone, Ross Armstrong, Gareth George, Jack McLaughlin.

A comprehensive design scheme would also have to be worked up.NI Water officials have also confirmed Saintfield is one of a number of towns across the Province which requires signicant investment to upgrade the existing infrastructure to carter for current and future demand.Rowallane politicians fear the moratorium on new development in Saintfield could potentially be in place for two years and have urged senior NI Water officials to do all they can to expedite the work that is required. They say the current ban will not only have a major impact on residents and developers, but the townrsquos economy.NI Waterrsquos Stephen Blockwell confirmed to Newry, Mourne and Down councillors that the drainage study will not be completed until next December. He said the study will look at the causes of the current issues in Saintfield and outline solutions.Pointing to sewage spills at the Old Grand Jury Road, Mr Blockwell, NI Waterrsquos head of investment, said the study was part of NI Waterrsquos approach to wastewater capacity and described it as a tool ldquoto get timely solutions.Mr Blockwell continued: ldquoIn terms of the drainage plan we need to get the right analysis to come up with solutions and the model we are working on will be ready in December .

This is very unpleasant and we sympathise with them. We will work to ensure everything is in place to develop a solution to this issue.Rowallane councillors Billy Walker and Terry Andrews have urged officials to ensure that the study is not only completed on time, but that money to implement its ious recommendations is available. They argue it is not unrealistic to suggest that the development ban could be in place for up to two years.ldquoIt is very concerning that work on the study will not be completed for another  months with no guarantee that the money needed to provide a st century sewerage system in Saintfield will be available, said Cllr Walker.ldquoThis is a very serious issue and one that must be urgently addressed. The ban is impinging on the future development of one of this districtrsquos leading towns and we currently have situation during heavy rain that raw sewage is backing up into peoplersquos gardens.Cllr Walker said it was his understanding that Saintfield is one of  towns in Northern Ireland which requires major investment to upgrade sewage treatment plants and the sewerage network.He added: ldquoSaintfield must be at the top of NI Waterrsquos priority list and the money needed to upgrade the sewerage system must be available. Given that the study will only be completed next December, by the time it takes to draw up detailed designs and secure money to carry out improvements, the development ban could be in place for at least two more years. This is unacceptable.Cllr Andrews said Saintfieldrsquos existing sewerage system could not cope and there were major questions over the long term future of the townrsquos treatment plant.ldquoThe preparatory work to identy solutions must be completed as soon as possible and the money required to signicantly upgrade the system must be made available, he said.ldquoI believe a new treatment works is required, but it will take time to deliver such a strategic capital investment scheme. People in Saintfield are looking for answers to questions they have on the future development of the town.

It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Incompetence, sabotage and political posturing all play their part in this, but it is the next generation that will pay the price.”UUP leader Robin Swann said the draft withdrawal agreement “fundamentally undermines the integrity of the United Kingdom and transfers Northern Ireland into constitutional limbo – nominally part of the UK, but subject to EU rules and regulations over which we have no control, leading to longer term uncertainty and instability.”Prisoner on the loose in NI Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

On average,  months after rollout, foodbanks see a % increase in demand, compared to % in areas with Universal Credit for  months or less.“All the evidence available suggests that the introduction of Universal Credit in new communities is swtly followed by hardship for struggling families. The introduction of welfare cuts has led to foodbanks being overrun and all politicians locally need to recognise the impact of welfare cuts it has on the people they represent. “The new welfare system is increasingly driving referrals to food banks due to benefit delays, which include waiting for a first payment or having problems with a new claim.“The generosity of people who donate to the foodbanks and the volunteers who manage and distribute the food are an inspiration.“Unfortunately, the winter months are more dficult were foodbanks typically receive more referrals for emergency support and we need to redouble our efforts. “To express our gratitude, the SDLP will be doing our bit this Christmas to assist local foodbanks and doing all we can to help families under pressure.”Council staff visit aerosol paint sellers after spike in graffiti Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Christmas1.jpg","title":"thought about the christmas party its just a few weeks away","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business A time for giving, the festive party is an event that puts the spotlight firmly on employer gratitude. Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey. Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/les_1.jpg","title":"a word from the wise les mccracken","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business Name: Les McCracken Position: Managing director, McCue Crafted Fit How did you get to the position you are in today I’m a big believer in work ethic. When I was young,  or so, I had a summer job on a farm. I would have milked  cows, morning and night, in addition to general duties around the farm. I was probably working  hours a week at that time, plus cycling five miles back and forth. It has stood me in good stead throughout my le. If you apply yourself, you can do anything.What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  In short, people. They are the greatest assets to a company but they can also be the biggest challenge. I’ve been fortunate enough to build a fantastic team around me at McCue but that has taken time. I’ve been here over  years and we’ve organically grown over that period from  employees and a turnover of £, to  employees and £m. It is also worth noting that in our sector there is a lack of skilled people, when you train them up some leave, which is disappointing but you have to train them and hope they stay. More must be done to engender the younger generation in to these skilled jobs. Too many are still going aimlessly in to third level education not knowing what they want to do, whereas they can earn as you learn in a trade, and that is much needed across the manufacturing sector.How would you describe your management style  I like to think I have a good management style, most of the time I’m very easy going and I do believe in autonomy. I expect those with responsibility to be capable and willing to do their job to the highest of their ability. I also have an open door policy allowing anyone to come and discuss problems but please bring with you a solution too.This allows my team to complete projects around the world from Vienna to Milan to Stockholm. We’ve been very fortunate to work with great brands, both in retail and hospitality, and on some fantastic projects from Ten Trinity Square in London to Danske Bank in Belfast and around Northern Ireland.What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  Of course, who wouldn’t say things could be done dferently, and better  Nobody is perfect, there’s always room for improvement. If I was to work until I was  years old, I would still learn something new every day.Have you done it all on your own  No, of course not. Who does  After  years I’ve a fantastic team who are very competent and trustworthy. But it has taken hard work and graft to get here. Today is very dferent to  years ago and for me I chose the right path. Today, you can enter this sector via a trade, an apprenticeship or a university background it’s about the right fit and enjoying what you do.How would you like your business to be remembered  McCue Crafted Fit is bigger than I. It’s been going for  years and providing unquestionable quality work. Like Jimmy McCue, who set this company up, when I choose to go, I hope to be remembered as a good leader who left the company in the best possible shape. Thirty years is a long time to be managing director and I have seen many changes in skill base, technology from hand drawn floor plans to full colour D fully explosive plans. It certainly has been an interesting three decades or so. I’d also like to note that McCue weathered the recession very well. I took some strategic decisions in  and , which ensured we not only held our own, but grew as a company.What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you Be patient. Time will come. Don’t think you know everything, as each day you’ll learn something new.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/k11.jpg","title":"kainos sees profits and sales surge","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT firm Kainos has seen a sales and profits surge with revenue rising by % to £.m for the first half of the year. And boss Brendan Mooney says it is “disappointing” that a political argument around Brexit is “over-shadowing” the business case, which is largely supportive of the withdrawal deal currently on the table. The company, which has it headquarters in Belfast, saw adjusted pre-tax profit rising % - from £.m to £.m, in the six months to the end of September. It says much of the increase is down to the expansion of its Workday business throughout Europe. It says “to support the continued expansion with our Workday-related business, in Europe we continue to grow from our recently established offices in Frankfurt and Copenhagen, alongside our existing offices in Amsterdam and Gdansk”. “In North America we continue to expand our presence in Boston and Atlanta and we will open an office in Toronto in the next few weeks.” Brendan Mooney, the firm’s chief executive, told Ulster Business “There is no single reason or new reason .” He said the firms government commercial work was still a very strong part of the business, with a move towards digitalisation. “In Workday, as it rolls out across the world, there is great demand for the service as well. “There is underlying geographical expansion and signicant revenue outside the UK – we are seeing growth across Europe.” The company has grown its workforce to , – up again on the previous year, and has continued to grow. Of that,  workers are based at its Belfast and Londonderry offices which Brendan says “are a very important part of our business, and that trend will continue”. On Brexit, from a company perspective, Brendan says the services it provides to government are “not linked to Brexit”. “For us, it doesn’t get impacted by the Brexit direction – we are pragmatic on that. “In terms of Northern Ireland, the reality is… conversations about a political impact, they are over-shadowing what businesses are talking about and that’s disappointing.” He said looking forward at the next five years, the rise in demand for areas such as machine learning could form a much bigger part of the business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/223.jpg","title":"lunns opening m rolex store in city","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by Ulster Business Luxury watch and jewellery business Lunn’s is opening a new £m Rolex store in Belfast city centre.

Peter Lunn, chairman of Lunn’s Jewellers, said the decision by Rolex to open in Belfast is “a huge endorsement for the city”. “Rolex is one of the world’s true super-brands and to have their store on Donegall Place, the city’s main retail thoroughfare, is a major expression of confidence. The store will offer customers a truly immersive experience of the brand. “We are also very excited to be opening a fully accredited Rolex workshop, which will help owners to maintain the value and ensure the quality of their watches by having them serviced by skilled technicians on site at Queen’s Arcade.

Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”.
