She is not thought to have married or had children.    It was only in 2011 that she re-emerged, when a German newspaper published an interview with her and sparking a flurry of interest in the last surviving members of the Nazi leadership\u0027s inner circle. In a documentary Pomsel talked about her three years working for the man responsible for spreading Hitler\u0027s poisonous ideology in newspapers and across the airwaves.She said: \u0027I wouldn\u0027t see myself as being guilty. Unless you end up blaming the entire German population for ultimately enabling that government to take control. That was all of us. Including me.\u0027 Pomsel described in the film how she was told to keep the Nazi top brass supplied with alcohol \u0027in order to retain the numbness\u0027 and stave off the reality of their imminent defeat by the hated Russians.                                                       In 2011, Brunhilde Pomsel broke a 66-year vow of silence about the Nazi regime when she gave an interview to popular German newspaper Bild. Her revelations about the Nazi power circle\u0027s last moments shocked the world.She revealed that even after a lifetime of service, Goebbels barely acknowledged her: \u0027You couldn\u0027t get close to him,\u0027 she said. \u0027He never once asked me a personal question. Right up until the end I don\u0027t think he knew my name\u0027.Pomsel spent the last 10 days of the Third Reich in the cellars of the propaganda ministry as Russian artillery and American bombers flattened her surroundings.She continued to pump out orders from Goebbels until the very last minute - when Goebbels shot his wife then himself.Immediately before the murder-suicide, Goebbels and his wife killed their six young children by breaking cyanide vials into their mouth.Aides were ordered to pour petrol on the corpses of the dead generals - but the remains were only partially burned, and later found by the Red Army.On May 1 1945, shortly after \u0027The Boss\u0027 - Hitler - committed suicide, the Russians came into the bunker and \u0027dragged\u0027 Pomsel out. She spent the next five years as a prisoner of the Russians in special camps.She claims not to have known about the Holocaust: \u0027I was a stupid, politically uninterested little sausage of simple means. I only learned about the Jewish extermination programme after the war. Goebbels never mentioned it in his correspondence.\u0027  "},{"url":null,"title":"Roma Mexican actor finally gets United States visa approved present Oscars","story":"    Jorge Antonio Guerrero, who starred in \u0027Roma\u0027, announced to his followers on Instagram that we will be travelling to Los Angeles for the Oscars           Guerrero is looking forward to the eventful night in Los Angeles on February 24 where \u0027Roma\u0027 is up for 10 gongs\u0027It\u0027s just too f**king dumb for words\u0027: Russell Crowe leads...Emilia Clarke and Jason Momoa named as Oscar presenters......Share this articleDuring his second meeting with U.S. immigration officials in Mexico City, Guerrero was asked if he was seeking a visa for employment north of the border. He said he was looking forward to attending one of the many events that have honored the hit movie.In January, \u0027Roma\u0027 won the Golden Globe for Director of a Motion Picture and and Foreign Language Film but Guerrero missed out on the festivities one again.Guerrero, who didn\u0027t have any acting experience until last year when he debuted in three series, including the Netflix hit, \u0027Narcos: Mexico\u0027, also saw another petition go down the drains towards the end of the year when he received an invitation from Netflix to attend a gala.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Haunting images ghost town New Orleans orphanage abandoned Hurricane Katrina","story":"    Exterior shots of the building show boarded up windows at the site  abandoned in 2005 in the wake of Hurricane Katrina          A student-parent directory emblazoned with the school logo was left behind and is now covered in dirt and dust at the school          Other striking shots include a mural of a young girl on the wall among the derelict building          Open lockers with school books left behind were captured in a series of haunting images of an abandoned former orphanage          Rows of damaged chairs still facing the front of the classroom were also pictured at the abandoned schoolThe building, which dates back to the 1800s, is understood to have been flooded by levee failures on the Industrial Canal due to Hurricane Katrina in 2005.A new campus was built in 2007 a new site in Gentilly and the old one damaged in Hurricane Katrina was left to rot.Photographer Abandoned Southeast said: \u0027Like a majority of New Orleans, Holy Cross was flooded by levee failures on the Industrial Canal due to Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\u0027The original campus was devastated. In 2007, Holy Cross selected a site for a new campus in Gentilly. Holy Cross remains the only all boys Catholic school in the Greater New Orleans area to offer a comprehensive pre-K through 12th grade education.\u0027The school has a long history dating back to the 1800s when it was originally an orphanage. In 1837, the Congregation of Holy Cross was founded.\u0027The Congregation took its name from a district in the city of LeMans, France – Saint Croix or Holy Cross. In 1849, the Archbishop of New Orleans invited five brothers of the Congregation of Holy Cross to New Orleans to assume responsibility for operating St. Mary\u0027s Orphanage. The city had been devastated by a series of epidemics: cholera, yellow fever, and malaria.\u0027In 1859, the congregation purchased Reynes Farm, a riverfront plantation. In 1879, as the need for the orphanage diminished, St. Isidore\u0027s College, a boarding and day school was opened. This became the original site on which Holy Cross School stood and it is here that Holy Cross\u0027 history officially began. The area has since become a Federal Historic District known as the \u0027Holy Cross District.\u0027\u0027The General Assembly of the state of Louisiana chartered the institution on June 20, 1890, empowering it to confer bachelor\u0027s and master\u0027s degrees. The original administration building was built for $15,000 in 1895. At the suggestion of the Archbishop, St. Isidore\u0027s College was renamed and solemnly dedicated as Holy Cross College.\u0027Two wings were added to the administration building in 1912 to accommodate the incoming students.

Yet despite their ripe old age, caravans are seeing something of a renaissance.‘Today’s caravans are a five-star experience,’ says holiday historian Andrew Jenkinson. ‘You can use them all the year round: modern tourers have full heating systems and double glazing. They are spacious, robust, ingeniously designed and incredibly comfortable. They have evolved.‘A few years ago, they tended to appeal mainly to older people who had fantastic memories of childhood holidays and had never lost the bug — or who wanted to rediscover it,’ says Andrew, author of caravan histories such as The CI Story. ‘But now lots of families are first-timers. Caravanning is enjoying a serious resurgence.’    Modern-day caravan: Yet despite their ripe old age, caravans are seeing something of a renaissance.

A model demonstrates the Mo-bed in 1959 The comeback is driven, Andrew believes, by both the rising cost of holidays abroad and by the popularity of British travel documentaries presented by the likes of Griff Rhys Jones (Griff’s Great Britain) and Julie Walters (Coastal Railways With Julie Walters).Their adventures in the stunning UK countryside are inspiring many to discover what’s on their own doorsteps.Decked out with comfy beds and fancy gadgets, caravanning today is more about comfort rather than getting back to basics.Today’s glitzy state-of-the-art motorhomes can cost well over £100,000.

Pictured is an early rendering by Airbus of the aircraft            Construction finally began in 2002. Pictured is a large section of fuselage being transported by road to the jetliner\u0027s final assembly plant in Toulouse, France          Parts for the A380 are produced across four European countries before being brought to Toulouse to be assembled. Pictured is a section of A380 being loaded on to a ship in Pauillac, France           A380 fuselage and wing sections are put on a freight ship ready to be shipped to Toulouse in October 2004           A barge carries an A380 central fuselage down a river in the French city of Bordeaux in April 2004, during the development and construction of the first superjumbos            A fuselage section for the A380 is moved to the double-deck jetliner\u0027s final assembly facility in Toulouse in October 2004 It was more than 30 years ago in 1988 when the idea for a super-sized 500-seat airliner was first mooted at Airbus. The aim? To directly challenge Boeing\u0027s extremely popular 747.By June 1994, Airbus announced it was to develop a very, very large double-decker airliner, called the A3XX.And six years later the $8.8billion (£6.8billion) project to develop the plane, renamed the A380, began in earnest.After the design of the huge new aircraft was finalised, construction finally began in 2002.          A section of fuselage is unloaded off a ship in Paulliac. A380 parts arrive by ship in Paulliac in France before being loaded on to barges to take them through Bordeaux to a dock at Langon and then by oversize road convoy to the assembly plant          A section of the first A380 fuselage arrives at the final assembly plant in Toulouse in January 2005, just months before the A380\u0027s maiden flight           Inside the Toulouse Airbus plant in January 2005, showing the first three A380s side by side as they are constructed            One of the construction milestones came in January 2005, when the first A380 Rolls-Royce engine was assembled            The first A380 passenger airliner is moved between hangars at the Airbus factory in Toulouse          Team effort: The forward and centre fuselages are made in France, the horizontal tail plane made in Spain and the tails fins and rear fuselages built in Germany          Workers gather in front of the nose cone of an Airbus A380 at the opening ceremony for the new final-assembly plant at Airbus\u0027s Toulouse factory in 2004. At that time, Airbus expected to sell more than 1,000 A380s. Total orders in the end totalled just over 320 The parts for the plane were built across Europe. The wings were constructed in Wales, the forward and centre fuselages made in France, the horizontal tail plane made in Spain and the tails fins and rear fuselages built in Germany.They were then brought by sea, air and road, to the production plant in Toulouse to be assembled. Roads around the plant had to be widened in order for the huge new plane parts to be transported in.The maiden flightAirbus finally unveiled the first five test A380s in Toulouse in 2005 and the first maiden flight took place on April 27 of that year.The giant plane touched down to applause after a flight of just under four hours. Nearly 30,000 spectators watched the behemoth take off and land.          In April 2005 the first A380 was moved from the assembly plant across a busy road to Airbus\u0027s flight test centre at Toulouse-Blagnac Airport           The A380 touches down in Toulouse after its maiden flight on April 27, 2005. The giant plane landed to applause after a flight of just under four hours    Airbus staff and media gather around the A380 after its maiden flight. During the first flight it recorded measurements for 150,000 separate parameters and beamed real-time data back to computers on the ground           The crew on the maiden flight took no chances - they donned parachutes and a handrail was installed inside the test plane leading from the cockpit to an escape door that could have been jettisoned had the pilots lost control. The plane was jointly captained by Claude Lelaie, Airbus\u0027 Senior Vice President Flight Division, and Chief Test Pilot and Vice President Jacques Rosay          Once testing of the aircraft was complete, the A380 went on a world tour. It first came to Britain in 2006 when it appeared at the Farnborough Airshow and flew alongside the RAF\u0027s Red Arrows           In March 2007, the A380 touched down on US soil for the first time, during its world tour. It is pictured landing at New York\u0027s JFK Airport             After landing at JFK, the world\u0027s largest passenger plane was honoured by the New York Fire Department, which sprayed water over the aircraft           While travelling around the US on a world tour, the A380 also made a pit stop in Washington DC. The aircraft is pictured flying across Capitol Hill and the Washington Monument           The A380 flies past the high rise buildings of Hong Kong during its world tour in 2007     The first customer to have an A380 delivered for service was Singapore Airlines.

It now has over 100 A380s in its fleet, making it the biggest customer.Following Singapore\u0027s lead, it created lavish cabins, with first class ticket holders given showers and private suites.Australian flag-carrier Qantas was third to take delivery of the A380 while British Airways received its first A380 in 2013. No US carrier has ever ordered an A380.Problems ariseDespite being launched to much fanfare and receiving orders from 13 different airlines, the A380 has been beset with issues.In November 2010, Qantas Airways and Singapore Airlines temporarily suspended flights of the A380 after an engine failure forced an emergency landing in Singapore.          In November 2010, the Airbus A380 test aircraft flew a special flight over the Pyramids in Egypt following airport compatibility tests carried out at Cairo International Airport to confirm the airport was capable of handling A380 operations           British Airways received its first A380 in July 2013 and on its arrival at Heathrow, BA staff greeted it with Union flags. BA has 12 A380s in its fleet And by July, 2016 Airbus announced that it was cutting production of the A380 in half, going to just one jet a month by 2018.By 2018, Airbus said it would have no other choice but to halt the costly A380 programme if Dubai\u0027s Emirates airline, its biggest customer of the A380, did not place another order.Last year Emirates Airlines struck a $16 billion (£12.3 billion) deal to buy 36 A380s, but it is now switching some orders to the smaller A350.Analysts have pointed to customers demanding flights directly to their destination rather than following Airbus\u0027s model of taking a long haul journey from hub-to-hub followed by a short hop on a smaller plane.          The 100th A380 was bought by Malaysia Airlines and delivered in March 2013          A special celebration was held at the Airbus factory in November 2017 when the 100th A380 for Emirates was handed over       Engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce secures order to build 140 aircraft engines for Emirates | City A.M."},{"url":null,"title":"World Cup hero Gordon Banks missed knighthood officials lost nomination papers","story":"    Gordon Banks (pictured lifting the Jules Rimet in 1966) was considered for a knighthood but bungling officials lost his papers A friend of the late footballer told the Daily Mirror: \u0027The system may well have let Gordon down.\u0027It comes as Sir Philip Green keeps his title despite the fashion tycoon facing claims of racism and harassment.Prime Minister Theresa May has said \u0027steps should be taken\u0027 in Sir Philip\u0027s case as pressure builds for him to be stripped of his knighthood.\u0027I\u0027m glad he saved my header – it started a friendship I\u0027ll...Gordon Banks earned just £100-a-week, lost his eye in a car...Share this articleMr Banks lost his fight against cancer aged 81 this week and campaigners say that had the Government\u0027s Honours Committee not lost his papers, he wouldn\u0027t have missed out by dying before the upcoming Queen\u0027s birthday honours list.  Former Lord Mayor of Stoke Anthony Munday, 59, has been campaigning for the late Leicester star and said: \u0027It is frustrating and disappointing that the system may well have let Gordon down.\u0027          Gordon Banks (pictured) will never be knighted because the honour can\u0027t be given posthumouslyTerry Conroy, who used to play for Stoke, joined Munday to nominate Mr Banks for the honour three years ago.Mr Munday said that each year the honours came along and neither he nor Mr Conroy heard back.He claims that he then had political contacts investigate and was shocked when they reported forms had been \u0027mislaid\u0027.Mr Conroy, 72, said \u0027overtures\u0027 were made and he was told that the matter concerning his former teammate was being looked into. Caroline Tellwright, a Staffordshire farmer, also nominated the goalkeeper independent of the application submitted by Mr Conroy and Mr Munday.  She too was told that the 1966 squad legend was being considered again after both nominations were located.  On Saturday it was revealed that Mr Banks was in the running for a knighthood in June.Mr Conroy visited his old friend two weeks ago and said that he knew then his end was nearing and added there is \u0027no doubt\u0027 he should have been knighted. Ms Tellwright described the late goalkeeper as her \u0027hero\u0027 because of the charity work he carried out in his later years.  The Cabinet Office said it could not comment on the matter because \u0027the nomination process is confidential\u0027.Gordon Banks missed out on knighthood \u0027after Whitehall officials lost papers\u0027 - Mirror Online"},{"url":null,"title":"Vegan activists perform rites ceremonies cattle abattoir","story":"    Vegan activists have begun performing \u0027last rites\u0027 ceremonies for incoming cows at an abattoir run by a major meat processing company.

elephant losing mate 17 years","story":"    Lammie the African elephant has been \u0027lonely\u0027 since her mate of 17 years, Kinkel, died around six months ago, campaigners say          Animal protection groups want to see Lammie moved to a bigger sanctuary where she can be with other elephants Elephants develop strong social group bonds and losing family and peers can result in significant grief and trauma, animal protection groups say. Lammie now spends her days alone in her enclosure without the company of another elephant or any distractions, say campaigners.They say she has little enrichment, not much shade, insufficient water to bathe, appears to listlessly stand at the gate of her elephant house for hours on end and is overweight.  Elephant experts at Humane Society InternationalAfrica, the EMS Foundation and the Elephant Reintegration Trust are concerned for her mental well-being and are urging Johannesburg zoo in South Africa.A rewilding sanctuary willing to offer Lammie a new home with other elephants who would become her new family has been found. But so far the zoo has resisted requests to release Lammie to the sanctuary and has instead suggested it may bring in another elephant to keep her company.           Lammie has been left on her own in her enclosure in Johannesburg Zoo in South Africa          Elephant experts say Lammie has become overweight since her mate of 17 years died and she has been seen standing listlessly at the gate of her enclosure The campaigners will hand a petition of nearly 300,000 signatures to the zoo, urging bosses to transfer Lammie to the sanctuary. A letter of support from 13 of the world\u0027s most renowned elephant conservationists has also been submitted.Harry Potter actress, Evanna Lynch, has added her voice to the campaign along with school children who are backing the mercy mission by sending Valentine\u0027s card to the zoo.  Orphaned by humans encroaching on their land: The

intelligent creatures that it is simply heart-breaking to see them reduced to such pitiful circumstances. \u0027I really hope that the people of Johannesburg zoo will find it in their hearts to let Lammie live with other elephants in a sanctuary, it\u0027s the least she deserves after years of captivity.\u0027Even if another elephant is acquired, the minimum recommended by a number of zoo associations stipulates at least four elephants should be in a grouping.           Actress Evanna Lynch has backed the campaign to get Lammie movedElephant experts at HSIAfrica say only having two elephants does not meet the complex needs of the animals which is why nearly 40 zoos around the world are shutting down their elephant exhibits.Audrey Delsink, wildlife director of Humane Society InternationalAfrica, said: \u0027Elephants are highly intelligent, extremely social, sentient beings with complex family structures and bonds that last a lifetime. \u0027Now that Lammie has lost her companion, she is in desperate need of a happier existence and the chance to live out her years with other elephants. \u0027There is a rewilding sanctuary ready and waiting to offer Lammie a home where she can express normal elephant behaviours and thrive emotionally and physically with a group of elephants who would become her new family. \u0027Acquiring another elephant would simply be repeating the cycle of suffering all over again, and seeing elephants in a sterile environment provides no educational value at all. \u0027There are many zoos around the world recognising the welfare challenges of keeping elephants, so this Valentine\u0027s day we\u0027re urging Johannesburg Zoo to mend Lammie\u0027s broken heart and let her go to a sanctuary where she can spend the rest of her days with others of her kind.\u0027           The Humane Society InternationalAfrica, the EMS Foundation, the Elephant Reintegration Trust and schoolchildren are calling for Lammie to be moved           Schoolchildren have written Valentines Day cards to zoo bosses begging them to move Lammie to a bigger sanctuarySouth Africa\u0027s NSPCA, an animal welfare group, appealed for an end to \u0027the endless and redundant cycle of continuously condemning elephants to captivity for many years to come\u0027.The Johannesburg Zoo says it serves an educational role and hosts visitors from low-income communities who don\u0027t have the means to visit wildlife parks. The case of Lammie, who was born in the zoo, echoes that of Happy, an Asian elephant that has lived at the Bronx Zoo in New York since 1977, including over a decade without another elephant in the same enclosure. Some activists say Happy should go to a sanctuary with other elephants, but the zoo said in 2016 that she is \u0027healthy and comfortable,\u0027 has bonded with the people who care for her and has \u0027tactile and auditory contact\u0027 with the zoo\u0027s other two

My daughter\u0027s first husband was having an affair with an ex and they split up.\u0027His mother wrote to her asking her for £395 for the orce fee. I couldn\u0027t possibly tell you her reply, not even on twitter.\u0027Speaking today Ms Doyle said: \u0027I\u0027m actually a bit embarrassed about what was said.

Even sitting by the engines at takeoff, you didn’t need to raise your voice on the A380 superjumbo. The quiet was almost eerie.It was a monstrous double-decker so big it felt like travelling in two planes stuck on top of one other. It was a kind of cruise ship of the skies with staircases, bars and private first-class cabins, spilling out a wave passengers when it landed at airports. And yet, when you were onboard, it somehow managed to feel delicate.When I took the first public flight on the Airbus A380 in Toulouse in 2007, I remember staring out of the window over the Pyrenees, thinking something was odd. It was the lighting. It felt less like being in a plane than in a strange kind of conference centre. The windows were bigger, letting in more natural light, and there were special light systems to alter cabin mood.For that two-hour flight over south-west France – the first time the media had been able to film inside the most complex passenger plane ever built – I watched company bosses and journalists stretching their legs by nipping up and down the staircases linking the two decks than ran the entire length of the plane. Flight attendants said they were glad to have larger floor space in which to work. There was more height above your head and it felt airy.It was also smooth. Air turbulence and movement didn’t seem to register. It almost felt as if you were standing on solid ground while being in the air. In surveys, passengers would later approve of it, praising its quiet, comfort and spaciousness.Technologically it was a success, even though economically it failed to get off the ground."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49ac8b40bd45b215671f5db7927b770b09cb3871/0_56_2800_1681/master/2800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b779d3a01864b3f0198ca6edfe884fb7","title":"a380 airbus to end production of superjumbo","story":"Firm makes ‘painful’ decision to end production of the planes in 2021 – putting UK jobs at riskAirbus has announced it will end production of its A380 superjumbo passenger jet after failing to secure orders – a move that puts UK jobs at risk.The European aerospace group said it had made the “painful” decision to stop making the world’s largest superjumbo in 2021 after Emirates, the A380’s biggest customer, reduced an outstanding order for 53 planes to only 14.Emirates will instead order 70 of the smaller A330 and A350 aircraft, underlining the trend towards smaller, more efficient aircraft that made the A380 unsustainable.The cancellation of the A380 will affect the jobs of as many as 3,500 Airbus staff, including about 300 at its factory in Broughton, north Wales, which constructs the model’s wings.The Broughton site has about 6,000 employees, while there are another 3,000 in Filton, near Bristol some of whom work on landing gear and fuel systems for the A380. However, Airbus said a “significant number” of staff will move to production of other, more popular models and major job losses in the UK are not expected as a result of the announcement.Rhys McCarthy, the national officer for aerospace at Unite, said the union is seeking assurances from Airbus that there will be no job losses. He added that companies in the A380 supply chain, including Redditch-based GKN, are a “key concern”.Tom Enders, Airbus’s outgoing chief executive, said the cancellation was “painful for us”. He said: “We have no substantial A380 backlog and hence no basis to sustain production, despite all our sales efforts with other airlines in recent years.”Speaking at Airbus’s headquarters in Toulouse, France, Enders said the effect on jobs in the UK “needs to be evaluated”. He said: “Hopefully we can reuse and redeploy a significant number of employees there.“What we’re seeing here is the end of the large, four-engine aircraft,” said Enders, who admitted that the company was a decade late in developing the superjumbo. Boeing, Airbus’s American arch-rival, this month celebrated 50 years of production of its 747.Engines for the A380 are produced in Derby by Rolls-Royce, another major British aerospace employer, although it is thought that the effect on UK jobs numbers will be small.In a statement, Chris Cholerton, Rolls-Royce’s civil aerospace president, said: “The A380 is a world-class feat of engineering, much loved by passengers, and we are obviously saddened that deliveries will come to an end.”Airbus said that more than 190 million passengers have flown in the A380 since the first plane rolled off the assembly line in Toulouse, France, in 2007. However, the plane, which can theoretically carry as many as 800 passengers, has struggled for profitability as demand for mid-sized jets boomed.However, the A380 cancellation will add another element of uncertainty for the future of UK operations already threatened by the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. Enders last month decried “Brexiteers’ madness”, saying that future investment decisions would be influenced if Brexit led to significant trade frictions.Enders on Thursday said he believed the “voices of reason” would prevail, avoiding a no-deal Brexit. In June last year Airbus said there would be a cost of €1bn (about £880m) for every week of delay in production. The company and its suppliers have built up buffer stocks of about €1bn, in line with estimates made in June.Enders said: “Looking at the situation as it is I’m still optimistic that a solution can be found that avoids a fall from a cliff.”The end of the A380 may free up space at Airbus’s Toulouse and Hamburg facilities, where final assembly is currently carried out, giving them a boost in the competition for business with the UK. However, Enders denied reports that Spain had made a formal offer to take wing production from the UK after Brexit.The end of the A380 comes at a crucial time for Airbus as it takes on a new leadership team after losing out to Boeing in the aircraft deliveries race in 2018. Guillaume Faury, a former helicopter engineer who became the president of Airbus’s commercial aircraft business in February 2018, will take over from Enders as chief executive in April.Faury said the risks from Brexit were “enormous” in both the short and long term, with the principal risk to Airbus coming in delays at the UK’s border with the rest of the EU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4af4cc84ca81e178320b1363aef9b7a527e3002f/0_0_4155_2493/master/4155.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b674b79cbdb25a0a0a16b4d89c3dd742","title":"cat ladders a creative solution for felines in flats in pictures","story":"Strategically placed ramps and ladders for urban cats are all the rage in Bern.

We’re still waitingHow do I know? Every time I look in a mirror, a brown person stares back at me. If I were to compare the color of my arms to that of a brown paper bag, I wouldn’t find much difference. But also, when it’s dark outside and I’m walking by myself, white people sometimes cross the street to avoid passing me. Then there are the repeated occasions when I’ve been mistaken for a taxi driver or a drugstore clerk, just because I’m standing beside a parked car or buying deodorant. And while it’s true that I’m not so dark that automated soap dispensers can’t see me, I’m also invisible in a more fundamental way in the United States.Why? Because the US census refuses to recognize me.There is a lot of talk about “black and brown people” these days, but did you know that “brown” is not one of the five official races listed on the census? Those five are: white black or African American American Indian or Alaska Native Asian and Native Hawaiian or other Pacific islander. These categories are, to be frank, incoherent when considered together, a mishmash of skin color, indigeneity, and geography.America’s racial categories have changed over time, mostly because our notion of what constitutes racial difference changes over time. Back in 1890, the census wanted to know if you were “quadroon” (a quarter black ancestry) or “octoroon” (an eighth black ancestry). For the 1920, 1930, and 1940 censuses, “Hindu” was a racial category. There have also been forward-thinking developments. Starting with the 2000 census, anyone can now check more than one race, which is progress. And yet brown is still absent.As a brown-skinned Arab American, I feel slighted by this omission. But the Latinx community is arguably the biggest loser in this case. By law, the census (and all federal statistical agencies) must follow the standards on race and ethnicity established by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and since 1997, the OMB has hewn to this list of five. In 2000, the census began to use a two-question format. The first question asked everyone about possible Hiic heritage (the wording has slightly changed over the years), and the second asked about race.“Some other race” is now the third-largest racial category in the United States.No doubt some people will find this fact comforting, as if it might herald the imminent arrival of an anti-racist America. (Incidentally, the research shows that the more “color blind” you believe you are, the more racist you tend to be.) But the census doesn’t make America racist. America’s history and its present do that work – and until we’ve arrived at a point where racism doesn’t exist, it makes sense to collect the most reliable statistics on race in the country to understand how racism works and what its effects really are. Since “some other race” is not one of the five official categories, its utility is severely limited. Each “some other race” selection is typically converted by the Census Bureau into one or more of the five recognized categories, making the census far less accurate and responsive than it could – or should – be.And an accurate census matters. A lot. The census is a powerful instrument used to reapportion congressional seats and electoral college votes. Political districts are drawn on the basis of the census. Everything from healthcare to highway construction uses its data. Accuracy in the census is necessary to the partitioning of over $800bn of annual federal funding, including to school lunch programs, section 8 housing, and Medicaid. Census data are key to designing community-level programs and enforcing civil-rights protections.So finding yourself in the census is important. And, although our situations are similar (and both groups are undercounted by the census), my problem is different than the one the Latinx community faces. Many Latinxs don’t see their worlds reflected in the census as it now stands. I, on other hand, am forced to choose a reality that isn’t my own.According to the OMB’s classifications, “white” refers to “a person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or north Africa.” My origins are from Egypt. Every day, I live my life in America as a brown person. Defining me as white and likening me to a European, as the census does, is absurd.As with the Latinx community, people from the Middle East and north Africa can often fit within multiple racial categories. But to compel everyone from the Middle East and north Africa to select “white” on the census is to force us to participate in our own official erasure.Or think about hate crimes. Even though the FBI has published statistics on hate crimes since the early 1990s, the bureau began providing data on anti-Arab hate crimes only in 2015, when reporting expanded to eight new categories (such as anti-Sikh and anti-Mormon bias crimes). The Arab American Institute has since found that the FBI intended to publish anti-Arab hate crime data from the beginning, but, in 1992, the OMB recommended removing anti-Arab hate crimes from official data collections to follow federal standards related to race and ethnicity. This was the only time that a category has ever been removed from FBI hate-crimes data collection.Arabs Americans: different enough to hate. Not different enough to count.For over 30 years, Arab Americans have been advocating a change to the census that would properly identify us, providing people from the Middle East and north Africa recognition and the country a more accurate tally regarding our numbers and our situation here. (The Arab American Institute estimates there are 3.7 million Arab Americans in the country, while government numbers have us at 2.1 million.)Meanwhile, the Census Bureau, through redesign and extensive testing, has also been searching for better ways to represent the complicated multiplicity of the country. Working closely with experts and community organizations, the Census Bureau has recommended major changes for the 2020 census. The changes would bring race and ethnicity together in a single question, accounting for how intertwined the two are in America today. “Hiic, Latino, or Spanish” would be included alongside the five pre-existing racial categories. People could still check multiple boxes. And a new category of “Middle Eastern or north African” (Mena) would include people from Turkey, Iran, and Israel.These proposed revisions would have gone a long way toward elegantly addressing many of the issues in the count. But the Trump administration got involved.It should surprise no one that the administration ruined decades of good work. Not only did it reject the above suggestions, but it suddenly added a citizenship question to the decennial count over the objections of the Census Bureau. Many believed the administration’s aim was to suppress an accurate count of non-citizens and Hiics. This undercount would translate “into a loss of political power and funds, among other harms,” in the words of Judge Jesse Furman, who ruled against the government in mid-January. The administration is expected to appeal.“The administration is playing politics with something that is just too important to get wrong,” Maya Berry, the executive director of the Arab American Institute, which works closely with the Census Bureau, told me. “There’s a real cost in people’s lives when you don’t have accurate data about their communities.”From its beginnings in 1790 until today, the US census has never simply reflected who we are. Rather, it produces a picture of who we are based on the very categories those in power have chosen. I, like millions of others, have waited for decades to see my reality in America counted. We’re still waiting."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f8d38ce76bbd5f66d6a3bbe4d831ae78cb887fb/0_202_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca457f446c9934c6c72b3c939ddd004d","title":"happiness health housing job security uk citizens","story":"For some time, sensible people have been arguing that governments need to focus less on economic growth and more on the wellbeing of citizens. Be careful what you wish for.In response to this demand, from 2011 David Cameron instructed the Office for National Statistics to gather data on people’s self-reported happiness and life satisfaction. Little practical good has come from this so far, but a new report by George Bangham for the Resolution Foundation is one of the best attempts to make useful sense of the data. He concludes: “The best prospects for policymakers targeting future increases in national wellbeing lie in raising job quality, raising incomes, particularly at the lower end, and policies to improve security in the housing market.”But I doubt Bangham is a happy man today, because almost all the media coverage has more or less ignored all this worthy, vaguely leftist stuff and instead latched on to the finding that people are happiest at ages 16 and 70.Such misplaced attention is par for the course. People are fascinated by how factors such as age, genes, gender, sexuality, weight, diet and ethnicity might determine happiness. Focusing on factors such as these also allows us to neatly depoliticise the issue. Some of these factors are things we have no control over, licensing us to resign ourselves to fate. The rest are things we are able to take some personal control over, which makes us feel empowered but also less compassionate towards those who refuse to do the right thing – and less inclined to make governments take their share of responsibility for wellbeing.But as the author and academic Michael Marmot’s groundbreaking 2010 report, Fair Society Healthy Lives, has shown, many of the most important determinants of wellbeing have nothing to do with personal choice or destiny. Rather, they are social and, as such, inescapably political.Two years after Marmot’s report, a new tube map of London was created to highlight inequality in the capital: among its striking findings was that along the Jubilee line, life expectancy falls from 86 in Westminster to 79 in Canning Town – roughly a year for every stop travelled east. This is explained purely by socioeconomic factors.Even the age correlation turns out to be inextricably linked to politics, despite the fact that no political party can make a difference to your date of birth. The happiness of pensioners is not just a function of their age, but of policy. On average, 70-year-old boomers today are the most affluent retirees in history, often owning their own homes and in receipt of generous pensions. People of 70 are not going to be as content in 30 or 40 years’ time if they are unable to retire, don’t own their homes and have small incomes. The flourishing of pensioners today is not biological destiny, but the fruit of decades of public policy.However, the age-related findings do shine some light on what we need to do to increase life satisfaction. In one way, the statistical equating of the quantity of happiness of 16- and 70-year-olds obscures the ways in which the quality of that happiness is completely different. A teenager’s joy is rooted in an exciting balance between innocence and experience, actuality and potentiality. An older person’s contentment is usually connected with an end of striving and quieter appreciation of what they have done and what they still can do. This should remind us that life satisfaction is a complex issue and could never be captured on a simple scale of one to 10.However, there is one respect in which teens and recent retirees are remarkably similar. Compared to other age groups, they tend to inhabit a sweet spot of having high degrees of both freedom and carefreeness. The typical 16-year-old has new freedoms without ever having had any serious responsibilities. The typical 70-year-old, having experienced a lifetime of work and family duties, has a very different kind of freedom, one born from relief.It should not surprise us to find that people tend to be happier when they have fewer worries. But this, too, has important political implications. If the government is really interested in raising gross national happiness, it has to make sure as many citizens as possible feel secure in their health, their housing and their incomes. Different states’ records in achieving this is one important reason why Nordic countries repeatedly score highly in international life satisfaction surveys and North America underperforms relative to its GDP.Whichever way you look at it, there is no escaping the conclusion that increasing wellbeing across society requires joined-up, long-term policy efforts. This is exactly what the Resolution Foundation recommends. Contrary to the headlines, the study does not show that the secret of happiness is to be 16 or 70. It is that wellbeing flourishes when people have freedom and security. A correct reading of the wellbeing data puts the ball very much in the government’s court.• Julian Baggini is a writer and philosopher"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa51401ba97e6e1111d3adc5150c8defe232dc28/0_131_4850_2910/master/4850.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee31d35ad7476de8a19371e1a0b093a0","title":"shamima begum grooming islamic state pregnant uk","story":"Four years after joining Islamic State in Syria, she is now 19 and pregnant. She should be allowed back to the UKIt’s impossible not to feel a jolt of shock when confronted with the photo of Shamima Begum on the front page of this morning’s Times. Four years ago – when we last saw her – it was accepted that Begum had been brainwashed. There was consensus that she was an innocent child who’d been groomed online. Begum was allowed to be the victim in the nation’s narrative – one that over decades had grasped the power and dangers of grooming – because that demanded nothing from us. She was the little girl who’d been caught up in a dangerous death cult the pixelated image of a kid caught on CCTV about to fly, and that was sad.It was also made easier by her absence. We only needed to empathise with Begum’s situation in the abstract. Of course, we wanted her to be rescued and returned to Britain immediately. But that was just a fantasy. I can’t have been alone in assuming these girls would simply meet a horrible fate in the fighting abroad. Having been found alive and nine months pregnant in a Syrian refugee camp, Begum is no longer an abstract concept. Instinctively it feels a little harder to say we should bring her back to her home in the United Kingdom – especially given her apparent lack of remorse. And yet is she not still a victim of grooming? Still a British citizen we should be looking to help? There are already those arguing that since Begum left the UK to join Islamic State four years ago her situation has changed entirely. Ex counter-terrorism chief Mark Rowley told the Today programme on Radio 4 this morning that when Begum was 15 he considered her a victim. Now she is an adult what happens next, he argued, should be determined by clinical risk assessment and the consideration of cold, hard facts. He wants us to separate those grainy images of a young girl from the crisp picture of the woman she is today.But to see Begum in isolation to past events serves no purpose. The brainwashed child she was has everything to do with the brainwashed young woman she has become. That’s not to justify what she has done, but to see the series of events that have unfolded in her life as being traceable directly back to her grooming and subsequent radicalisation. Children are influenced by those around them, a product of their environment. We only develop and learn to be better when another influence takes a bad one’s place. Since the age of 15 Begum has not been afforded that opportunity in the caliphate it is unsurprising her views continue to be as dangerous as when she left – they’ve become her norm.If she seems untroubled by the violence she has witnessed, that’s no more a sign of a callous and wicked villain than a vulnerable young woman who is profoundly scarred. We know that trauma in childhood impacts your experiences as you grow older. I can’t begin to imagine what she has seen in her life, what it’s like to have had two children die. What we told ourselves about that 15-year-old girl remains true to this day, except now helping this young woman requires more than just easy words.That’s not to say Begum is to receive a hero’s welcome back at Gatwick airport. To rehabilitate and reintegrate her back into society will take much work by dedicated professionals, be in no doubt. But to try to help her must be better than leaving this teenager to languish in a camp, to quite possibly witness her third child die. If rehabilitation proves impossible, at least back in Britain she can live under supervision and be kept from doing further harm – to herself or to others. And should, one day soon, Begum be in a position to rejoin British society proper, who could be better placed to warn other vulnerable children of the dangerous reality of online grooming, of radicalisation by extremists and the acts that led her to commit?

I travelled a lot and when I was away rented my house out on Airbnb.So, during the summer, on one of my rare nights home, I decided to host a small party for my neighbours to thank them for putting my bins out, and keeping an eye on the place. But also I wanted to get to know them.It was a hot, stormy evening and we set up the party under the carport. The evening started innocuously enough – then one bottle of prosecco down, the neighbour who lived in the house behind mine said, “I hope you don’t mind, but you had some guests recently that were a bit strange.”My heart sank. My Airbnb guests. Randoms from the internet. What had they done?“I don’t usually look out my window into your backyard,” she said by way of caveat. “But I glanced down and something caught my eye.”My neighbour, a retired teacher, tried to be polite as possible but it was obvious what she had seen was my guests having sex, in my backyard, in the middle of the day.I looked out, past the carport, to my backyard – it was a horrible sight.There was a rusty clothes line, dried grass, weeds and thistles. It was ugly, not to mention uncomfortable.“What did they do?” I asked, appalled. “No, wait, don’t tell me what they did!”Ronald, a man in his 80s who lives around the corner, started waving his arms around. “Them! Them! I saw your backyard when I was bringing your bins in!”The whole party joined in – talking about them.“They were really going for it. In the backyard. He was really old and she was really young. I thought it was your brother,” said Ronald.My brother is not old. Also, he did not have sex in my backyard.“It wasn’t my brother,” I said. “It was my Airbnb guests. I’m so sorry!!!”My mother, who was also at the party, was doing a calculation in her head. “Was this around a month ago?”“I came to the house on the Monday, after they had been here and had to strip the beds. And”– everyone leaned in at this fresh horror – “I found a pair of undies!”My neighbours squealed. Mum mimed the movement you make when you pick a dirty pair of undies up with a stick.“Eugh!” said all the neighbours. “Undies!”My mum then mimed hurling the undies into a distant field – similar to someone throwing a javelin.“I’m sorry you had to do that, mum,” I said.My neighbours were such innocents. Why did I have to taint this piece of rural paradise with these weird, horny guests?“It’s OK,” said my neighbour who had seen the sex acts.“Worse thing have happened here,” said Ronald.I looked around. All my neighbours were nodding.Ronald pointed to where I had placed the cheeseboard. “A person who lived here was shot, by police, right where we are now.”“In the garage?”Ronald pointed at the cheese.All the neighbours were explaining it at once, but it made no sense. A previous owner who liked “staying up all night on the internet” came under police suspicion. Police came up to the house in the middle of night, and hearing strange noise, the man came out carrying a baseball bat.He was confronted by police – who shot him.The entire scenario confused me. “That makes no sense – I am on the internet at night, it’s not suspicious … Did he die?”But the conversation had moved on. Ronald was telling my neighbours that before they had moved into their house, a murderer lived there, and had gone to jail for killing someone and shoving their body down a disused mine shaft.Then those neighbours said to me that actually they didn’t mind that I was away so much – the house was quiet, because previously the tenants were “on drugs and listened to loud music day and night”.“What sort of music?”“Heavy metal.” The police were also frequent visitors to that set of tenants.We were working our way through the cheese and a second bottle of wine. The neighbours were happy and laughing. They were having so much fun – it was so great to get to know each other.But now I knew so much more about my neighbourhood. Too much. The carport, previously a place I hadn’t given much thought to – a neutral space – was the site of great violence. In my mind’s eye I saw the glow of the computer screen (“he was up all night on the internet”) the dark shape of the baseball bat (who has a baseball bat, anyway?) and heard the shot ring out.How could I continue to live here?The storm came in properly now. There was lightning and rain sheeted into the carport. Packing up and bringing things into the house, I stood at the threshold and felt the weight of all that had come before.The neighbours came in, the house had been recently renovated. It was clean and bright.“Oh it looks lovely, the new reno,” said one. “It’s like a different house!”• Brigid Delaney is a columnist for  Australia"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c5dc4b82db688a4b99d124fa4f1a1627e6ecbf6/0_5_3398_2040/master/3398.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42dd62a2b189143299ee55e5d99bd9e0","title":"samantha bee fox news green new deal","story":"Late-night hosts are worn out from another round of Fox News panic and Trump’s reaction to the budget billLate-night hosts discussed the Green New Deal, Fox News and the bill to avert another government shutdown.It has been a week since a few members of Congress, fronted by star representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, introduced the Green New Deal, and the plan to fight climate change has left many Republicans apoplectic. With lines such as “Hide your cows, hide your travel plans”, the loudest criticism has aired on Fox News, “where you can always count on thoughtful analysis based on solid scientific thinking”, said Samantha Bee. For instance, she pointed to a viral clip of a Fox \u0026amp Friends anchor admitting that he hadn’t washed his hands in 10 years, because “germs are not a real thing. I can’t see them, therefore they’re not real.”“The people at Fox should really be worried about working with patient zero here,” said Bee. Instead, they’re “soiling themselves over the Green New Deal”.Bee admitted that many of the ambitious Green New Deal’s proposals – including an overhaul of America’s transportation system, free higher education and a goal of net-zero emissions – will never pass, “but the plan’s aggressive, even radical goals are bringing much-needed attention to climate change”.Furthermore, she argued, it’s not crazy to use the government to do something big and seemingly ridiculous. She pointed to John F Kennedy’s pledge in 1961 to put a man on the moon by the end of the decade. “It sounded crazy but we dedicated our fullest resources to it, and our hard work paid off eight years later when we managed to convincingly fake the moon landing,” she said, referring to a widespread (and false) conspiracy theory.But in all seriousness, Bee said, “if we don’t act soon to keep our planet livable, we’ll have to figure out a way to send all 8 billion of us to the actual moon”.Seth Meyers also took a serious look at Fox News on Late Night, turning to Donald Trump’s appearance with Fox host Laura Ingraham on Tuesday. The president told Ingraham that he didn’t yet have an opinion on the bipartisan budget deal because, scheduling-wise, “it was between the deal and you, and I had to choose you”.To be clear, Meyers explained: “He literally said: ‘I had a choice between running the government and going on Fox News and I chose Fox News.’ No quote has ever summed up Trump’s presidency better than that.”As for talking about the deal’s specifics, Trump had, as usual, “all the specificity of a Real Housewives promo”, Meyers said.Meyers then dispensed with the jokes. “Every few months we have to go through this exhausting ritual where we pretend the president actually knows what he’s talking about even though it’s clear he doesn’t,” he said. It’s pointless to argue with someone who can’t agree on shared conditions of reality, he continued. “Trump spends all day digesting lies from Fox News, and Fox News in turn reinforces his alternate reality.”The ridiculous dysfunction of American government seemed to even wear out Stephen Colbert, who kicked off Wednesday’s Late Show with a profuse thank you to his audience and a period of reflection on what, exactly, the point of all this is. The show usually helps him process the day’s news and “think about what it means”, which made Wednesday “tough because the one thing everyone is talking about” – whether or not Trump would sign a budget deal to keep the government open – “doesn’t mean anything”.No significant legislation has passed recently, Colbert noted – no infrastructure bill, or immigration bill, or a fix for skyrocketing healthcare costs. And yet, “we’re celebrating, or supposed to be celebrating, that they’re close to a deal to achieve the absolute minimum: having a government”, Colbert said.“That is like celebrating that you’re child finally used the potty on his first day of medical school.”Instead we have an executive branch of kabuki theatre in which Trump doubts he will sign the necessary budget bill while aides quietly reassure that he will after making “the dance to get to yes”, according to a report.At least, Colbert noted, such a dance is a “refreshing change from Trump’s usual MO: the grope to get past ‘no’”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/363479e1f60acb4d367c02f9cc4225c7433579ae/0_74_4841_2904/master/4841.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=259fbdb45237101060f1a4be4b17ba85","title":"i love calling out politicians xiuhtezcatl martinez on the teenage stand against climate change","story":"Eighteen-year-old activist Xiuhtezcatl Martinez is among those suing the Trump administration for climate inaction. Now he’s asking more students to get involved by joining the school strikesUniversity students should support “badass” teenagers who skip school to strike for climate action by walking out of lectures alongside them, a leading youth activist has said. In recent months more than 20,000 children have skipped school across Germany, Belgium, Switzerland and Australia, demanding governments and politicians do more to limit the effects of global warming. There are more strikes planned in the coming months.Xiuhtezcatl Martinez, 18, global youth director of Earth s, and one of 21 young people suing the Trump administration for failing to combat climate change, says his peers are now at the “head of the table” when it comes to climate activism and that more of them should take part in walkouts.So far, school children have taken a lead on strikes, but the first UK-wide strike on Friday asks young people of all ages to take part.“It would be pretty cool if uni students walk out in solidarity with Greta,” Martinez says, referring to Greta Thunberg, the Swedish 16-year-old who sparked the strikes when she refused to go to school. “If a worldwide movement can do that, it would be crazy.”Martinez is from Boulder, Colorado and of indigenous heritage. He has been campaigning for environmental justice since he was six and regularly speaks on campuses across America. He’s addressed world leaders at the United Nations (UN) and given TED talks on the topic. He’s also a hip-hop artist, using music to promote his activism, and has recently written songs with Jaden Smith, another vocal activist for the climate. “I see this movement is more global, more connected, more erse, younger, and more intergenerational than ever before,” he says. “We’re one of the last generations that will have the chance to lead the way on this.”The next 10 years are crucial we have just over a decade to limit a climate change catastrophe, a landmark report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned in October. Meanwhile scientists say we’re in the middle of what is likely to be the warmest 10 years since records began in 1850.Martinez reckons his generation “thinks differently”, having grown up in a changing, turbulent world. “We have a greater understanding of technology because we grew up with it.” Plus there’s now a strong sense of urgency to act before it’s “too late”.A descendent of Meshika or Aztec people, he says he grew up with an appreciation of nature and the environment. “My dad taught me everything we do is in honour of our ancestors,” he says. Martinez was homeschooled until he was 10, and as a result learned “ancient poems and prayers” while “other kids were learning nursery rhymes”.But he’s not lacking in confidence. “I love calling out politicians,” he says. He and the 21 other young activists aged between 11 and 22 are “turning to the courts” as a “powerful force” where politicians have failed, suing the US federal government over climate change.This week Donald Trump, who has previously said global warming is a hoax invented by China to attack US manufacturing, failed to address the issue in his State of the Union address. Since becoming president, he has also withdrawn the US from the Paris climate agreement, in effect ensuring the world’s second largest emitter of greenhouse gases quit the international effort to address global warming.With powerful enemies, Martinez sometimes feels the pressure. “There have been moments when I’ve just wanted to go to high school and be a normal kid,” he says. It’s not just politicians he’s up against. “It’s some of the biggest industries in the world, from the pharmaceutical industry, to the agriculture industry, to the prison industrial complex to the fossil fuel industry, and we might lose.”That’s why young people must stand together and continue to demand politicians pay attention, whether through strikes, legal action or “however it is you connect with the world”. Students should push for universities to est from fossil fuels and should join school strikers. “Greta Thunberg is a real badass, and now university students have to step up too. Not everyone is outspoken, but we all have a significant part to play,” he says. “So channel your fear, channel your hurt and channel your hatred into action.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a78938ac2710ad76dd0fd5fee401d4aa1d4a336c/0_43_5417_3250/master/5417.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=633166e8941d1791f4862f1b98f7dbcd","title":"uk pupils climate change strike headteachers unions schools","story":"Unions urge pupils not to walk out of class but some schools may adopt relaxed attitudeSchool leaders are having to wrestle with their consciences over pupils joining the nationwide climate strike to be held on Friday afternoon, caught between their duties as teachers and instincts as educators.Thousands of the more than 8 million school pupils in the UK are expected to walk out of lessons to show their concern about the threat of escalating climate change.Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat education spokeswoman and a former science teacher, said she will be joining a rally in Oxford and urged school leaders to accommodate pupils who join the protests.“As a former teacher I absolutely understand the frustrations that teachers and schools may have with these strikes. However, I would describe this as a teachable moment,” said Moran, the MP for Oxford West and Abingdon.“I hope schools, colleges and universities see this in the positive light it is meant and equally hope those students act sensibly with making sure adults know where they are and making up the missed work.”But the National Association of Head Teachers, which last week offered some support for those joining the strike, gave a more hard-headed assessment to its members as the day of the action approached.“Pupils should only be out of school in exceptional circumstances. Whilst NAHT supports the right of young people to express themselves, first and foremost, pupils should be in school during term time,” the union said.“While a school leader’s role is to ensure children attend school, are kept safe and receive a good quality of education, it is right that inidual school leaders can decide how best to respond to any proposed protest by students in their school on Friday.”Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT teaching union, said young people were right to be concerned about climate change but warned that teachers had genuine safeguarding issues to consider.“It’s not appropriate for pupils to just walk out of school. The young people organising this are potentially putting themselves and others at risk by simply walking out of school,” Keates said.“Teachers take their responsibility for pupils welfare during the school day seriously and while they may have sympathy for the cause will not be able to condone pupils just walking out.“A well-planned, accessible demonstration of young people at a weekend or during a holiday would enable thousands to participate and be a powerful protest.”The Department for Education’s guidance says unauthorised absences must be recorded as part of safeguarding, but gives room for headteachers to approve absences in “exceptional circumstances”.The organisers have written form letters for the parents of those wanting to take part, which argue that protesting qualifies as civic engagement and climate change is an exceptional circumstance.With the strike taking place on the final day before half-term holidays in many parts of England, some schools may adopt a relaxed attitude. But others have already informed their students any absence will be noted as unauthorised.Geoff Barton, a former secondary school headteacher who now leads the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “While we understand the strength of feeling over the very important issue of climate change, we would urge pupils against walking out of school on Friday.“It is extremely disruptive for a school to have to deal with unauthorised absences and pupils will be missing out on important learning time.”The day of action follows the example of Greta Thunberg, a 15-year-old Swedish schoolgirl who began protesting outside her country’s parliament in August. Her solo effort has since grown and spread to countries around the world including Germany and Australia.In a letter to the , more than 200 UK academics said they offered “full support” to the school strikers. “They have every right to be angry about the future that we shall bequeath to them, if proportionate and urgent action is not taken,” it said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92e0791abd4dfc3836cc8d96304a6fa2e16f2067/0_37_5600_3360/master/5600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45333e55e8532c3a116d1b10d4a030bd","title":"tell us about the outfit you loved wearing the most","story":"We’d like you to send in photos of your favourite ‘look’ and share your memories of when you wore itThe clothes we choose to wear can impact our mood, and leave a lasting impression on our memories.

I don’t think people fully appreciate how difficult it can be to have two nationalities in football and the kind of stigma that can come with it – especially for someone who is only 20. Rice broached the issue of respect for his dual heritage so eloquently and honestly in his public statement, which I am sure will bring him respect for his decision in return.There will be a lot of Irish fans who were disappointed and offended by his decision but for me it is not necessarily a question of choosing an allegiance. There is an eitheror culture in football that is polarising. Many believe it is about picking a side and sticking with it but when your heritage is essentially both it is difficult. For example, I’m both British and Nigerian. In the same way as someone like Adam Lallana has family roots in Spain. If you dig a little deeper there are so many English players with Welsh or Scottish heritage. We’re not just one dimensional. Raheem Sterling is another example. He is proud of his Jamaican roots but plays for England and is proud of that too.Rice has played three times for the Republic in friendlies but he grew up in England and is choosing with his head and his heart. He is well within his rights to make that choice under the regulations, even if some people might look at it cynically and say he has made a calculated decision to play for a country who usually do much better in tournaments. But let’s say he was offered the chance to leave West Ham and play for a bigger club such as Manchester United, Manchester City or Liverpool, there would not be the same outcry. What is the difference?Perhaps I’m just looking at an emotional topic of nationality too objectively. I know people see representing one’s country as very different to playing for your club but it’s not like Rice has chosen to play for Brazil because they are the best team in the world. He is as English as he is Irish and has chosen to play for England. Does it make you more English because you are born in England? Are we going to start tracing bloodlines now to decide whether a player should or should not represent their country? I struggle to understand why many in football get so upset about dual nationality.Rice is being open and essentially saying, “well, actually I’ve got a bit of a choice to make here” as he would do if a bigger club came in for him. If he is choosing England for whatever reason, then it’s a valid choice. It’s part of him and would be if he chose Ireland over England. I understand the problem with countries who go looking for players with looser generational ties in an attempt to improve their team, like has happened in other sports. This is slightly bending the rules and cherry-picking talent from around the world. However, when there is a genuine affiliation to a country where you have been raised then it’s a different matter.This a tricky issue because ultimately it’s a question of identity. Being of Nigerian heritage, I can understand Rice’s situation and can relate to the battle between dual nationality both in life and in the context of football.I didn’t have that benefit of choice because I was called up to my first England squad when I was 14 and the Nigeria women’s team did not really have the structure back then to select me. On the other hand, my brother, Sone Aluko, played for the Super Eagles even though he was born and raised in Birmingham.It can be difficult for players who are perceived to have turned their backs on England, as Wilfried Zaha has found out after deciding to play for Ivory Coast. I remember Jack Grealish got a lot of abuse on social media and even from fellow professionals such as Jack Wilshere when he was weighing up the same choice as Rice. There is still this perception in football about whether people are “English through and through”. Essentially there is not any such thing without going into a whole discussion on genetics and bloodlines of each player.Grealish is from an Irish background but, like me, was raised in Birmingham. I believe, much like the maturity of Rice’s statement, there needs to be a much more mature attitude in football towards players who have dual nationality and respect their choices as legitimate choices without the cynical perception that comes with it. Ultimately you can be both – Rice could have chosen to play for the Republic or he could have chosen to play for England and it’s up to him which is best for his career after consulting his family, who I am sure have dual allegiance too.Whatever national anthem that inidual chooses to sing, we have to respect that. In this case, the Republic are the ones who lose out but I’m sure Ireland will always remain a part of Declan Rice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5475818436528473eedcd85368e98f5e09f1b90a/0_201_2824_1694/master/2824.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77e132e7eb5daecda9b31772e1eb4f6e","title":"bate borisov v arsenal europa league last 32 first leg live","story":"37 min Maitland-Niles’s cross takes a deflection and loops beyond the far post to his fellow wing-back Kolasinac.

But, (wait for it...), if anyone can do it, (I’m really sorry...), Xhaka can. Xhaka can. I’m here all week. Try the kluski.”When that email started I honestly thought you were going to start singing ‘Iwobi’ to the tune of Madonna’s Erotica, so I feel like the rest of us got off lightly.18 min In the first few minutes it looked like Arsenal would run away with this match, but it’s more of a contest now. Arsenal have probably had 70-75 per cent of the possession. Bate look pretty well organised defensively now that the match has settled down.14 min Bate are playing like the away side, sitting deep and springing onto the counter-attack. 13 min ... which leads to a chance on the counter for Bate. They break three on three after a mistake from Guendouzi, and Stavysh forces a save from Cech with a stinging shot from a very tight angle on the right edge of the area.12 min Kolasinac plays in Iwobi, who tries to flick the ball over the advancing keeper. It bounces over his foot, hits the thigh of a sliding defender and loops towards goal. Scherbitski stretches to flap it behind for a corner...11 min “Rob, do you have any inside info about what’s up with Monreal?” asks Charles Antaki. “ journalists have their ears to the ground. Anyway he’s looked a shadow of his recently-former self. That’s quite good enough to get him into the Arsenal back line (even a quarter would have done), but still, it’s odd.”Inside info! Inside info! He’s 32, so maybe the inexorable decline of the thirtysomething sportsman has started.10 min Bate’s free-kick is partially cleared and lobbed back into the area, where Milic fails to control the up and under. A better first touch would have given him a half chance.9 min Guendouzi slips on the dodgy pitch and loses the ball to Skavysh, who breaks down the right. Xhaka pulls him back and is booked.8 min The atmosphere in the stadium is brilliant, the kind of thing you used to hear in England. The fact Bate are being totally outplayed doesn’t seem to bother the home fans one bit.6 min “Surely against unfit, inferior opponents it’s the perfect opportunity for Emery to let Suarez showcase his skills \u0026amp ability?” asks Sam. “What does he need to do to start a game for the Gunners?”I’m sure he’ll play next week if Arsenal get a decent lead tonight. The pitch is so bad that I’m not sure there would have been that much value in playing him.5 min Arsenal are all over Bate. A short corner is returned to Mkhitaryan, whose inswinging cross is headed just wide of the far post by Mustafi.2 min: Scherbitski makes a fine save to deny Mkhitaryan! Iwobi played a superb angled pass inside the right-back Rios to find Kolasinac, who slid a first-time pass across the face of goal. It was right into the path of Mkhitaryan, whose close-range sidefoot was blocked by the sprawling Scherbitski. 1 min Peep peep! After a minute’s applause in memory of Emiliano Sala, Arsenal get the match under way. They are in red and white Bate are in yellow. It’s freezing and the pitch is a mudheap. Great stuff!Well that was worthwhile.Read all about it!Bate’s team includes former Arsenal charmer Aleksandr Hleb. As you probably know already, future former Arsenal charmer Mesut Ozil has not travelled with the squad. Unai Emery makes two changes from the team that beat Huddersfield at the weekend: Petr Cech and Granit Xhaka come in for Bernd Leno and Lucas Torreira.Good Valentine’s Day to you. Unai Emery was born to succeed in the Uefa Europa League. Just look at the initials on him! He has won the tournament three times, a record he shares with Giovanni Trapattoni, and it’s quite conceivable he could make it four this year. Arsenal are one of the favourites for the tournament, though there’s a strong field that includes Chelsea, Napoli, Internazionale, Benfica, Lazio, Eintracht Frankfurt - and Emery’s old clubs, Sevilla and Valencia.It’s strange that Arsenal never won a European trophy under Arsene Wenger, though they had terrific chances in 2000, 2004, 2006 and 2018. That missed opportunity in 2003-04 still haunts me, and I don’t even bloody support them. The last time they won a European trophy, then, was the criminally unsung Cup Winners’ Cup victory in 1993-94. In the parlance of our time, they are due.They met tonight’s opponents, Bate Borisov, in the group stages last season, whacking them by an aggregate score of 10-2. Bate, the Belarusian champions for the last 13 years, are in their off season and haven’t played a competitive game since 13 December. You can never rule out a touch of Arsenalitis, I suppose, but they should progress comfortably into the last 16.Kick off is at 5.55pm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ef5e002cfdd3e8f7ac83fd611adfb3cba0fdae8/0_170_964_578/master/964.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa1d7ee1931f13d61fb5a21a0747f348","title":"valentines day love cockroach zoo el paso","story":"An increasing number of zoos are offering people the chance to name creatures after those who’ve spurned them in loveYou can see why people rebel against Valentine’s Day. All those chocolates and store-bought cards seem so cheesy and inauthentic, particularly if you’ve recently had your heart broken.But perhaps the zoos and wildlife centers letting people name cockroaches and other animals after their exes are overreacting.Take the El Paso zoo in Texas. It’s running a name-a-cockroach promotion, followed by a Valentine’s Day “quit bugging me” livestream, where those who pledged money to name a roach can watch it being fed to meerkat or a tamarin. It’s proved seriously popular: the zoo said its offer was so attractive it had run out of roaches to name.The Bronx zoo in New York touts itself as the originator of the roach stunt, and says it has been giving the gift of a Madagascar hissing cockroach since 2011. They also pledge cockroaches to celebrities they admire: Orange is the New Black actor Natasha Lyonne, Broad City stars Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson and late-night hosts Desus and Mero have been honorary recipients of the zoo’s roaches this year.Rather than feeding the roaches to other animals, the Bronx zoo promotes them as symbols of eternity. “Nothing lasts longer than a roach, so it could be sent as a symbolic gesture about how long your love will last or exactly the opposite,” said John Calvelli of the Wildlife Conservation Society, the organisation that runs the zoo. They also have mugs and hats available, for people who are very much not over it.Southern Oregon’s Wildlife Images Rehabilitation \u0026amp Education Center has upped the stakes by allowing those willing to make a donation to name a salmon after their ex, with the promise it will be fed to their bears Kodi and Yak. They even promise “a special certificate and photos of Kodi and Yak destroying your salmon”.The promotion is part of the zoo’s “saving wildlife with love” program, which helps to raise money during the winter months when visitor numbers dwindle. So far, the promotion has brought in over $8,500 in salmon sales.The trend is gaining global popularity. The Hemsley Conservation Center in the UK will let you name a cockroach, while Sydney zoo is letting people name a snake after a former paramour.If you’re looking for relationship closure, paying to watch an insect get eaten by a herpestid might not be the healthiest way to go about it. But if you’re dead set on naming a salmon after your former lover, at least this way you get to make a bear happy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd84fd03e451985dce0ef32236805e077cdfc5e3/0_2_2278_1367/master/2278.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e668f4a42ed392829bd15a1b08a5a2f","title":"heres a thought what if the x factor had never existed","story":"A new film imagines a world where the Beatles were unknown. Let’s take a moment to envision life without Simon Cowell’s cash cow …Let’s take a trip to YouTube, where we find the newly released trailer for Richard Curtis and Danny Boyle’s Yesterday. The movie tells the story of a world that has forgotten the Beatles ever existed but, in a twist of Lars von Trier-level cinematic bleakness, has total recall of James Corden. The film also seems to tell the story of a casting department that has never heard of Game of Thrones, because the film features Ed Sheeran in an acting role.It’s a busy time for bands reviving decades-old hits via the silver screen. So, to avoid confusion, Yesterday must not be mistaken for hit-packed movies such as Bohemian Rhapsody or Mamma Mia!, which, rather than trading on Yesterday’s curiously Farage-friendly notion that society is crying out for a return to the good old days of Britain as pop’s leading exporter, celebrated the free movement of music between European countries and told the story of a small island that actually welcomed immigrants.But there are interesting questions posed by the central conceit of Yesterday, which follows the story of the one man who does remember the work of George, Ringo et al, and who uses this knowledge to pass the Beatles’ Movie Medley hitmakers’ songs off as his own. Not least among these questions are: is Ed Sheeran (who stars in the film as Ed Sheeran) under the misapprehension that he is already living in a similar film about Marvin Gaye, and are we all extras in that film, representing one of the most unappealing examples yet of simulation theory?Also, if you had every single Beatles song rattling around in your head, you might consider their dissemination to be broadly in the public interest after all, it’s fair to say that the Beatles had their moments vis-a-vis the whole toe-tapper thing. But how far would this principle extend into other areas of our cultural lives?If you were the only person who remembered Facebook, would you spread the word, or quite frankly keep your thoughts to yourself? And is it fair to say that life would not be worse – and might actually be marginally more bearable – if you switched the Beatles for Muse and decided to join a monastery? When Big Brother first hit our screens, we all thought it might have been quite an interesting social experiment, did we not? But perhaps many of us would now say that was a corner of Elstree that should never have been televised. And putting yourself in the shoes – then, inevitably, the jeans – of Simon Cowell, for rather more pressing reasons that have come to light in this week’s news headlines, how would you behave if you woke up one morning to discover that the UK had suddenly forgotten everything about The X Factor? (As opposed to everyone slowly forgetting, to the tune of 10 million jettisoned viewers since 2010.)For context, current rumblings are trumpeting the partial, or the total, and the imminent, or the not-for-ages disappearance from ITV of The X Factor (Cowell’s current deal with ITV ends this year). Unnamed Chatty Cathys appear in many of the stories with quotes ranging from, “There will definitely be a show this year” to, “This year’s auditions are axed for sure”, two apparently contradictory statements that aren’t necessarily mutually exclusive. Rumours suggest that the last-minute cancellation of this year’s auditions could pave the way for a champion-of-champions approach that might finally – finally! – see stars such as Ben Haenow back on primetime.Other format shifts have been mooted, including a throwback to 2006’s wisely-never-repeated one-series wonder X Factor: Battle of the Stars, which, in scenes that scarred a generation, saw Gillian McKeith honking her way through I Just Want to Make Love to You and Chris Moyles romping to third place. At the time even Cowell described the Battle of the Stars as “pointless”, but reports suggest it may be discussed as a possible way forward. Trigger warning: it’s impossible to consider that option without envisaging Keith Lemon coming in at least second place.Why keep it going at all? For elucidation, let’s head over to a quote from last year in which Cowell, with all the enthusiasm of a world-weary sausage salesman, said: “We could probably do three years or five years. It makes a lot of money.” There’s nothing quite like putting a price on great art. Which is to say, this is nothing like putting a price on great art. But setting to one side the enormous sums of cash that The X Factor has made and continues to generate for Cowell, his record label and ITV, what if The X Factor really had never existed?Well, our collective consciousness would sadly wave goodbye to the triumphant oeuvre of bongo-bothering tunemaul practitioner Wagner. We might never have seen Calvin Harris with a pineapple on his head. Christopher Maloney would have more of a spring in his step and we could do away with the continued insistence – nearly two decades after his last successful artist launch – that Louis Walsh knows what he’s talking about. And yet. Nature would, one hopes, still find a way.Leona Lewis, a former stage school and Brit School attendee, would surely still have warbled her way to some sort of success. Harry Styles’s hair would still somehow have achieved global recognition. Jack Quickenden would still have found his way to Portsmouth for last year’s panto season. And had The X Factor – and Popstars, and Pop Idol – never existed, the UK music industry would never have come to rely on TV platforms to launch pop artists, meaning that it would never have forgotten how to create and nurture decent pop stars. It’s amazing that the 2016 European referendum ever went ahead considering how clearly X Factor winners such as Leon Jackson highlighted the risks that come with leaving things to a public vote if most of those doing the voting are twice the age of the people who will ultimately have to deal with the outcome.Perhaps this points us, rather circuitously, to the next steps for both The X Factor and Richard Curtis: a jukebox movie that tells the story of Brexit, set to the hits of 15 years’ worth of X Factor winners. Who wouldn’t pay good money to see Steve Brookstein reprising Against All Odds in the role of Jean-Claude Juncker?One of this week’s most distressing celebrity headlines comes from the Mirror, which, on Wednesday, relayed news regarding the final days of Nasa’s most beloved robotic explorer under the words: “Mars rover Opportunity dies, aged 15”. The brave fella’s reported final message echoed the internal monologue many of us endure in these testing times: “My battery is low, and it’s getting dark.” Nasa had broadcast more than 1,000 wake-up commands to Opportunity, but there was no response. And with that, Opportunity was lost in a cloud of space dust. A dignified end to a brave mission.Back on Earth, Gemma Collins, who once fell in a hole, is not in darkness. The sun is shining brightly and she is in hay-making mode following her ejection from Dancing on Ice. Gemma’s time on the show is more robustly summarised by the mask slipping in leaked backstage audio of a tantrum regarding a visit to Wales, than by any of her perfunctory on-screen endeavours. Regardless, Collins’s profile has benefitted so much from appearing on the show that her fee for nightclub appearances apparently now stands at £13,000 an hour.Let’s just say it. Opportunity would have been fine with a trip to Wales. Opportunity would probably appear in nightclubs for 10 quid, a finger buffet and a cab fare home. Opportunity – a bundle of wires, metal and rubber – showed more humanity in its final eight-word message than Collins has mustered in the past eight years. We don’t always choose the role models who will guide us through life often, they seem to choose us. But, given a choice between Opportunity and opportunism, it’s not a hard decision."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b347cbf0236da29cb3581d5e45fcc140fceb1de9/0_0_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d18844848b79d1be00a73e7e1c882fd","title":"a week at guantanamo bay today in focus podcast","story":"’s Julian Borger recently spent a week at the Guantánamo Bay detention facility, attending the 33rd pre-trial hearing of five 911 suspects.

MPs are permitted to amend the motion, which will be voted on on Thursday.This is the second time May has submitted an amendable parliamentary motion after the defeat of her Brexit deal. In January, MPs successfully amended the motion twice.The first amendment, supported by the government, was spearheaded by the Conservative MP Graham Brady and called for the government to seek “alternative arrangements” to replace the backstop.The second came from Caroline Spelman and was a defeat for the government backed by rebel Tory MPs. It said the House of Commons rejected the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.But several high-profile amendments were lost, including one by Yvette Cooper and Nick Boles that would have paved the way for legislation to extend article 50. Both Cooper and Boles have said they do not intend to bring their amendment back until 27 February, when May has promised the next update will be tabled.Here is a look at the prime minister’s main motion and the amendments that have been selected by the Speaker.Theresa May’s motion was defeated after ERG Tories refused to support her approach to leaving the EU.May’s defeat, by 303 votes to 258, showed the prime minister once again losing control of her own party in the crucial final weeks before Brexit.May’s motion had said negotiations to come to a compromise on the backstop are continuing and “reiterates its support for the approach to leaving the EU expressed by this house on 29 January 2019”.MPs were voting to accept both the Brady and Spelman amendments – and members of the pro-Brexit European Research Group did not want to vote to accept the latter. It would effectively have meant they had accepted parliament was against leaving with no deal, when many of their faction believe it is a viable option.The Labour frontbench, including Jeremy Corbyn and Keir Starmer, tabled an amendment that would force the prime minister to bring her deal back to the Commons or table another amendable motion by 27 February, just over a month before the UK is due to leave the EU. It was defeated 322 to 306.The amendment by the Scottish National party calls on the government to extend article 50 by at least three months. The amendment was defeated 315 to 93. Anna Soubry has withdrawn the amendment she tabled with Labour’s Chuka Umunna, both leading remainers. It demanded the government publish “the most recent official briefing document”, which has been given to cabinet ministers on the implications of a no-deal Brexit on business and trade. Soubry pulled the amendment after the government said on Thursday that it would publish the information she wants."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d6afcdf3b8c4b7b68afd379348399821a6119bd/0_48_2605_1563/master/2605.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=218937e46e11f5940f981a80c3dd74c8","title":"corbyn to hold brexit talks with barnier and verhofstadt next week","story":"Exclusive: Labour leader to meet key EU figures next week as he seeks to break impasse and get PM to back customs unionJeremy Corbyn will hold talks in Brussels next week with Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, as he seeks to break the Brexit impasse and persuade Theresa May to sign up to a customs union.The visit is likely to be highly unwelcome in Downing Street, and risks accusations that Labour is pursuing its own shadow negotiations, undermining the prime minister’s hopes of fresh EU concessions.May will be in Brussels in the same week to meet the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker. The UK attorney-general, Geoffrey Cox, is expected to travel with her.During a whistle-stop tour of the central figures in the Brexit talks on Thursday, Corbyn is also due to meet the European parliament’s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt.He will also hold talks with senior figures in the socialist group in the European parliament, including Labour MEPs.EU sources said Corbyn was expected to provide further details on his recent conditional offer of support for the prime minister’s deal along with an update on the cross-party talks.Earlier this month, the Labour leader said his party would back the withdrawal agreement, containing the Irish backstop, if May renegotiated the accompanying political declaration on the future relationship.Labour is seeking a permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union, a close alignment with the single market and protection for standards and workers’ rights.Corbyn also wants commitments on participation in EU agencies, funding programmes and security arrangements, such as the European arrest warrant, written into the deal.The Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said: “There are enough people in Brussels already dedicatedly working against British national interests without Corbyn and his circus joining them.”Barnier raised the Labour party’s ideas as a way to secure parliament’s support when he dined with the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, on Monday in Brussels, EU sources said.Barclay is understood to have pointed to the UK’s determination to have an independent trade policy.The government is still pursuing legally binding changes to the Irish backstop, in order to persuade the Democratic Unionist party and Brexiter MPs to back the prime minister’s deal, despite the EU’s refusal to reopen the deal.May has insisted to the EU that a time limit on the backstop, a unilateral exit mechanism or its replacement with “alternative arrangements” would convince Brexiter MPs that the UK would not be trapped in the customs union envisaged as a way to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.But the EU’s most senior officials have said in turn that the bloc will not reopen the withdrawal agreement.When the European council president, Donald Tusk, directly suggested to May last week that Corbyn’s Brexit plan might be a way out of the deadlock, sources said May did not respond.Spokesmen for Corbyn, the European commission and Verhofstadt declined to comment on the scheduled visit.The EU’s belief that there is little hope of the government winning over the most hardline Brexiters and the DUPwas strengthened on Thursday evening during a debate and vote on the next steps in the Brexit talks.May had asked the Commons to approve a motion that “reiterates its support for the approach to leaving the EU expressed by this house on 29 January”.But Tory MPs criticised the motion on the basis that the Commons had also voted to avoid a no-deal Brexit that day, leaving a host of those backbenchers that May would need to back her deal vowing to rebel again.Meanwhile, the Irish deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, announced “emergency” legislation as Ireland “ramped up” its preparations for no deal.Earlier, the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, also expressed the growing dismay in EU capitals over the Brexit talks, and claimed that the UK was a “waning country” and too small to stand alone on the global stage.A Downing Street spokesman hit back, claiming that employment was “at a record high, exports are at a record high, companies are continuing to invest in the UK. Deloitte named the UK as Europe’s leading destination for foreign direct investment just last month.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a4d7ae3af185f6c218969bd5e56cad467edfcf8/0_0_2555_1533/master/2555.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd6170f7a73750dcfe8fb0605fd59173","title":"theresa may defeated on brexit again as erg tories abstain","story":"May defeated by 303 votes to 258 as PM again loses control of her own partyTheresa May has suffered an embarrassing defeat at the hands of hardline Brexit supporters who refused to support her approach to leaving the EU.A band of eurosceptics led by Jacob Rees-Mogg abstained on a government motion because they were unhappy that the prime minister endorsed parliament’s decision to rule out a no-deal Brexit.May’s defeat, by 303 votes to 258, showed the prime minister once again losing control of her own party in the crucial final weeks before Brexit.The disunity is likely to cause fresh doubts in Brussels that she can win parliamentary support for the EU withdrawal agreement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01b6fa0e9fe3312bef9bdeb24b3d38eb44d2ed0c/0_0_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9187898fb91f541c1d46ceb0da251738","title":"dont use moisturiser and stop over exfoliating 10 beauty rules for your best ever skin","story":"Want to take your complexion to the next level? Three skin experts share their dos and don’ts for clear, glowing skinFeed your skinDid you know we all have our own skin flora? “Bacteria, yeast and viruses make up our skin microbiome,” says Pfeffer. “You want to foster and encourage your healthy microbiome to flourish and be at its most erse. By doing this, those microorganisms will protect your skin from infection, pollutants and pathogens which contribute to ageing, acne and eczema.”Pfeffer recommends using pH-balanced skincare, as anything too harsh, such as alcohol or soap, can destroy the bacteria. “Incorporate probiotics into your routine inside and out!” she adds.Ramp up your hydrationIt’s old news that drinking water is good for us, but did you know you can supercharge the hydration benefits of your H2O? “Drinking water is important, however, you may find you still feel dehydrated externally,” says Reynolds. Sound familiar? “Add ionic mineral drops to your water, as this will hydrate you at the cellular level. It is important for cell turnover and communication sometimes drinking water alone doesn’t cut it.”Take care of your productsDon’t just focus on looking after your complexion – your products need care too. “Active ingredients can be unstable and have an expiration date for a reason out-of-date products aren’t going to perform at their optimum and could even cause skin irritation,” says Pfeffer. “Check how the product should be stored, too – lots of ingredients can be denatured by sunlight so it’s best to keep them in a cool, dark cabinet. What if there’s a textural change or a funny smell? Play it safe and don’t apply.”Use retinol at night“Retinol is an anti-ageing superstar,” says Kerr. “It is a cell communicator that can attach to most skin cells, telling them to behave like younger, healthier versions of themselves.”Retinol is best used at night when the skin is “more active and in repair mode”, adds Kerr. Because retinol is a seriously active ingredient, start slow with a low percentage a few nights a week and work your way up in strength and frequency.Incorporate PHA into your routinePolyhydroxy acids (PHAs) are the new “it” exfoliating acid on the beauty block and because they are gentle, everyone can benefit from them (even if you have sensitive, dry or rosacea-prone skin). “PHAs are humectants, which means they have the ability to attract moisture which hydrates the skin. They also have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits,” says Kerr. “Plus, if used regularly they can strengthen barrier function, making the skin stronger and more resilient, giving you more of that sought-after glow.”Stop applying products in the wrong orderYou need to think about product penetration when applying your skincare. “The biggest mistake I see people make is using a balm or oil cleanser, then applying a water-based serum. Water floats on top of oil – that serum isn’t going anywhere near your skin,” says Kerr. Apply your products from thinnest in consistency to thickest and “always apply sunscreen last”, adds Kerr.Stop over-exfoliatingSkin experts have differing views on this one, but Reynolds doesn’t believe we should be excessively exfoliating. “The skin’s microbiome and lipid barrier can be disrupted by aggressive exfoliating, leading to inflammation,” she says. Aim to exfoliate twice a week. If you feel your skin can handle more, that’s OK, but proceed with some caution.Stop using moisturiserCurveball! “It has been ingrained in us from a young age to cleanse, tone and moisturise. But our skin is capable of maintaining its own hydration levels – only a true dry skin type needs moisturiser,” says Kerr. “When we use moisturiser, our skin’s surface sends a signal down to its water reservoirs that there is plenty of moisture and to halt production. This makes the skin sluggish and lacking in moisture, so we reach for more moisturiser.“Breaking the cycle wakes up the skin’s natural moisturising processes, not only hydrating the skin but helping to balance oil production, preventing congestion. You’ll notice a brightening of the complexion and slower rate of skin ageing.” Give it a go and you should start to see a difference in two to three weeks.Stop ignoring instructions“The biggest mistake is overusing something if it works,” says Reynolds. If that retinol is making your skin glow, then the temptation is to go to town. “Remember, the ingredients in products that give the wow factor can also create an imbalance if over used. Stick to the instructions.”Stop cleansing with oilsBalm and oil cleansers may feel luxurious, but Kerr says “oils congest the skin, upset our own moisturising processes and prevent product penetration”. Not ready to give up your balm or oil cleanser? Be sure to double cleanse to remove any oil residue that could prevent your pricey serums from penetrating.Be your healthy best with Nature’s BountyBeauty starts from within.

From gardening ‘workouts’ to training with Serena Williams, there are ways to be frugal and fitIf getting fit is up there on your 2019 to-do list, then you may be tempted to stump up the cash for a pricey gym membership. Instead, why not explore the fitness workouts you can do for free?When it comes to getting fit, Louise Parker, author of Louise Parker: The 6 Week Programme (£20, Mitchell Beazley) and founder of the Louise Parker Method, believes the route to success is consistency, so, whether or not you’re paying for your workout, bear that in mind. “Stick to a routine, even if the time varies,” says Parker. “I get home, tend to the kids and then it’s yoga mat out for a quick cardio workout and job done. It’s not severe or gruelling, so I never dread it. It’s consistent and so it works.”Luke Worthington, human movement and elite performance specialist, agrees: “As a trainer, one of the most common questions I get asked is: ‘What’s the best programme for *insert goal here*?’ The answer, almost always, is the one that you will stick to. Adherence and consistency (and, therefore, motivation) are the most important considerations when embarking on an exercise regime.”Below are five free workout ideas. All you need to do is commit, workout, then repeat.Running is one of the most affordable ways to get fit. To start with, you really don’t need a lot of expensive kit a pair of running shoes – and, for women, a sports bra – is all you need to get started. If you’re totally new to running, try downloading the C25K 5K Trainer app (iTunes or Android, free), which will get you running the distance in just eight weeks. Once you’ve mastered a 5k, why not seek out your local Parkrun? The free Saturday morning race is timed, so you can keep track of your progress week after week.If you live near the countryside, or you fancy heading off for an active break, then why not seek out the UK’s best hiking routes? Walking is a low-impact exercise – you’re less likely to get injured from a jaunt across the countryside than doing something more intense. You’ll be burning calories and working those muscles, all the while distracted by the scenic views. Head to nationaltrailthe-trails to discover some of the best walking routes our country has to offer.We all know that gym memberships can cost an arm and a leg, and while there are now more affordable options that don’t tie you in, they still involve a monthly outlay. Our Parks offers free workouts, from boxfit and boot camps to yoga and Zumba, in parks up and down the country. Simply set up an online account and book a class near you.If you like the idea of being outside, but you’re not a fan of workout classes, then Green Gym could be for you. It’s a charity organisation that gets volunteers gardening their way to fitness. Each session involves a warm-up and cool down, but the bulk of the “workout” is gardening.Fitness Blender is a website devoted to free workouts of varying lengths and for different abilities – choose from barre, cardio and strength training, plus many more. It’s this decade’s answer to the workout DVD.If you travel a lot and want to exercise on the go, then download the Nike Training Club app (iTunes and Android, free) it’s essentially like having Nike’s best trainers and athletes – such as Serena Williams and Cristiano Ronaldo – in your pocket. It boasts more than 100 workouts, including core strength, abs and arms, and glute toner.Don’t think you have the willpower or motivation to work out at home? Anna Samuels, boxing trainer and the BoxxMethod co-founder suggests treating your at-home workout like you would a gym class or personal training session. “Book out time in your diary to do it, otherwise there is always the risk of putting it off until later. With the right mindset and planning, you will find the motivation to start, and with consistency it will become a habit.”OK, this is slightly unusual, but ecstatic dance – where you move to music in any way you please – frees you from confusing routines so you can lose yourself in the rhythm. You don’t need to head to a pricey class instead, load up Spotify or iTunes with your favourite, energy-boosting tunes and dance like no one’s watching. The benefits? It’s free, it burns calories and can even relieve stress. Try it if dancing’s your thing.Be your healthy best with Nature’s BountyGet energy the easy way with delicious Nature’s Bounty CoQ-10 Gummies with Vitamin C – helping you reach your healthy best, every day.

However, Semenya’s legal team will argue the natural advantages she derives from being a DSD are no different than those other athletes enjoy.In a statement they added: “Women with differences in sexual development have genetic differences that are no different than other genetic variations that are celebrated in sport. She asks that she be respected and treated as any other athlete. Her genetic gift should be celebrated, not discriminated against.”On Wednesday the IAAF rejected a report suggesting it regarded Semenya as a “biological male”. “The IAAF is not classifying any DSD athlete as male,” it added. “To the contrary, we accept their legal sex without question, and permit them to compete in the female category.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f865a333c3cd689d579e446b90dc5649a87dae00/0_121_2722_1633/master/2722.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7637c44a119d2aeac11a8426d613aa57","title":"ellis genge injury england six nations wales rugby union","story":"England have encountered further problems at loosehead prop in the build-up to their Six Nations match with Wales a week on Saturday after Ellis Genge picked up an ankle injury in training.Genge failed to finish Thursday’s training session because of soreness in an ankle and, while England are hopeful there will not be “any major consequences”, it is an unwanted disruption for Eddie Jones, who is already without Mako Vunipola for the rest of the championship.Vunipola started both England’s victories, against Ireland and France, with Genge on the bench in Dublin and Exeter’s Ben Moon among the replacements at Twickenham last Sunday. When Vunipola was ruled out on Tuesday Genge and Moon were set to vie for the No 1 jersey but, if the Leicester prop is unavailable, Exeter’s Alec Hepburn would most likely come into the equation. Moon and Hepburn have only four starts between them but they shared loosehead duties to impressive effect during the November series, when Vunipola and Genge were sidelined and Joe Marler had just retired from international duty.“Ellis Genge in training today reported a sore ankle so he was withdrawn,” said England’s forwards coach, Steve Borthwick. “He reported the ankle so we said: ‘Right, stop training, we won’t push that.’ We don’t think there will be any major consequences. It’s ongoing and it was the right decision to ensure he didn’t finish training.“Mako’s play has been exceptional. It’s disappointing because he’s a very good player. But we’ve also got some very good loosehead props in Ben Moon, look at the way he played in November, and while Genge left training today he’s also an excellent player.”Maro Itoje and Dylan Hartley were both present at Thursday’s training session but were not considered as part of the 25-man squad and their involvement was considerably limited. Hartley is not expected to be in contention to face Wales but Borthwick did not rule out the possibility of Itoje returning from his knee injury ahead of schedule, even if the likelihood remains remote.“Maro’s progressing well each day,” said Borthwick. “He’s working exceptionally hard as you’d expect from him. He’s doing everything possible he can to recover as quickly as possible. He’s on track to be back on the field in the latter part of the tournament. He’s healing fast.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f19b9e7be03d3b4e5c972941e2bf757a84adfc2/1567_155_3089_1854/master/3089.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3427a2fa7749bde93fb4967239bcbaf3","title":"mclaren lando norris f1 fernando alonso","story":"Lando Norris, who next month will become the youngest British driver to compete in Formula One, has said he knows he will make mistakes while under the intense scrutiny of his debut season for McLaren. Norris will be only 19 at the first grand prix in Melbourne and faces by far the most challenging test of his career as he seeks to make his mark at a team still in the throes of rebuilding after four years of underperformance.Norris and his teammate Carlos Sainz Jr replace Fernando Alonso, who has retired from F1, and Stoffel Vandoorne, who was dropped by McLaren at the end of last season.Vandoorne was a recognised talent but struggled in an uncompetitive car and when measured against Alonso. The task facing Norris is similarly daunting, with Sainz in his fifth season and McLaren with another as yet unproven car, but he does not expect an easy ride.“There’s going to be times when I make mistakes but it’s just knowing that’s part of it,” he said. “No one’s perfect, I’m sure there’s going to be times when I do things wrong, that no one’s going to like and everyone’s going to think I’m terrible and rubbish but I know I’m going to go through those times, it’s just understanding that that’s going to happen.“It’s very different when you get to F1 knowing when I make one small mistake a lot more people are going to see it. There’s more pressure in knowing you’re under more scrutiny of making small mistakes.”Norris was speaking at the launch of the new McLaren MCL34 at the team’s headquarters in Woking. He joined McLaren as a junior driver in 2017 and was the reserve driver in 2018, taking part in practice at the Belgian GP. He was second in the F2 championship last season and McLaren have high hopes he will be a future star, having shown the potential to make it with a string of titles in junior series.Norris will take to the wheel of the MCL34 at the first test in Barcelona on Monday and was more than aware of the scale of the challenge that faced him and McLaren. “I’ve spent a lot of time over the winter to try and prepare myself in every way for this moment and for the races,” he said. “But there’s some things you can’t learn until you’re on track and in that situation. The aim is to win races and championships but we have to improve as a team first.”McLaren’s chief executive officer, Zak Brown, acknowledged the team were still undergoing a rebuilding process. They endured three woeful years with an underpowered and unreliable Honda engine until switching to Renault last year. However, optimism of a swift return to the sharp end was crushed when their car proved to have fundamental aerodynamic issues. They finished sixth in the constructors’ standings, flattered by how much Alonso was able to extract from his recalcitrant ride.Brown’s new drivers, especially Norris, are unknown quantities in comparison with Alonso but the American was confident about the British driver’s ability to step up.“Lando is very mature for his age and been in a race car for most of his life,” he said. “He is a relaxed inidual and we think he is ready otherwise we would not put him in the car. I am sure he will make some rookie mistakes but we will be there to support him. I think he will hit the ground running and will be on it right away.”McLaren, who have been restructuring their personnel, are awaiting two major new additions this season. James Key, who was at Toro Rosso, will join as technical director at a still undisclosed point in the near future and Andreas Seidl, who was in charge of Porsche’s highly successful World Endurance Championship team, will become their head of F1 operations on 1 May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f9c999bf1645f91ec572440adf4b320583390ae/2_0_10663_6400/master/10663.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79291db2268fb9d7141efc2081bd5abf","title":"my funny valentine standups on their most disastrous dates","story":"A night in a cemetery, a trip to a strip club, five hours in A\u0026ampE … comics relive their woeful romantic rendezvousOn my year abroad in Paris – the city of love – I went on, if not an official date, then a two-person “rendezvous” where I was almost certainly harbouring more romantic aspirations than my opposite number. We elected, foolishly, to watch the film Buried, about an American truck-driver (Ryan Reynolds) in Iraq who spends the film imprisoned in a coffin. The only sliver of hope for this claustrophobic nightmare of a cinema experience would have been a mutual clasp of terror during one of the white-knuckle moments (the snake? the sand? Ryan’s phone running out of battery?). Alas, due to our late arrival at the Gaumont Parnasse, my companion sat not next to me but one row in front. And someone kicked over my popcorn. A dismal failure on every front.During the last Edinburgh fringe, I met a flyerer and we had a fun initial chat. We both had an hour to kill and she asked if I wanted to get a bite to eat. I went “Sure” and she said “OK, do you want to come back to my place?” I was a bit taken aback but it seemed innocent enough so I went along with it. When I got there, she reheated some pasta, we ate and then she started kissing me. She quickly stopped and said: “Sorry, I’m not into this.” So I left and we never spoke again. This all took place within an hour of meeting.We had worked together one summer, and ran into each other one Friday night. We went for drinks and everything was fine, until he shushed me and started listening intensely to the music. It was Madonna or something. Then he smiled and said: “Sorry, it’s just that I communicate with God through music. Carry on.” He told me his powers came from his mother’s cats and that he believed all people were cats or dogs. “You’re obviously a dog,” he said with a big, caring smile. He wanted to win The X Factor. “Do you sing?” I asked. “No,” he said. “But I’ve never cried before and I can only cry if I win The X Factor. I’d love to try crying.” I still don’t know if he was trying to be funny or not. Either way, he never texted me back.Edinburgh festival, 2012. She was flirty and pretty in a girl-next-door way (if the girl next door was really fit). She came to my show, said she loved it and suggested a drink the next night. We had several – laughing, chatting, sharing a fag. The bar was closing but she knew somewhere else. Brilliant! A jazz club. I’ve never been into jazz but I could be tonight. I’ve always been awkward on dates but I was smashing this one. As I walked her home, we shared an umbrella. (Since I was a teenager I’ve thought rain is romantic because of a kissing scene in Ally McBeal I remember thinking: “Imagine wanting to kiss someone so much you didn’t mind your hair getting wet.”) At her house, we gazed into each other’s eyes. Then she broke the silence. “This was amazing. You’re the perfect date. If I was gay, you’d be the one.” Ah … not a date after all.I was 13 and Nick from my drama group invited me to see Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones. Remember it? It’s the one that was extra shit and in which Anakin refers to child jedis as “younglings”. I brought my best friend Libby with me, as was the Year 9 way, and we just took the piss out of the film, not saying a word to poor Nick. Afterwards a friend texted me on my Nokia brick to inform me something I needed to know about Nick. It turns out he wasn’t 13 at all – he was 12. Twelve! I felt lost, betrayed and humiliated. This Year 8 kid had lied to me and it was over. The experience taught me everything I now know about love: ask to see ID before going to the latest Star Wars instalment, or girl you gonna get burned.This date was disastrous thanks to me and only me. While at university, I fancied myself a real manic pixie dream girl – so when a lovely young man asked me out, I decided to inject it with as much whimsy as humanly possible. First, I demanded he drive us to a cemetery, because I wanted to be quirky but in a goth way. It turned out to be much sadder than the Smiths made it seem, so we got back into his car. After that, I asked him to drive us to a strip club. There, he tried his best to maintain eye contact with me as a beautiful woman approached us offering a lap dance. He politely said “I’m good”, to which the beautiful woman responded with a shrug: “I’m better.” Later we made out in his car.Once upon a time, there was a little, ginger, camp comedian who had just finished a Soho theatre run and was ready to find The One. He searched far and wide (OK, I went into Soho after my gig) and met a boy. He looked like Aladdin, we exchanged numbers. Days later, I was invited to his house (a warehouse in east London, and he was vegan – I should have known). The conversation was great, he was a little eccentric and wore a kimono but I just thought: “Take what you can get.” He took me into his “special room” and there was a bed of nails. He said they were for chiropractic – a likely story! I was dying to leave but the Uber surge charge was on. So I hopped on and I’ve not quite been the same since.When I was an awkward 18-year-old, all low self-esteem and Nirvana T-shirts, I met a friend of a friend in the pub. He had dark curly hair and lovely eyes, so when he asked me to go out with him, I was over the moon. I gave him my number (by which I mean the landline at my mum’s house) and steeled myself for a week of sitting by a phone that never rang. But it did. The next day. He was having a party at his house on Saturday night. Would I like to go along as his date? He lived in a village out of town so would come and pick me up. (He had a car! OK, it was his mum’s Nissan Micra, but it was a car!) I was so excited – a date and a house party. We made awkward small talk as he drove me to his parents’ house in the country. I thought: how cool must your parents be to just let you have a party in their massive house? We arrived, and I was greeted at the front door by said parents. Both of them. It was their 25th-anniversary party, where I was to be paraded and introduced to his entire family. I couldn’t escape – I didn’t even know where I was – so I had to smile sweetly and wait for him to drive me home.Never date someone older than your dad. Never date a drug addict. Never date someone you meet in a lift. These were the golden rules my mum told me. I broke all of them two years ago. He told me “You make me feel impossible” and quoted a Stephen King book at me. I assumed it was true love. We arranged to meet at 7pm. He was 45 minutes late. He told me he had been stopping a fight. This turned out to be a lie. He had gone to the cinema on his own to see Paddington and got the timings wrong. He wore Crocs, army shorts and a Robbie Williams Let Me Entertain You tour T-shirt. It was a Friday in December. He resembled a serial killer from Luther.We went to a hipster restaurant where he talked about his brother’s orce, his dead relatives and his acute IBS – all while taking out a lot of aggression on the bread sticks. After he asked if I had “ever considered getting checked for Marfan syndrome”, I stood to make a dignified exit. Instead, I banged my head on a decorative shelf and started bleeding from my head. As I bled all over my dress, the table, the food and my dignity, much like Sissy Spacek in Carrie, I also managed to bleed on his clothes. I apologised. He said there was nothing to apologise for. A week later he sent me a receipt for the dry cleaning.I was 15 and my boyfriend and I were in a posh spa for Valentine’s day. After some heavy petting in the deep end, I needed a widdle and because it was a nice place, I thought I would use the toilet. I sauntered off as sassily as I could in my mum’s ill-fitting Aztec-print bikini, through a door up some stairs. I was following my nose to the toilet because, like a fox (or rat), I work on instinct. I opened a fire door, which locked closed behind me and I took in my surroundings. I was in a five-star restaurant where people were busy eating Sunday lunch. There I was stuck like a fox (or rat) in the headlights: a dripping-wet, apologetic, bikini-clad rat. I did the walk of shame through to the other end of the restaurant, out the front door and back into reception. Hiya!When we first met, my girlfriend was living in Bristol. Early in our relationship, we walked to the beautiful suburb of Clifton for lunch it was all dappled sunlight and gentle breeze. Things were going tremendously well until the end of the meal, when my face and hands began dramatically swelling. My breathing was normal, I was merely beginning to inflate like Violet Beauregarde (but still brown). Once we had acquired deflationary drugs, detective work was in order. It turned out that the multivitamins I had started taking contained small amounts of krill oil. It also turns out that I am allergic to krill. Like a shit whale. If you want a date to go perfectly, avoid spending the preceding week microdosing yourself with poison while telling anyone who’ll listen that you’re “on a health kick”.We were just winding up the date when he broke his arm. My friend had arranged a blind date for me with her work colleague. There had been no spark of romance, I had to foot the whole bill and he told me I looked fatter in real life than on TV. We were just about to part ways (reasonably) amicably at the tube when he decided to vault over the barrier. The tube staff were really kind and sympathetic considering he was a felon, and called an ambulance. They assumed we were boyfriend and girlfriend and I felt obliged to go with him. I stayed with him for five hours in A\u0026ampE until he was discharged. I would love to be a time traveller so I could go back to 2002 and tell my younger self to leave before coffee.When I was 18 I had an all-consuming crush on a boy who was also a very close pal. We were already very comfortable talking about romantic relationships, just never the one we were clearly meant to have. I decided I had to tell him and invited him over to my place. I went to make us some tea and returned with two mugs on a tray. As he took a mug, I said: “I really, really like you.” The mug stopped in mid-air. Wordlessly, eyes glued to the mug, he replaced it on the tray, turned on his heel and walked out the front door. Summer holidays started the next day. I didn’t see him again until we were 24 and he was a last-minute passenger in a car I was driving on a road trip. But that’s another story.Did You Hear About the Morgans? Not a question. That’s the name of the film I saw when I was ditched halfway through a date. I was 18 and on one of my first ever romantic outings. My date (let’s call him Liam … like his parents did) invited me to see it. I was on my best behaviour. I don’t even think we spoke that much but I thought everything was going great. Then the film started … Sarah Jessica Parker attempted a character that wasn’t Carrie Bradshaw and “Liam” (real name) had to go to the bathroom. It was the longest bathroom break ever because it’s still going, apparently.I came of age in the 90s. Back then, you just fell on someone in a nightclub. Dating came later. I joined a dating website a couple of years ago and got chatting to a nice woman. She was quite a bit younger than me but happy to come to my local. When I arrived, she had pushed two armchairs together and had bought not one, but two bottles of wine. I had to be up for the school run. After a few minutes she said: “You snogged my cousin at the Edinburgh festival’ ARGH! Obviously, her cousin did not respect the law of “what happens at the fringe, stays at the fringe”. At Edinburgh, I’m 90s-me again. All other times, I’m a tired fortysomething. There was no second date.I used to watch people go on dates on Sex and the City and think: what are they doing? I didn’t have that sort of life. I used to sleep with people and work backwards: if you can tolerate them in the morning, you might get towards a relationship. I thought dates were like auditions, and I went on those and they were shit. But there was a time when I’d been single for a while so I appealed to a friend to set me up on a blind date. We had a nice evening, he was funny and interesting, but there wasn’t any spark. He was a playwright and was doing a production and offered me a part in it. I ended up snogging one of the other cast members and taking him home with me. He’s now my husband."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8aed182c9ed4504c6046ed00c322ea3492c93798/0_57_5106_3063/master/5106.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73d362c65262bf7c3d7912f89cc0681e","title":"elon musk backed ai writes convincing news fiction","story":"The Elon Musk-backed nonprofit company OpenAI declines to release research publicly for fear of misuseThe creators of a revolutionary AI system that can write news stories and works of fiction – dubbed “deepfakes for text” – have taken the unusual step of not releasing their research publicly, for fear of potential misuse.OpenAI, an nonprofit research company backed by Elon Musk, says its new AI model, called GPT2 is so good and the risk of malicious use so high that it is breaking from its normal practice of releasing the full research to the public in order to allow more time to discuss the ramifications of the technological breakthrough. At its core, GPT2 is a text generator. The AI system is fed text, anything from a few words to a whole page, and asked to write the next few sentences based on its predictions of what should come next. The system is pushing the boundaries of what was thought possible, both in terms of the quality of the output, and the wide variety of potential uses.When used to simply generate new text, GPT2 is capable of writing plausible passages that match what it is given in both style and subject. It rarely shows any of the quirks that mark out previous AI systems, such as forgetting what it is writing about midway through a paragraph, or mangling the syntax of long sentences.Feed it the opening line of George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four – “It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen” – and the system recognises the vaguely futuristic tone and the novelistic style, and continues with:“I was in my car on my way to a new job in Seattle. I put the gas in, put the key in, and then I let it run. I just imagined what the day would be like. A hundred years from now. In 2045, I was a teacher in some school in a poor part of rural China. I started with Chinese history and history of science.”Feed it the first few paragraphs of a  story about Brexit, and its output is plausible newspaper prose, replete with “quotes” from Jeremy Corbyn, mentions of the Irish border, and answers from the prime minister’s spokesman.One such, completely artificial, paragraph reads: “Asked to clarify the reports, a spokesman for May said: ‘The PM has made it absolutely clear her intention is to leave the EU as quickly as is possible and that will be under her negotiating mandate as confirmed in the Queen’s speech last week.’” From a research standpoint, GPT2 is groundbreaking in two ways. One is its size, says Dario Amodei, OpenAI’s research director. The models “were 12 times bigger, and the dataset was 15 times bigger and much broader” than the previous state-of-the-art AI model. It was trained on a dataset containing about 10m articles, selected by trawling the social news site Reddit for links with more than three votes. The vast collection of text weighed in at 40 GB, enough to store about 35,000 copies of Moby Dick.The amount of data GPT2 was trained on directly affected its quality, giving it more knowledge of how to understand written text. It also led to the second breakthrough. GPT2 is far more general purpose than previous text models. By structuring the text that is input, it can perform tasks including translation and summarisation, and pass simple reading comprehension tests, often performing as well or better than other AIs that have been built specifically for those tasks.That quality, however, has also led OpenAI to go against its remit of pushing AI forward and keep GPT2 behind closed doors for the immediate future while it assesses what malicious users might be able to do with it. “We need to perform experimentation to find out what they can and can’t do,” said Jack Clark, the charity’s head of policy. “If you can’t anticipate all the abilities of a model, you have to prod it to see what it can do. There are many more people than us who are better at thinking what it can do maliciously.”To show what that means, OpenAI made one version of GPT2 with a few modest tweaks that can be used to generate infinite positive – or negative – reviews of products. Spam and fake news are two other obvious potential downsides, as is the AI’s unfiltered nature . As it is trained on the internet, it is not hard to encourage it to generate bigoted text, conspiracy theories and so on.Instead, the goal is to show what is possible to prepare the world for what will be mainstream in a year or two’s time. “I have a term for this. The escalator from hell,” Clark said. “It’s always bringing the technology down in cost and down in price. The rules by which you can control technology have fundamentally changed.“We’re not saying we know the right thing to do here, we’re not laying down the line and saying ‘this is the way’ … We are trying to develop more rigorous thinking here. We’re trying to build the road as we travel across it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc6f85e4c73361c99f2230d037e12c1b192be15f/0_124_1840_1104/master/1840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf39efe6b5a2ec4c76a994b7b482abdf","title":"venice bibione beach is the first in italy to ban smoking","story":"Ban to take effect at the end of May after years of trials and research into air pollution at the Veneto seaside resortThe Venetian seaside resort of Bibione will be the first Italian beach to go completely smoke-free, in a mission to safeguard the environment from discarded cigarette ends and protect visitors from secondhand smoke.The decision comes after eight years of trials, as part of the Breathe the Sea Air project, which saw an initial smoking ban between the first row of umbrellas to the water’s edge. New measures, to be imposed by the end of May, will include designated smoking areas 300 to 400 metres away from the sea, at the edge of the beach. Details regarding fines and whether e-cigarettes are to be permitted will be published in May.Cigarettes filters, which contain slow-degrading plastic cellulose acetate, can take up to 10 years to decompose. Approximately 5.5 trillion cigarettes are sold worldwide each year, with a vast number of the ends discarded into the surrounding environment. As part of the trials between 2014 and 2018, 550,000 cigarette ends were collected on Bibione beach, which would have otherwise ended up in the sand or sea.“We’re interested in giving the people who choose to spend their holidays here the chance to breathe the clean sea air without having to put up with polluting substances that are harmful to health,” said Pasqualino Codognotto, mayor of San Michele al Tagliamento-Bibione. “It is also a way of working alongside our guests to promote a culture based on respect, and we are confident that non-smokers and smokers will seize the opportunity that it presents. The initiative also has the backing of all of the members of the local tourist industry.”Scientific research used to support the move included a report from the Stop Smoking Centre at the Italian National Tumour Institute in Milan, which measured air pollution on and around Bibione beach. It found peaks in pollution levels from cigarettes even from a distance of 10 metres from smokers, and that even though peaks only lasted a few seconds, levels were higher than at the busy roundabout at the resort entrance. The average black carbon measurement (tiny, toxic pollution particles) from when a cigarette was lit until it was put out was 7.4 microgramsm³, compared with 2.1 at the roundabout and 1.8 on the beach overall.Other places that have already introduced a ban include Queensland, Australia, on all its patrolled beaches more than 300 beaches across the US and as of 2018 24 beaches in Thailand, including Patong beach in Phuket and Bo Phut on Koh Samui. Two Welsh beaches have introduced voluntary bans – Little Haven in Pembrokeshire and Caswell Bay in Swansea.Italy imposed a smoking ban in public enclosed places in 2005, prohibiting smoking in bars, restaurants, clubs and offices. The European commission has called several times for a ban on smoking in public areas, including urging member counties in 2017 to put policies in place to make public spaces, including beaches, smoke-free."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37e83498cc81bad037e75d902dfa1494cee97e39/0_964_2497_1497/master/2497.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b995f842986931b4899eb4e658b14b7b","title":"paddington to emigrate to tv with ben whishaw back as the bear","story":"The marmalade-scoffing mammal and big-screen star will appear in a new pre-school animated seriesFrom darkest Peru to the small screen, Paddington will star in a new animated TV series, with Ben Whishaw returning as the marmalade-loving bear.Whishaw, who voiced the character in the popular recent films, will now bring the adventures of a younger Paddington to a pre-school audience in a series that will air on Nickelodeon in 2020.The animation’s aim is to introduce the next generation to the beloved bear created by Michael Bond 60 years ago. Every episode will open and close with Paddington writing to his long-lost Aunt Lucy from Windsor Gardens, his London residence, to tell her about his adventures that day. A first-look image of the new series shows a fully animated Paddington flying over London, clasping an umbrella and wearing his trademark blue duffle coat and red hat. The programme will be executive produced by David Heyman, who also produced both Paddington films as well as all eight Harry Potter films. “It is a joy to bring this uniquely life-enhancing bear to a whole new audience of younger children,” Hayman said.Both Paddington and its sequel were critical and commercial hits, each taking more than $200m (£156m) at the global box office.  film critic Peter Bradshaw described Paddington 2 as a “tremendously sweet-natured, charming, unassuming and above all funny film with a story that just rattles along, powered by a nonstop succession of Grade-A gags” – a humour, he added, that has the “citrus tang of top-quality thick-cut marmalade.”Paddington author Bond died at the age of 91 in 2017. His last story, Paddington’s Finest Hour, was published just two months before his death. More than 35m Paddington books have been sold globally, spawning toys and TV shows as well as the Bafta-nominated films.The films starred Whishaw, Imelda Staunton, Sally Hawkins, Julie Walters, Jim Broadbent and Hugh Bonneville, with Hugh Grant getting rave reviews for his turn as Phoenix Buchanan in the sequel.

You’ve got Atlantic views all the way around.”Since going on the market last Friday it has received more than 7,000 views, said the auctioneer. “That’s massive.”Star Wars fans should note that High Island – Ardoileán in Irish – is a good 200 miles north of the Skellig Islands, rocky outcrops off County Kerry which served as Luke Skywalker’s sanctuary.The island, about the size of 60 football fields, rises to 206 feet above sea level at its centre and slopes down to cliffs and deep inlets.It includes two freshwater lakes and a host of birds: gulls, fulmars, Arctic terns, Manx shearwaters, barnacle geese, petrels, oystercatchers and peregrine falcons, making the island an EU special protection area.Pollen evidence suggests there was human settlement about 3,000 years ago. Archaeologists believe monks converted a secular settlement into a monastery in the seventh century. It was reputedly founded by Saint Féchín, who founded other monasteries across Ireland until succumbing to yellow fever in 665.The monastery’s ruins, which include a church, altar, beehive huts and graves, are owned by the Irish state and excluded from the sale.A prominent Galway family, the Martins, owned the island in the 18th century and leased it to copper miners, who built stone huts and left a mineshaft.Richard Murphy, a poet who lived on the nearby island of Inishbofin, owned it from 1969 to 1998.“I got excited at the thought of buying this inaccessible holy island, restoring the beehive cells and oratory of its derelict hermitage and preserving the place from destruction,” he wrote in his memoir, The Kick.Visits to the island influenced some of his poems. According to Tim Robinson, author of a trilogy about Galway’s Connemara region, weather deterred Murphy from long visits. “After one spell of five days during which he saw the sun for 20 minutes he gave up spending more than a few hours there at a time.”Murphy sold High Island to a friend, Féichin Mulkerrin, who is now selling it.Spencer said the place was not all howling wind and darkness. “When we visited we had a stunning day out there. I’m in Connemara at the moment and it’s blue skies.”The existence of a small modern building and septic tank should help a new owner obtain planning permission for a new dwelling or rehabilitation, said the auctioneer.The online ad hinted at a fixer-upper: “Please note we have not tested any apparatus, fixtures, fittings or services. Interested parties must undertake their own investigation into the working order of these items.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7397b824c9b2d63fab957666a86c610a9329016/360_245_1959_1175/master/1959.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfee3fb8b3e6ef33647c4cbd4471cb66","title":"stunningly preserved fresco of narcissus discovered in pompeii","story":"Mythological hunter is depicted enraptured by his own reflection Archaeologists working in a richly decorated house in ancient Pompeii have discovered a stunningly preserved fresco depicting the mythological hunter Narcissus enraptured by his own reflection in a pool of water.The figure of Narcissus, who according to the myth fell in love with his own image to the point that he melted from the fire of passion burning inside him, was a fairly common theme in the first-century Roman city.The discovery, announced on Thursday, is in the atrium of a house where, back in November, excavations brought to light another fresco that portrays an erotic scene from the Greek myth of Leda and the Swan.“The beauty of these rooms has led us to modify the project and continue the excavation,” said the site’s director, Alfonsina Russo.“In the future this will allow us to open at least part of this domus to the public. Its excavation has been possible in the context of the broader intervention of stabilisation and re-profiling of the excavation fronts, overseen by the Great Pompeii Project.”The ancient city of Pompeii was destroyed in AD79 by an eruption that killed more than 2,000 people. The ruins have become one of the most visited archaeological sites in the world.The city, which attracts almost 4 million visitors a year, has come a long way since 2013, when Unesco threatened to place it on its list of world heritage sites in peril unless Italian authorities improved its preservation.On 16 October, archaeologists discovered an engraving that suggested the eruption occurred in October of AD79, and not August, as had been previously thought.Surprises unearthed in recent months include the remains of a horse and a home with an elaborate shrine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/446bf777a6840d43aa958156669d7b479e6fe340/0_22_1125_675/master/1125.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f423772a5429e3eed046d49929129334","title":"sweden investigates ambassador china strange meetings","story":"Daughter of Swedish bookseller jailed in China says Anna Lindstedt set up meetings in StockholmSweden is investigating its ambassador to China after she was accused of orchestrating a bizarre series of meetings between the daughter of a Swedish bookseller jailed in China and businessmen who said they could help secure his release.The story is detailed in a blogpost by Angela Gui, the daughter of Gui Minhai, a Chinese-born Swedish bookseller who has disappeared twice and is currently held in Chinese custody.Gui Minhai was one of five Hong Kong-based booksellers – known for publishing sensational tomes on the private lives of China’s elite – who disappeared in 2015 and resurfaced in mainland China two years later.He was released in October 2017, but was arrested on a train to Beijing in January 2018 while travelling with two Swedish diplomats. He was reportedly en route to see a Swedish specialist over fears he had the neurological disease Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS.Angela Gui, who is a PhD student at the University of Cambridge, has been vocal about calling for her father’s release.In the Medium post, Gui details the “very strange experience”, alleging that she was contacted by Anna Lindstedt, Sweden’s ambassador to China, in mid-January and invited to Stockholm to hear about a “new approach” to her father’s case.Lindstedt returned to Stockholm on Wednesday to meet officials from the foreign affairs ministry, the Swedish embassy in Beijing told Associated Press by phone. Lindstedt is not under criminal investigation. The embassy declined to give further details, but a foreign ministry spokesman in Sweden confirmed that Lindstedt’s departure was related to meetings she arranged between Gui and the Chinese businessmen.“She didn’t explain very much, but said that there were some businessmen she thought could help, and that they wanted to meet me in Stockholm. She’d join too, and these were people she trusted, she reassured me,” wrote Gui.Gui said the meetings were held at a hotel lounge, which required keycard access. She was encouraged not to leave the suite, with the businessmen saying they needed her to “be around as much as possible”. She said she was even escorted to and from the bathroom.After several days, during which time Gui says she was offered a job at the Chinese embassy, Gui said she felt a growing sense of unease.“There was a lot of wine, a lot of people, and a lot of increasingly strange questions. But because Ambassador Lindstedt was present and seemingly supportive of whatever it was that was going on, I kept assuming that this had been initiated by the Swedish foreign ministry,” wrote Gui.She alleges the men told her that talks were underway with Beijing to secure her father’s release but that in order for them to succeed Gui must stop talking about the case and avoid media engagement because “‘the Chinese’ were very angry with me”.Gui says Lindstedt agreed to the plan and promised that if Gui’s father was released she would “go on Swedish television and speak of the bright future of Sweden-China relations”.Gui claims that the conversations took a nasty turn, with one man saying she had to trust him or she would never see her father again and that her refusal to cooperate could harm the ambassador’s career.“Ambassador Lindstedt added that China were adopting a new diplomatic line which meant that if activism and media coverage was to continue, China might ‘punish Sweden’,” wrote Gui.Gui said she rang the ministry of foreign affairs the following week and they told her they were unaware that these meetings had taken place and were not even aware Lindstedt was in the country.A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Stockholm denied any involvement in the incident. “The embassy of the People’s Republic of China in Sweden would like to solemnly state that the Chinese side has never authorised and will not authorise anyone to engage with Gui Minhai’s daughter,” the spokesperson said. “China is a country of rule of law, and the result of the Gui Minhai case is to be decided by China’s law, instead of the so-called China’s representative claimed by Gui Minhai’s daughter or the press. We hope that some people will not try to gain publicity for themselves by making up a so-called China’s representative.”Gui concluded her post by saying she would continue to campaign for her father’s release: “I’m not going to be quiet in exchange for a visa and an arbitrary promise that my father ‘might’ be released. Threats, verbal abuse, bribes, or flattery won’t change that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f40b3a5769b2d97649f5f32a76a4ae55fee144f9/0_12_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4516c67e763bc91a5ce89fb5d68422ed","title":"us and israel say confrontation with iran needed for peace","story":"Vice-president tells event that EU mechanism to facilitate trade with Iran is ‘ill-advised’The US vice-president, Mike Pence, has sharply rebuked Washington’s European allies over their efforts to shield their businesses from US sanctions on Iran, as transatlantic tensions over US foreign policy were laid bare at a conference in Warsaw.A scheme the European Union has set up to facilitate trade with Iran was “an effort to break American sanctions against Iran’s murderous revolutionary regime”, Pence said during a conference on the Middle East organised by the US in the Polish capital.“It is an ill-advised step that will only strengthen Iran, weaken the EU and create still more distance between Europe and the US,” he said.In an unusually blunt and fiery address, Pence called on what he described as “freedom-loving nations” to stand against Iranian “evil”, and went so far as to accuse the regional power of plotting a “new Holocaust”.The Warsaw meeting was attended by more than 60 nations, but major European powers such as Germany and France, parties to the landmark 2015 nuclear accord with Iran, refused to send their top diplomats. The US-led summit focused on Iran but also the Israeli-Palestinian issue, over which European leaders have expressed frustration at Donald Trump’s aid cuts and diplomatic attacks against Palestinians.The US was represented in Warsaw by Pence, Mike Pompeo, Washington’s top diplomat, and Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and special aide on the Middle East. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, also attended.The Obama administration eased US sanctions on Iran under the terms of the nuclear deal, but Trump reimposed them when he withdrew the US from the agreement last year.“You can’t achieve stability in the Middle East without confronting Iran. It’s just not possible,” Pompeo told reporters after his formal opening statement. “There are malign influences in Lebanon, Yemen, Syria and Iraq … The three H’s: the Houthis, Hamas and Hezbollah, these are real threats,” he said, referring to groups Iran supports.Netanyahu had earlier withdrawn a claim on his Twitter account, said to be the result of a mistranslation, that he was in Warsaw to discuss war with Iran.Pence praised other nations for complying with US sanctions by reducing Iranian oil imports, but said the Europeans fell short. “Sadly, some of our leading European partners have not been nearly as cooperative,” Pence said. “In fact, they have led the effort to create mechanisms to break up our sanctions.”Pence then called for Europe to abandon the nuclear agreement altogether, making explicit a demand that Trump administration officials had previously only hinted at.European diplomats at the conference rejected Pence’s accusations. “We strongly disagree,” a diplomat from a major European power told Reuters.Netanyahu described the opening dinner at which he sat alongside senior officials from Arab Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, as a “historical turning point”. Many Arab states do not recognise Israel but they have been driven together by their common fear of Iran.It remains to be seen how far the new alliance can extend to a combined approach to the Palestinian issue. It is expected Kushner will discuss his peace plan with Arab leaders in private as well as at a public session on the sidelines of the summit.Netanyahu has argued that the Arab world is open to normalised economic ties with Israel that are not dependent on a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Pompeo’s call in his opening speech for a new era of cooperation in the Middle East will be viewed with scepticism by EU leaders, who feel they were not consulted on the US decision to pull out of the Iran deal, or the planned withdrawal of 2,000 US troops from Syria.In a sign of transatlantic ision, Niels Annen, a German minister of state for foreign affairs, said he was sceptical that the conference could deliver results on Iran. “I am hoping for constructive signals but nobody here has the expectation that this conference will solve problems,” he told reporters.The Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, described the Warsaw conference as “dead on arrival” and another attempt by the US to pursue an unfounded obsession with Iran.A former US ambassador to Sweden, Azita Raji, also dismissed the event, saying “conducting a lacklustre and rambling conference on the Middle East shows that it is amateur hour at the White House and is ultimately another blow to US prestige and leadership”.The Warsaw conference came as the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, increasingly seen as a key player in the Middle East, hosted his Iranian and Turkish counterparts to discuss a final settlement in the Syrian civil war, including the presence of large numbers of Islamist fighters in Idlib province.The three countries, particularly Turkey and Iran, do not agree on the final settlement in Syria, but have been uneasily cooperating to find a solution that does not betray their interests.Iran wants Turkey to agree that Syrian forces should be deployed along the border with Turkey, but there has also been a separate US discussion of an international force to assuage Kurdish fears of Turkish invasion once US forces depart.The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Wednesday that the leaders would also discuss forming a special committee tasked with drawing up a new postwar constitution for Syria. The composition of the committee, including the role of civil society, has been in dispute for more than a year.Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Prime minister fails to secure support for her approach to renegotiating EU dealIncident happened at about 10am between the Cookstown and Tallaght Hospital stopsKeith Gilroy was trying to offset his debts to criminals, court toldPatrick Quirke says he was shocked when he found body and called his wife out of \u0026lsquoinstinct\u0026rsquo\u0026lsquoThat\u0026rsquos another shovel to add to my collection\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash Leo VaradkarWoman alleges sexual abuse by her parents and neighbours when aged between four and sixWatchdog publishes 25 reports on centres for people with disabilitiesDaughter of patient was unable to wake worker who was asleep on two chairsRate is proof Clancy Amendment had been necessary, Minister for Transport saysFalse allegations made about consultant at James Connolly Memorial Hospital, DublinArmy will provide ambulances and crews to assist HSE during 10-hour stoppageFF says there are \u0026lsquoserious questions\u0026rsquo about sustainability of receiptsNetherlands\u0026rsquo foreign minister tweets photograph with creature sprawled across deskEnvironment agency criticises failure to tackle health threat problem quickly enoughEvery child in Dublin 24 area to receive one book every month until they are aged fiveGarda\u0026iacute said money was part of \u0026pound26.5m Northern Bank robbery in 2004This time last year, country shivered ahead of Beast from the EastLord Mayor of Dublin Nial Ring met mortgage debt demands on Clontarf house"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3793985.1550161972!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach and minister for transport turn sod on new dublin airport runway","story":"Residents of homes near Dublin Airport protested as Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tourism Minister Shane Ross performed the official sod-turning for the new North Runway project. Video: Bryan O\u0027Brien\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar  and Minister for Transport Tourism and Sport Shane Ross perform the official sod-turning for Dublin Airport’s new North Runway project, along with DAA chief executive Dalton Philips. Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill“That’s another shovel to add to my collection,” said Leo Varadkar after he’d finished throwing muck at a phalanx of photographers assembled to watch him and Shane Ross turn sods marking the start of work on the long awaited North Runway at Dublin Airport. As the Taoiseach and his transport minister stood under diggers artfully parked to resemble a love heart for the Valentine’s Day that was in it, the pair crossed their twin shovels - both of which came with added brass plaques to mark the occasion - and their pose prompted Leo to mangle the star-crossed lovers quote from Romeo and Juliet.There was no love lost for the Taoiseach among the small group of protestors who had gathered at the temporary gates what will someday be a 3.1km runway.It will - according to the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) - become the key gateway into Ireland and help create tens of thousands of jobs and contribute billions of euro to the economy.Sheela Morris was one of the protestors. She belongs to the St Margaret’s Concerned Residents Group who have campaigned for years to have activity at the airport restricted overnight so they can get some sleep. She said the DAA had completely ignored local resident’s concerns about the runway and warned that the lifting of planning conditions restricting the number of flights to and from the airport between 11pm and 7am would have a “massive impact” all their lives.“Our homes will be deemed worthless,” she said. “We won’t be able to live here. We have a voluntary buyout scheme out to us which is absolutely not fit for purpose.” “They are saying we are insignificant,” she continued. “But people matter, we matter, we have been living here for three generations. These are our homes and our lives. This is not just about bricks and mortar.” In response a DAA spokesman said: “The voluntary house purchase scheme, which applies to 38 houses, offers to pay a 30 per cent premium on the market value of each house. That the value will be assessed as if the North Runway was not being built. The scheme is entirely voluntary and if an owner decides not to participate, their house will be insulated by DAA to the highest standards.”‘The greater good’Around 250 homes are likely to be significantly impacted by the new runway and Mr Varadkar insisted that while the concerns of local people were not being ignored he was more focussed on what he described as “the greater good.”“That’s always the way with these projects,” he said. “You have to balance local concerns on the one hand with the needs and the greater good of the entire country. This airport is Ireland’s gateway to the world.”Mr Ross echoed his comments and said it was “absolutely wrong” to say local residents had been ignored in the process. The DAA chief executive Dalton Philips said they would have to be changed and he warned that if the number of flights the airport could handle overnight and in the early morning was restricted to 65 then it would be “catastrophic” for the airport and the country.“We want to challenge those conditions,” he said. “We don’t take it lightly. As the Taoiseach said, it’s about the wider economic good. There are residents that are impacted and we clearly engaged with them and we’re concerned about that.”The runway which has been talked about since the 1960s will cost around €320m and will be financed from the DAA’s revenue and borrowings with no bills landing at the Government’s door.The development will involve more than 300,000sqm of runway, 6km of internal roads, two electricity sub stations 11km of CCTV cable and 2,100 new runway lights. A new airport tower is also being build as well as €1.2 billion worth of improvements, including boarding gates are getting underway. All going to plan, the runway will be finished within two years with planes set to land and take off from it by 2022."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3789531.1549884117!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the galway professor behind our understanding of neanderthals","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA reconstruction of a Neanderthal man at a museum in Halle, Germany. We now know that Neanderthals are our closest ancestor and probably interbred with humans. File photograph: Sebastian WillnowAFPGetty ImagesWhen you imagine a Neanderthal you probably think of the classic image of the “cave man”: heavy brow, monkey-like face, stooping posture, shaggy hair, holding a big club. Although this is not how most scientists imagine Neanderthals today (have a look at http:www.nhm.ac.ukdiscoverwho-were-the-neanderthals.html), the early images were based on observed characteristics of Neanderthal skeletal remains. An Irish-based scientist, the geologist William King, had an important role in interpreting these remains and even provided the name Homo neanderthalensis to express his belief that they were the remains of a new species of hominid similar to, but distinct from, modern humans.The position of Neanderthals in the ancestral tree of Homo sapiens has been a subject of debate since the first skull was discovered in Germany in 1856. Since then, fragments of more than 500 iniduals have been discovered. Scientists have asked questions about Neanderthal language and cognition, about Neanderthal tools, about Neanderthal burial practices and beliefs. Perhaps the most furious debate has concerned their relationship to fully modern humans. After the Neanderthal genome was sequenced in 2010, the debate has focused on how much interbreeding occurred between communities of Neanderthals and of Homo sapiens in Europe. In short, what percentage of our DNA did we get from Neanderthals? Before genome sequencing, scientists could only use their knowledge of comparative anatomy to determine the relationship between fossilised remains and living organisms. Using a cast of a skull cap and the descriptions of other Neanderthal skeletal remains written by other scientists, King asserted that the remains found in the Neander valley were different enough from modern humans to form a new species.King, originally from Sunderland, had been appointed a professor of geology at one of the newly opened Queen’s Colleges in 1849. The controversial “non-denominational” colleges were the precursors of NUI Galway, University College Cork and Queen’s University Belfast and aimed to increase the opportunities for Ireland’s middle classes to access higher education. The colleges were particularly forward thinking in their focus on scientific instruction. Isolated in Galway with few students but with a good laboratory and access to the ever-increasing scientific periodical press, King ranged widely across many sciences we might now consider separate. Most geologists today would think twice about debating the comparative anatomy of modern humans, chimpanzees and ancient remains. Yet when King obtained a cast of the unusual German skull cap, he compared it with a variety of other skulls (using both a collection of objects and descriptions in scientific papers) and concluded that the skull was so different from modern humans as to constitute a new species. Before King’s contribution, the predominant view was that the Neanderthal might be a deformed or diseased human. King dismissed this idea with the suggestion that even the most degraded and “inferior” human races (as King believed races other than Europeans to be) showed a more spherical skull and a higher forehead than the Neanderthal skull cap suggested. During the 19th century, a high forehead was believed to indicate superior intelligence. Australian Aborigines were most Europeans’ favourite example of a supposedly “degraded” and “savage” race and King believed that even their skulls showed more similarity to modern humans than the Neanderthal skull. In short, the Neanderthal skull’s “strong simial tendencies” led King to believe that it was simply too different from humans to be of the same species. In his 1864 paper for the Quarterly Journal of Science he even proposed in a foonote that “I now feel strongly inclined to believe that it is not only specifically but generically distinct from Man”. That is, not a member of the genus Homo. It is hard for us to recapture the shock value of King’s ideas in asserting the existence of another species of human-like creatures at a time when the Biblical version of creation was widely considered an accurate description of the Earth’s history.Things have come almost full circle from King’s time: we now know that Neanderthals are our closest ancestor and probably interbred with humans. Yet what has remained curiously consistent is our belief that Neanderthals were inferior to modern humans, although the explanations have changed. Rather than the absence of a high forehead, scientists now refer to the absence of some kind of genetic adaptation that enabled Homo sapiens to create more advanced societies and out-compete their shorter, stockier neighbours.Dr Juliana Adelman lectures in history at Dublin City University"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/10/TELEMMGLPICT000051671687_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqO65TkrT7BriBrd3fK6VEg2oOnP5Tf-6BsL77M1adEXU.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"sir philip green staff told wear revealing clothes visited","story":"Sir Philip Green in 2014 with models, left to right, Suki Waterhouse, Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne, Sienna Miller and Naomi Campbell.

From finding love to toppling corrupt governments, this multi-billion dollar industry – with sharing as its organising principle – can be a force for good.As a former science and innovation minister, I know we are only at the start of this technological revolution. And I want Britain to be the go‑to place in Europe where digital platforms – including social media and messaging behemoths like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube and Tinder – can flourish.But that also means recognising that this great leap forward in connecting people can cause harm, to iniduals and society at large. The argument that the web should be beyond careful regulation is long past its sell by date. Social media giants have come of age and are making vast profits. Now they must take on the big responsibilities we expect of all big companies.To lead the world, therefore, Britain must set a new standard for these firms: to enhance their reputation and sustain their business models for the long term, by protecting their users.The time to act is now. A growing body of research has linked social media use to a range of mental health problems, from depression and anxiety to eating disorders and sleep problems. As the generation that use social media the most, it is those aged 16 to 24 that are being hardest hit.Duty of care puffA report by the Royal Society for Public Health suggested that social media can be more addictive than alcohol or cigarettes. Cyber‑bullying and grooming are rife on some platforms. The tragic suicide of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who was exposed to distressing material about depression and suicide on Instagram, brings home the dark side of social media. Systems designed to bring people together are leaving many young people feeling isolated, alone and alienated.The harmful effects extend beyond this, however. From extremism and intellectual property scams to subverting our democratic processes, the power of social media can all too easily be perverted.So we need a new approach that all social media sites will adopt – we need something that will go viral, so to speak. As the use of social media is increasingly universal, any solutions have to be systemic – and taken seriously by all the players in the industry. This is why I am backing the Daily ’s duty of care campaign.Put simply, social media giants should have a statutory duty of care to their users, obliging them to take more responsibility for reasonably foreseeable damage caused to iniduals and the public through use of their platforms. The idea of a duty of care set out in statute is not new. For decades, companies have had a duty of care to their employees as well as employers. As Professor Lorna Woods and William Perrin point out, there is no reason why a similar system cannot be evolved for the tech industry.Real and fast progress is vital. But this will only be achieved if the tech giants take the lead in working with a willing government to design this new statutory regime. The attention paid to this issue by this newspaper and the dignified campaign of Molly Russell’s parents have forced Instagram to welcome the idea of a duty of care. That is a good start, but it will take more than words to mitigate the harmful effects of social media.Duty of Care campaign | Read moreEffective leadership involves tech giants rethinking the design of their services in a safety-conscious way. Just as passenger, public and environmental safety is critical to the car manufacturing industry, social media platforms need to see prevention of harm as core to their business. We, rightly, expect more from business, with the demands on them to operate responsibly – wherever they are – increasingly daily.Tech giants spend serious money understanding their users. Investing in tools to limit the anxiety, insecurity and depression their services can foster (for example) should be part of their license to operate.If social media companies want to be a force for good, they must share the responsibility and lead the way in dealing with the bad. This should be their covenant with their customers.Duty of Care CampaignSenate approves William Barr as Donald Trump\u0026#39s new attorney generalComment: On Brexit, this desperate Government doesn’t know which way to turnBrexit latest news: Another defeat for Theresa May in the Commons after Brexiteer rebellionComment: Don’t underestimate the role of female jihadis like Shamina Begum Sweden recalls Chinese ambassador over unauthorised attempt to free dissident booksellerComment: Tory Brexiteers risk giving Brussels the perfect excuse not to give ground on the backstopMan whose death set off anti-migrant protests in Germany \u0026#39may have died in drug dispute\u0026#39Suicide car bomber kills at least 44 policemen in Indian KashmirValentine\u0026#39s Day 2019: Who was St Valentine and what is the true meaning behind February 14?Singer Ryan Adams hits back over claims of sexual misconductSearch for Shackleton\u0026#39s lost Endurance ship defeated by bad weather and bad luckJustice Department discussed forcing Donald Trump out of office, former FBI chief admitsDuke of Sussex jokes troops are \u0026#39weirdos\u0026#39 for Valentine\u0026#39s Day \u0026#39shrine\u0026#39 of Duchess inside iglooComment: John McDonnell has lost his grip on history: Winston Churchill was the father of the worker\u0026#39s tea break, a true working class heroExeter OAPs suffered \u0026#39serious head injuries\u0026#39 in suspected serial killing spree, police sayIsil schoolgirls: The journey from Bethnal Green to RaqqaBrexit latest odds tracker: Best bets on how (and if) Brexit will happenPrince Harry spends first married Valentine\u0026#39s Day in Arctic CircleEl Chapo\u0026#39s journey into folklore complete in home state where Cartel violence continues to rageWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"westminster dog show 2019 pictures","story":"Wire fox terrier wins Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in New York on Tuesday night, emerging as the top dog among nearly 3,000 barking, tail-wagging competitors.Senate approves William Barr as Donald Trump\u0026#39s new attorney generalComment: On Brexit, this desperate Government doesn’t know which way to turnBrexit latest news: Another defeat for Theresa May in the Commons after Brexiteer rebellionComment: Don’t underestimate the role of female jihadis like Shamina Begum Sweden recalls Chinese ambassador over unauthorised attempt to free dissident booksellerComment: Tory Brexiteers risk giving Brussels the perfect excuse not to give ground on the backstopMan whose death set off anti-migrant protests in Germany \u0026#39may have died in drug dispute\u0026#39Suicide car bomber kills at least 44 policemen in Indian KashmirValentine\u0026#39s Day 2019: Who was St Valentine and what is the true meaning behind February 14?Singer Ryan Adams hits back over claims of sexual misconductSearch for Shackleton\u0026#39s lost Endurance ship defeated by bad weather and bad luckJustice Department discussed forcing Donald Trump out of office, former FBI chief admitsDuke of Sussex jokes troops are \u0026#39weirdos\u0026#39 for Valentine\u0026#39s Day \u0026#39shrine\u0026#39 of Duchess inside iglooComment: John McDonnell has lost his grip on history: Winston Churchill was the father of the worker\u0026#39s tea break, a true working class heroExeter OAPs suffered \u0026#39serious head injuries\u0026#39 in suspected serial killing spree, police sayIsil schoolgirls: The journey from Bethnal Green to RaqqaBrexit latest odds tracker: Best bets on how (and if) Brexit will happenPrince Harry spends first married Valentine\u0026#39s Day in Arctic CircleEl Chapo\u0026#39s journey into folklore complete in home state where Cartel violence continues to rageWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/14/TELEMMGLPICT000153543299_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq44rdSC6sTNv0-awk2LQJvjqHtzf5oKeOIhbMcKsl7Co.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"happy valentines day 2019 date ideas february 14th st valentine","story":"Valentine\u0027s Day is here, with plenty of people sure to panic-purchase heart-adorned cards, bumper boxes of chocolate, bouquets of red roses and teddy bears wearing T-shirts emblazoned with cutesy messages in shops across the country.Now heavily commercialised and laden with expectation, the annual event was once a day where people earnestly showed their love and affection for another person.The oldest surviving Valentine\u0027s poem was written by a prison-entrapped, pining lover: Charles, Duke of Orleans wrote it for his wife in 1415, confined in the Tower of London after being captured at the Battle of Agincourt.However Valentine\u0027s Day was celebrated for centuries before that. From who the saint was to the best romantic gift ideas, here is everything you need to know about Valentine\u0027s Day.The event falls on the same day each year. February 14 of course - which this year is a Thursday. Couples across the globe typically recognise the annual celebration by exchanging gifts, flowers and cards, although it it isn\u0027t a public holiday in every country.Sweets for my sweet...While Valentine\u0027s Day is now heavily commercialised, the church originally decided to make the day a Christian celebration to honour St Valentine. The feast of St Valentine of February 14 was first established in 496 by Pope Gelasius I, who included Valentine among all those ... whose names are justly reverenced among men, but whose acts are known only to God.While the details of who St Valentine was are contested, one thing is agreed upon: he was martyred and buried on February 14 at the Roman cemetery on the Via Flaminia, the ancient road from Rome to Rimini.St Valentine is thought to have been imprisoned for secretly marrying Christian couplesHowever the details we have of St Valentine could be of one saint or two conflated saints with the same name this means there are many different biographies in circulation. The most popular legend is that St Valentine - a priest from Rome - was arrested after secretly marrying Christian couples, who were being persecuted by Emperor Claudius II in the third century AD.As helping Christians was considered a crime, St Valentine was imprisoned while in jail he attempted to convert the emperor to Christianity and was condemned to death. He was beaten with stones and clubs, before being beheaded outside the Flaminian Gate.According to some, while in prison St Valentine fell in love with the jailer’s daughter and sent her a love letter signed ‘from your Valentine’ on February 14, the day of his execution, as a goodbye.Wearing a coronet made from flowers and with a stencilled inscription, St Valentine\u0027s skull now resides in the Chiesa di Santa Maria in Cosmedin, on Rome’s Piazza Bocca della Verità.A casket containing a number of St Valentine\u0027s bones and a vial of his blood have been stored in the Whitefriar Street Church, in Dublin, since 1936, and couples regularly visit the religious shrine to ask him to watch over their lives.Many couples preparing to marry also head to this church on February 14, the feast day of the saint, for a Blessing of the Rings in the presence of the reliquary. Cupid is the god of desire, erotic love, attraction and affection. He is often portrayed as the son of the love goddess Venus and the war god Mars.Cupid is also known in Latin as Amor (Love). His Greek counterpart is Eros and he is just one of the ancient symbols associated with St Valentine’s Day, along with the shape of a heart, doves, and the colours red and pink.He is usually portrayed as a small winged figure with a bow and arrow which he uses to strike the hearts of people. People who fall in love are said to be ‘struck by Cupid’s arrow’.The heart was once associated with knowledge as well as feelings: Egyptians believed that the heart was the source of our memories, as well as our emotions. They placed so much value on the organ that they left it in people\u0027s bodies during mummification, while throwing all other organs, including the brain, away. And they weren\u0027t the only ones - Aristotle also believed that the heart was an organ of intellect.This idea was widely accepted until Galen, a Roman physician, said the heart was more likely to be responsible for emotions than reason - apart from love, which was found in the liver.As the influence of Christianity grew in the Middle Ages, so did the religion\u0027s pairing of the heart with love. \u0027Courtly love\u0027, where knights wooed women, became popular in the eleventh century and was tied to spiritual attainment.It became popularised in lyric poems written by troubadours, such as William of Aquitaine, one of the first troubadour poets. Some say he was likely influenced by similar views on love in the Islamic world, which he came into contact with during the First Crusade.In 1184, poet Andreas Capallenus referred to the organ as one of affection, writing ‘the pure love which binds together the hearts of two lovers with every feeling of delight’.Around the same time, members of European families began to insist their hearts were buried separately from the rest of their bodies, in places that were special to them. In 1199 King Richard I of England had his heart buried in Rouen in Normandy and his body in Anjou, where his father was buried.Over the centuries, the idea that the heart is linked to emotion has persisted and the two are now intrinsically linked.It was during the middle of the 18th century that Valentine\u0027s Day started to take off in England, with lovers sending sweets and cards adorned with flowers, ribbons and images of cupids and birds.Eventually huge numbers of printed cards replaced hand-written ones. In 1913, Hallmark Cards of Kansas City began mass producing Valentine\u0027s Day cards.Now about a billion Valentine\u0027s Day cards are exchanged every year and it\u0027s the second largest seasonal card sending time of the year.However, not all the cards are intended to be read: every year, thousands of letters addressed to Juliet are sent to Verona, where Shakespeare\u0027s fictional Romeo and Juliet lived.100 funny quotes about love, sex and marriageWhat message will you be writing to your loved one this Valentine\u0027s Day?If you\u0027re thinking of just putting Happy Valentine\u0027s Day and leaving it there - well, that\u0027s fine. Not all of us can be poets. But if you wanted to go for something a bit more elaborate, why not take inspiration from some of the greatest love letters ever written?Plus, if you want to quote the modern greats, look no further than  Culture\u0027s collection of the best love poems ever written.This trend was started by the Victorians, who thought it was bad luck to sign Valentine\u0027s cards with their names.The Victorians also started the rose-giving trend. They were the favourite flower of Venus, the Roman goddess of love, and have come to indicate passion and romance.Nowadays, more than 50 million roses are given for Valentine\u0027s Day every year. There will of course be some people who do not receive any cards, flowers or gifts on Valentine\u0027s Day. In 2016, one teenager solved that problem by buying 900 carnations and giving them to out to all the girls at his school.Valentine’s Day doesn’t have to mean buying out-of-season strawberries or boring boxes of chocolates - nowadays, there are more creative food gifts to show the love. From choux-art to cookery classes, here is how to woo the ravenous and romantic in style.Consider all things choux.

For inspiration, here are some of the best ever captured on film:A real contender for the title of greatest rom-com ever, and certainly the quickest witted, the climax here sees star reporter Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell) realise that her editor and ex-husband Walter Burns (Cary Grant) has engineered their quest for a scoop so that it also sabotages her plans to marry again. Instead of raging at such temerity, she falls gratefully into his arms. It’s a beautifully executed little twist, making it clear that the pair are in cahoots even when they’re apparently working against each other.10 Things I Hate About You (1999) - The Shakespearean-ish sonnetHeath Ledger’s grandstanding performance of I Love You Baby gets mentioned a lot in relation to romantic gestures in this film – but that’s a lark that’s relatively easy to laugh off. In terms of putting yourself out there for your other half, Julia Stiles’ Kat takes the bigger risks. First, she flashes a teacher to give Ledger’s Patrick the chance to escape detention. Then she reads a sonnet, no less, revealing her feelings for him to her entire class. The guts required are almost unthinkable.Beauty and the Beast (1991) - The libraryBelle (Paige O’Hara) isn’t particularly materialistic in this Oscar-nominated animation, but she’s as susceptible as the next bookworm to the gift of an entire, enormous library. This one comes with a convenient sofa by the fire and sweeping baroque staircases to shelves that stretch about 200ft. in the air. The fact that the Beast (Robbie Benson) – previously bad-tempered and hostile – presents his revelation with a charming degree of shyness and hope just makes it all the sweeter. He was originally cursed for his selfishness, so the thought counts all the more here.While Britons tend to think of red roses, corny cards and chocolates when it comes to Valentine\u0027s Day, some countries around the world celebrate love differently and have their own traditions.In Denmark, couples exchange pressed white flowers called snowdrops while in the Philippines, weddings and vow renewal ceremonies significantly increase on the romantic day, with couples gathering at shopping centres and other public places to tie the knot.In South Africa, women wear their hearts on their sleeves on Valentine\u0027s Day, quite literally, by pinning the names of their love interests to their shirts.China celebrate its own version of Valentine\u0027s Day called Qiki, during which young women prepare offerings of fruit to Zhinu, a heavenly king\u0027s daughter, in the hope of finding their perfect match.In Brazil, they celebrate Dia dos Namorados, translating as Lovers\u0027 Day, on June 12, with music festivals and performances, while in Argentina, they celebrate love for an entire week during July, in what is called Sweetness Week.If you\u0027re single and looking for love, look no further than online dating. Any stigma which may have surrounded searching for love online has been banished, and meeting for a mid-week Tinder date is no longer something people feel they have to lie about.But given how much choice is out there, how can you separate the wheat from the chaff? We\u0027ve selected the top 20 dating apps to help you find your perfect match.Looking for love?

undertaking winter weather training.Harry arrived on a private jet at the remote Bardufoss air station shortly after 11.15am local time (10.15am GMT), where he was greeted by UK ambassador to Norway Richard Wood.The duke is spending his first Valentine\u0027s Day as a married man in one of the planet\u0027s harshest climates, although the temperature of minus 2C was much milder than the minus 35C servicemen and women can expect.Harry\u0027s trip marks the 50th anniversary of Commando Helicopter Force and Joint Helicopter Command deploying to the remote base, where military personnel are taught how to survive, operate and fight in the sub-zero conditions, as well as gaining experience of operating aircraft in severe cold weather and mountainous environments.The multinational Exercise Clockwork, hosted by the Norwegian armed forces, comprises environmental flying qualifications, cold weather survival, and snow and ice driving courses.The duke, in his role as Captain General Royal Marines, spent the afternoon meeting military personnel living and training at the base.Prince Harry visited a Quincey Shelter plastered with photos from his wedding dayHe will saw field tents, snow vehicles and a Quincey Shelter, a makeshift shelter built of snow in which the elite forces are able to camp.Harry was appointed Captain General Royal Marines in December 2017, taking over the role from his grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh, who held the appointment for 64 years.He already has experience of colder climates, facing temperatures as low as minus 35C on charity expeditions.Harry took part in treks to the North Pole in 2011 and South Pole in 2013 with Walking With The Wounded.The Duke of Sussex met troops participating in Exercise Clockwork in Bardufoss, NorwayLieutenant Colonel David West, officer commanding Exercise Clockwork, said: We are celebrating 50 years of Exercise Clockwork today and are honoured to be able to welcome the Captain General of the Royal Marines to Bardufoss to mark the occasion.Harry is used to rigours of harsh climates and so will fully understand the dangers of trying to live and operate in such an extreme environment.Clockwork continues to deliver vital training for our people.It provides essential experience in flying and surviving in the extreme cold hundreds of miles inside the Arctic Circle.For 50 years Commando Helicopter Force and its predecessors have operated in this region and the skills learnt here are more relevant than ever.Comment: Don’t underestimate the role of female jihadis like Shamina Begum Sweden recalls

And they could be as big a change as when the wires dropped out of Apple\u0027s existing headphones and they were first born.Introduced in 2016, the two truly wireless earphones haven\u0027t been updated since. They came with a wide range of futuristic features – but a range of rumours have swirled around them about new updates, that would bring new and even more futuristic features.The AirPods are actually two (or three) different things: the case that protects them and the earphones that sit inside. Until recently, they\u0027d be considered one and the same – but recent leaks have suggested that Apple might update the two separately, with different release dates.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialAccording to recent rumours, the new case is likely to arrive earlier, and maybe soon. It could even be a part of Apple\u0027s March event. The actual release date is probably dependent on when Apple releases the AirPower mat that it\u0027s charging could rely on.The earphones themselves are likely to undergo a more dramatic reinvention. But that could also take longer to arrive. Those could not be updated for some months, according to recent rumours – and perhaps won\u0027t even arrive until September, when the new phones are introduced.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

And most of the rumours focus around how exactly it would do that.New AirPods charging case could come before updated earphonesMost likely, the biggest change in any new case would be the addition of wireless charging. That would allow them to charge up just like a phone, being able to be plonked down a wireless charging puck and then transfer that into its battery as well as the AirPods themselves.Apple has actually teased a new case before, when it announced the AirPower wireless charging mat. It said that a new case would be needed to allow the AirPods to be charged through that new product – but then the new product never actually arrived.The company did say then that the case would be updated but that the existing AirPods would be compatible with the new one. And people would be able to pay a reduced price just to buy the case and update, it made clear – an offer that will presumably stay around with the new earphones.Another rumoured change includes the addition of a new and grippier kind of plastic, which should make the box easier to hold. And if as suggested Apple does introduce new colours of AirPods, such as black, presumably the case will also change colour too.But it\u0027s the earphones that have most of the technology. Rumours have suggested that a whole host of new (and sometimes strange)\u0026nbspfeatures could be coming to the new earbuds.The most likely feature – in part because it\u0027s been apparently revealed by Apple\u0027s own software – is always-on Hey Siri. That will mean that people don\u0027t have to do the uncomfortable move of tapping their own ears to wake the earphones up, and instead just say Hey Siri any time they\u0027re wearing their AirPods to speak with the voice assistant.Other rumoured updates including new health tracking tools. Apple has been keen to get into those features with technology like the Apple Watch, and the inside of people\u0027s ears is a great place to take readings for things like heartbeat and temperature, which could happen with future AirPods.Apple is also likely to improve the performance in less obvious ways. The new buds will probably feature better wireless connectivity, and improved waterproofing.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The argument revolves around a feature called envelope tracking, which allows the phones to improve their battery life while they send and receive wireless signals.Qualcomm claimed that some of the non-Qualcomm\u0026nbspchips Apple was using infinged those patents, and should be removed from sale.German courts agreed with Qualcomm, and banned sale of the iPhones that used those chips. That led Apple to completely remove those phones from sale in both its retail and online stores, while an appeal continues.Now Apple said it will put those phones back on sale, but will only use the versions that feature the Qualcomm chips and so will be in line with the court\u0027s decision.The dispute between Apple and Qualcomm has been felt across the world. In December, Apple was also ordered to stop selling some iPhones in China because of a similar argument.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.She dresses like a primary school teacher, smiles like the Cheshire cat, and sees the best in absolutely everybody: Kimmy Schmidt is an unusual heroine today. There’s no cynicism, sneering, or snark here – listening to her naive optimism is like seeing your twitter feed in negative. But the clever thing about Tina Fey’s fast-paced, wise-cracking show is that it isn’t, well, too fey. Kimmy’s zest for life comes from having been held captive in an underground bunker for years rather than being broken by that, she emerges determined to get the most out of life. Four seasons in, there’s still something rather inspiring about that. If you’ve ever dreamt of sacking off the rat race and giving countryside self-sufficiency a try, why not live vicariously through this delightful, warm-hearted Seventies sitcom? Here, though, Tom (Richard Briers) and Barbara (an effortlessly cool Felicity Kendal) don’t quite make it to the countryside, instead attempting to raise goats, pigs, and chickens in their suburban back garden after Tom packs in his corporate job. Buoyed by its wonderful supporting characters, namely the Good’s painfully conventional next-door neighbours Margo and Jerry Leadbetter, The Good Life is an utter joy.310 Pride and PrejudiceThe work of Jane Austen, as a whole, is a kind of the ultimate comfort blanket. She offers us a smart, witty view on the world, where love can be transformative, but should never be pursued at the cost of losing all your senses. The BBC’s 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice captures this feeling, and has dynamism to spare. It’s wistful and romantic without feeling naive, anchored by a relatable heroine in Jennifer Ehle’s Elizabeth Bennet, and (of course) features that swoon-worthy, brooding performance from Colin Firth as Mr Darcy. Then there’s the lake scene – need I say more?Five gay American men do a makeover, and it’s fabulous. That’s the basic premise of Queer Eye, a Netflix reboot that introduced the world to the new Fab Five. Each has their area of expertise – Antoni Porowski teaches cooking, Tan France es into wardrobes, Karamo Brown provides life coaching, Bobby Berk re-designs their homes, and Jonathan Van Ness is in charge of grooming – and each one makes the show that little bit special in their own way. Even when the person getting the makeover is at the other end of the political spectrum to our hosts, the show focuses on the positives and shows that everyone, whether they’re democrat or republican, can do with a little self-love.Stars Hollow is excellent in all seasons, as demonstrated by Gilmore Girls: A Year in the LifeThis early Noughties comedy may be the product of its time, but it still makes for deeply unchallenging viewing. A single mother, Lorelai, and her teenaged daughter, Rory, have an upbeat and supportive relationship, speaking in snappy one-liners and rapid-fire dialogue. They live in Stars Hollow, a pastel picture of small town America at its most loveably eccentric. While it delivers poignant emotional truths galore, the focus is blessedly narrow, the stakes untroubingly low, and the outcome usually uplifting. Gilmore Girls has all the bite of a marshmallow – but soft and gooey is, sometimes, just what you need. Could there be a more quintessentially British TV show than The Great British Bake-Off? A batch of contestants try their hardest to impress two judges with their ornate cakes and pastries, all while cheering each other on and become the best of friends. There’s not a whiff of bitterness between them as they leave the tent – only sadness that Paul may never taste their grandma’s macaron recipe. And with the sardonic wit of Mel and SueNoel and Sandi keeping things fun – even when the pressures on – there’s never a mean-spirited moment. Bewitched is absolutely the product of its time, but that’s also what makes it so delightfully subversive. Samantha Stephens (Elizabeth Montgomery) is, on the surface, the ideal housewife of the 1960s. Each episode ends with her household in perfect order, dinner on the table, and a martini ready for her husband the second he walks through the door. Yet the joy of Bewitched comes from the fact that Samantha does these things with a wry smirk. We know she’s a witch, after all, actively choosing to the wear the guise of housewife despite the option to live as an all-powerful, supernatural being. We also know that it’s often her pulling the strings behind-the-scenes on this idyllic marriage. Despite its mid-century suburban sheen, Bewitched is a rebel in disguise. And that’s always enlivening to watch. Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a friendly embrace of a TV series, a sitcom in which all members of its erse ensemble deliver on cheer and belly laughs in each and every episode. Its the endlessly likeable Andy Samberg who leads the charge, and his Peter Pan-style detective Jake Peralta is the kind of character that makes you feel any issue can be resolved. As such, the show offers more of a motivational boost than you might expect for a series about hapless members of a police precinct. After all, if they can do it, anyone can.A staple on ITV3, Inspector Morse is the televisual equivalent of slipping on your favourite slippers: familiar and cosy. Sure, there are quite a few murders, but what about that beautiful Oxford setting, where dreaming spires tower above the grisliness? It\u0027s intelligent and has brilliant characterisation, with John Thaw\u0027s curmudgeonly, Wagner-loving, real-ale man its wonderful centre of gravity. The series ran from 1987 to 2000 and its legacy has lived on through spin-offs Lewis and Endeavour, but neither of which can quite match this series for charm. Sure, the further away we get from the end of Friends’s decade long run, the more blatant its many problematic moments are – but this ensemble sit-com is also enduringly funny, brilliantly acted, and endlessly bingeable. It rightly made stars of its six cast members when it premiered in 1994, and managed to continually evolve through the course of its ten seasons without losing its warm, inimitable charm. Once you\u0027re hooked, you\u0027ll have 236 episodes to get your teeth into – which is enough that by the time you\u0027re done, you\u0027ll be ready to start again.She dresses like a primary school teacher, smiles like the Cheshire cat, and sees the best in absolutely everybody: Kimmy Schmidt is an unusual heroine today.

A batch of contestants try their hardest to impress two judges with their ornate cakes and pastries, all while cheering each other on and become the best of friends. There’s not a whiff of bitterness between them as they leave the tent – only sadness that Paul may never taste their grandma’s macaron recipe. And with the sardonic wit of Mel and SueNoel and Sandi keeping things fun – even when the pressures on – there’s never a mean-spirited moment. Bewitched is absolutely the product of its time, but that’s also what makes it so delightfully subversive. Samantha Stephens (Elizabeth Montgomery) is, on the surface, the ideal housewife of the 1960s. Each episode ends with her household in perfect order, dinner on the table, and a martini ready for her husband the second he walks through the door. Yet the joy of Bewitched comes from the fact that Samantha does these things with a wry smirk. We know she’s a witch, after all, actively choosing to the wear the guise of housewife despite the option to live as an all-powerful, supernatural being. We also know that it’s often her pulling the strings behind-the-scenes on this idyllic marriage. Despite its mid-century suburban sheen, Bewitched is a rebel in disguise. And that’s always enlivening to watch. Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a friendly embrace of a TV series, a sitcom in which all members of its erse ensemble deliver on cheer and belly laughs in each and every episode. Its the endlessly likeable Andy Samberg who leads the charge, and his Peter Pan-style detective Jake Peralta is the kind of character that makes you feel any issue can be resolved. As such, the show offers more of a motivational boost than you might expect for a series about hapless members of a police precinct. After all, if they can do it, anyone can.A staple on ITV3, Inspector Morse is the televisual equivalent of slipping on your favourite slippers: familiar and cosy. Sure, there are quite a few murders, but what about that beautiful Oxford setting, where dreaming spires tower above the grisliness? It\u0027s intelligent and has brilliant characterisation, with John Thaw\u0027s curmudgeonly, Wagner-loving, real-ale man its wonderful centre of gravity. The series ran from 1987 to 2000 and its legacy has lived on through spin-offs Lewis and Endeavour, but neither of which can quite match this series for charm. Sure, the further away we get from the end of Friends’s decade long run, the more blatant its many problematic moments are – but this ensemble sit-com is also enduringly funny, brilliantly acted, and endlessly bingeable. It rightly made stars of its six cast members when it premiered in 1994, and managed to continually evolve through the course of its ten seasons without losing its warm, inimitable charm. Once you\u0027re hooked, you\u0027ll have 236 episodes to get your teeth into – which is enough that by the time you\u0027re done, you\u0027ll be ready to start again.Carr said: “Wow!

There’s no cynicism, sneering, or snark here – listening to her naive optimism is like seeing your twitter feed in negative. But the clever thing about Tina Fey’s fast-paced, wise-cracking show is that it isn’t, well, too fey. Kimmy’s zest for life comes from having been held captive in an underground bunker for years rather than being broken by that, she emerges determined to get the most out of life. Four seasons in, there’s still something rather inspiring about that. If you’ve ever dreamt of sacking off the rat race and giving countryside self-sufficiency a try, why not live vicariously through this delightful, warm-hearted Seventies sitcom? Here, though, Tom (Richard Briers) and Barbara (an effortlessly cool Felicity Kendal) don’t quite make it to the countryside, instead attempting to raise goats, pigs, and chickens in their suburban back garden after Tom packs in his corporate job. Buoyed by its wonderful supporting characters, namely the Good’s painfully conventional next-door neighbours Margo and Jerry Leadbetter, The Good Life is an utter joy.310 Pride and PrejudiceThe work of Jane Austen, as a whole, is a kind of the ultimate comfort blanket. She offers us a smart, witty view on the world, where love can be transformative, but should never be pursued at the cost of losing all your senses. The BBC’s 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice captures this feeling, and has dynamism to spare. It’s wistful and romantic without feeling naive, anchored by a relatable heroine in Jennifer Ehle’s Elizabeth Bennet, and (of course) features that swoon-worthy, brooding performance from Colin Firth as Mr Darcy. Then there’s the lake scene – need I say more?Five gay American men do a makeover, and it’s fabulous. That’s the basic premise of Queer Eye, a Netflix reboot that introduced the world to the new Fab Five. Each has their area of expertise – Antoni Porowski teaches cooking, Tan France es into wardrobes, Karamo Brown provides life coaching, Bobby Berk re-designs their homes, and Jonathan Van Ness is in charge of grooming – and each one makes the show that little bit special in their own way. Even when the person getting the makeover is at the other end of the political spectrum to our hosts, the show focuses on the positives and shows that everyone, whether they’re democrat or republican, can do with a little self-love.Stars Hollow is excellent in all seasons, as demonstrated by Gilmore Girls: A Year in the LifeThis early Noughties comedy may be the product of its time, but it still makes for deeply unchallenging viewing. A single mother, Lorelai, and her teenaged daughter, Rory, have an upbeat and supportive relationship, speaking in snappy one-liners and rapid-fire dialogue. They live in Stars Hollow, a pastel picture of small town America at its most loveably eccentric. While it delivers poignant emotional truths galore, the focus is blessedly narrow, the stakes untroubingly low, and the outcome usually uplifting. Gilmore Girls has all the bite of a marshmallow – but soft and gooey is, sometimes, just what you need. Could there be a more quintessentially British TV show than The Great British Bake-Off? A batch of contestants try their hardest to impress two judges with their ornate cakes and pastries, all while cheering each other on and become the best of friends. There’s not a whiff of bitterness between them as they leave the tent – only sadness that Paul may never taste their grandma’s macaron recipe. And with the sardonic wit of Mel and SueNoel and Sandi keeping things fun – even when the pressures on – there’s never a mean-spirited moment. Bewitched is absolutely the product of its time, but that’s also what makes it so delightfully subversive. Samantha Stephens (Elizabeth Montgomery) is, on the surface, the ideal housewife of the 1960s. Each episode ends with her household in perfect order, dinner on the table, and a martini ready for her husband the second he walks through the door. Yet the joy of Bewitched comes from the fact that Samantha does these things with a wry smirk. We know she’s a witch, after all, actively choosing to the wear the guise of housewife despite the option to live as an all-powerful, supernatural being. We also know that it’s often her pulling the strings behind-the-scenes on this idyllic marriage. Despite its mid-century suburban sheen, Bewitched is a rebel in disguise. And that’s always enlivening to watch. Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a friendly embrace of a TV series, a sitcom in which all members of its erse ensemble deliver on cheer and belly laughs in each and every episode. Its the endlessly likeable Andy Samberg who leads the charge, and his Peter Pan-style detective Jake Peralta is the kind of character that makes you feel any issue can be resolved. As such, the show offers more of a motivational boost than you might expect for a series about hapless members of a police precinct. After all, if they can do it, anyone can.A staple on ITV3, Inspector Morse is the televisual equivalent of slipping on your favourite slippers: familiar and cosy. Sure, there are quite a few murders, but what about that beautiful Oxford setting, where dreaming spires tower above the grisliness? It\u0027s intelligent and has brilliant characterisation, with John Thaw\u0027s curmudgeonly, Wagner-loving, real-ale man its wonderful centre of gravity. The series ran from 1987 to 2000 and its legacy has lived on through spin-offs Lewis and Endeavour, but neither of which can quite match this series for charm. Sure, the further away we get from the end of Friends’s decade long run, the more blatant its many problematic moments are – but this ensemble sit-com is also enduringly funny, brilliantly acted, and endlessly bingeable. It rightly made stars of its six cast members when it premiered in 1994, and managed to continually evolve through the course of its ten seasons without losing its warm, inimitable charm. Once you\u0027re hooked, you\u0027ll have 236 episodes to get your teeth into – which is enough that by the time you\u0027re done, you\u0027ll be ready to start again.She dresses like a primary school teacher, smiles like the Cheshire cat, and sees the best in absolutely everybody: Kimmy Schmidt is an unusual heroine today.

Here, though, Tom (Richard Briers) and Barbara (an effortlessly cool Felicity Kendal) don’t quite make it to the countryside, instead attempting to raise goats, pigs, and chickens in their suburban back garden after Tom packs in his corporate job. Buoyed by its wonderful supporting characters, namely the Good’s painfully conventional next-door neighbours Margo and Jerry Leadbetter, The Good Life is an utter joy.310 Pride and PrejudiceThe work of Jane Austen, as a whole, is a kind of the ultimate comfort blanket. She offers us a smart, witty view on the world, where love can be transformative, but should never be pursued at the cost of losing all your senses. The BBC’s 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice captures this feeling, and has dynamism to spare. It’s wistful and romantic without feeling naive, anchored by a relatable heroine in Jennifer Ehle’s Elizabeth Bennet, and (of course) features that swoon-worthy, brooding performance from Colin Firth as Mr Darcy. Then there’s the lake scene – need I say more?Five gay American men do a makeover, and it’s fabulous. That’s the basic premise of Queer Eye, a Netflix reboot that introduced the world to the new Fab Five. Each has their area of expertise – Antoni Porowski teaches cooking, Tan France es into wardrobes, Karamo Brown provides life coaching, Bobby Berk re-designs their homes, and Jonathan Van Ness is in charge of grooming – and each one makes the show that little bit special in their own way. Even when the person getting the makeover is at the other end of the political spectrum to our hosts, the show focuses on the positives and shows that everyone, whether they’re democrat or republican, can do with a little self-love.Stars Hollow is excellent in all seasons, as demonstrated by Gilmore Girls: A Year in the LifeThis early Noughties comedy may be the product of its time, but it still makes for deeply unchallenging viewing. A single mother, Lorelai, and her teenaged daughter, Rory, have an upbeat and supportive relationship, speaking in snappy one-liners and rapid-fire dialogue. They live in Stars Hollow, a pastel picture of small town America at its most loveably eccentric. While it delivers poignant emotional truths galore, the focus is blessedly narrow, the stakes untroubingly low, and the outcome usually uplifting. Gilmore Girls has all the bite of a marshmallow – but soft and gooey is, sometimes, just what you need. Could there be a more quintessentially British TV show than The Great British Bake-Off? A batch of contestants try their hardest to impress two judges with their ornate cakes and pastries, all while cheering each other on and become the best of friends. There’s not a whiff of bitterness between them as they leave the tent – only sadness that Paul may never taste their grandma’s macaron recipe. And with the sardonic wit of Mel and SueNoel and Sandi keeping things fun – even when the pressures on – there’s never a mean-spirited moment. Bewitched is absolutely the product of its time, but that’s also what makes it so delightfully subversive. Samantha Stephens (Elizabeth Montgomery) is, on the surface, the ideal housewife of the 1960s. Each episode ends with her household in perfect order, dinner on the table, and a martini ready for her husband the second he walks through the door. Yet the joy of Bewitched comes from the fact that Samantha does these things with a wry smirk. We know she’s a witch, after all, actively choosing to the wear the guise of housewife despite the option to live as an all-powerful, supernatural being. We also know that it’s often her pulling the strings behind-the-scenes on this idyllic marriage. Despite its mid-century suburban sheen, Bewitched is a rebel in disguise. And that’s always enlivening to watch. Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a friendly embrace of a TV series, a sitcom in which all members of its erse ensemble deliver on cheer and belly laughs in each and every episode. Its the endlessly likeable Andy Samberg who leads the charge, and his Peter Pan-style detective Jake Peralta is the kind of character that makes you feel any issue can be resolved. As such, the show offers more of a motivational boost than you might expect for a series about hapless members of a police precinct. After all, if they can do it, anyone can.A staple on ITV3, Inspector Morse is the televisual equivalent of slipping on your favourite slippers: familiar and cosy. Sure, there are quite a few murders, but what about that beautiful Oxford setting, where dreaming spires tower above the grisliness? It\u0027s intelligent and has brilliant characterisation, with John Thaw\u0027s curmudgeonly, Wagner-loving, real-ale man its wonderful centre of gravity. The series ran from 1987 to 2000 and its legacy has lived on through spin-offs Lewis and Endeavour, but neither of which can quite match this series for charm. Sure, the further away we get from the end of Friends’s decade long run, the more blatant its many problematic moments are – but this ensemble sit-com is also enduringly funny, brilliantly acted, and endlessly bingeable. It rightly made stars of its six cast members when it premiered in 1994, and managed to continually evolve through the course of its ten seasons without losing its warm, inimitable charm. Once you\u0027re hooked, you\u0027ll have 236 episodes to get your teeth into – which is enough that by the time you\u0027re done, you\u0027ll be ready to start again.He suggested that the character may also still be living in Chicago, where he moved at the end of the show’s final episode, leaving the familiar surroundings of the show’s Seattle setting.\u0026nbspThe actor further mentioned the death of the actor who played his onscreen father, adding: “Certainly, John Mahoney died over a year ago and we would probably deal with that a little bit, dad being gone.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Phantom Thread has all the trappings of a conventional period romance. Daniel Day-Lewis plays Reynolds Woodcock, a famous dressmaker who falls in love with Alma (Vicky Krieps), a waitress who later becomes his muse. Paul Thomas Anderson’s twisted romance flies off in some psychologically dark and unexpected directions, but the arc is that of a storybook love affair, of two people taking extraordinary measures to hold onto the one they love.Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga scored big at the box office with last year’s A Star is Born remake, but for many, the definitive version was released nearly 65 years earlier. James Mason plays the alcoholic actor whose career is on the wane, while Judy Garland is the supremely talented up-and-coming singer he meets in a nightclub. Although there were two other major screen versions of the story – one in 1937, the other in 1976 starring Barbara Streisand and Kris Kristofferson – Garland boasts the strongest singing voice of any, and her chemistry with Mason is superb.In this futuristic romance, Joaquin Phoenix plays a man who falls in love with an artificially intelligent computer system, voiced by Scarlett Johannsson. Her – written and directed by Spike Jonze – treats Phoenix\u0027s courtship with all the sensitivity of a flesh-and-blood romance, and what could be a cringe-worthy or facetious premise instead blossoms into a touchingly sincere examination of love in the age of technology.This romcom from 1999 brings Hugh Grant’s down-to-earth bookshop owner into the orbit of an A-list actress played by Julia Roberts, and the unlikeliest of British love affairs ensues. Scripted by Richard Curtis, who had already proved himself a dab hand in the genre with Four Weddings and a Funeral, the film manages to stay charming and keep its tone light, even as its romantic plotline descends into schmaltz.True Romance has an all-star cast that includes Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt and James Gandolfini, but eyes are mostly kept on the whirlwind romance struck up between Clarence and Alabama (played by Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette), who go on the run with a suitcase full of cocaine belonging to a notorious gangster. Quentin Tarantino’s script wades through some heavy subject matter, and includes plenty of his characteristic violence, underscored by an effective score from Hans Zimmer.620 Harold and Maude (1971)Age-gap relationships are common in cinema, but seldom like in Harold and Maude. Harold (Bud Cort) is an 18-year-old with an overbearing mother who spends his free time staging elaborate fake suicides. After meeting Maude (Ruth Gordon), a 79-year-old woman trying to grab life by the horns, he falls in love. Hal Ashby’s off-beat cult classic doesn’t shy away from the social taboos of their relationship, but make no mistake, Harold and Maude is an earnest and deeply moving romance at its core.720 Beauty and the Beast (1991)The classic French fairy-tale – about the love between a beautiful woman and a prince cursed to live as a beast – has been adapted countless times, most recently into a live-action blockbuster starring Emma Watson. Disney’s 1991 animated musical, however, is the superior on-screen rendering of the romance. Although elements of the story now seem problematic – most glaringly the idea of the Beast imprisoning Belle, and she loving him despite this – there\u0027s still a lot of appeal in the songs, and the hand-drawn animation is fluid and endearing.Positioning three of Old Hollywood’s most beloved stars at the corners of a love triangle, The Philadelphia Story is one of the most enduring romcoms of all time. Navigating its way around the strict Production Code rules regarding extra-marital affairs, George Cukor’s film tells the story of a orced couple (Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant) who are drawn back together despite the allure of a third party (Jimmy Stewart). All three actors play to their strengths: Grant is suave and sardonic, Stewart wide-eyed and self-effacing, while Hepburn is given a strong role in the woman who must choose between her capable suitors.In Carol, Cate Blanchett plays Carol Aird, a woman in the midst of a difficult orce who falls in love with a young photographer, Therese, played by Rooney Mara. The film – a sexy and stylish period piece directed by Todd Haynes – won a host of Oscar nominations, and stands as one of the most specific and deftly crafted representations of female desire in mainstream cinema, earning a particularly devoted fanbase in the LGBTQ community.The highest-grossing French-language film of all time in the US, Amélie is a modern-day fairy-tale about a socially maladjusted young woman who decides to dedicate her life to impishly and secretly helping others. The film leans into the tweeness of its premise, as well as the romance of its Parisian setting, to build a gradual love story that’s straight from the heart. It’s not all sweetness, however, and some of the more world-weary touches – such as Amélie’s lover working in a sex shop – help give the film some sharp edges, and a comic bite.Ang Lee’s Brokeback Mountain stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger as two sheep herders who go through a turbulent but passionate romance. The film’s open and unapologetic depiction of sex and queer relationships made it a landmark release for LGBT representation in mainstream cinema.Directed by Frank Capra, master of the feel-good film, It Happened One Night mixes screwball comedy with heartfelt romance. Claudette Colbert plays a wealthy socialite who decides to slum it with an abrasive but charismatic news reporter, played by Clark Gable. One of only three films to ever win all five major Oscars (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and Screenplay), It Happened One Night endures as the gold standard for a classical Hollywood romcom.1320 Call Me by Your Name (2017)Set in an Edenic villa “somewhere in Northern Italy”, Call Me by Your Name tells the story of Elio (Timothée Chalamet), a smart but directionless 17-year-old who falls in love with his father’s research assistant Oliver (Armie Hammer). Luca Guadagnino’s languid romance is well on its way to being considered a modern queer classic and it made an instant star out of Chalamet when it hit cinemas in 2017.Richard Linklater’s minimalist romance pairs Ethan Hawke with Julie Delpy as two love-struck strangers who meet on a train and spend the evening together wandering around Vienna. The naturally romantic city is the perfect background for a soft and thoughtful meditation on love, fate and missed opportunities. Hawke and Delpy reportedly crafted much of the naturalistic dialogue through improvisation sessions, for which they were uncredited. They would, however, be credited in the film’s two sequels – Before Sunset (2004) and Before Midnight (2013).2016 Best Picture winner Moonlight is a radical film: a queer romance with an all-black cast that captures a boy’s coming-of-age with heart-wrenching specificity. Chiron, the protagonist, is played by three actors across three chapters of his life – and the third act, in which an adult Chiron (Trevante Rhodes) reconnects with an old flame, is one of the most heart-rending in modern cinema. Writer-director Barry Jenkins showed himself to have a poet’s ear for dialogue and James Laxton’s camerawork perfectly captures the vibrancy and the physicality of romantic attraction.1620 In the Mood for Love (2000)One of the most acclaimed pieces of Asian cinema of all time, In the Mood for Love is a masterful study in love behind closed doors, tracking the emotional affair between two people who realise their spouses are having an affair together. Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung are exceptional in the lead roles as two soulmates struggling to contain their desire. In 2016, the film was voted the second-best film of the 21st century in a BBC critics poll.David Lean’s tender depiction of an unconsummated extra-marital affair remains one of the finest love stories ever told, and frequently ranks among the best British films ever made. Adapted from Noel Coward’s one-act play Still Life, Brief Encounter focuses on the relationship between Laura Jesson (Celia Johnson) and Dr Alec Harvey (Trevor Howard). Their courtship is bookended by two fateful scenes at a train station – once meeting, once parting. It’s hard to estimate how many hundreds of on-screen romances have ended with a teary-eyed lover being carried away on a train, but none have done so as memorably as Brief Encounter.When Harry Met Sally took Annie Hall’s subversion of the romcom genre and removed the neuroses and pseudo-intellectualism. The result was a breezy, observational romantic comedy starring Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan as two unlikely lovers. Screenwriter Nora Ephron based much of the film on its eventual director, Rob Reiner. When Harry Met Sally would become a massive hit, spawning an iconic catchphrase (“I’ll have what she’s having”) and even a stage adaptation in 2004.Jack Lemmon plays bedraggled corporate yes-man CC Baxter, who falls in love with elevator operator Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine), who is also his boss’s mistress. The 1960 masterpiece, directed by Billy Wilder, is equal parts cynical and romantic, and features one of the most compelling will-they-won\u0027t-theys in the history of cinema.The romance of Casablanca has resonated throughout the 20th century. Its dialogue is among the most-quoted in film history and its locations – the piano bar the airfield – are indelible pieces of Hollywood iconography. Humphrey Bogart is the perfect romantic lead as Rick Blaine, the bitter, lovelorn club owner in French-occupied Morocco whose ex-lover Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) arrives with her new flame Victor Laszlow (Paul Henreid), who is wanted by the Nazis. Casablanca has been mimicked and parodied so many times throughout the years that it’s easy to forget quite how inventive it is in its depiction of a love affair torn apart by the brutality of the outside world.Phantom Thread has all the trappings of a conventional period romance. Daniel Day-Lewis plays Reynolds Woodcock, a famous dressmaker who falls in love with Alma (Vicky Krieps), a waitress who later becomes his muse. Paul Thomas Anderson’s twisted romance flies off in some psychologically dark and unexpected directions, but the arc is that of a storybook love affair, of two people taking extraordinary measures to hold onto the one they love.Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga scored big at the box office with last year’s A Star is Born remake, but for many, the definitive version was released nearly 65 years earlier.

He must carry ampoules for injection in the event of an emergency, but these have a limited shelf-life and he needs regular fresh supplies.He recently went to his usual pharmacy\u0026nbspto obtain a new batch of these life-saving drugs, but was informed by the pharmacist that she did not have them in stock. She told Woodman that “we can’t get hold of them” and explained it was because of Brexit.If Brexit is reversed ‘there will be blood on the streets’The experience of being denied the drugs that he needs to keep himself alive reinforced Woodman’s opposition to the UK leaving the EU. “I am horrified by the biggest act of national self-harm in my lifetime – I am 52 – and probably going back a lot earlier,” he says. “It’s not as bad as going to war, but it’s not far off.”The maternity services in Llandough would have collapsed if it was not for the Filipino nursesHe does not see the political and economic damage as something confined to a post-Brexit future, but as a destructive process that is underway and already inflicting losses among real people. As a regional organiser for Unison in Wales, he deals with the problems of union members such as staff at less well-known and less well-funded universities that can no longer attract foreign students. The prospective students are deterred by Brexit uncertainties over their status and qualifications but formerly paid high fees and were an essential cash-cow for the institutions.Woodman says he is particularly concerned about the University of South Wales. Brexit, he believes, “has the capacity to bankrupt the place because the supply of overseas students has dried up”. Other universities are coming under intense financial pressure, meaning “lecturers and support staff are being let go … I am trying to save my members’ jobs”. He adds that Brexit is exacerbating the crisis in the NHS in Wales because of the difficulty in recruiting foreign doctors and nurses who have hitherto kept it going.Ian Thomas, a psychiatric nurse at Llandough Hospital in the Vale of Glamorgan, agrees that the active recruitment of foreign medical workers has been essential. “The maternity services in Llandough would have collapsed if it was not for the Filipino nurses,” he says.Created with Sketch.

There are hints that it shares an undercurrent of resentment towards The Sun newspaper too.Debate in Britain over the advantages and disadvantages of leaving the EU have focused largely on the economic consequences of the move. The first concrete signs of this are in higher education and health as well as in international companies such as Airbus and Nissan. But it is the political changes in Britain produced by the 2016 referendum which are more advanced and more visible than the economic ones – and which have the potential to be much more serious.Two very different political trends have gathered pace since the vote to leave the EU and are becoming irreversible: Britain is a far more ided society, perhaps more so than at any time since the Home Rule crises in the 19th and early 20th century and possibly since the turmoil of the 17th century. “People who lived happily next door to each other are now at daggers drawn,” says Woodman. Grievances that have little or nothing to do with the EU\u0026nbsphave been energised and envenomed by the anti-EU vote.Outside Westminster, people are becoming numb to the Brexit crisisCardiff and south Wales are a useful guide to the politics of Brexit in Britain because the outcome of the referendum here helps demolish conventional wisdom about why a majority of those who went to the polls in the rest of Britain wanted to exit the EU.\u0026nbspWales voted Leave\u0026nbspby 52.5 per cent to 47.5 per cent, which surprised some because it receives substantial EU subsidies, amounting to £680m a year, according to the Welsh government. What’s more, Remain\u0026nbspwas backed by the Labour Party, which has dominated Welsh politics for the past 97 years. Yet only five out of 22 local authorities voted to remain, very much mirroring the split in England between poor and better off, less educated and well-educated, old and young.Cardiff, a prosperous-looking city of 350,000 – one of five UK cities most dependent on EU markets – voted 60 per cent to stay in the EU. But the valleys just to the north of Cardiff, a de-industrialised region once filled with coal mines and steel plants, opted strongly for Leave. The pattern of voting was much the same as in England, though the valleys are famous for their strongly-held Welsh identity and loyalty to the Labour Party, something which they were to confirm in the 2017\u0026nbspgeneral election.In the 1980s we used to regularly have dog shit in Tesco bags pushed through our letter box and ‘Pakis Out’ in big letters written on the side wall of our houseThe outcome of the referendum in Wales puts in doubt the widely credited belief that Brexit was significantly fuelled by resurgent English nationalism and nostalgia for a lost imperial past. This thesis looks less convincing if Welsh socialists, who do not feel the same about the British empire and are still bitter about the crushing of the miners’ strike in 1984-85, voted the same way as English Leavers.Care also needs to be taken when arguing about the degree to which the Brexit vote was propelled by opposition to immigration and Islamophobia, because, while there are many immigrant communities in Cardiff, there are very few in the valleys,\u0026nbspwhere there is not a single mosque according to residents.Of course, the absence of immigrants on the street does not necessarily mean that there is no hostility towards their presence\u0026nbspnationally. Local opinion is split on this, but Graham Simmonds, an independent member of Caerphilly Council who is a Leave supporter, says that emphasis on anti-immigration as an issue in the valleys “is just a stick that the media uses to beat us”. He adds: “I have never encountered it.”Whatever the role of the anti-immigrant vote, there is a simple reason why Cardiff, a government centre with much employment in health and education (it has three universities), should vote differently from the families of former miners and steel workers in the valleys.West Wales and the valleys, once a hub\u0026nbspof the industrial revolution in Britain, today top the list of the five poorest areas in northern Europe, according to 2016 figures. Interestingly, the next four on the list are all in England: Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, Lincolnshire, South Yorkshire, and the Tees Valley and Durham. As in Wales, these deprived regions voted strongly for Brexit, with Lincolnshire having the highest proportion of Leave voters in the UK. Poverty, not national identity, appears to be the dominant factor.UK manufacturers stockpile at record pace in January ahead of BrexitImmigration is an easy explanation for people in deprived areas who want to know why they are jobless or have ill-paid, insecure employment. Pro-Brexit tabloids have for decades drip-fed readers with stories portraying immigrants as parasites on the NHS and the undeserved recipients of largesse through exploiting state benefits.Even so, it is difficult to judge the extent of anti-immigrant feeling, because people are embarrassed to express it and, even when they did in interviews with The Independent, some later asked for their comments to be removed. Police figures for hate crimes or abuse are not very accurate because officers often do not have the resources, the numbers or the inclination to follow such incidents up, according to Cardiff residents.Those from ethnic minorities in the city are better judges of the extent to which the referendum and its aftermath turbo-charged racism in Britain and raised it to a new and more toxic level. Trade union leaders from minority communities (Pakistani, Sikh, Caribbean, Portuguese) spoke to The Independent about their personal experience of racism and about their members who had filed or been the targets of complaints about alleged abuse. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspShavanah Taj is a national officer for the Public and Commercial Services Union, whose father came from Pakistan to work in a steel plant in south Wales in 1958-59. She is married to a Nigerian and has two children aged five and seven. She says that racist abuse has markedly increased in the last three or four years, though she stresses that it was also bad in the past.\u0026nbsp“In the 1980s we used to regularly have dog shit in Tesco bags pushed through our letter box and ‘Pakis Out’ in big letters written on the side wall of our house.” She says this of kind of abuse ebbed in the following years, but has now returned – and strengthened. \u0026nbspAs an Asian woman with two small children, she says she has been harassed by white men who block her way in the street. Invariably, when she walks into a shop “the security guard will follow me around”.For the first time she and her husband are asking themselves if they\u0026nbspwill get to the point when they\u0026nbspno longer think of the areas as\u0026nbsphome.\u0026nbspPreviously, she and her family had never felt it necessary to have a Plan B about where they should live.\u0026nbspNow they wonder if they ought to.Created with Sketch.10 novels to help you beat the Brexit blues Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Lucky Jim by Kingsley Amis Mansfield Park by Jane Austen310 Diary of a Provincial LadyDiary of a Provincial Lady by EM Delafield410 Tales of the CityTales of the City: the Seventies and Eighties gay bible, by Armistead MaupinThe Mating Season by PG WodehouseNot Working by Lisa Owens810 A Gentleman in MoscowA Gentleman in Moscow by Amor TowlesCold Comfort Farm by Stella GibbonsAdrian Mole, The Prostrate Years by Sue TownsendLucky Jim by Kingsley Amis Mansfield Park by Jane Austen310 Diary of a Provincial LadyDiary of a Provincial Lady by EM Delafield410 Tales of the CityTales of the City: the Seventies and Eighties gay bible, by Armistead MaupinThe Mating Season by PG WodehouseNot Working by Lisa Owens810 A Gentleman in MoscowA Gentleman in Moscow by Amor TowlesCold Comfort Farm by Stella GibbonsAdrian Mole, The Prostrate Years by Sue TownsendAmarjite Singh, a Sikh who works for the Royal Mail, is branch secretary of the Communications Workers Union and wears a distinctive red turban. He agrees with Taj that open racism receded from the end of the 1980s up to 2016. Other are less sanguine and say there has been mounting Islamophobia propelled by 911, 77 and the rise of Isis after 2014.Singh says\u0026nbspthe most significant change is the degree to which the extreme right is today able to mobilise\u0026nbsppeople. “I haven’t seen so many far-right demonstrations up and down the country ever before with rallies on the same weekend in Birmingham, Leeds and Newcastle,” he says.I know a plasterer who told me that he is now reading a book by Tommy Robinson called ‘Enemy of the State’, which he says is the first book that he has ever readBrexit may originally have been about leaving the EU and about anxiety over immigration from Eastern Europe – indeed, says Singh, many Sikhs voted Leave because they thought foreigners were coming to take their jobs. But then they found that immigrants from the subcontinent and beyond were also targeted.Singh recalls:\u0026nbsp“Two weeks ago I was on a bus and there was a Somali woman with a baby in a pram who could not put it in the space allotted for it because a young man was blocking it. When the bus driver told him to let her park the pram there, the young man replied: ‘Who does she think she is?\u0026nbspShe’s only a foreigner’.”Woodman, whose mother immigrated to the UK from Portugal in 1952 and whose father came from Guyana, agrees that the Brexit vote has exacerbated racism, saying: “It emboldens people, as it does in Trump’s America, to say in public what they used to say in private. I have been called the n-word and that rarely happened in recent years.” He adds that it is wrong to blame everything on Brexit, but he finds it difficult to think of any other explanation for the racist surge.It’s time to call out broken Brexit promises on tradeWhite indigenous residents in south Wales confirm that the extreme right is becoming legitimised in a way that it was not in the past. Ian Thomas, who has long campaigned against racism, says\u0026nbsphe is more worried now than he has ever been before, because he believes that racial hatred, that was always there, but hidden, is coming increasingly to the surface.The rise of the extreme right and open displays of racism have occurred in the past (Oswald Mosley in the 1930s, the Notting Hill riots in the 1950s, Enoch Powell’s “Rivers of Blood”\u0026nbspspeech in 1968, the National Front in the 1970s) but they have peaked and then evaporated or returned to obscurity. Often, they took advantage of periods of acute economic and political instability which came to an end.What is so different about the current crisis over Brexit is that there is no reason why the crisis should come to an end any time soon, and every reason why it should get worse, providing the far-right with fertile ground to expound their racist creed.Not all the arrows point in the same direction and some polls show that hostility to immigrants has receded somewhat since 2016, when Syrian refugees were flooding into Europe and Isis was carrying out highly publicised atrocities in the centre of European capitals.But in the eyes of many people, immigrants remain a threat and the evidence is that this perception has not changed very much. As Woodman says, all that you need to do to generate racial hatred “is to persuade people that those who are different from themselves are the reason they are poor”.We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

That light is invisible to the human eye but is a useful tool for exploring the universe: it will give astronomers a look at more than 300 million galaxies, as well as 100 million stars in our Milky Way.This amazing mission will be a treasure trove of unique data for astronomers,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, in a statement. “It will deliver an unprecedented galactic map containing ‘fingerprints’ from the first moments in the universe’s history. And we’ll have new clues to one of the greatest mysteries in science: What made the universe expand so quickly less than a nanosecond after the big bang?”To answer those questions, SPHEREx will look out at all those galaxies, some of which are so far away that the light reaching us has taken 10 billion years to travel through the universe. It will hunt out water and organic molecules in the hope that we can understand where – and how often – those ingredients for life occur throughout the cosmos.It will also look out\u0026nbspto create\u0026nbspmap of the entire sky, in 96 different colour bands. That will be a\u0026nbspfar more detailed colour resolution than previous all-sky maps, and will offer hints that other equipment\u0026nbsplike the James Webb Space Telescope and Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope can follow up on.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This all seems very much at\u0026nbspodds with earlier comments from Carney that Brexit could wipe 8 per cent off GDP and that house prices could crash by as much as 35 per cent.On the face of it, this is a conversion to rival Paul’s as he approached Damascus in AD5.

He talked about, among other things, the effects of a slowdown in China. Then he placed Brexit in the context of broader upheavals stemming from globalisation. The crisis in policing shows the danger of a single-issue government“Trade tensions abroad and Brexit debates at home are manifestations of fundamental pressures to reorder globalisation,” Carney said.“It is possible that new rules of the road will be developed for a more inclusive and resilient global economy.”But crucially he then laid out a second point that has conveniently been left out of a number of accounts: “At the same time, there is a risk that countries turn inwards, undercutting growth and prosperity for all.”Carney’s approach here should not surprise anyone. He is an economist and a central banker, not a political pundit. In that role he doesn’t back one side of a debate or another he puts forward a range of possible outcomes, based on analysis.He is used to traders and market commentators poring over and dissecting his every word for a sign of where interest rates are heading, and so he deliberately gives little away.But what about that project fear doom-mongering in months gone by?As it happens, Carney\u0026nbspdidn’t say house prices would crash by 35 per cent or that GDP would drop 8 per cent in a year. In both cases he laid out a number of best, worst and middling scenarios.The middle scenario rarely makes for the best headline.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

But few people will feel the impact more sharply than the 3.5 million EU nationals who have built their lives in this country – and who are now having to take steps to secure their right to be here.The government has pledged that all EEA citizens (ie those from the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), their family members and dependents living in the UK on or before 29 March\u0026nbspcan remain in the country with no loss of their rights.The EU Settled Status Scheme, which opened fully last month, is designed to facilitate this, providing – in the words of Sajid Javid –\u0026nbspa “simple, streamlined process for residents and EU citizens and their family members to obtain their new UK immigration status”.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut campaigners warn that it risks leaving thousands of EU nationals undocumented – and pushing them straight into the claws of the so-called “hostile environment”.The obligations on employers, landlords and doctors to make routine immigration checks under existing\u0026nbspmeasures mean that anyone who doesn’t obtain settled status before the deadline – 30 June 2021 – could suddenly find themselves unable to work, rent or access healthcare.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentOne of the main concerns is\u0026nbsplack of awareness. Efforts to inform harder-to-reach people such as the elderly and non-English speakers\u0026nbsphave been branded “completely inadequate”.Grayling’s incompetence sends the worst message about Brexit BritainSenior MPs have said children in care are particularly at risk because local authorities don’t know they need to register. There is real fear that tens of thousands of people will miss the “arbitrary cliff-edge” deadline simply because they do not know about the scheme.There are also concerns that mistakes will be inevitable as the Home Office takes on a\u0026nbspsignificant increase to its caseload.\u0026nbspIt is unclear whether current provisions of staffing and training in the department are sufficient to meet the need – and the number of blunders exposed in the past year suggests it is already struggling. This could leave people wrongly denied settled status simply due to administrative\u0026nbsperrors.Even people who do successfully apply for the Settled Status Scheme could\u0026nbspfeel the force of the hostile environment, as they are suddenly\u0026nbsprequired to prove their immigration status each time they get a new job, rent a home or go\u0026nbspto the GP.Some landlords and employers may start choosing British passport-holders over EU nationals simply to avoid the extra bureaucracy, making them inadvertent victims of dicrimination.The government has made little\u0026nbspattempt to remedy the hostile environment measures which proved so detrimental to Windrush nationals – now EU citizens risk falling into the same trap.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

We even used to ride a tandem bicycle.”\u0026nbspMr and Mrs Marsh celebrated their 75th wedding anniversary on Christmas Day last year. They said they feel gratitude because\u0026nbspthey have a large family, which contributes to maintaining a loving\u0026nbsprelationship\u0026nbspning nearly eight decades.Recounting their approach to money, Cecelia spoke about the frugal times endured when they used credit to buy just one item at a time.\u0026nbspReferring to Mr Marsh, she added: “But that said, if we wanted to buy something, you didn’t mind going out and spending money, did you James!”\u0026nbspMr Marsh, who lives with dementia,\u0026nbspreplied with a quick wit when he said: “Yes, and now I’m skint!”\u0026nbspMr Marsh, whose first job was at a local hardware and iron merchants, added: “When we first met, I thought Cecelia had a lovely way about her.\u0026nbspAfter we were married we were sometimes short on money, but we made a decent home because the kids were growing up.\u0026nbspThere’s more to life than money – you don’t need to make extravagant purchases. And it was nice to get home at the end of the day to a home-cooked meal.”With Valentine’s Day approaching, Ms Marsh said they did not really celebrate it in a big way anymore.\u0026nbsp“We used to - flowers, chocolates, that kind of thing, she said.\u0026nbspShe added they had made cards for each other this year with help from the staff at the\u0026nbspBupa Abbotsleigh Mews care home in Sidcup, South East London where\u0026nbspthey now live.\u0026nbspThey have also planted a rose bush in the grounds to symbolise their\u0026nbspdiamond anniversary.\u0026nbspThe world\u0027s least romantic cities, from Venice to BarcelonaWhy you should buy houseplants instead of flowers this Valentine\u0027s Day10 of the best sex scenes in film“It’s heart-warming to watch their relationship continue to grow even after all these years, and so we all wanted to do something special to mark the occasion, said care home manager Tracey Cheeseman.\u0026nbspAfter the war, Mr Marsh\u0026nbspreturned to work at a local hardware merchants,\u0026nbspand eventually ended up as general manager until he\u0026nbspretired in 1989. \u0026nbspMs Marsh worked as\u0026nbspa trainee seamstress, which meant she\u0026nbspfrequently made clothes for the family. \u0026nbspShe said she was kept busy with sewing, dressmaking and crocheting,\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspwith designing and making wedding dresses.By the time their three children, James, Marion and Ann grew up,\u0026nbspMs Marsh\u0026nbsptook up employment\u0026nbspat the\u0026nbspPeek Freans biscuit factory in Bermondsey.\u0026nbspIn the sixties, she moved on from her job to help Mr Marsh\u0026nbspat Hawkins and Sons, working as a bookkeeper for 20 years.The pair have been retired since 1989 and\u0026nbspup until three years ago, accompanied\u0026nbspeach other to the shops every day.\u0026nbspThe couple have seven grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.\u0026nbspMr Marsh said: “Looking back at the old times, I remember we had to learn to work together to overcome any troubles we might have had.”\u0026nbspMs Marsh added: “And if you can see that your family is happy and content, then that makes you happy.\u0026nbspPeople in our generation didn’t ask a lot from life, we were happy with what we had.We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

even handing out parchment hearts as a reminder of the love of God or delivering letters between jailed lovers in secret.\u0026nbspThe devastating love story of Camila O\u0027GormanSeven ways to share the love with others in need this Valentine\u0027s DayWhen it comes to the perfect V-Day gift, it’s all about balanceIt is perhaps for these\u0026nbspreasons he has come to be considered the patron saint of love and lovers, a slightly contradictory notion for a faith at other\u0026nbsptimes placing an emphasis on self-denial.An alternative explanation comes from Geoffrey Chaucer, whose Parliament of Foules (1380) mentions: “Saint Valentine’s day, when every bird comes there to choose his mate.”Few details can be substantiated from the saint’s biography relating to romance, the argument goes, so his association with the theme has more to do with fanciful revisionism in the Middle Ages, Chaucer associating his matrydom and feast day with the arrival of spring and the optimism and renewal the season represents.Chaucer’s influence was carried thereafter by the poets, from Shakespeare to John Donne, and by the Victorian era the custom of exchanging cards or gifts as tokens of affection had taken hold.St Valentine’s\u0026nbspskull, crowned with flowers, is on display at the Basilica of Santa Maria in Cosmedin in Rome, while the rest of his bodily remains are retained at St Anton’s Church in Madrid, Spain.The one exception is his heart, which\u0026nbsphas been held at Whitefriar Street Carmelite Church in Dublin, Ireland, since 1836, where it serves as a site of Christian pilgrammage for those in search of true love.We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

It is too small to appear on the world stage on its own.”He also warned that hundreds of companies had plans to relocate across the North Sea from Britain.Government must ‘get its act together’ to prevent Brexit panic-buying “We can’t stop them from coming here,” he said of the news that around 250 UK-based firms had been in talks to relocate to Britain’s closest ally in the EU, to retain access to the single market.“Every businessman I speak to from the UK is saying they will cut investments, cut their business in the UK. It will have an insurmountable impact on the UK,” he told the Financial Times, adding that Britain was a “more diminished country compared to what it was two or three years ago”.Sony and Panasonic are among high-profile names to have cited Brexit in their relocation, but the trade and investment arm of the Dutch government, the Netherlands Foreign Investment Agency, has been actively soliciting more firms and says hundreds more are on the verge of moving.Mr Rutte also said Britain’s allies on the continent were aghast at the fact the UK was doing little to stop a no-deal Brexit.“At the moment, the ball is rolling towards the Dover cliff and we are shouting ‘Stop the ball from rolling any further’ but nobody is doing anything at the moment, at least not on the UK side,” he said.Responding to Mr\u0026nbspRutte’s comments, the PM’s spokesman said: “I disagree entirely. Employment is at a record high, exports are at a record high, companies are continuing to invest in the UK.“Deloitte named the UK as Europe’s leading destination for foreign direct investment and London as the world’s top city for investment just last month.”Reports out of Westminster and accidental leaks from UK Brexit negotiators suggest Theresa May wants to wait until the very last moment to force her MPs to vote through her Brexit deal.But the brinkmanship raises the prospect of a possible no-deal, as sought by some hardline Conservative MPs.Mr Rutte said that as a result of the exodus, the Netherlands had only seen benefits from Brexit so far – though his country could face serious disruption at its ports and airports in the event of a no-deal.Created with Sketch.Politicians\u0027 Brexit tweets don\u0027t hold up well to time or fact Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.These billboards were plastered by campaign group Led By DonkeysThese billboards were plastered by campaign group Led By DonkeysThe Dutch government has sometimes appeared better prepared for Brexit than the UK, with advanced plans to recruit as many as 1,000 extra border officials to deal with potential disruption and extra bureaucracy caused by the UK’s exit.In addition to private businesses, the UK has also lost a key EU agency to Amsterdam: the European Medicines Agency, which employs around 900 highly skilled workers.We’ll tell you what’s true.

An exact itinerary is still said to be under discussion between the parties.The Government has relentlessly focused on trying to get the EU to concede changes to the Northern Ireland backstop, which Brexiteer MPs are resolutely opposed to.The European Union has however responded by saying it will not reopen the withdrawal agreement – but that the UK should change its red lines to build a closer future relationship with the EU that could avoid the backstop being triggered.This has put Labour and Brussels on roughly the same page – with the opposition party’s proposals going down well in the EU capital.Though the prime minister has held talks with other parties, including Labour, about a cross party way forward, they have yet to bear any fruit. The prime minister is reported to be sceptical about whether her MPs would back the sort of close future relationship Labour is demanding. \u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Politicians\u0027 Brexit tweets don\u0027t hold up well to time or fact Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.These billboards were plastered by campaign group Led By DonkeysThese billboards were plastered by campaign group Led By DonkeysMr Corbyn last visited Brussels in September, where he met with feared Commission official Martin Selmayr, as well as Mr Barnier.The Labour leader was in the Belgian capital then to attend a naming ceremony for Place Jo Cox, a square named after the Labour MP murdered by a far-right extremist during the EU referendum campaign.We’ll tell you what’s true.

We should not be helping to deliver Brexit.”Mr Lewis – who resigned to oppose the triggering of Article 50 exit notice in 2017 – again called for an in-or-out Final Say referendum on the prime minister’s deal.He also warned of a future European war, as Brexit propelled the rise of the far right, saying: “If we walk away from Europe now, my children, your children, or possibly our grandchildren, will be back in Europe in a few years’ time – but in uniform.”Brexit ‘uncertainty’ blamed as airline cancels UK flightsBrexit already costing UK £800m per week, Bank of England expert saysUK a ‘diminished country on the wane’ after Brexit vote, says Dutch PMDefeating May in Commons would ‘hit PM’s chance to win concessions’“We cannot forget what Europe has done to keep the peace in Europe.”Two other frontbenchers – rail spokeswoman Rachel Maskell\u0026nbspand Paul Sweeney, the shadow Scotland minister– also called for a referendum on the Brexit outcome.Labour’s official position is still to press for a general election, if its softer Brexit plan is rejected in the Commons, with a fresh public vote only “an option”.The criticism came as a Labour MP on the opposite wing of the party – Corbyn critic Chris Leslie – warned Final Say supporters were being “played for fools” by their\u0026nbspleader.The Nottingham East MP urged government ministers opposing Brexit to “do the brave thing and resign” to make up for the failure to deliver “what should be a solid Labour move against this outrageous situation”.Criticising\u0026nbsphis party’s amendment, Mr Leslie said he no longer sees the “option of a public vote\u0026nbspwhich was there when we had the amendment on 29\u0026nbspJanuary”.\u0026nbspHe added:\u0026nbsp“Why are we regressing in our party’s policy passed at the September conference?”And he added: “I certainly feel that we are being played for fools by the leadership of the Labour Party on this particular issue because, by now, we should have reached the stage of a public vote when it comes to the option of remaining in the EU.”Frontbench supporters of a referendum are becoming increasingly frustrated by Mr Corbyn’s failure to switch to outright support – even after the prime minster rejected Labour’s proposals, which include staying in a customs union.Resignations are possible if the Labour leader continues to sit on the fence when the next round of Brexit votes take place on 27 February.However, shadow ministers are keen for a concerted move, which would need to be led by the shadow cabinet, where Keir Starmer, the Brexit spokesman, is pushing for a referendum.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The reality is the Prime Minister\u0027s political game in refusing to take no deal off the table is having a serious effect on people\u0027s day-to-day lives.The Liberal Democrats have campaigned for a people\u0027s vote for over two years. Tonight\u0027s defeat of the government makes clear it is long overdue that the prime minister took no deal off the table, and offered the public a final say on Brexit with the option to remain in the EU.Responding to the vote, a\u0026nbspDowning Street spokesman said: “Jeremy Corbyn yet again put partisan considerations ahead of the national interest – and yet again, by voting against the Government’s motion, he is in effect voting to make no deal more likely.\u0026nbsp“While we didn’t secure the support of the Commons this evening, the Prime Minister continues to believe, and the debate itself indicated, that far from objecting to securing changes to the backstop that will allow us to leave with a deal, there was a concern from some Conservative colleagues about taking no deal off the table at this stage.\u0026nbsp“The motion on 29th\u0026nbspJanuary remains the only one the House of Commons has passed expressing what it does want – and that is legally binding changes to address concerns about the backstop. The Government will continue to pursue this with the EU to ensure we leave on time on 29th\u0026nbspMarch.”NEW: Analysis of tonight\u0027s votes shows that 41 Labour MPs broke ranks to vote with the SNP in favour of extending Article 50.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThey were joined by two Tory MPs: Ken Clarke and Sarah Wollaston.Jeremy Corbyn says Theresa May must admit her strategy has failed...\u0026nbspHere\u0027s the moment the vote result was announced...\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn is making a point of order. He asks why the prime minister is not present to hear the result of the vote.\u0026nbspThe Labour leader\u0026nbspsays he wanted her to come to the Commons\u0026nbspand admit that her strategy has failed. Is there a way to ask her to attend, he asks John Bercow?\u0026nbspThe\u0026nbspSpeaker says it is not obligatory for the prime minister to be present but other ministers are welcome to make a statement.

The government motion was defeated by 258 votes to 303.One leading Tory described the night as a “fiasco”, Jeremy Corbyn said the country was heading for a “catastrophe”, while a senior source in Brussels said “there goes the strong mandate”.The Brexit fault-line also cut through Mr Corbyn’s party on Thursday, with a significant number of Labour MPs apparently defying their leader’s will in a separate vote\u0026nbspamid suspisions that some are close to breaking away.But the spotlight was firmly on the prime minister’s ailing administration as it contorted in an attempt to avoid defeat on what did not have to be a difficult night for Ms May.The wording of the motion on Thursday called on MPs to reiterate their support for the approach set out in an earlier set of votes on January 29 – when the Commons backed a plan to re-open negotiations with Brussels on the Northern Ireland backstop.However, it had also in January voted for a non-binding cross-party amendment rejecting a no-deal break with the EU. By apparently combining support for both issues in Thursday’s motion, Tory Euroceptics found themselves unable to back the government.Government whips spent days and hours in the run up to the vote trying to convince Brexiteers that backing the government on Thursday would not take no-deal off the table, but they were not won over.Prominent eurosceptic Bernard Jenkin MP said: “It’s an unfortunate fiasco that the government’s clumsiness created.“I don’t know why the government doesn’t consult a bit more widely before they table these motions. There are 110 eurosceptic Tory MPs who helped defeat the Withdrawal Agreement – not one of us was consulted.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

They were murdered as part of a bloody turf war with Al Capone’s Italian contingent, the two factions fighting for control of Chicago’s illegal liquor black market, catering to underground speakeasies since the 18th amendment had banned the production, import or sale of alcohol in 1920.The two sides had been at war\u0026nbspsince North Side boss Dean O’Banion was shot in the back of the head while clipping chrysanthemums in his North State Street flower shop on 10 November 1924. When the Chicago Outfit’s leadership was subsequently passed on from the experienced Johnny Torrio to the less even-tempered Capone, violence became a way of life on the city’s streets.Torrio and Capone narrowly escaped attempts on their lives but O’Banion’s successor, Hymie Weiss, was not so lucky. The St Valentine’s Day Massacre was reportedly planned as a hit on Moran after he had avenged Weiss’s murder by taking out Pasqualino Lolordo, one of Capone’s made men.On 14 February, the North Siders were set up by an undercover Capone contact, who promised a shipment of Canadian whiskey hijacked from the Italians would be delivered to the SMC Cartage Company garage at 2122 North Clark Street.Moran’s men arrived before 10.30am to meet the incoming truck but, in a peculiar quirk of fate, the target himself was running late. A police car promptly arrived outside, bearing two men dressed in uniform and two more in civilian clothes. Moran, pulling up just in time to spot the quartet entering the building, quietly moved on.The four entered the depot, cornered the men and ordered them to line up against a rear wall. A hail of gunfire erupted from a brace of Thompson submachine guns and a shotgun. The perpetrators duly made a getaway in the squad car, never to be identified.\u0026nbspThe only survivor was a German shepherd named Highball, his lead tied to a parked car’s bumper nearby.The dead included Moran’s right-hand man and deputy Albert Kachellek, bookmaker Adam Heyer, business manager Albert Weinshenker, two brother enforcers – Frank and Peter Gusenberg – as well as two associates, optician-turned-gambler Reinhardt Schwimmer and mechanic John May.\u0026nbspWhen the real cops arrived, Frank Gusenburg was still alive despite being riddled with 22 bullets but refused to say who did it, dying in hospital still loyal to the thieves’ code of honour he had lived by.The killings, reported on every front page in America, provoked a public outcry.\u0026nbsp“From coast to coast, people suddenly seemed to be reaching the conclusion that a line had been crossed, that the violence had become too much to bear,” wrote Capone biographer Jonathan Eig.President Herbert Hoover met with city elders and duly instructed his attorney general, William Mitchell, to “get Capone”. Though widely suspected of having ordered the hit, the mobster was careful to be in Florida at the time it was carried out.\u0026nbspWhy do people still admire the Kray Twins?His bodyguard, “Machine Gun” Jack McGurn, was arrested and accused of being the mysterious connection who had set up the whiskey plot, but no case could be made against him. He said he had spent the day with his girlfriend, Louise Rolfe, and quickly married her to ensure she could not be pressured into testifying against him. She was thereafter popularly referred to by the press as the “Blonde Alibi”.Ballistics experts did trace the Tommy guns used in the massacre to the Michigan home of one Fred “Killer” Burke. A career criminal with ties to Egan’s Rats and the Purple Gang – mobs out of St Louis, Missouri\u0026nbspand Detroit, Michigan, respectively – Burke went on the run after he was involved in a car accident in December 1929 and killed the investigating police officer, Charles Skalay, in a moment of panic.\u0026nbspBriefly on the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted list, Burke was found hiding out on a farm in Green City, Missouri, when a local man recognised his mugshot in a copy of True Detective magazine. He was imprisoned for the murder of Skalay in March 1931 and died nine years later of a heart attack.Though the Valentine’s Day killings were never successfully pinned on him, the murder weapons were found in Burke’s possession and he was missing a front tooth, a detail that matched an eyewitness description of one of the ersatz officers spotted fleeing the scene.\u0026nbspThe remaining killers are thought to have come from a St Louis gang known as the “American Boys”.\u0026nbspA criminal named Byron Bolton\u0026nbsptold the FBI in 1934 the Valentine’s Day hit squad had consisted of Burke and American Boys Fred Goetz, Gus Winkeler, Raymond “Crane Neck” Nugent and Bob Carey, apparently modifying the truth to exclude the fact he himself had served as lookout, hence his inside knowledge. Oddly, the bureau’s director J Edgar Hoover left the matter to local police rather than acting on the tip-off.Al Capone was finally brought down for tax evasion in 1931, the result of an extensive investigation by the Treasury’s Special Intelligence Unit\u0026nbspled by Elmer Irey and the work of agent Eliot Ness and his team of “Untouchables”, men who could not be bribed.Capone spent\u0026nbsphis final days on the island prison of Alcatraz in the San Francisco Bay.We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

But it strikes a powerful chord with real people, particularly voters in the North.They resent claims they are racist thickos and believe all parties lied to them in  when they promised to deliver on the referendum, whatever the outcome.Like the BBC — and, indeed, the EU itself — Remainers are slow to realise time is running out. Brexit is to the EU what Netflix is to the BBC. The £billion licence fee — like the European “Grand Project” — is on its way out.Whatever last-minute deal Theresa May brings home, the scepticism which brought Brexit to le cannot simply be turned off.It is a disruptive force and is already beginning to sweep away the EU as we know it.Economist Bernard Connolly famously identied this as the logical consequence of EU skulduggery in his book The Rotten Heart Of Europe: The Dirty War For Europe’s Money.Connolly was in charge of setting up the euro, the slow-burning catastrophe which has wrecked economies and young lives across the EU.He was sacked for exposing the secretive abuse of power at the very top, exposing the unscrupulous methods deployed by an unaccountable regime to bludgeon critics into submission.The same tactics are used on rebellious nations like Britain today and Greece in , triggering the explosion of anger we are seeing among protesting citizens and a rise of authoritarianism against such dissent.EU states are at each other’s throats — Italy against France, Brussels against Hungary and Poland.The rise of military-style policing — French police firing hard rubber bullets at unarmed yellow-jacket protestors, the jailing of dissident politicians in Catalonia — is alarming.Romania, a former Soviet police state, is reverting to type and spying on its own citizens.Hungary locks up opponents and silences the media.The EU does nothing, fearing for its own survival.Europe-wide polls reveal increasing antagonism to Brussels, deeper even than here in the UK.He remains a cherished champion of free speech and razor-sharp inquisitorial combat.Mean-spirited as ever, the left-wingcould not resist suggesting he was past his sell-by date.Not by such a margin as this preachy, unpopular rag which is about to go out of print.Those politicians who believe we mustto the EU’s totalitarian embrace are grievously out of step.Yes, Brexit has been botched, both by Theresa May and by Brexiteers themselves. There may be trouble ahead.But those who voted in their millions in  to leave have not budged.

It’s why we have rigorous safety standards. But we are in danger of going overboard.The Tories must shake themselves out of their paralysis, and find a backbone.THE police appear to be missing in action in the case of odious “Sir” Philip Green.They usually can’t wait to jump into action when they can get an easy headline, nor do they spare any effort in virtue-signalling PR operations.And yet after thehas revealed lurid allegations about his conduct and serious questions about cover-ups, there’s hardly a dickie bird.The Government, too, must act.They have been shown in black and white how the rich and powerful continue to abuse expensive gagging orders to keep shameful behaviour private – no matter the public interest. Ministers offer warm words on changes to come.But it’s time for a little more action, and a little less conversation.A DAMNING new book reveals the man his followers call “JC” is certainly no messiah.We know Jeremy Corbyn’s politics are potty, potentially leading us to a similar economic ruin to that inflicted on long-suffering Venezuelans.But it’s his personality that truly condemns him.He is not up to the job of leading Britain.SPARE us the Beeb’s bleating about how hard it’ll be to continue dishing out free licences for the over-s.The giveaway was a Gordon Brown electoral bribe and it is simply too much for the taxpayer to continue funding.If the BBC want to keep it free, the cash should come from their own bloated empire.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Their foolishness means Britain must give away a fixed . per cent of national income at a time when global poverty is plummeting due to capitalism, scientic progress and technological advances.Now some Tories are trying to find ways to keep their promise to hit this aid target, while spending the money in fresh ways. That exposes the ­shallowness of ministers’ ­posturing as heroic saviours of the poor and dispossessed.International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt told the Cabinet last month this level of aid spending was “unsustainable” and money should be shted to domestic priorities.She has floated the idea of ­building new ships for the Royal Navy from the aid ­budget by using them for humanitarian operations.And she knows the issue will rear up in any forthcoming Tory leadership battle.Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson chipped in, saying Britain needs more control over what counts as foreign aid under international rules — and that it should go towards boosting British foreign policy objectives.His move was linked to a report by former soldier turned Tory MP Bob Seely arguing that Britain should simply define its own aid spending to include our ­“strategic goals”.Yet they all miss the obvious solution. Just DITCH the target and abandon the  law binding us to it — one that makes the Department for International Developmentthe only ministry that must explain itself to MPsit fails to spend enough.This silly UN target is an historic anachronism devised by campaigners half a century ago based on flawed, outdated economic data.It makes no sense to rely on a fixed spending target based on national income over needs in poor places — as predicted by a former Tory Chancellor, respected Labour peers and a British economist who won the Nobel Prize for their expertise in poverty.One horried DfID minister confessed to me he thought spending was at least TRIPLE what it should be — yet whenever he tried to thwart wasteful projects, they simply bounced back from officials on to his desk again.It was no surprise to find those pen-pushers in the poverty relief department are among the best-paid bureaucrats in Whitehall.This torrent of cash has fuelled a self-serving aid industry stuffed with fat cats on six-figure salaries in charities and private firms.These people are so focused on protecting their valuable brands that some of the best-known organisations covered up abuse, rape, malpractice and theft.Their political paymasters pose as municent saviours of the world. Yet as I have seen on three continents, much of the money taken from taxpayers is blown on ludicrous projects based on bogus statistics — and ends up doing more harm than good by fostering conflict and undermining democracy.I was in Ghana last year, investigating a UK-funded scheme to pour cash into a few villages to prove aid works.“Far from breaking the poverty trap, the project does not appear to have reduced poverty or hunger at all,” concluded DfID’s own report.Yet we give cash to fast-emerging powerhouses such as China and India.We give cash to countries riddled with corruption, such as Uganda, where I found officials inflating the number of refugees to grab more funds from foreign donors.We give cash to places that have space programmes, even their own aid agencies.And we pour cash into countries run by gangsters spending huge sums on weapons — and in Rwanda’s case, on the brutal president’s favourite Premier League football club, Arsenal.Even North Korea, which runs massive death camps under a bloodstained family dictatorship, has been a beneficiary of UK aid. This is what happens when politicians prioritise spin and spending over needs and reality.Holland has showed a country can get off this hook. It abandoned the target and found the anticipated fuss died down quickly.The sht led to renewed focus on efficient spending, with fewer countries receiving donations. “We were surprised it was so easily dealt with,” one insider told me.Dutch spending has dipped from . per cent of national income in  to . per cent last year and will fall again over the coming years.Let us welcome the dawning realisation in Westminster that fixating on an aid target has been a dire failure.Instead of tinkering with definitions — or deceiving voters by slipping domestic spending under the foreign aid banner — politicians should accept their mistake and abandon that daft targetOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The BBC — fuelled by £billion of public money — has expanded into a state-backed media monster encroaching on areas that should be none of its business, from trivial “clickbait” stories to lestyle advice.After all, the BBC Charter states that it should “provide impartial news and information to help people understand  the world around them. It should offer depth and analysis not widely available from other UK news providers”.Somewhere, this has gone very wrong.It churns out so much stuff online that it could be renamed the British Publishing Corporation.In the process, the monster is devouring the market for everything from local newspapers to gossip websites.Why does “our” national broadcaster now feel obliged to publish “news” stories such as the classic “Serial poopers: What makes people poop in public ” The BBC is also hopelessly addicted to pumping out recipes. Type in “spaghetti bolognese” on Google and the first result that s is from BBC Good Food — a commercial site that trades on the broadcaster’s brand.Why is the BBC even in the already-crowded recipe market  Never heard the one about “too many cooks” By stretching its insensitive tentacles into local areas from its London and Salford HQs, the BBC has contributed to wrecking the local and regional Press, longstanding voices of real communities.At least  local and regional titles have closed since , as circulation halved from .million weekly in  to .million in .Since , the number of regional journalists has also been halved, to around ,.An estimated  per cent of the country now has no daily or weekly title.A robotic BBC web page is no substitute for local Press coverage of council meetings and court proceedings.And yet the money pours in to fund this expansion way beyond its remit.Last year the BBC spent £million on BBC Online and “Red Button” services. The national and local Press are under siege from the tech giants and their BBC collaborators. But this is about more than newspaper self-interest.The future of dirt-digging journalism and democratic debate is at stake.Cairncross estimates that “legacy newsbrands” — aka national and local newspapers — are responsible for around  per cent of all original news journalism in the UK, more than broadcasters and online-only outlets put together. That seems an underestimate.The role of the Press in reporting the news is not just a matter of historical “legacy”. As one ex-editor of a London local paper observes, “councillors and crooks must surely feel relaxed” without local hacks watching and reporting what they are up to.Every big story of recent years was broken by newspapers, from the fire risk Vauxhall Zafira and how Age UK pushed expensive power deals to OAPsto Philip Green gagging reports of sexual and racial harassment .Even last year’s most popular BBC-based story — the snogging scandal on Strictly Come Dancing — was a Sun on Sunday exclusive, before the BBC did its usual parasitical trick of topping Google searches for articles about “the Strictly Curse”.The newspaper tradition of long-form writing and forensic examination will continue to struggle as the online purveyors suck up adverts for cheap and cheerful clickbait.The print medium remains unmatched for serious analysis.Yet the BBC’s self-aggrandising aim is now to expand its global audience further, rather than meet the needs of the underserved as a public service broadcaster surely should.Thus the social media chief of BBC News, Mark Frankel, boasts of the corporation having on Facebook “the largest news page and total fanbase of any news organisation in the world”.The publicly funded BBC need not care that the tech giants don’t pay for stories, as for them Facebook is just a free publicity funnel.That alliance makes it even harder for the rest of the media to take a stand against being royally ripped off.Auntie is effectively in league with greed-driven tech giants.What of the output of all these BBC s  They claim to be a beacon of liberal ersity.The one thing the BBC can’t tolerate, however, is ersity of opinion.It is a bastion of illiberal luvvie smugness, peddling its elitism as the centre ground, blasting out conformist propaganda in Brexit-bashing  debates and Brexit-bashing comedy shows.Lord Reith, the first BBC chief, wanted the then-monopoly corporation to “inform, educate and entertain” the public, from the point of view of the British Establishment.Reith’s successors might have quite a dferent world view.But the new BBC establishment —  managers paid between £, to £, a year,  on between £, to £, — would love to have a state-backed news monopoly again, educating and informing the ignorant public, whether we like it or not.Those of us who appreciate the importance of a vibrant and erse media to democracy, should tell the BBC to get its tanks off the free Press’s lawn.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No, he’s broken it, Mills  Boon style, “into a million pieces”.No one is suggesting that Meghan isn’t upset by the way her father and other off-message relatives have behaved — who wouldn’t be But this supposedly “private” attempt to build bridges lacks authenticity.Decades of dealing with PR spin designed to deflect suspicious journalists away from the real storyhas taught me to trust my gut instinct.And given Thomas’s previous form on speaking to the Press, it’s telling me that Meghan wrote this rather staged letter in the expectation that he would leak it and, therefore, seamlessly allow her to peddle her own narrative while maintaining the cover of the innocent party who has been betrayed by her own father yet again.But Thomas kept the letter under wraps. Until, that is, he was baited in to defending himself against claims made by some of Meghan’s close friends, who spoke anony-mously , about the duchess’s plight to the US-based People magazine.One said: “After the wedding she wrote him a letter. She’s like, ‘Dad, I’m so heartbroken. I love you. I have one father. Please stop victimising me through the media so we can repair our relationship’.”Look, Thomas Markle is by no means blameless. He did a deal with the paparazzi for staged photos, is clearly given to petulance, has only released the parts of the letter that suit him and, as the parent in this scenario, should be the one to stop this tit-for-tat soap opera and just shut the hell up.But equally, any sympathy one might have felt for Meghan in dealing with her off-message family is evaporating fast in the face of such a blatant PR exercise that has her manicured fingers all over it.One of the friends who spoke out has “let it be known” that the duchess herself knew nothing of them speaking to People magazine.Sorry, but I just don’t buy it. Meghan has form for dropping friends like hot potatoesthey displease her, so the notion that those who remain “close” would speak to the Press — anonymously or otherwise — without approval is, to my mind, utter bunkum.Which leads me to conclude that this was a ham-fisted, Hollywood-esque attempt to try to manipulate Press coverage and put a stop to, as her friends put it, the “global bullying” of The Duchess of Sussex. But it has backfired badly.Yes, plenty of the criticism levelled at Meghan is unfair, and some of it is downright offensive.But as the rest of the Royal Family could tell her, they’ve all suffered their share of brickbats over the years but come through it.How  By earning respect through dutul and consistent hard work, not demanding it early doors via an ill-conceived PR initiative.JENNIFER ANISTON has just celebrated her th birthday.Or “poor Jen” as she’s frequently referred to because she’s single and childless which, obviously, is something to be pitied because marriage and giving birth defines us.Meanwhile, back in the real world, the single le appears to suit the fierce Ms A very well indeed.She says she considered her marriages to be successful, but when the end came: “This is our one le and I would not stay in a situation out of fear. Fear of being alone.“To stay in a marriage based on fear feels like you’re doing your one le a disservice.”She’s right, of course. But moving on is far simpler when you don’t have children together.If you do, then taking the decision to break up the family home is a far tougher one.Because your kids only have “one le” too.NOW US teenager Ethan Lindenberger has turned , he has finally had the MMR vaccination while criticising his “anti-vaxxer” movement parents for refusing to give it to him when he was younger.His mother, Jill Wheeler, who believes that vaccinations cause illnesses such as autism, says his decision is “insulting” and a “slap in the face”.Ethan, from Ohio, did his own research into the jab and commented on social media site Reddit, “God knows how I’m still alive” – presumably a reference to the fact that measles can be deadly.He probably swerved it thanks to all the parents who recognise the need for herd immunity and do have their children vaccinated.PARENTS in America say that regular viewing of children’s TV show Peppa Pig is causing their kids to start speaking in a British accent.Many moons ago, I went to collect my youngest from her first day at nursery and was greeted by an excited young assistant who hailed from Valencia.“I didn’t know your daughter could speak Spanish!”“Neither did I,” I replied.Turns out that rather too much time in front of Dora The Explorer had indeed been educational.LUNG cancer screening units are to be offered in supermarket car parks across the UK in an NHS bid to improve early detection rates.This reminds me of when a mobile cervical cancer screening unit was set up in a Birmingham car park in the s and an elderly lady approached the receptionist.She was directed to a curtained booth, given a smear test, then emerged to declare: “I’ve never had to do this to get a bus pass before.”NETFLIX documentary Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened is proof,needed, that all on Instasham etc is not what it seems.The Fyre festival was the brainchild of US “entrepreneur” Billy McFarland, now serving six years in prison for fraud, aided and abettedby a close coterie of consultants, marketeers, media experts andonline “influencers” who helped sell the dream of an exclusive event on a luxury, Bahamian island to unsuspecting, albeit wealthy punters who turned up to find a nightmare of soggy tents, bad food and no headline acts.Among those who appeared in a promotional video and posted the event’s distinctive “orange tile” to their millions of followers to help drive ticket sales were models Bella Hadid and Emily Ratajkowski.Most notably, model Kendall Jenner was paid an eye-watering , via wire transfer for just one post about it to her million-plus followers.It shows with compelling clarity that while the power of A-list, online influence is real, what’s being promoted can sometimesbe a Grade A dud.So, buyer beware of those “influencers” who only post for favours or cash.They’re just the social media version of the old-fashioned freeloader.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

These include repealing the so-called Swedish derogation, which allows employers to pay their agency workers less.Speaking in the Commons she said: “We are committed to enforcing holiday pay for the most vulnerable workers.“Not just protecting workers’ rights, but extending them.”Labour MPs are demanding that as well as protection for workers they also want the Government also cements environmental protections that would ban US meat such as hormone-treated beef.The Sun last week revealed the Government had put plans to announce a new Workers Rights Bill on the back burner.

Somehow, they’ll stop it.” I don’t think I was alone in reckoning that.It’s looking very much like that at the moment, isn’t it  We’re  days away from deadline time, March . But what do you reckon the likelihood is of the deadline being put back  I’ll bet it is.Olly Robbins thinks it’s likely. He’s a civil servant and the Prime Minister’s chief negotiator to the EU. He was overheard jabbering about the whole business in a bar in Brussels. And he saidthere WERE a delay, it would most likely be a long one.We’ll probably all be here this time next year, then, in exactly the same position.By which time the deal will be so watered down, the whole point will have been lost. It’s pretty close to that stage right now.Why has this happened  Because our establishment do not want us to leave. And while they may pay lip service to “respecting the voice of the people”, they don’t remotely mean it. They never did.And so, on the one hand we have establishment voices — Blair, Mandelson, Heseltine — and a growing number of current politicians demanding we must have another vote. Because we got it wrong last time.The European Union has a history of ignoring popular votes and getting countries to run the vote again, after a slew of propaganda about why the people were so wrong.Then, on the other hand, we have a Prime Minister who voted Remain leading our negotiations. And at every stage of the process more and more has been given away.We started from a position of weakness by allowing the EU to dictate the order of the negotiations. So they got to demand things from us — such as extortionate amounts of money — before we even got down to talking about our trading relationship.And at every stage the deal has got weaker. Every time she came back from Brussels, something more had been given away. Until we reach today’s position, where the deal before us isn’t really leaving the EU at all.We’ll still be tied to the customs union for the foreseeable future. We will still have the horrible European Court of Justice telling us what we can and can’t do for another two years.And there are plenty of people who believe that the famous issue of the Northern Ireland backstop is simply an attempt to get us to remain, for ever, inside the customs union.Here’s what I think will happen.Brexit will, in the end, be delayed. And by the time a deal is put before us again — months down the line — it will bear no real resemblance to “leaving the European Union”.And so those of us who have no trust in our liberal establishment, because we know what scant respect it has for democracy, will be able to say: “Told you so.

The truth is that Meghan is not remotely being hunted by photographers and enjoys extraordinary freedoms.The paparazzi do not stalk her like they did the Princess of Wales — although they were often tipped off about where Diana would be.Snappers were told  when she was going for lunch  with a friend, dressed up to the nines, or out for a night on the town in a sizzling frock. She had her favourite writers and her favoured photographers.But the only paparazzi pictures ever to have been published of Meghan were taken when the story first broke that she was romantically linked with Harry.This was a genuine news story. But because their media minders at Kensington Palace refused to issue an official photo of the couple together, they had created a market for one, and every paparazzo was desperate to get the first photo of them together.Since then, in all her public engagements, she has been closely monitored by the Palace Press team. Even her wedding pictures were so tightly controlled that just one Press agency was allowed to photograph the marriage service inside St George’s Chapel in Windsor last May.As a result, Meghan can quite happily live as a semi-private citizen in her palace.She comes and goes when and where she wants, with no photographers following her.We know precious little about the le she and Harry lead in London or at their luxury bolthole in Oxfordshire.Yes, she likes Soho Farmhouse and she writes on bananas — but that’s about it.Like everyone in the public eye, she is trolled on social media. Palace aides supposedly “spend hours” deleting hateful comments — but why bother  Why not simply ignore it  Their PR advisers hope to bypass the traditional media by controlling the photographs and stories they release.Meghan deleted her own social media accounts when she and Harry became engaged.  Perhaps the Royal Family should do the same. Instagram does not equal real le.When The Sun accurately reports about Meghan in fairly harmless stories, their frankly second-rate PR people set lawyers on us.Yet the biggest invasion of her privacy was triggered by Meghan herself, after she gave consent to friends to talk to People magazine in America last week about the awful relationship she has with  her dad.Although there have been stories about the “dficult Duchess” and the fall-out with Kate, most of her problems stem from back home in the USA.Meghan’s father Thomas Markle, her half-sister Samantha — who Meghan says she barely knows — and her cannabis-grower half-brother Thomas Jr, have only ever said disparaging things about the Duchess.I suspect that Meghan knew the letter she sent to her dad last August would be published and she used it to make sure the world knew she was disgusted with the lies being told by her family.Meanwhile, in his bid to “protect” his we, Prince Harry — once the Press photographers’ favourite among the royals —  has gone from hero to zero in his relationship with the media.I have asked twice for Meghan to meet Britain’s royal correspondents but so far it has not happened. If she did, I am sure her profile would improve.Despite being surrounded by great wealth and privilege, the young royals seem to have been seduced by the cult of victimhood.Harry talked about his anxiety and stress and Meghan is a victim of “global bullying” — whatever that means.Meghan really needs to lighten up. So does Harry.The pair of them should look across the road at Harry’s father, the Prince of Wales, and his lovely we Camilla, who has had more hostile Press coverage than any other member of  the Royal Family, including Diana.But they just worked harder and harder to win people over, and Camilla’s approval rating is now sky high and she will certainly be our Queen.Every job I have been on with Meghan she has been the star of the show. She engages brilliantly with people and is a true royal star.My main hope is that this phoney war with the media — that they started and which has now been  intensied by their friend Clooney — comes to an end before the Press loses interest.Newspapers and websites could, after all, simply stop covering Harry and Megan’s engagements, which I’m not sure would please either of them.So stick to acting, George, because there is no part for you in this royal soap opera.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She thinks shes a lap dog and always insists on sitting on my lap.All of the other dogs move out of the way for her, everyone has accepted that she gets special attention because our bond is so tight.Other mainstays at Mutt Misfits include Scary Jack, who owes his unusual appearance to a severe case of puppy strangles.Heather said: The charity was formed because in shelter settings there arent many organisations that specialise in the special needs pups.Most rescue groups take in highly adoptable pups from shelters and re-home them. We focus on animals with major medical issues and saving the sick and injured pets.We like to help people to understand that animals dont have to be perfect to make perfect pets.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That’s why I thought the UK was so smart in getting out.”Enriched uranium is a critical component for making nuclear weapons and in nuclear power stations and by curbing the amount Iran produce is a way to curb the number of weapons produced.As part of the agreement, Iran also agreed to only enrich their uranium up to . per cent over the next  years and they agreed to reduce their gas centruges for  years.Gas centruges are used to separate dferent types of uranium which allows specic types to then be used to manufacture nuclear weapons or generators.Iranian nuclear facilities were limited to a single facility with only first-generation centruges for  years and other nuclear facilities had to be converted into other use.In addition, they were barred from building any more heavy-water faculties - a type of nuclear reactor which uses heavy wateras a coolant to maintain temperatures in the reactor.Also under the agreement, the International Atomic Energy Agency was granted regular access to all Iranian nuclear facilities to ensure Iran maintains the deal.The deal said thatIran abides by the deal it would receive relief from the US, European Union, and the United Nations Security Council on all nuclear-related economic sanctions.The President also views the EU as a foe on trade.He said: “Well I think we have a lot of foes.

He added: The PM still has additional time to negotiate deal revisals Parliament said it needs.He predicted the second meaningful vote would come before the end of February, when MPs will be presented with a stark choice between backing Mrs Mays deal or crashing out of the EU without a deal.As the PM still did not have a deal for MPs to vote on today she put down a supposedly neutral motion instead.It said MPs welcomed the last votes in the House of Commons where they forced her to go back to Brussels, but also accepted that the House didnt want to leave without a deal - something Brexiteers said was ruling out a No Deal.Steve Baker insisted the PM must now fully endorse the Malthouse compromise as the only way forward.And Jacob Rees-Mogg added: The message tonight is that there is a majority for the Malthouse compromise, but the Government needs to work with its backbenchers, rather than against them.The PM appeared not to take the defeat seriously, and wasnt even on the front bench to hear the votes results come in.Shortly afterwards Jeremy Corbyn said the vote showed there was no majority for the Prime Ministers course of action for dealing with Brexit.And he blasted: The Government cannot keep on ignoring Parliament and heading for March  without a coherent plan.David Lammy stormed: This is a Valentine’s Day massacre for the government and a damning indictment of the Prime Minister’s Brexit plan.Tory Nick Boles said he hoped the penny will now drop with Prime Minister and her Chief Whip that the hardliners in the ERG want a  No Deal Brexit and will stop at nothing to get it.The defeat is likely to damage Mrs Mays confidence in talks with Brussels, as they will be sceptical as to whether she can secure a majority among her own MPs for any plan at all.Steve Barclay revealed the PM will fly to Brussels next week for fresh talks with Jean Claude Juncker in a last ditch attempt to persuade them not to derail her plans.And No insisted No Deal was still on the table - but the assurances werent enough for dozens of members of of the European Research Group.MAYS MOTION - The PMs motion was supposed to be a neutral one as she didnt have a deal ready to put to a vote.Instead she just said the House welcomed last weeks votes - accepting Sir Graham Bradys change to go back to Brussels and ask for more, and a non-binding amendment to rule out a No Deal Brexit.But it was slapped down when MPs said it would effectively rule out no deal, throwing a spanner in the works of the PMs plans.CORBYN AMENDMENT -

where the Commons rather than the Government would be dictating the path of Brexit - would be unprecedented.He said: This is a remarkable condition for Parliament and Government and the country to find itself in.It has never previously been the practice for this house to have to take control and to direct Government policy by legislation, that is an extraordinary turn of events.When this house comes to that situation we will be as it were a Cabinet... we will actually be making a decision about the future of this country.We will have in effect to take on, for this period, for this purpose, the government of this country.Sir Oliver said the proposed vote on February  would be high noon for MPs who are desperate to rule out No Deal.Yvette Cooper, who is leading the revolt, told the Commons: If we dont do something sensible like this its like were just all living in a fantasy world in which we talk about alternative arrangements.We say something is going to come along and sort it out and it just doesnt.Its aswere all standing around admiring the finery of the Emperors new clothes and actually the Emperor is running around stark naked and everyone is laughing at us -

Just  days before Brexit, the PM has tabled a motion asking MPs to reiterate the support for her strategy that they expressed two weeks ago. But she faces defeat. And meanwhile MPs are tabling three amendments which would give them a chance to back a radically dferent approach instead. Its a re-run of two weeks ago, when MPs voted to reject the prospect of No Deal , and agreed to back the dealthe Irish border backstop can be fixed. The House of Commons showdown was originally billed a Valentines Day massacre where MPs could strip out core details of her plan for leaving the EU. Then it appeared MPs had backed off - in full knowledge that therell be another clash in two weeks from now. But she now faces a suprise defeat at the hands of Tory Brexiteers...  Heres how today works. Theresa May tables a statement. MPs then table amendments to it. Usually the amendments are the danger area. But Tory Brexiteers arent actually exercised about the amendments to her statement. Instead theyre cross about the statement itself - even though it has no legal force. It says: That this House reiterates its support for the approach to leaving the EU expressed by this House on  January . The problem is, the Commons agreed two things on January . One was to renegotiate the Irish backstop - a clause which could extend EU customs rules over the UK. Brexiteers are fine with this. The second was to reject the prospect of a No Deal Brexit. Brexiteers are not fine with this at all. Defeat on this motion wont have any legal force. But it will kneecap Theresa May in her talks with the EU, because it will show she doesnt have a united parliament behind her. Here are the  amendments she faces  Stop Tories running down the clock  Labours Jeremy Corbyn has an amendment that would stop the Prime Minister running down the clock. The bid would force the government to hold a full meaningful vote on the new Brexit deal by February  - or admit there is no longer a deal. If the government admitted there was no longer a deal, it would need to make a new statement on what happens next. It comes after ministers admitted MPs may only get their final meaningful vote a few days before the March  date of Brexit. Labour MPs fear that will blackmail them into choosing either Theresa Mays deal or a disastrous No Deal Brexit .  Delay the date of Brexit The SNPs Ian Blackford is seeking to extend the date of Brexit by no fewer than three months. This would have to be agreed with the EU, with whom extension talks would begin immediately.  Reveal secret No Deal briefing documents  Cross-party Remainers including Anna Soubry want to reveal the impact of no deal. Their amendment would instruct the government to publish the most recent official briefing document given to the Cabinet on the implications of No Deal on business and trade. The document would have to be published within seven days. Heres the threat coming soon Force the PM to rule out No Deal   NOTE: This amendment is not being laid THIS week - itll only be put forward towards the end of February. Labour MP Yvette Cooper is leading a fresh bid to rule out No Deal Brexit - after her previous attempt was defeated by MPs. Under her plan,there is still no Brexit deal by March , Prime Minister Theresa May must put no deal to a formal vote. MPs would then be able to vote to block a No Deal Brexit, choosing instead to extend the March  date of Brexit. Labours Brexit chief Sir Keir Starmer said the party will support Ms Cooper again, like they did two weeks ago. But hell have to convince some of the  Labour rebels who refused to back her last time to change their minds. A source said the amendment is being held back for now, because Tories clearly want one final opportunity to get a deal. “So it’s likely that it will be put to a vote at the end of the month, rather than now. At that stage, there are likely to be Tory resignations over it, the source said.  And here are the amendments that didnt make the cut The following amendments will not face a vote because they were not selected by Speaker John Bercow. Hold a ballot of MPs on the options  Remain-backing Tory grandee Ken Clarke is leading a bid for MPs to hold a vote on their preferences for the way forward. Under his plan, they would rank dferent options from  to X on a ballot paper - a highly unusual procedure. Any option could go on the ballot paperat least  MPs have backed it in advance. It comes days after the Tory MP was spotted having a curry with Commons Speaker John Bercow. We wouldnt possibly suggest the Speaker had something to say about this unusual ballot plan. Cancel the date of Brexit  SNP MP Angus Brendan MacNeil is leading a bid to cancel the  March date of Brexit. His amendment calls on the government to urgently revoke the Article  notication, which set a two-year countdown to our leaving the EU back in . Under EU rules, Article  cant be extended without getting permission from all  EU leaders. But it can be revoked completely on the UKs decision alone. Delay the date of Brexit Labours Geraint Davies is seeking to extend the date of Brexit with the option of a future public vote. Let MPs vote on a series of set options Cross-party Remainers led by Sarah Wollaston, the Tory GP and MP, want to gold a series of indicative votes on the shape of a future deal. The options would be:Theresa Mays deal as it stands A No Deal Brexit Theresa Mays deal with backstop changes A Canada-style deal Norway plus, staying in EFTA A second EU referendumHold a second EU referendum  Labour MP Roger Godsf is leading a fresh bid to force a second EU referendum. Under his plan, the March  Brexit date would be delayed while a second referendum is arranged. The referendum would then have three questions on the ballot paper - Theresa Mays deal, No Deal, or stay in the EU. The referendum would use the alternative vote system, where the least popular option is eliminated and second preferences are then re-allocated to decide the winner. Plaid Cymrus Jonathan Edwards is also leading a bid to hold a binding second referendum on EU membership. And Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable wants to delay the date of Brexit in order to hold a second EU referendum.

Mr Lewis, who insisted he supported Jeremy Corbyns leadership, added: We are now sending some mixed messages out there and that is truly dangerous.The Norwich South MP drew comparisons between Labours stance on EU withdrawal and how the Liberal Democrats tried to soften the impact of austerity while in coalition with the Conservatives. Referring to the Lib Dems, Mr Lewis said: They were utterly and comprehensively destroyed by the British public and not forgiven because they facilitated austerity. They facilitated the Tories doing that.And my fear is that what we are now doing is... helping to facilitate a Tory Brexit. And the ramications for our party I think will be severe. And just like the Liberal Democrats, when Theresa May has bogged off somewhere to go and put her trotters up after she has delivered her Brexit, and a new Tory leader comes in he will say you know what  She was a disaster for this country. She betrayed this country. But, so too did the leader of the opposition. He was part of this sorry debacle and I am now going to move forward to try and resolve this situation in the best way I can. And I tell you what, the Tory right wing mainstream media will get behind that narrative. And it is us, the Labour Party, who will pick up a lot of the flack for what happens.At an event chaired by Lloyd Russell Moyle, several Labour MPs from the left of the party spoke out against Brexit. It comes as reports suggest at least  Labour frontbenchers could quitJeremy Corbyn fails to back a Peoples Vote.

And in response to a Parliamentary Question tabled by the Labour Party, ministers have admitted the extent of the cut.Mr Opperman revealed , pensioners are set to lose an average of pound, a year as a result of no longer being eligible to claim Pension Credit. The changes from the Department of Work and Pensions will cut the numbers of people who are eligible for pension credit, which tops up the income of the poorest pensioners.   Couples where one is over the state pension age, currently  for both men and women, and one is not, will no longer get the benefit. Margaret Greenwood MP, Labour’s Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, said: “Pensioners on low incomes should not have to lose out on Pension Credit just because their partner is younger than them. “Pensioner poverty is already on the rise and this change clearly breaks the Conservatives’ manesto pledge to protect pensioners’ benefits.“These are people on low incomes who not only may receive signicantly less support under Universal Credit , but also find that their younger partner could be subject to the unfair sanctions regime.“Labour will ensure that older people get the support they need to enjoy security and dignity in retirement.”   When the cut was announced, a DWP spokesman said: In , Parliament voted to modernise this system for new claims so only pensioners receive pension credit. Currently couple can move from working age benefits to pension age benefits when the older partner of the couple reaches state pensions age. The new rules mean this now takes place when the younger partner reaches state pension age too.

The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said she argued with her son before going to bed on the night six-year-old Alesha disappeared. In the morning, the mum told the court she woke up to hear people searching for the young girl. She says she checked her CCTV, which she had installed because a relative with dementia was moving in, to seeAlesha could be spotted walking by. Instead, footage showed her son leaving and ing to the property on three occasions throughout the night. The -year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, denies raping and murdering Alesha, as well as charges of child abduction and defeating the ends of justice.  He has lodged a special defence of incrimination stating Ms McLachlan, the partner of Aleshas dad Robert MacPhail, committed the crime.

The letter, scrawled on a discarded brown paper bag and left on her car in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, read: “Put your dog on a lead, slag! Your dog is naughty and your irresponsible owner .” Tesco worker Grace explained that she was “upset and very confused”.She posted on Facebook : “Just letting people know that this was left on my car by the roundhouse so watch out for someone leaving notes on peoples cars.“My dog is a puppy and I pride myself on being a very responsible owner never let him off unless I know its safe always pick mess up and just upset and very confused as to why someone would do it.”   The note caused outrage on social media, with other pet lovers saying it was completely unacceptable to speak to someone that way.

Hayley says it was her duty as a mother to plan an exercise regime for the young girl - including  sit ups, squats, lunges and ab crunches. The mum-of-two found a gym that Maisie was able to enrol at and pledged to help her get in shape. Hayley, a qualied personal trainer from Barnet, London said: We go to the gym together every week and weve done this since she was .   In just four months Maisie looked leaner and fitter after going to the gym. She lost her puppy fat and we focused on looking great while on holiday in Florida. It might seem extreme to say to a child but Maisie was starting to prefer how she looked and the exercise was giving her more confidence. Even my son, Leo, then six, would get involved. And even now Im proud of showing my family how to lead a healthy lestyle.   Hayley - who runs her own personal training business called Limitless Personal Training - said while Maisies studies take priority over their gym routine they love going together.

I cant see that they is anything wrong with parents that want to help ensure their kids lead a healthy lestyle. Its impossible for kids not to worry about their appearance in todays world of the internet and TV showing our kids how their bodys should look. We cant shield them from that but we can help educate them on how to improve their lestyles.  I ensure she has porridge for breakfast now and plenty of fruit for snacks. I know plenty of people who say children should be children, butyour child says theyre concerned about their weight and you know they could be more active, then parents should help. Maisie has now grown into an educated young women when it comes to diet and the gym. Embracing a healthy lestyle is something all children and teenagers should do so they go on to be healthy adults.  I have been a personal trainer since Maisie was six and spend the majority of my time educating pre-post natal women and teenagers so theyre healthier both by eating the right things and through regular training. Maisie said: I started the gym when I was  years old and have been going ever since. I think its important for young kids to understand how to lead a healthy lestyle from a young age.  My mum helped me feel more confident and even though I wasnt overweight I was a bit bigger than I wanted to be which was making me self conscious. I have prioritised my school studies at the moment but we normally go twice a week together. My friends think its great that were able to train together and as my mum is an expert shes great at being able to help with technique and diet.

Georgina Paraskevas said she was left looking like a monster after having an allergic reaction to what she said was Clairols Nice N Easy product last November. The -year-old claims the dye left her blind for two days and with a scorched scalp. Georgina, from Bristol, believes the reaction was to Paraphenylenediamine- a chemical commonly found in dark hair dyes. The online jewellery store owner is now speaking out about her terrying experience to ensure other people know of the potential risks and are aware of alternatives.  It was honestly the most horric experience of my le, Georgina said. Looking back at the pictures now is just horrible, my head doubled in size and I looked like a monster. It felt horrible and made me feel like I had zero confidence. I hated going out and felt really self-conscious and like people were staring at me. I made the conscious decision to stay inside as I hated going outside and feeling like people were looking at me, it was awful. Georgina was refreshing her hair colour using the Clairol black hair dye on November th - a product shed previously used with no problem - and claims her face and scalp suffered no adverse reaction.  However the following evening during a romantic meal with partner Josh Cox, , she said her head began to feel really hot and itchy. Over the next two days her face slowly started to balloon so panicked Georgina rang  where an operator advised taking an antihistamine to combat the swelling. After visiting her GP the following day and receiving cream to soothe her scorched and blistered skin her face continued to swell so much so her eyelids closed over leaving her unable to see. Georginas desperate mum bakery worker June Kellett, , rang for an ambulance on and was rushed to Southmead Hospital where she was hooked up to a drip. Georgina said: My whole family use Nice N Easy and Ive used it a few times before with no problems. That evening my head was absolutely fine but it was when I went out in the evening the following day my whole head was hot and seriously itchy.  I had blisters on my scalp and the skin on my hairline was really crispy. Later that week the swelling got worse and when my eyes started to swell up and I couldnt open them, thats when I felt really panicked. When I went to the hospital it felt like I had glass in my eyes and I went full-on blind. I couldnt see a thing for two days, it was horrible.  After being discharged from hospital with a antihistamine and steroid prescription, Georgina had to be cared for by her mum and partner as her vision was still affected for a few days. Three months on Georgina now avoids chemical hair dyes and uses coffee granules to tint her brunette locks. Georgina said: Ive started using natural remedies on my hair now and use coffee granules to colour it, it works really well. I want people to be aware that things like this can and do actually happen. A lot of people dont realise whats in hair dye and that it can be really dangerous, Im really lucky and super grateful that it didnt escalate. Since this happened Ive read up on it and I could have permanently lost my eyesight and its scary to see that people have died from it.  Im also a lot more cautious about the things I use on my skin and I just make sure I read everything and make sure it contains natural ingredients. A Clairol spokesperson said: The safety of the people who use our products is our first and most important priority, so we were very concerned to hear about Ms Paraskevas experience with Nicen Easy No Ammonia when we were first made aware of the incident last November. Unfortunately we were unable to get in touch with Ms Paraskeva at the time. Allergic reactions are very rare and hair colourants are extensively researched to ensure they are safe when used as directed and it is imperative patch tests are conducted at least  hours before each colouring occasion. Details of how to perform this test are included with each of our products to help minimise risk to consumers. We remain happy to discuss the matter with Ms Paraskeva should she wish to contact us on our customer helpline.

Former network engineer Delilah Corkery, , said she lost pretty much her whole body when she was struck by Guillain-Barreacute Syndromefollowing an initial bronchitis in February last year. The woman, from Calornia, USA, had hoped she was getting over the worst of that illness when she started to notice peculiar symptoms developing. In March , Delilah went out for a meal with some friends when she noticed that the food tasted bland and she couldnt actually distinguish any taste from what she ate.  Recollecting her experience, Delilah said: I was diagnosed with bronchitis two weeks prior to my first symptoms, and they say a respiratory illness can trigger GBS, said Delilah. I was out eating dinner and all the food tasted bland, like there was no taste. I also felt really hot. But when I got home that night, I washed my hands and the water was icy cold.  I then tried hot water and it was burning hot and touching anything metal felt like fire. The next day, I told my partner that I thought it was time to go to the hospital. I was there for seven hours sitting in the waiting room and when they finally saw me, it was for five minutes and they diagnosed me with vertigo, because I told them it was getting harder for me to walk, gave me some pills and sent me home.  But when she woke up the next day, Delilah was in excruciating pain and could no longer walk unaided. She was immediately sent to the hospital, where staff ran stroke tests, X-rays, MRI tests, blood tests and a spinal tap, which indicated a raised level of proteins, which is indicative of Guillain-Barr Syndrome . Delilah started on an IVIG treatment immediately, but by this time she had lost thein her legs, arms, face, including her eyes, and her bowel. The extent of Delilahs case meant she couldnt even blink but could still see, so she would have her eyes taped shut for eight hours every night for the following three months.  I lost my taste and feeling in my fingertips, then my legs and arms, then my torso, my ability to control when I went to the bathroom and my ability to eat, breathe and even blink. I was stuck, mentally aware but had no control, all in the space of five days. I lost pretty much my whole body, including my face. They put these bubble patches on my eyes during the day so that my eyes stayed moist, but they had to tape them shut at night. They had to give me sleeping medication and anti-anxiety medication every night because I felt paranoid. I was always wonderingsomeone  was in the room as I couldnt see anything. Delilah explained how she had to tape her eyes shut for eight hours every night, and do so for three months after she left rehab. I was intubated twice. Initially for five days, then they tried to take it out thinking I was breathing fine, but when they took it out, I felt like I was suffocating. I kept telling them I couldnt breathe but they just told me to relax until I yelled, and the doctor asked them to do a blood test. That was when they saw my CO levels were high, so they immediately put it back in for six more days. After three weeks in hospital, Delilah was then transferred to a rehabilitation centre where she spent almost a month regaining her strength. She then ed home at the end of April, after seven weeks of intense treatment.  Delilah spoke about the dficulty of going from being such a physically active person to not being able to blink or go to the toilet herself. I had to be moved by the nurses every few hours because I couldnt control anything. Going to the bathroom was the worst because GBS affected all my nerves, including my bowels. I had to be lted in and out of bed to use the toilet with an electronic lting device. I was refusing the pain medication they were giving me because it made me feel sleepy and loopy, so I was in a lot of pain. Just the slightest touch of my legs would be extremely painful. If they lted my leg it would just drop to the side. So finally, I askedthere was something  I could try and they gave me something called Lyrica. The day I started taking Lyrica, I was able to slightly lt my knee to my chest using my arms. It was the most amazing feeling and I sat there with my knee up to my chest for an hour.

Taking to Reddit, the unnamed bride shared her side of the story, asking fellow usersshe was an a**hole for not including her friend in the wedding party.She began the post by explaining that shed been friends with two women, Kristy and Erin, since they were all very young. The woman claims she and Erin had grown apart a little, and that she was now closer to Kristy, but soon reveals this isnt the reason she didnt ask Erin to be her bridesmaid. [Kristy] told me that Erins feelings were hurt and then asked me why I didnt include Erin, and I told her the truth.   Erin has MASSIVE breasts. Literally bigger than should be physiologically possible because she has a hormone disorder that caused her breasts to grow to an excessive degree. The bride goes on to explain that initially she had wanted Erin to be a bridesmaid, but thinking about the logistics of getting a dress tailored to fit her friends dimensions had stressed her out. But her bigger worry was being upstaged on her big day by her friends breasts. She continued: Part of me has a fear that Erins presence would be a distraction.   Ive been Erins friend since we were kids. Ive been there through it all, and I have seen how people react to her situation. When people think back on my wedding, I want them to think about how beautul the venue was, or how nice the wedding party looked, ormy fianceacute and I finally getting hitched! I dont want people to remember my wedding for the bridesmaid with the giant boobs. The woman added: I told Kristy these feelings and she more or less told me I was being an a**hole. And honestly I recognize that she might be correct, because Im being selfish... but then I also think thatever theres a time I can be a little selfish then its probably my wedding day.   People who read the post were less than impressed by the brides decision - and were quick to tell her so. One person agreed she was being an a**hole. They said: You specically didnt include someone in your wedding party for a medical problem they cant control. Trade out the issue at hand with needs a wheelchair or has a prosthetic arm and youll see the clear issue.  Another commented: The best way to handle the one bridesmaid needs a dferent sort of dress is to not do matching dresses but instead matching colours. A third added: I would be so hurtsomeone I knew from childhood decided not to include me because I was too skinny or because I had dferent coloured hair or because I had a certain sized breast. After reading all the responses, the bride updated her post admitting she failed to fully comprehend the depth of [her] a**holery. She has promised to sit down with Erin, apologise to her and do whatever she can to recty the situation.

One woman clearly wasnt very interested in brushing up her knowledge on the company she wanted to work for, or wowing the interviewer with her ious skills and qualications. Instead she took a very dferent approach in attempt to put herself in line for the job.  Recruiter Graham Wynn says he was shocked to receive a message from a potential candidate, offering sexual favours infor a receptionist role.Graham, the founder of HR firm Superior People Recruitment, claims to have been sent the highly inappropriate message earlier this week. He shared screenshots of the bizarre conversation online. The conversation begins with Graham offering the unnamed woman a job interview.   He writes: I have received your resume and would like to arrange an interview at level ,  Collins St, Melbourne. If convenient could you please advise best day and time. Thank you. Graham. The woman replies, saying: Hi Graham. Is there anything I can do, specically to you, that would help me get the job  She adds a winking emoji to the end of her message.  A little surprised, Graham attempts to steer the conversation back to a more professional tone. He shoots back: Just to come and meet me and will see what I can do for you. The woman then askshe wants a blow job.Speaking to news.au, Graham said: It was a shock in this day and age and all the things around #MeToo.  I put my phone down and walked away for five minutes, I asked people What do I do  My concern was, is this entrapment to see how I responded  With all this stuff going on. Graham admits he considered just ignoring the message, but colleagues convinced him that no response could be taken as a response. He explained: The rationale was because I didnt say no, I might be open to it. I spoke to a couple of people and they said the best thing to do is respond by saying This is not appropriate.  His actual response read: Refraining from ever sending text like that would help. In general showing unethical traits or an inappropriate sense of humour tends to detract from ones chances of getting a job. According to Graham hes heard nothing back from the woman since - and hes definitely not putting her forward for the job. But this wasnt the first time hes been offered a bribe. The recruiter claims he was once offered , to help someone get a job - but this was the first time someone has propositioned him with sexual favours. He added: We quite often get abusive emails from people who didnt get a job, but this sort of thing  No. I was quite taken aback by it.

Zaharie Ahmad Shah or co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid stole the plane in what he termed a criminal event.The fateful flight took off from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March ,  but vanished without a trace with  crew and passengers on board.Vance, formerly of the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, told CBC News: It’s not an accident. This was planned and conducted, carried out by one inidual who had control of the aeroplane via his job to have control of the plane. He claimed that the pilot or co-pilot made the decision to take it to a remote part of the ocean and make it disappear forever.   After studying the crash debris, Vance claims the sections of the flap system were positioned downwards and that the plane entered the water at a low speed. He said: I believe with  percent certainty that the aeroplane entered the water in a controlled ditching with the flaps extended. This indicates the pilot had deliberately crashed the aircraft into the sea, he claims. We would call that a controlling ditching into the water, Vance told  Minutes Australia in an interview. The only way that could happen issomeone was flying the aeroplane. In particular,somebody selected the flaps to be in the extended position.  He added: If the flaps were down, then somebody would have had to have put them down, and they had to have put them down intentionally. Vance has put forward the theory in his book MH Mystery Solved which he spent  months researching. The investigator was not part of the official investigation by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau Bureau but teaches the details of the incident to students.   Vances theory has not been universally accepted by those connected to the case. Martin Dolan, former head of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, there was not enough evidence to support a murder-suicide conclusion - adding that it was speculation that the flap system was positioned downwards. The evidence is not yet sufficient to draw as firm a conclusion as you appear to have done, he told Minutes.  MHs disappearance has resulted in numerous theories as to its eventual fate, including some which say the plane was switched on autopilot and ran out of fuel.Indonesian fisherman Rusli Khusmin, , claims his crew witnessed the disaster while on an expedition off the coast of northern Sumatra, Indonesia.He stated that the stricken plane emitted black smoke as it plunged into the Straight of Malacca in .  Speaking at a press conference in Kuala Lumpur, he said: I saw the plane moving from left to right like a broken kite. There was no noise, just black smoke as a result of fires before it crashed into the water. He swore an oath on the Koran and handed over evidence supporting his claims, including a a GPS navigator which he used to record the coordinates of the spot where he believes tyhe pane went down.

Being on the pitch it certainly felt it could have been a lot more than - at the break.“We dominated the game and that gives you a bit of confidence, especially playing against a Premiership team.“Second half we knew St Mirren were going to come out and have a bit more about them.“They did, but we were dealing with it without any real problems.“Unfortunately for us, Calum Butcher got sent off when it was a - tackle in midfield and could have just been a yellow card.“But he got sent off and then we showed the character to stick in and win the game.“We were playing against a team from the level above us for about  minutes with  men. We rolled our sleeves up and got the result we deserved.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c618efadbfbd5.08419022.jpg ","title":"far travelled dundee star ryan mcgowan says scots footballers are luckier than they think","story":"Far-travelled Ryan McGowan believes Scottish footballers don’t realise how lucky they are as they make their way in the game without having to give up their home comforts.When the -year-old signed for Dundee on loan from Bradford City at the end of last month, it took his tally of clubs in a -year senior career to .And having turned out for outfits in his native Australia, Scotland, China, the United Arab Emirates and England during that period, he’s clocked up more air miles that your average long-haul airline pilot.Having always known he’d have to travel round the world to make a career in football, the Socceroo believes it’s made him more open to hop from one country to another.That, he’s learned, is in contrast to many of the friends he’s made here in Scotland.“Scottish kids probably don’t realise how lucky they are. They’ve got something like  full-time clubs within a three-hour drive of where they’ve grown up,” he said.“When I was growing up in Adelaide, we had one team and then it was a two-hour flight to the next closest.“Soyou weren’t good enough for that team, you had to work harder and be prepared to sht around.“I know boys here who only want to play for teams in or near Edinburgh – and they can.“Scottish boys are very lucky to have so many clubs and opportunities without having to move.”While he’s no regrets about his nomadic career, McGowan admits the chance to hang around in one place for a prolonged period is growing more attractive.Particularlythat place is here in Scotland, the country he regards as his adopted home.“I do sometimes think I’d love to sign a two or three-year contract somewhere again,” he added.“I would have probably have loved to have stayed on at Hearts for a couple of more seasons and I was enjoying my time at United when I was there but bids came in and were accepted.“And having an Australian passport does open doors in Asia, which is why I’ve ended up there a few times.”If the chance arises to stay at Dundee long-term, he admits it’s something he will give serious thought.He has not, and will not, look that far ahead until he’s helped the Dark Blues out of their current predicament.“A couple of weeks ago moving to Dundee hadn’t even come onto my horizon. Everything has happened quickly and I just want to make sure that, first and foremost, we stay in this league.“When the summer comes,an opportunity arises to stay I will definitely consider it but there is a lot of work to be done between now and then.”He is confident by the end of the season Dundee will be safe.“It’s been really good so far. They are a great bunch of boys and they have made me feel really welcome in the dressing-room.“I’ve kicked most of them when I was playing here in seasons gone by so I know most of them.“There’s a good manager in Jim McIntyre to work under as well. I’m showing my age here but I’ve actually played against him when I was a young player on loan at Ayr from Hearts.“He was coming to the end of his career then and later I played against a couple of his teams once he’d become a manager.“I’m quite close with a couple of players who have played under him and they spoke highly of him and that was more of a factor in coming here.“Having played across the road I also knew how big a club Dundee is. It’s a good club, in a dficult position at the minute but definitely one we can get out of.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c62a1edba50c1.56795146.jpg ","title":"george cran dundee are in a far better place now than when jim mcintyre arrived","story":"Almost four months into his reign as Dundee manager, Jim McIntyre won’t look back on his first match in charge with too much fondness.However, he might just do so with a great deal more satisfaction with how his squad has shaped up in the time since.Despite only picking up two wins and six draws in the  matches under McIntyre, there’s a growing sense of optimism at Dens Park after some encouraging displays since the January transfer window.The opposite can be said of Saturday’s opponents Livingston, the side the Dark Blues faced in Jim’s debut in the dugout.After a lightning-fast start to theirto the Premiership – which peaked with that - thumping of Dundee back in October – Livi’s form has slipped off a clf with last Wednesday’s - draw at Hearts bringing a five-game losing streak to an end.Since leaving Dundee gaffer Jim in no doubt how big a job he had on his hands with that - success at the Tony Macaroni Arena, Gary Holt’s side have only picked up three victories and none since the middle of December.That’s seen them slip from a high of second spot with  points from their first eight games down to ninth with just  picked up from the following  matches.And, though the gap between the sides hasn’t shrunk in those four months, the feeling around both clubs right now couldn’t be more dferent.A massive part of that from Dundee’s point of view is the complete overhaul of the playing squad in the winter transfer window.In fact, there’s a fair chance there won’t be any of the players who featured in the - defeat the last time the Dark Blues travelled to West Lothian this time around.Only three of the  used by Jim that day remain at the club – Elliott Parish, Cammy Kerr and Kenny Miller.Of those, only Miller looks like he could be given a start this time around but even he has a fair bit of competition to overcome with Andrew Nelson on the goal trail and Craig Curran preferred by the manager to lead the line in every match since he arrived at the club at the start of January.A missed penalty in stoppage time in their last run-out won’t have helped veteran Miller’s cause either.Meanwhile, Parish hasn’t featured since that - thumping and doesn’t look like dislodging Seny Dieng as first choice any time soon.The nature of the goals that day, with all four from set-pieces, no doubt led the manager to question his defenders.Parish quickly paid the price by dropping to the bench while three of the back four have been moved on.Andy Boyle is now at Ross County, Ryan Inniss was sent back to Crystal Palace after a nightmare at Palmerston in the Scottish Cup and Calvin Miller has also dropped to the Championship, being picked up by Ayr United on loan from Celtic.Kerr was right-back in October but he’s seen his place taken by new signing James Horsfield in recent games.The former Manchester City kid has looked assured in Kerr’s place and will take some shting before Saturday.The rest of the team have since been shown the exit door – Glen Kamara, Kharl Madianga, Lewis Spence, Sofien Moussa, Benjy Kallman, Roarie Deacon and Adil Nabi have all moved on.Even the side that drew - with Livi at Dens on Boxing Day will be unrecognisable to the one running out this weekend.Whatever side he opts for, Jim knows his team are in a far better place than when he took over – now they have to prove that by getting points on the board."},{"url":null,"title":"ruthless dundee united hammer dundee 7 0 in wee derby","story":"A very strong Dundee United reserves were ruthless at Dens Park as they dispatched a youthful Dundee -

to Robbie Neilson’s Championship outfit.Referee Willie Collum was just yards away from the collision and only deemed the offence worthy of a yellow card.Even though the foul was seen by the referee, under SFA rules compliance officer Clare Whyte could have issued a notice of complaint to the former Dundee full-back had she decided the incident was “exceptional in nature”.A  of three former referees would also have to have given their unanimous agreement McGinn deserved to be sent off for Whyte to proceed with a notice of complaint but it has been decided there was not enough evidence."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c640bc2771117.02764497.jpg ","title":"tom duthie this time the renewed hope at dundee united might not be a false dawn","story":"For the first time in a long time, perhaps even since the dark days of relegation in , there is strong reason for optimism at Dundee United.The one thing that should be stressed about that immediately is it’s still early days.Robbie Neilson’s rebuilt team is only two games in and that means there is some way to go before we can confirm things are definitely on the up at Tannadice.And the truth is that will only come with promotion back to the Premiership.It must also be said there have been other  dawns over the past three years.The arrival of Ray McKinnon and then Csaba Laslo as managers brought hope and even early promise that, after the disastrous   campaign, things were being turned around.In fairness to McKinnon in particular, had he been handed the kind of budget that was made available to the current team boss in the January transfer window, the major problems at the club might well have been sorted and the Tangerines could have been back in the top flight already.Unfortunately for him, those in the boardroom when he was in charge were unable to provide the kind of cash for signings new American owner Mark Ogren has.That, incidentally, is not a criticism of the previous regimes, just an unfortunate fact.Neilson has been lucky he’s got an owner with dollars to spend and the indications so far suggest that owner is just as fortunate that he has a manager who knows how to spend it wisely.Ogren can also consider himself blessed his predecessor in the chairman’s seat at Tannadice, Mike Martin, found not just a good manager, but one who through being out of the game for a period, had taken the time to look at United and form a clear picture of what was needed.Because one thing that’s obvious about the signings made is all have been part of a jigsaw in the manager’s mind.January  didn’t just come round and see Neilson turn his thoughts to what was available. He’d done his homework and, equally importantly, worked out exactly where his squad needed strengthening.That means the right players for the right positions have been found, or so it seems.That’s produced victories over Morton and St Mirren that have lted spirits among Arabs. Rightly so, because both outings have seen impressive work.Of course, with most of those brought in lacking match fitness – that’s usually the major issue with January signings – the good football, has mostly come in the first hour.Players who’ve not had a lot of game time have tired, particularly when reduced to  men at St Mirren. They’ve then shown their ability to manage matches.What the manager also looks to have done well is identy those already in his squad who were good enough to be part of his plans.For all new boys like Peter Pawlett, Mark Reynolds and Mark Connolly have deserved the praise they’ve received for their first couple of performances, attackers Pavol Safranko and Nicky Clark have shown they remain big players.After a run of just two goals in nine games, Safranko has found his scoring touch with one in each of the last two outings and has looked the lethal striker he did when he first arrived on loan from Aalborg.Now he’s finally got fully fit, Clark also looks dangerous and there’s no doubt both have benefited from having better players round them in the last two outings.For Neilson and his players the trick is now to keep the good work going. The good news for United fans is, this time, that might just happen."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"hugh-jackman-in-glasgow-how-to-get-tickets-without-using-ticketmaster","story":"AS is usually the norm when big acts announce gigs, music fans have been unable to buy tickets to see Hugh Jackman in Glasgow through Ticketmaster, despite him having announced a staggering three-night run in May."},{"url":null,"title":"lgbt-history-month-council-decision-not-to-fly-pride-flag-is-slammed","story":"A COUNCILLOR has slammed the decision not to fly the Rainbow Flag on Glasgow City Chambers during LGBT History Month."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-mcdonalds-branch-is-serving-up-side-of-classical-music-with-big-macs","story":"A GLASGOW branch of McDonaldrsquos is serving up a side of Bach with its Big Macs in a bid to reduce anti-social behaviour."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-potato-day-back-at-the-reidvale-centre","story":"ITS a favourite day in the allotment calendar and the Glasgow Potato Day willthis year."},{"url":null,"title":"brendan-rodgers-reveals-kieran-tierney-wont-make-valencia-game","story":"Tomorrow nights Europa League game against Valencia will come too soon for Kieran Tierney."},{"url":null,"title":"brendan-rodgers-tells-celtic-to-believe-ahead-of-valencia-tie","story":"As tests go, there will be an examination this evening at Celtic Park that will be far more intense than anything  Brendan Rodgersrsquo side have experienced since the turn of the year."},{"url":null,"title":"student-party-flat-in-glasgow-city-centre-allowed-to-keep-licence","story":"THE LANDLORD of a student flat which neighbours claim is an intolerable party zone has been granted a new licence."},{"url":null,"title":"savoy-centre-revamp-art-and-culture-drawing-in-new-generation-of-customers-into-iconic-mall","story":"A PLAN to breathe new le into Glasgows Savoy Centre with boutique stores, cafe bars and contemporary art is drawing in a new generation of customers, according to traders as the next phase of the project is launched."},{"url":null,"title":"10-of-the-most-embarrassing-things-peoples-toddlers-have-said-in-public","story":"KIDS, famously, say the funniest things ndash but sometimes they can leave their parents in thoroughly awkward situations."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-trampoline-park-flip-out-announce-free-entry-for-a-year-giveaway","story":"Trampoline enthusiasts could be jumping for joy after a Glasgow arena announced it has opened applications to bring in ambassadors - who will be given free entry to the park for a whole year."},{"url":null,"title":"scots-comic-des-clarke-on-learning-to-swim-drive-and-ride-a-bike-in-the-past-year","story":"ITrsquoSall change for Des Clarke.  months ago, he couldnrsquot do basic skills which most people in their s had in the bag."},{"url":null,"title":"alesha-macphail-mum-of-accused-puzzled-about-him-leaving-house-during-the-night","story":"The mother of a -year-old boy accused of raping and killing Alesha MacPhail told the court she was ldquopuzzled about why he left the house in the middle of the night."},{"url":null,"title":"evening-times-campaign-to-teach-every-pupil-cpr-reaches-25th-council","story":"EVERY secondary school pupil in the Lothians will now be taught how to save the le of someone who has suffered a cardiac arrest, after campaigning by the Evening Times and British Heart Foundation Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"blind-taste-test-of-irn-bru-and-4-can-of-full-sugar-original","story":"It remains the great Scottish scandal of our time.

City-wide, since , there were  lebelts and  ropes replaced. This year, four lebelts and  ropes were installed or swapped out for new ones.When told of our findings, Ian Yuill, councillor for Airyhall, Broomhill and Garthdee, said: “This is alarming and hugely worrying. The le safety rings are there to save lives.“Just how stupid or nasty does someone have to be to deliberately put lives at risk by vandalising a le safety ring ”Yvonne Allan, councillor for Torry and Ferryhill, said: “I am really concerned about what they are doing as it may be their lives that need saving next, or even their family members.”Councillor Catriona Mackenzie, councillor for Torry and Ferryhill, said: “Vandalism of this equipment is beyond stupid and irresponsible, butthat has been an ongoing issue, then the city council should have identied it and worked with partner organisations to prevent further spates.“We cannot get complacent, especially when over the weekend, in an emergency situation, one of these lebelts could not be used because of damage that hadn’t been repaired. The Evening Express’ work to investigate the extent of this problem is commendable.”A council spokeswoman said: “The lebelts along the rivers and beach are inspected twice a week for any faults which do not adhere to regulations, and action is taken to remedy any faults found. The inspections along the beach front are increased to every day during the summer, due to the increased numbers of people using the area.“However, we cannot be everywhere at all times, and we ask peoplethey see anything amiss to report any faults to us on   , andthey witness any vandalism to phone the police.“We strongly advise people not to tamper with the boxes and lebelts, as the equipment can literally save lives at a time when every second counts,someone is in our fast-flowing rivers or the sea which also has strong undercurrents.“The inspection we carried out to these lebelts last week did not show faults so we thank the Evening Express for bringing it to our attention and this led to additional inspections which found at least  security seals had been damaged.“We will be reporting the damage to the police.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 01","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe conditions being endured by refugees on a remote Greek island might seem of little importance to folk living in Argyll, but Pam Gregory spends time helping make their lives easier.More volunteers are desperately needed to assist as conditions worsen during the winter and Samos Volunteers would love to hear from anyone with the inclination to help.Pam#s dedication and the support of the Craignish community deserve great credit.

First performed in , Within This Dust has gone on to be staged all over the UK and internationally, including at the   memorial and museum.Especially inspired by Richard Drew#s unforgettable photograph, The Falling Man, Within This Dust details the experience of witness, Lisa Hood, and victim, Vince Virr, of the   attacks.The witness finds herself surrounded in dust, made of crumpled paper, and begins a grieving process of hunting through the papers, finding meaning in the words, as someone tries to tidy around her. The second act features the victim joining the witness, creating a connection that will inevitably be broken, when finally, in the third act, the victim is alone, caught between a choice of the smoke and fire within the collapsing building or the  metre drop to freedom.It was a very poignant performance, tenderly expressing the horror of the incident, perhaps now weakened due to overindulgence. When the lights came up everyone stayed where they were, perhaps a little too stunned to move. Chatter was in whispers, for respect to people who could not hear them.As the narrator of the show captured and pieced together from coverage of the attacks said, the dust has not settled, and never will.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

The bunds will help reduce the risk of debris reaching the A in the event of a landslide.This project allows BEAR Scotland to maximise the benefit of recycling the material being excavated from the Rest and Be Thankful while minimising the overall cost of these works.To keep roadworkers and motorists safe throughout the works, temporary traffic lights will be in place on the A at each location. This next phase of the works is expected to last approximately  weeks.Commenting on the works, Eddie Ross, BEAR Scotland’s North West Representative said: #The installation of the next stages of the mitigation measures will provide more protection and resilience against any future landslips blocking this key route at both the Rest and Be Thankful and Glen Kinglas.#The temporary traffic lights are necessary to keep our teams as well as users of the route safe during the works, and the teams will do all they can to complete the project as quickly and safely as possible.#We encourage road users to plan their journeys in advance by checking the Traffic Scotland website for up to date travel information.#"},{"url":null,"title":"third sector interface launches new approach to service delivery","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Third Sector Interfaceis changing the way it supports all types of third sector organisations, including charities, social enterprises and community groups.Due to many people now finding information through digital means and the need for information and assistance to be accessible and consistent across the whole of Argyll and Bute, not just in the main towns, the organisation has launched a new website, argylltsi.org.The website, reflecting the TSI’s new corporate identity, contains a self-serve area allowing third sector organisations to find links to a whole iety of locally-based and more national resources that can support their development needs, as well as useful templates to use to run their organisations.The TSI will be growing and developing self-service over the coming months, with the site becoming a ‘one-stop shop’ for information that third sector organisations need to set up, govern and manage organisations – everything from how to start a social enterprise to raising funding from major donors.The TSI can also now be contacted through a central freephone number #   , available between the hours of am-pm, Monday-Friday.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayrshire health board 22m debt","story":"NewsAyrshire health board £m debt fearNHS Ayrshire  Arran have slashed the amount spent on agency nurses and made other cutbacks but the shortfall is still soaring.ShareBySarah Hilley:,  FEB NewsBoard Chair Martin Cheyne \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyrshire’s health board is on the verge of racking up a poundmillion debt this year. NHS Ayrshire  Arran have slashed the amount spent on agency nurses and made other cutbacks but the shortfall is still soaring. Now the Scottish Government are poised to step in and wipe out poundm of the debt mountain. A report presented at a board meeting this week said the “Scottish Government are currently planning on poundmillion of brokerage”. The board had already overspent by pound.m up to the end of December. The debt could soar to pound.m by the end of March. Health bosses are under pressure to reduce that figure before the end of this financial year. Board chair Martin Cheyne said: “It is right to see that we as an organisation are keen to get below the pound.million and we are working as hard as we can towards that.” North Ayshire Council leader Joe Cullinane, who attended the meeting, said: “How many cuts are the health board looking at making during  to   “NHS Ayrshire  Arran have severerly overspent and been underfunded.   “They have received loans from the Scottish Government. “But the headline budget won’t be enough to meet the demands of the health board and the citizens across Ayrshire.” Director of Finance Derek Lindsay told the board it “has managed to reduce spend in agency nursing”. Nursing agency spend has been pared down to poundm for the current financial year. The report said: “ Whilst it may not be possible to completely eradicate the use of agency nurses, a further poundm reduction is on target to be achieved in  .” There has been a dramatic reduction over the last three years with costs paid on external nursing staff droppng by half. The figure dipped from pound.m in   to pound.m in  . The risk for “financial performance” overall has been branded as “high” in the report.

Inverness were three up and on easy street after a crazy opening  minutes which saw United gt-wrap the game. But a Lawrence Shankland inspired comeback almost grabbed a share of the spoils for Ian McCalls title contenders. A relieved Robertson said: Had it finished - you wouldnt have been surprised. Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending. And were the team with the best defensive record in the league. I think a draw would’ve been fair but it’s just one of those nights.

His death revealed he had left his entire fortune in his will to his native town of Troon. His legacy would provide education awards and grants for the people of the town along with a new public school. As Marr’s train travelled north he decided to break his journey, to pay a visit to his sister in Girvan. He was close to his sister Helen and visited her often after her marriage to ColonelABGrant, owner of Killochan Castle estate at Girvan, who was also a senior partner in the firm of Grant Somerville  Co in London and was later ordained as Revd. Grant in the Church of Scotland. Marr had intended to spend part of his fortnight at Girvan but extended his stay to a month. Perhaps his change of heart was due to the widespread unrest taking place in Glasgow at that time. The January of  saw the so-called ‘Harbour Riots’, where racial confrontations were breaking out between black and white merchant seamen on the town’s quayside and spreading into the town. A four day General Strike was called for on January  and four days later George Square was crammed with tens of thousands of angry workmen. Crowds of unemployed men joined in the fracas for a  hour working week. As tempers flared the army was deployed, troops brought in tanks and armored vehicles to control the crowds. As tensions heightened it was not an environment travellers would want to find themselves caught up in. Eventually CK Marr left Girvan on Saturday February  for his onward journey north to his annual shooting and fishing break in Perthshire. As the train made its way towards the city he took ill with acute appendicitis. When taken off the train at the Central Station he was rushed to the Glasgow Nursing Home, but it was already too late as he tragically died in the operating theatre. There is little known of Charles Kerr Marr, despite having a successful career in the coal exporting business. Born on October , , at  Welbeck Crescent, Troon, he was the third son of Captain John Marr, master of the merchant ship ‘Reciprocity’, sailing between Troon and Canada. John Marr and his we Amelia had five children, sons William, John and Charles, along with two daughters, Helen and Amelia. Up to the age of ten, Charles attended the Parish School in Academy Street at Troon, going on to join his two brothers at Irvine Royal Academy to complete his education. On finishing his schooling, Marr was apprenticed at A  J Guthrie, Coal Agents at Troon Harbour. Unlike his brother John, who followed in his father’s footsteps to become a sea captain, Marr left home as soon as his apprenticeship ended, to work as a Commercial Clerk with Kitstons, Iron Merchants in Glasgow. Moving later to take up the position of cashier at Clyde Ironworks, only to leave a short time later to be manager of the firm of GrantSomerville  Co in London. The move may have been influenced by A B Grant, who was a senior partner in the company and married to his sister Helen. By the time he met his future we, some years later, there is no evidence as to when he moved back to Glasgow, or indeed any explanation found as to his change of occupation. Marr is recorded in the Scotland census of  as residing in Renfrew Street in Glasgow and again on his marriage certicate a year later, where he is also recorded as being employed as a Soft Goods Warehouseman.  Little is known as to why he left coal exporting to go into the Drapery business, or where he met and fell in love with his we Agnes Murray Kinghorn. However, Agnes’s father was a General Merchant, so it would seem likely he met her in his line of work. Charles and Agnes married on March ,  and set up home at Sutherland Terrace in Glasgow’s Hillhead. Unfortunately, after only  months of married le, Agnes tragically died of Phthisis Pulmonalis . She was just  years of age. Her death was a severe blow to Marr, leaving him brokenhearted and distraught, which had a profound effect on him. Shortly after he laid his we to rest, he had thought of going abroad to work, but instead accepted an appointment with Hull Blyth  Company of London. Within a year he was made a partner in the company when he developed the firm’s export trade. His work of establishing depots in numerous ports in the world gave him an opportunity to travel abroad, especially to China and Japan, where he found an interest in collecting oriental treasures. During his time with Hull Blyth the firm went on to become one of the largest shipping charterers in the UK. Charles Kerr Marr played a signicant part in the company’s worldwide success. Charles Marr moved to London after his we’s death, he never again owned a house. All his years in London, he alternated between two clubs, the Athenaeum and the Constitutional. The nearest he came to having a home was in his later years, when he rented two rooms in Camden House at Chislehurst in Kent, which was originally built for Napoleon the rd. Just being there helped him to relax and take up golf. He was reputed to be good company with a great sense of humour and well known to be very generous. Marr was a lover of the arts and music and in all that time he rarely spoke of his we, or of her death and he never remarried, even his closest friends assumed he was a bachelor. When he retired in  he spent a good part of each year fishing and shooting in Scotland. Two years before his untimely death, Charles Marr carefully drafted out his will in , leaving his entire fortune to the people of Troon and setting out the way it was to be carried out. Marr’s coal fortune legacy has given the town a magnicent architectural school building with playing fields the envy of the country. Marr College on its own is a fitting tribute to this man of extraordinary vision. By the time Marr College opened in  the school had attracted the most renowned academics to come and teach. It was the only grant aided school in Scotland that didn’t charge fees. A public school for every child of the town, had oak led class rooms, inlaid parquet flooring, Italian tiled corridorsa copper domed library, purple velvet drapes and teachers attired in flowing cloaks with mortar boards on their heads, this was seen by all to be a stunning,not magnicent, comprehensive school, deemed to be the best school in Scotland and envied by it. The CK Marr Educational Trust, the only one of its kind in Scotland, has provided awards or grants to hundreds of Troon students, of all ages each year. The addition of the MarrEducation Resource Centre in Troon Library, the only one then in Ayrshire, is a valuable educational resource for all who use it. Marr College and the CK Marr Educational Trust are a testimony to the wishes of Charles Kerr Marr and a fitting memorial to this great benefactor. He was buried beside his beloved we in CathcartCemetery in Glasgow. Over the past century the people of Troon owe a huge debt to custodians of Marr’s vision, the Marr Trustees, past and present. Over the decades the many Trustees, Boards of Governors and ious Clerks, Treasurers and Accountants, who have and still do today and for many decades to come, have successfully upheld the wishes of the town’s greatest ever benefactor and extraordinary visionary, Charles Kerr Marr.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnChurch of ScotlandUniversities and CollegesGlasgowEducationFishingArmed forcesLove and romanceSchoolsRenfrewTroonPerthshireGirvanAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"cinema set return prestwick after","story":"NewsCinema set forto Prestwick after  year gapReturn to the golden age of screen in PrestwickShareByStephen Houston:,  FEB NewsFriends of Broadway - they want cinema open again \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCinema made a boldto Prestwick for the first time in more than  years.

The East Ayrshire Licensing board depute clerk Stuart McCall told councillors it was important to maintain the standard policy and have consistency. He pointed to Celtic and Rangers matches as examples of tense clashes requiring robust licensing rules. Mr McCall said: “The standard practice is games start early and the reason for that is to limit the amount of alcohol supporters can have.” “We all know the outcome excess alcohol can have in certain circumstances.” Congragulating Talbot, he added: “We are all delighted to see the result. “The maintenance of the policy is important so we are not accused of favouritism.” Some venues wanted to offer breakfast to supporters.

John Senior has been an animal surgeon in the town for  years. He has also immersed himself in activities and volunteering for all sorts of causes. This week he was continuing his latest community activity as a hand bell ringer at Cumnock Old Church. John, , said: “All I want is the best for Cumnock and we are so fortunte to have so many things going on now. “I just want to make it better than it is.” The Keir McTurk Memorial Committee chose John after “much deliberation” from all the nominations. Chairman Colin Chisholm said: “John is someone who prefers to work behind the scenes rather than be at the forefront. “But his efforts for the community have proved invaluable.” John, originally from Edinburgh, has freshly retired from the Crossriggs veterinary practice in the town. When he arrived in  it was chiefly large livestock but treats mostly small animals. His we Heather, also a vet, remains involved in the management and their son Iain, the third member of the Senior family who is a vet, runs the practice. John is a very active member of the Cumnock Action Plan Committee, in which he has reformed the Cumnock Gardening Club assisted living in the arrangements for the Christmas festival and was actively involved in the poppy display marking the centenary of the end of the First World War.

I prefer being in the background. “I somehow manage to find time for the things I want to do and I am not very good at sitting down doing nothing. “I enjoy being active and putting things back into a town that has supported me and given me a living for  years.” The presentation is likely to be at Dumfries House.

-hole golf courses and high-standard accommodation.We would like to see the service continue with a timetable with low ticket prices to allow the full day in Glasgow for NHS appointments, business and shopping trips and the reinstatement of seven days a week flights to enhance business and tourism.In addition, we want national advertising campaigns inclusive of timetables to promote the area for

The doorsquocot is a clue that once a residence of some signicance stood here. It was called Dolphingstone Castle. Nothing now visibly remains of the castle, but around  years ago ruins were still to be seen.It was at one time an elegant mansion, but before that, on the same site, an older castle once stood ndash now all gone, and the structures of modernity are hemming in what is left of this ancient site. A wave of new housing laps at its walls to the west, the A traffic roars past on its south, and roads surround it on other quarters.One wondersthis small slice of East Lothian history will survive the developers. I hope it does. It is a small, historic fingerprint and gives a mysterious glimpse into our countyrsquos past, in an area now being carpeted with thousands of new houses.Earlier maps suggest that Dolphingstone Castle was surrounded by woodland. So perhaps the planting of a small wood or orchard within the old walls could create an island of both nature and history amidst the tide of urbanising development in this area.Up above on the ridge of Falside Hill to the south, the restored Farsquoside Castle looks down on the developments below . It sits like an eagle perched on a high ridge, observing the land below.How dferent the landscape it surveys would have been in  when, according to an old story, a small force of hand-picked warriors descended from the castle under the cover of darkness.It was just past midnight when they left, guided by a slither of moon. It was a raiding party, bent on revenge and heading for Preston Tower in what is now Prestonpans.Tradition tells us a feud had existed between the houses of Farsquoside and Preston for some years. The cause of the feud was the breaking down of walls between the two estates and the animals of each side grazing on the land of the other. Regular, and sometimes violent, clashes had taken place.But then Hamilton of Prestonrsquos livestock had been poisoned, or so it seemed. They had drunk from a burn which flowed from Farsquoside and it was assumed the water had been deliberately poisoned. Hamilton of Preston Tower, making no investigation, sent his men on a raid of violent retribution.Farsquoside Castle was attacked and blood was shed. This was the act which the select band of warriors who had set forth from Farsquoside were to avenge.In darkness, they filed down from the ridge on a path now known as Whinney Loan. This took them down to where the new houses are now being built on the southern edge of Wallyford.From here, great care was needed lest they be seen or heard. Dolphingstone Castle lay ahead and although their grievance was not with the occupants of Dolphingstone, early discovery could ruin the element of surprise.So the raiders veered north of Dolphingstone, by way of Prestoungrange, and at dawn, with the smell of the salt pans in their noses, they set about their vengeful work.Screams and running bairns alerted the occupants of Preston Tower. Armed men were ready, for this raid was expected, although not from this direction.The walls of Preston Tower held the attackers at bay but the people of the village suffered the worst of the slaughter. What senseless violence: neighbours separated only by the brae of a hill had been whipped up into a hateful frenzy against each other. Gradually the raiders melted away, back up the hill, with blooded swords.But hate builds on hate and the reckoning was not slow in coming. The very next day, Hamilton of Preston led a force westwards. It arrived by the walls of Dolphingstone Castle and then rounded past them to head up the hill towards Farsquoside, crossing where now the A speeds by.No attempt at surprise was required, this was to be an open fight. The Lord of Farsquoside had arranged his men along the top of the ridge, looking down on the approaching force of Hamiltonrsquos men. The order to charge was given and the men of Farsquoside poured down the slope.The leaders of both sides were in the thick of the fighting. It was the Lord of Farsquoside who fell, pulled from his horse and hacked to death by Hamiltonrsquos men.Seeing the death of their leader, the men of Farsquoside fled back to the castle. But the Lady of Farsquoside, in shock and rage at the death of her husband, rallied the men. She led them out of the castle in a furious charge as the sun began to set, forcing Hamiltonrsquos men to flee back to Preston.The battle, or skirmish as some would call it, was over, and the feud had reached its bloody climax. Soon after it was discovered an infectious disease had stricken the cattle, not poisoned water. Cattle on both sides had been equally affected. No one was to blame.How easy it had been to make enemies out of neighbours based on  assumptions. We are told Hamilton attempted to make amends. But the dead could not rise and the Lady of Farsquoside was said to be devastated at the loss of her husband. We can be sure others of lesser status suffered no less.This feud was over little remains to record it except tradition passed down, captured and retold by th-century writers such as P MrsquoNeill and Robert Seton, from whose works this account is garnished.Preston Tower still stands in Prestonpans, in a ruined but still defiant state. Farsquoside, much restored, is a visual delight still keeping watch atop the ridge. But only those feint hinds of Dolphingstone Castle remain, most of it lost to time and mystery just like the details of this story.But all the more reason to preserve and value them, I think."},{"url":null,"title":"betting-businesses-told-to-monitor-gambling-habits-of-people-on-benefits","story":"East Lothian Councilrsquos licensing board has approved a new gambling policy which puts the responsibility for policing the risks of betting in the hands of new licensees.Among the issues that new applicants will have to prove they have addressed before being given a licence will be monitoring ldquogaming trends that may reflect benefit payments, ldquoidentying and reporting attempts to launder money on premises and ldquoprotecting vulnerable people and those with gambling dependencies.Approving the new draft policy, which will govern the boardrsquos licensing decisions for the next three years, board members raised concerns about a lack of legislation to stophigh streets in deprived communities becoming lined with betting shops.Councillor Lachlan Bruce, Preston Seton Gosford ward member, called for current laws which prevent local authorities from refusing a licence to betting businesses because of overprovision to be changed.He said that it was impossible to walk down some town centre streets without being confronted by gambling premises offering promotions and deals.Mr Bruce told the meeting: ldquoThere are high streets in East Lothian where [betting shops] seem to be every  yards.ldquoThere is an issue where it is impossible to avoid gambling premises.The board was told that the Gambling Act  precluded using overprovision as a reason to refuse a licence for a betting shop.The councilrsquos new policy will put the onus for local risk assessments on applicants who want to open licensed gambling premises ranging from bookies to casinos, bingo halls, tracks and travelling fairs.Board member Councillor Jane Henderson, North Berwick Coastal, spoke of the dangers of gambling addiction, saying: ldquoGambling is an extremely destructive situation and sometime it does not get the headlines other things do.ldquoBut it crosses all walks of le and we, as a board and as iniduals, have a moral duty to recognise it is as much an illness as anything  and anything we can do to help should be taken very seriously.Councillor Willie Innes, council leader and Preston Seton Gosford ward member, cautioned that only a minority of people who gambled were affected by addiction and for others it was simply an activity they enjoyed.He told board members: ldquoWhen I first joined the council, gambling was a backstreet activity with premises down back alleys and it took us a long time to persuade the industry to come onto the high street.Mr Innes said that the new policy, which set out additional risk assessment requirements for applicants, sent ldquoa clear message to both the industry and those concerned about it."},{"url":null,"title":"prominent-cockenzie-campaigner-larry-tomlins-remembered","story":"Larry Tomlins, who was chairman of Cockenzie West Tenants and Residents Association, was involved in campaigns to reduce speeding and upgrade local park facilities in his community.The grandfather-of-two was an active supporter of the recent fight to implement speeding restrictions outside new housing at The Chimneys, Cockenzie, and helped oversee the trial and subsequent introduction of  miles per hourspeed limits in the Whin Park area of the village.Mr Tomlins, , grew up in Ayrshire and moved to Cockenzie more than  years ago, where he raised his family with we Ann.A consultant engineer, he ran his own successful business and still found the time to be an active member of his local community.He was a founding member of the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association, which helped improve Whin Park for local families.Ward councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell said: ldquoLarry made a huge contribution to the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association and the wider community.

But spring still feels like a long way off.I crave it, not just because it makes the evening walks in the woods possible once more, but because of the beauty it s to the landscape.The land is still dormant, with nature seemingly sleeping. Itrsquos at this time of year that the ugly results of peoplersquos disregard for the land can be most clearly seen. Litter of all kinds lsquodecoratesrsquo the roadsides. In summer it is partly hidden as hedges, roadside bushes and grasses grow. But in winter nature retreats and exposes the extent of peoplersquos uncaring behaviour.I canrsquot understand it, I really canrsquot. Our country is so beautul, yet so many people just throw rubbish from their car window. Do they not see the results and feel a sense of shame and horror  In a country where we have the facilities to dispose of our rubbish, there is simply no excuse to trash our landscape like this.And in a time when there are cuts to vital services, councils having to pay money to pick up peoplersquos rubbish from the sides of roads is just another unseen effect. Itrsquos not just that itrsquos ugly to look at, itrsquos polluting our environment, killing wildle and leaving an appalling legacy for our children.And so as we set off last Sunday for a walk, the sight of litter strewn everywhere along the roadside was quite depressing. And my children noticed its ugliness too. ldquoWhy do people litter like this  I was asked by my five-year-old Skye, and to be honest I struggled for an answer.ldquoI really donrsquot know, but it must be because they donrsquot care.My daughter seemed forlorn at this reply as we drove past a mass of discarded fast food remains, plastic bottles, beer bottles, plastic bags and yet more fast food rubbish.But I wanted to lt her spirits and so told her we were going on a hunt for something beautul. We were on a snowdrop hunt! And so as we drove to our destination, I reminded them of my version of the old story:lsquoMany years ago, Snow had no colour. It felt ashamed and left out to be colourless, especially when the land was so beautully covered in flowers of all dferent colours.And so Snow asked the flowersthey would be willing to share just a little of their colour. First Snow asked the daffodils, who were a beautul yellow. But they said no, they needed all their colour for themselves.Then Snow asked the bluebells, who were a wonderful blue. But they said they were too small to share any of their colour.Then Snow asked the whin bushesthey could share some of their vivid yellow, and they said no because they needed the colour.Snow even asked the roses of summer, but got the same answer: no.Then Snow heard a small voice and looked down. It was a small white flower. We can share some of our colour, with you it said.ldquoBut you are so small and you need your colour for yourself, said Snow. ldquoYes, the flower replied, ldquowe are small and we need our colour, but there are many of us andeach one of us gives a little then we can give you enough colour.ldquoThat is very kind of you but I donrsquot want to ruin your beautul appearance, said Snow.ldquoDonrsquot worry, said the wee white flower, ldquowe can all take a little colour from the inside of our petals, so it will not be noticed that any white is missing.rsquoAnd so that is how Snow became white. And because of the kindness shown by this little flower, Snow agreed to share its name with it, and so they became known as snowdrops.Snow also shared its space with the wee flower, so snowdrops and snow are often seen on the ground together. Andyou look carefully inside the snowdrop, you will see the hidden part where the white has been scraped off to give to Snow.With the storyrsquos end we arrived at Smeaton Lake, near East Linton, our destination for the snowdrop hunt. Itrsquos such a beautul place where a planted wood stands guard by a lake created  years ago. The woodland here is possibly unsurpassed in East Lothian for the canopy of snowdrops it displays.Excited screams at small patches of the flower soon gave way to ldquowow, look as we reached the end of the waterside and a wood carpeted by the wee flowers.My spirits were lted as I watched my daughter carefully examine flowers for evidence they had shared their colour. She showed her wee brother the green strips inside, explaining that is where the white was shared from. Both were careful not to damage or pick the flowers, despite their desire to do so.ldquoWersquoll find some growing in a less happy place and take those ones home, I assured them.And so we eventually headed back, a delicious bowl of ice cream at The Goth in Prestonpans, accompanied by traditional music, the reward for a good dayrsquos hunting.That night my daughter was reflective. ldquoI wish people wouldnrsquot spoil nature, she said. I felt guilty shersquos only five, I thought to myself, and shouldnrsquot have to be concerned about such things at that age. Perhaps I should have kept my thoughts to myself.ldquoBut I wonrsquot, and Irsquoll tell my friends not to as well. Can you tell me the snowdrop story again  So I told her the story once more.She had one wee snowdrop in a bowl by her bed. We had found it growing precariously at the verge of the road, surrounded by litter, and she wanted to lsquosaversquo it. So we did, hopefully with roots intact.ldquoWell we will plant the snowdrop in the garden and perhaps we will have our own snowdrops next year! I said to her, and she was happy at this.I went downstairs as she slept. My thoughts and emotions flooded me. My anger and depression at the ignorant mess we are making of our planet was superseded by my daughterrsquos determination to make a small dference, just like the snowdrop in the story.And perhaps therein lies the true message of that old tale: a dference can be made,we all do a little, but do it together.The children are the future, but letrsquos not leave all our ugly mess and destruction to our children to deal with. Let us all do something small, as many already are, to change the way we behave and how we appreciate what we have been gted.For our childrenrsquos sake, I really hope itrsquos not too late."},{"url":null,"title":"county-team-conquer-kilimanjaro-in-memory-of-vera-cameron","story":"Dougie Cameron and daughter Laura-Jane were joined by seven other men and women in climbing Mount Kilimanjaro last week.The trek was the latest fundraiser in memory of Vera Cameron and in aid of Cancer Research UK.Laura-Jane said that her mum would have thought the fundraisers were ldquooff our heads but would be ldquoreally proud of their achievement, which takes the fundraising total to about pound,.She said: ldquoIt was a really tough challenge but the fact we were doing it for charity kept us going.ldquoAt the end of the day, it was for such a good cause and we wanted to get to the top and keep the sponsorship going.ldquoThe whole experience was totally dferent to what I expected.ldquoBeing over seven days, we have never done anything like that before and it was tough mentally and physically.ldquoWe had one goal ndash to get to the summit ndash and we ended up making lots of new friends and spent a lot of time with other groups.ldquoIt was a really good experience overall.Vera, of Macmerry, worked for East Lothian Council as a senior administrator in transportation.Dougie, who is site attendant at Kinwegar Recycling Centre in Wallyford, was joined by seven colleagues from the council on the memorable trip.Laura-Jane, , and her dad set off from Scotland on January  alongside Ray Montgomery , Paul Ritchie , Lorraine Faulds , William Kelley , Stuart Baxter , Rachael Cormackand Vanessa Sanal .The group began the trip up the near-,-metre-high mountain on the Saturday and reached the summit last Thursday.Then it was back down before flying home on Sunday and back to work on Monday.Laura-Jane, who works as a PR officer, said it was ldquosurreal to think that just a few days earlier she had been standing at the top of Kilimanjaro.Already, more than pound, has been donated to the good cause, with that figure set to rise to pound, when all the money has been donated and counted.Previously, fundraisers have completed a number of other challenges ndash although nothing on the scale of the latest achievement ndash in memory of Vera, who was  when she passed away from cancer in .The West Highland Way, which stretches from Milngavie to Fort William , and the Three Peaks Challenge, which sees the highest peaks in Scotland, England and Wales ndash Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon respectively ndash climbed have been completed.Laura-Jane, who lives in Tranent, said: ldquoI think my mum would think we were off our heads for doing what we have done but really proud of us.

He effectively dropped his opposition to her Withdrawal Agreement, which Labour had repeatedly condemned as the ldquoworst of all worlds. The Labour leaderrsquos letter still calls for a customs union, regulatory alignment on trade and guarantees on workers rights and security cooperation. But, crucially, Labour is no longer holding to the ldquosix tests, and insisting a Brexit deal should deliver ldquoexactly the same benefits as being in the single market.Labour has even dropped its opposition to the Irish backstop, which Mr Corbyn condemned, as recently as December, for leaving Britain ldquoin an indefinite halfway house with no say on its future. The explanatory note that Labour circulated after the leaderrsquos letter to May is quite clear. ldquoAny withdrawal agreement,\" it says, ldquowill need to include a backstop.\" Labour is also hinting at further compromises in ldquonegotiations.Hitherto, Labourrsquos policy has been to make demands May could never accept now they are trying to make her an offer she canrsquot refuse.So at last, after months of there being nothing much new to say about Brexit, suddenly we have what looks like a breakthrough, a historic compromise. Of course, you canrsquot overestimate the ability of political leaders to look a gt horse in the mouth. Theresa May may be so wedded to being a ldquobloody dficult womanthat she may find a way to avoid accepting Labourrsquos free hooved mammal. But the deal is there to be made.Senior Tories like Sir Oliver Letwin have welcomed the Labour offer, seeing it as a step towards a Norway-style agreement, even though it isnrsquot. Labourrsquos plan is much closer to Turkey, which is also in a customs union and accepts regulatory alignment. Brussels likes Corbyns proposals too, as a way out of hard Brexit ldquohell.Ive argued that the logic of Labourrsquos position was always to back something resembling Theresa Mayrsquos deal with the EU. It corresponds to Labourrsquos manesto commitments to leaving the EU, including the single market, and ending free movement while seeking frictionless trade. Mrs May has always supported regulatory alignment, since the ldquocommon rule book in her Chequers plan. And the backstop, remember, involves the UK remaining in the customs union until there is a future comprehensive trade deal.In what could almost have been a coordinated intervention last week, Mrs May restated in Dublin her determination to prevent a hard border in Ireland. This put the wind up the DUP, since they fear that the border might now move to the Irish Sea.It didnrsquot appeal to the hardline Brexiteers in her own party either, who are adamant that no deal is better than her bad deal. They thought it had been killed off by last monthrsquos record-breaking Commons defeat ndash but it may now live again with Labourrsquos backing.They canrsquot admit it, of course, but May and Corbyn are now speaking broadly the same language. The customs union, regulatory alignment, rights and protections etc are all matters to do with the future trade relationship with the EU, not the Withdrawal Agreement. It covers only money, citizenship and the Good Friday Agreement.The trading relationship can only be negotiated after Brexit. It is to be hammered out within the up to four years of the transition period, during which the UK remains in the single market and the customs union.Onlythere is no agreement does the backstop comes into play, and that really just extends the transition period indefinitely. May has said she will get assurances that the backstop will be time-limited, but she canrsquot get that from the European Union. If it was limited, it would no longer be a backstop.What hard Brexiteers really fear is that the transition period might lead to a soft Brexit, not a clean break ndash and they are right. What we know is that MPs will block any no-deal Brexit. Hardliners face a choice of May Corbyn or no Brexit at all.To secure a Commons majority without them, Mrs May could promise legislation to keep Britain in regulatory alignment with the customs union until a new trade deal is finalised ndash one which delivers the same benefits. This is anyway implicit in her promises to keep trade ldquofrictionless. Indeed, remaining in a customs union is the only way of achieving this. Up to now, she hasnrsquot been able to say this openly for fear of a rebellion by her hardline backbenchers, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg. They want a managed no-deal now, or in four years, under the so-called ldquoMalthouse Plan.Butshe has an ounce of political sense, May will now face them down and pivot to Labourrsquos softish Brexit. Labourrsquos demand that she put the customs union in primary legislation can be finessed, because the trade negotiations canrsquot happen until after Brexit. She doesnrsquot even need to ensure that Labour votes with her. Labour could abstain in the meaningful vote and achieve essentially the same result. The DUP would accept the customs union as a guarantee against a backstop or an east west hard border.Jeremy Corbyn could explain Labourrsquos abstention, which will be attacked by Vote Leave MPs andleader writers, by saying, as his spokespeople did last week: that the top priority ldquofor the nation is to avoid a no-deal. Corbynite commentators can be relied upon to condemn any Labour MPs who continue to vote against Mayrsquos deal as traitors. Unreconstructed Blairites, voting with the hated Moggists to force a no-deal disaster.Corbynrsquos letter made no reference to a Peoples Vote. Remainers in the Labour Party realise where all this is heading, which is why a number, like former shadow cabinet figures like Owen Smith, and Clive Lewis, have threatened to leave the party. That could become part of the script.Corbyn has used the Brexit issue to smoke out Blairite Remainers like Chuka Umunna, and the Jewish MP, Luciana Berger, in order to portray them as disloyal splitters.Of course, ordinary members of the Labour Party will be mightily confused. Many of them still think Labour is committed to a referendum. It still could come to that, of course,May doesnrsquot seize this opportunity.I still harbour vague hopes that A could be revoked, but Irsquom afraid that pro-Europeans are on the wrong side of history right now. The country is destined to leave the EU, because letrsquos face it, Labour under Jeremy Corbyn is and has always been a pro-Brexit party.And after Brexit Day  Well, get ready for Groundhog Day  as negotiations over the future EU trade deal begin all over again."},{"url":null,"title":"night-time-arts-project-to-be-part-of-hebridean-dark-skies-festival","story":"Now the concept behind Whatever Gets You Through The Night, a multi-media artistic reflection of le between the hours of midnight and am, is being adapted for one of the countryrsquos most remote locations seven years after it was first staged.Musicians Emma Pollock and Rachel Sermanni are among the acts performing in a revised version of the project at An Lanntair arts hub in Stornoway on the Western Isles as part of the first Hebridean Dark Skies Festival on Lewis.First conceived by theatre director Cora Bissett and playwright David Greig, Whatever Gets You Through The Night originally featured songs by Pollock and Sermanni with author Alan Bissett and songwriters RM Hubbert, Ricky Ross and Eugene Kelly.Actors Frances Thorburn and John Kielty were joined by aerial artists as an audience, seated on reclaimed seats from Glasgow Corporation buses, were taken on a journey from solitary introspection and cosmic rumination to pounding clubs and the hunt for chips and cheese.The production was accompanied by an album, book and film and won a Creative Scotland Award for Best Theatre in .A long way from Glasgowrsquos Arches, this weekrsquos reduced adaptation is at the heart of the festival programme, augmented by music from Gaelic singer Ceitlin LR Smith and Hebridean songwriter The Sea Atlas, aka Calum Buchanan.Lewis-based festival programmer Andrew Eaton-Lewis, whose band Swimmer One collaborated with Bissett and Greig on the original project, pointed to parallels between what was staged at the Arches and what will be seen in the Western Isles this week.He said: ldquoWhen I was asked to programme the Dark Skies Festival, Emma Pollockrsquos song from the album, Dark Skies, was in my head quite a lot. I really wanted to do something with the song, so we used it in the trailer.ldquoThen after a while I started thinking the same kind of thoughts we had when we were making Whatever Gets You Through The Night, and that it would be a really interesting way to broaden out the festival beyond astronomy and star-gazing. Itrsquos about songs and stories which help you through that time in the night.Mr Eaton-Lewis added: ldquoWhen you come to Lewis people tell you the winters are long and hard because the nights are so long.ldquoBut the long nights can also be magical. A lot of the stories people were coming up with when we were first making that project were about endurance and survival. So it seemed like an interesting thing to explore in this context.The festival, which runs until  February , includes photography exhibitions, film screenings, expert discussion on the cosmos and insight into the inidual benefit of sensory enlightenment through exposure to the dark, with indoor and outdoor venues including the former RAF radar station at Gallan Head, the UKrsquos most north-westerly point.Glasgow-based singer songwriter Emma Pollock said the festivalrsquos appeal lay in its celebration of the winter experience.ldquoItrsquos so dferent to that of the summer on the island or the winter on the mainland, and I think for that reason itrsquos beautul idea, because so many of us just donrsquot get to experience that emptiness or that silence, said the former lead singer of Lanarkshire indie band The Delgados.ldquoThis is essentially a nod to the fact that the contrast between night and day in a rural community is much greater than you ever get living in the city.Ms Pollock will perform her song Dark Skies as part of her performance at An Lanntair, written for the  project as a reflection on growing up in Castle Douglas in Dumfries and Galloway close to the Galloway Forest, one of two Dark Skies Parks in Scotland - the other being in the Cairngorm National Park.She said: ldquoI was thrown back to where I grew up, that emptiness, that rural space which is so much more magnied at night and is such a huge contrast with urban darkness.ldquoIf yoursquore out there and the weather is good, then what you can see is quite incredible.

The Government at UK level should take that prospect off the table, it should rule out no-deal and its failure to do so with every day that passes right now becomes increasingly reckless and negligent.But, she explained, such a prospect did put a responsibility on the Scottish Government to increase its planning.ldquoWe stepped up the level of our planning today, the FM revealed.ldquoWe canrsquot mitigate all impacts of that, the impacts will be so wide-ranging and so severe that it will not be possible to take away all of that impact but itrsquos important that within our areas of responsibility wersquore doing everything that we possibly can and wersquore very focused on exactly that.Asked what advice she would be giving to Scottish householders, Ms Sturgeon replied: ldquoThe Scottish Government over the next few weeks will run public information campaigns.ldquoWersquoll look to give not just advice to households but we will give advice, we already give advice to businesses and to all sectors of the economy.ldquoOf course therersquos a balance we need to strike.

But most observers believe this to be highly unlikely and that the process will move towards the key vote at the end of the month.While like tonightrsquos vote, the one on February  will be a next-steps decision, which will not be legally binding, the Whitehall sources made clear, politically, it will be enormously important.One referred to it as a ldquosemi-meaningful vote. The meaningful vote on the PMrsquos fully-formed Plan B is not expected until March.As MPs began their latest debate on Brexit the prospect of defeat for Mrs May appeared to be receding after leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg suggested it was \"highly unlikely\" that Eurosceptic Tories would rebel after all.Members of the backbench Conservative European Research Group had threatened to vote down a Government motion, which they said effectively endorsed efforts to block a no-deal Brexit.But ministers warned that defeat for the PM would send the \"wrong signal\" to Brussels about the possibility of Parliament uniting behind the revised Withdrawal Agreement which Mrs May is seeking.Liam Fox, the International Trade Secretary, told potential rebels that Parliament was not an \"internal debating society\" and European negotiators would be watching to seeMPs were showing \"consistency\".\"What we say is looked at and listened to by those that we are negotiating with,\" the Scot told BBC Radio s Today programme.Read more:BBC Question Time faces fresh row over claims it edited SNP retort to former UKIP candidate\"They will be looking to see whether Parliament is showing consistency because in the debates and the votes we had recently there were two things: one was that Parliament said we dont want there to be no-deal and that we will sign up to the Prime Ministers dealwe are able to get changes to the Irish backstop.\"Our European partners will be watching our debate and listening today to seethey get the impression thatthey were to make those concessions, Parliament would definitely deliver on that.\"However, Steve Baker, the former Brexit minister, argued Conservatives should not be \"associated with anything\" that \"seems to take no-deal off the table\".Members of the ERG have been lobbying Downing Street for two days to amend the wording of Mrs Mays motion for the Valentines Day vote, which asks the Commons to \"reiterate\" its support for the approach approved in an earlier set of votes on January .MPs voted on that date to send Mrs May back to Brussels to seek an alternative to the \"backstop\" provisions in her EU Withdrawal Agreement which are intended to ensure the Irish border stays open after Brexit.But they also gave a majority the same day to a non-binding amendment calling on the Government to rule out a no-deal outcome.Some Eurosceptics would welcome no-deal, while others believe it must be kept as a weapon in the Governments armoury to ensure maximum leverage in extracting concessions from the EU.Speaking as Downing Street confirmed it would not amend the wording of the motion, backbencher Lee Rowley said: \"The Government is essentially asking me to vote for something tonight - taking no- deal off the table - which isnt Government policy.\"We are all genuinely scratching our heads this morning asking what on earth they are doing. Instead of putting forward badly worded motions, the Government should be properly focusing on the Malthouse compromise - the one and only option which brings together Leavers and Remainers and, vitally, will command a majority in Parliament.\"ERG members declined to confirm whether there would be a rebellion or speculate on possible numbers involved.But Mr Rees-Mogg, the groups chairman, signalled three hours before voting was due to take place that the potential revolt was off.He told ITV News: \"This is a secondary issue, rather than a primary one, and that is why it is highly unlikely people will be voting against this motion.\"Mrs Mays spokesman told reporters: \"It is important that MPs support the Prime Minister today in order to send another clear message to Brussels on the need to address Parliaments concerns about the backstop, so we can leave on time with a deal on March .\"John Bercow, the Commons Speaker, selected only three of the  amendments tabled for debate on the floor of the Commons.MPs are set to vote on a Labour amendment demanding that Mrs May hold a meaningful vote on her plan by February  or hand power to Parliament to decide the next steps.Also selected were an SNP amendment calling for a three-month extension to Brexit negotiations and a demand from pro-EU backbenchers led by Tory Anna Soubry for the publication of the latest official assessments of the likely economic impact of no deal.The latest showdown comes as Dutch PM Mark Rutte told the Financial Times the Netherlands was already benefiting from businesses relocating from a \"diminished\" Britain.But Mrs Mays spokesman insisted Number  \"disagrees entirely\" with Mr Ruttes stance, adding: \"Employment is at a record high, exports are at a record high, companies are continuing to invest in the UK.\"Deloitte named the UK as Europes leading destination for foreign direct investment and London as the worlds top city for investment just last month.\"In a bid to keep lines open with EU leaders, Mrs May spoke to French President Emmanuel Macron and Romanian President Klaus Iohannis on Wednesday evening and is expected to make further phone calls over the course of Thursday.Peoples Vote protesters seeking a second EU referendum gathered outside Parliament to demonstrate against what they termed a \"blindfold Brexit\".And pro-Brexit campaigners from the Leave Means Leave movement delivered a Valentines Day card for the PM to Downing Street."},{"url":null,"title":"first-look-line-up-for-new-bbc-scotland-channel-revealed","story":"Love Island host Iain Stirling will be the face of the first programme on Sunday February , a one-off iety show featuring Scots singers Lewis Capaldi and Nina Nesbitt in what the broadcasters promise will be \"an evening packed with laughs and entertainment\".The first night will also see the introduction of The Peoples News, which invites ordinary Scots to speak their minds on the weeks news, events and gossip.Read more:Emeli Sande and Mark Bonnar set to feature on new BBC Scotland channelThe ten-part series aims to steer clear of traditional media commentators and opt for a funnier approach, seeing ying viewpoints from all walks of le and every corner of the country.It comes just one night before highly anticipated The Nine is broadcast for the first time, with Rebecca Curran and Martin Geissler fronting the new \"nightly news hour\".Hayley Valentine, editor of The Nine, said: \"Im delighted with the team of presenters and reporters weve put together.\"It has a great mix of experienced correspondents and new talent, all of whom are working on a raft of original stories for The Nine.\"Our viewers will get some of the best analysis of Scottish, UK and international news from this team.Read more:BBC Question Time details revealed ahead of Aylesbury show\"And Irsquom confident viewers will enjoy a very dferent approach to news presenting and storytelling.\"The broadcaster also announced Scotlands answer to Question Time will launch in the opening week.Debate Night will give members of the public one hour to put their questions to a  of politicians and other public figures about the biggest stories and the things they care about the most.Comedian Des Clarke will front the multi-award winning topical comedy news quiz Breaking the News, which covers the weeks news agenda in Scotland and across the UK.It follows a successful pilot on BBC Two Scotland at the end of , andhas been scheduled for a -week run on the new channel.The ninth -

He said some areas of the town, such as Shore Street and Upper Ormlie, had been designated as one-way streets some time ago but this had not been implemented. \"That needs to be corrected,\" he said at Tuesday nights meeting.Mr Potts and other community councillors felt something had to be done to address the issue of speeding and one suggestion was for more sleeping policemen to be installed in problem areas of Thurso.Councillor Rosie, who represents Thurso and Northwest Caithness on Highland Council, said what is needed is a transport review which can take a comprehensive look at the issue. \"We need a strategic look at the whole thing ndash something which covers transport management and pedestrians,\" he said.However, community councillor and former police officer Bert MacLeod urged caution. He said: \"You need to be careful you dont go overboard with this  mph limit. Modern cars can stop quicker than vehicles did in the past. We need to be sensible.\"Mr Potts claimed \"some of the driving in Thurso is abysmal\".Mr MacLeod replied: \"Why should you and I be affected because someone drives like an idiot \"He also pointed out there are problems with installing sleeping policemen on roads. New laws have been introduced as cars have been damaged by them, he said.\"It is not just a case of putting them down,\" stated Mr MacLeod. He argued that enforcement is the key to tackling the problem.\"If you had a traffic warden in each town again that would help,\" he added.Community councillor Colin Johnston said something should be done to address the issue of traffic and parking in the town.Struan Mackie, another Thurso and Northwest Caithness Highland councillor, stressed that it takes time to process traffic orders and pointed out that the mph plan for Wick began over two years ago.He also pointed out that the county is going to get traffic enforcement officers which should help deal with some of the parking issues.Mr MacLeod commented: \"You have got to watch you do not overdo these things.\"But Mr Potts said: \"Parking has been an issue for a long time. It is up to us to keep fighting. There is parking available in the town so the problem can be overcome.

We have been calling for more parking enforcement in Wick for a while now.\"High Street and Bridge Street are far too regularly packed with cars parked where they shouldnt be. Its an issue that has been raised time and time again by both drivers and pedestrians. Some people think they are above the rules and for too long theyve got away with it.\"He added: \"Under the current proposals Bridge Street and much of High Street will essentially become double yellows, meaning no parking at any time. This should also help stop the constant issue of people selfishly parking in areas like the Market Square.\"The parking bays there are intended only for those who are disabled badge holders but these rules are often ignored by people who just canrsquot be bothered walking.\"Councillor Sinclair said the order would give council officers the power to enforce parking restrictions once they receive the required training but, initially, existing enforcement staff would carry out the work.\"We should expect a much more regular presence than under the old system,\" he said. \"The discussions Irsquove had with the officer responsible for parking have been extremely encouraging.\"Having an enforcement officer in the town for regular and random visits is a great start butthe situation doesnrsquot improve we will still be pushing to get someone in this post locally to clamp down on rogue drivers.\"He explained that in Inverness several council employees have been trained to undertake parking enforcement duties as well as their day-to-day jobs. \"There is no reason why the same couldnrsquot be done up here. If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others.

Whether it’s our personal information on social media or important financial details, it’s vital that we’re aware of how to keep our safe and secure from cyber criminals.”“By really getting under the skin of these hackers, our Cyber Sense workshops can point out how to understand how these iniduals work. Through the games we’ve designed, attendees will be able to competitively play roles on both sides of a cyber-crime. This offers a unique perspective that can show just what preventative measures can be taken to outsmart these online criminals.”To learn more about the Cyber Sense on Tour event and to book a free place, visit www.hellodigital.scot cyber-sense- copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The body responsible for food standards and nutrition in Scotland is currently consulting on a range of proposals, including mandatory calorie labelling. Food Standards Scotland has said the country’s diet is too high in calories, fats, sugars, and salt, which can lead to type  diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Now, Dundee City Council’s community safety and public protection committee is expected to formally endorse the watchdog’s suggestions, stating that “mandatory means” are necessary to address problems which cost Scotland £.bn a year. In its draft consultation response, the committee said it wants to make outlets serve smaller portions and print the calorie contents of meals on menus.A report to councillors, who will be asked to formally approve the response at a meeting on Monday, states: “There is no single solution to tackling the issue of a poor diet, however eating outside the home is one of the areas where change is needed as in many cases the food and drink on offer tends to be a less healthy option.”The council’s response argues that as well as compulsory calorie labelling, food inspectors should be trained to carry out checks to ensure premises are meeting the new regulations. It states: “Businesses need to cease practices that encourage over-consumption.“This will require defining carefully which practices encourage overeating. Multi-packs and ‘go large’ promotions on meals and drinks should be banned. Healthy meal deals could be promoted.”: Restaurants could face curb on portion size and calorie countIt added that “public sector premises should be exemplars and early adopters” of the new measures.Alan Ross, the convener of the committee, said: “Basically, we are trying to promote healthier lestyle choices.“It’s about people living longer, reducing the strain on the NHS and the benefits eating healthily.”NHS Tayside dietetic consultant in public health nutrition Joyce Thompson said: “NHS Tayside is aware that food eaten outside the home currently makes up a signicant part of people’s diets and therefore welcomes the Food Standards Scotland’s consultation on proposals to improve the out of home food environment.“The proposals, which include consideration of portion sizes, calorie information on the menus, improving quality of food sold out of home, and shting marketing and promotion strategies from unhealthy products to healthier options, offer important steps in the solution to tackle overweight and obesity.”Jonathon Clark, owner of Clarks bakery in the city, said he would comply with any new rules but did not think mandatory calorie labelling “makes much sense”.He said: “We have a salad bar at the front of our shops and have tried to promote healthier eating in our shops.“I don’t think it makes much sense - somebody wants to eat something healthy they’ll make it themselves at home.“If it’s a rainy day then we are at our busiest as people want comfort food.”The proposal has emerged just weeks after American chain Fatburger opened a branch on Dundee’s Reform Street.The business is famed for its quadruple Fatburger challenge, comprising a meaty tower of four burgers sandwiched in a brioche bun with mustard, relish, onion, pickles, tomato, lettuce and mayonnaise. Heather Peace, Head of public health nutrition at Food Standards Scotland said: “We are delighted that Dundee City Council are planning to take part in our Out of Home consultation.“We would also encourage other organisations and consumers to have their say so we can gather as many views as possible before the consultation ends on  February to inform our Out of Home Strategy.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brian monteith think the unthinkable nicola s on the way out","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The SNP is losing its nerve. Why can we tell this is happening  Simple, #because we are at last #seeing the symptoms of decay in its once strict internal discipline.SNP politicians briefing against each other, hostile opposition to official policy, histrionics about BBC bias as a deflection from what’s going wrong with the party’s strategy and policies – and now even the open talk of notNicola Sturgeon should go, but when and where to.I am not making this up. There is no conspiracy. You only need to have been reading, watching or listening to the news to see the SNP is imploding.Firstly, let’s get the Salmond dficulty out the road. Whatever happens with the pending Alex Salmond prosecution it has caused deep isions around competing loyalties within the SNP. Supporters of the ­Salmond or Sturgeon tribes have been briefing against each other. Were Alex Salmond to be cleared of everything, such behaviour will not be forgotten and of course he could be expected to seek re-election. What then for Sturgeon, what then for the SNP  More bitterness, manoeuvring and ision. Let’s not kid ourselves, the SNP will never be the same again, either because of something Alex Salmond might have done, orinnocent, because of the way Nicola Sturgeon has handled the accusations and process – or a mixture of both.Then we have policies like the Car Park Tax. It will be unjust, having no sense in regard to who pays it, who is given a free pass and whether or not they can afford it. The earnings of the driver or the size of car will not ­matter. And, get this, there will be VAT on top of the tax – because the tax will be a bill presented by the employer providing a serviceand so it attracts  per cent VAT on top. £ would become £, or £ would become £.I also have it on good authority that the tax was offered by the SNP to the Greens as a bribe to get their support for the budget – not the other way round. So it is an SNP Car Park Tax that the party cannot escape blame for.No wonder some SNP politicians are openly letting it be known they do not agree with it – it will cost them votes and cost the party seats in Holyrood.That never used to happen, but discipline has gone out of the window under Nicola Sturgeon’s autocratic husband and we rule. Where  in the Western world does so much power rest in a married couple ­holding the posts of party chief executive and Government leader  Not Romania, not the Philippines. Then there have been the protests about an audience member who gave the SNP Culture Secretary a roasting on BBC’s Question Time. The ­programme makers and the BBC have been accused of bias. This is a ­classic deflection of seeking to take away from and avoid discussing the home truths the member of the public made about SNP hypocrisy. Secondly, the man’s politics, religion, allegiances and number of appearances are all irrelevant – are SNP politicians and fellow travellers saying he should not be allowed to speak, that he should have duct tape over his mouth  Is that what an independent Scotland would be like  We also have growing speculation on Nicola Sturgeon being replaced as leader or retiring before she is served notice. Now that’s a new development, partly fuelled by yet another trip to the United States when the real day job of fixing our schools and hospitals is here at home. Is she being lined up for a job at the UN  Who knows, but the fact that I can even ask the question without sounding foolish tells you the SNP is no longer a happy ship.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish independence top law officer refuses to reveal if nicola sturgeon asked for indyref2 advice","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Scotland#s top law officer has refused to revealNicola Sturgeon has sought his legal advice on holding a second referendum on Scottish independence.Lord Advocate James Wolffe says it would “not be appropriate” even to say whether such advice has been sought in response to Liberal Democrat Mike Rumbles.The MSP has now written to Scotland’s Standards Commissioner calling for an overhaul of parliamentary rulesto force the minister to answer such questions.The refusal has prompted anger because the SNP had been calling for Theresa May to release her legal advice on Brexit.Read more: Nicola Sturgeon: I won’t call a second Scottish independence vote this yearFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has pledged to set out her plans for a second vote on Scotland’s future in the UK in the coming weeks.

It is a lyrical and delightful portrait of a child’s perspective of the natural world.Last year ATLAS installed it in the south wing of Dunvegan Castle and ran an educational workshop programme with Portree Primary School and Portree High School.This year they are hosting cross-generational screenings with primary aged girls, similar age to the young girl in the film and the elderly generation. The aim is to encourage conversation and share experiences and knowledge about their own encounters with nature.Suzy Lee, ATLASArts film programmer, commented: “We are really excited about working with both Portree Primary and Budhmor House to offer this screening that encourages sharing and discussion.We’ve had a great response to the film and to our extended programme, so we look forward to showing the film in a new environment.”Centre with the primary seven girls from Portree Primary.Angus Beaton, a care worker at the centre praised the event for bridging the generational gap. He said: “It was wonderful to see the younger generation interact with their regular group and to enjoy watching a film together that connected with both age groups.”Sara Matheson, Portree Primary Head Teacher said: #Our pupils have been very fortunate to benefit from the work of ATLAS Arts. Most recently our primary seven girls have taken part in film screenings of Eglantine, both at Dunvegan Castle where they were able to hear directly from Margaret Salmon, and more recently at Home Farm and Tigh Na Drochaid, where they have been able to enjoy the film in a cross-generational context.She added: #As with all projects we have been involved in with ATLAS Arts, our pupils have been impacted very positively by these experiences. We look forward to working with ATLAS Arts on some new and equally exciting future projects.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/homeinthehighlands17-2-360x100.jpg","title":"skye couple get green light for historic hotel conversion planners had tried to","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA Skye couple are aiming to breathe new le into an historic former hotel after councillors this week overturned an earlier planning refusal issued by local authority officials.Eilidh and Iain Mcniven#s proposal to convert a dilapidated wing of Pier House in Broadford into two flats and bed and breakfast accommodation had fallen foul of authorities, largely because of the design of the windows and doors they planned to install.However, members of the council#s planning review body ruled that, although the building#s appearance would be modied by the plans, all changes would be offset by the benefits of bringing the former hotel back into use.After Tuesday#s meeting Mrs Mcniven said she and her husband were now looking forward to seeing their dream become reality.She said: “We#re delighted that the outcome was in our favour after several weeks of anxious waiting.“We can now rest happy that the Pier House will be looking its best with windows that are appropriate for our new development. We would like to thank everybody for the great support locally.”The house was originally built in  for Eilidh#s great grandfather Samuel Campbell, and for many years it operated as a temperance hotel.Fire ravaged the building in the s and, although part of the domestic side was occupied up until around  years ago, it has since lain dormant.Councillors on the review body said the couple deserved sympathy and support in their vision to restore a building which had been in Mrs Mcniven#s family for four generations.The couple#s supporting statement before planners said: “It is important to remember that this is a property that has been in the same family for  years and is about to become a new home for a young local family. The historic value of the property is not lost on them. However without intervention it may very well be lost entirely.”Dingwall councillor Margaret Paterson said she thought it “sad” that obstacles had been placed in the way of a couple who proposed to put so much into a building that was “almost falling down”.Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and Raymond Bremner, who represents Wick and East Caithness, also spoke in support of the couple#s plans.Councillor Bremner said he believed the aluminium window frames, as proposed for the development, had changed considerably from previous types which did not stand up well to spray from seawater.He added: “I have a lot of sympathy with the applicants and with the points made in their appeal. I don#t have an issue with the change of use.”Broadford and Strath Community Council had lobbied in support of the couple, while neighbours and local businesses also backed the proposed conversion.Community council chairman Hamish Fraser said: “They are proposing to restore a building that will become an asset to the community. It#s a common-sense decision to support a young couple who want to live and make a business here.”Planning officials had turned down the original application on the grounds that it had breached three policies of the Highland-wide local development plan.In their reason for refusal planners said modern windows and a door with patterns “is not in keeping with the character of a historic building”.In his letter of support of the couple, local historian and broadcaster Professor Norman Macdonald said: “In many years of regularly attending Highland Council planning committee meetings at all levels I do not recall a single application where a big and ambitious idea has come to the brink of jeopardy over such relatively immaterial and tangential matters.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/BROADFORD-PIER-HOUSE-H-FRASER-3.jpg","title":"the waterboys set to kick off skye live festival","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLegendary Scottish-Irish folk-rock band The Waterboys are to kick-off the Skye Live festival’s fth-anniversary celebrations this autumn.The opening concert in Portree on Thursday th September will see the bandto Skye for the first time in nearly  years.

I was born in , my family have been resident in Ballymena for generations, Allen, obviously, on my fathers side and Gribben on my mothers. My parents moved into the Demesne Estate shortly after it was built, first living in Carnduff Drive and then after a few years moving to Glenshesk Drive where they lived the rest of their lives.  I attended Ballymena Boys Secondary School. Music lessons were pretty much a non event. Every exam time each student would be hauled up to the front of class to sing a song and was awarded a C grade. My standout memory of music lessons was hearing the music teacher playing an album of Holsts Planet Suite to himself, this at least started a le long love of classical music.  In my early teens Glam rock was the big thing but apart from Bowie, T Rex, Rod Stewart etc I seldom listened to the charts.  I was more into album bands like Cream, Taste, Hendrix, early Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd and especially Led Zeppelin. Of course I followed the usual links from these back through Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf to the Delta greats, Robert Johnson, Son House and Charley Patton.  First real early Blues album I heard was by Leadbelly and then Robert Johnson : The King of the Delta Blues , album which has been a major influence on my playing ever since.  I started playing bass guitar when I was about twelve then switched to six string. FLAMINGOMy first paying gig was at The Flamingo playing bass with local rockers Angel when I was fourteen.  After discovering the joys of Blues and Booze, I could be found many a night after closing time, sitting around a fire in the woods at the back of my old school, playing guitar and singing the Blues with friends.  Many Friday nights were passed in The Bridge, Dunloy listening to South Bound Train and most Saturdays were spent in The Pound or The Harp Bar in Belfast, catching as much live music as I could.  This was during the dark days of the Troubles, with bomb warnings and check points an everyday normality but somehow music lovers seemed to live in a world apart, music clubs being one of the few places religion didnt encroach on.  I have played in ious bands throughout the years, including Angel, AGS, Harpers Hill Blues Band, The Flood and BIDDY EARLY as well as playing as a solo Delta Blues player, playing slide guitar harmonica.  Lately I have seriously got into electric Blues Harp, being influenced by Sonny Boy Williamson ii, Little Walter, Paul Butterfield, John Myall, Walter Horton etc. I currently play Blues Harp with The Matchstick Men, Irelands premier Status Quo tribute act, and I also regularly sit in with Legal Tender and Blues Taxis. I can be found most first Saturdays of the month at the excellent BT Blues and Rock Club sitting in on Harp with the featured bands. For the last six years I have been host of BIDDY EARLYS Open Mic at the BT Club, one of the Provinces most successful Open Mics which I also founded. I have finally decided to call an end to it at the start of this year to concentrate on my own music.  I play ious instruments guitar,  string guitar, slide guitar, bass guitar, banjo, mandolin, auto harp, Appalachian mountain dulcimer and of course Blues Harp.  Yeah, after all these years, Ive still got the Blues, once your hooked, thats it for le! - see BB King, John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy etc.  As for other local promoters of the Blues, theres the afore mentioned BT Blues Club which Looi Burns has been doing an excellent job of running for many years and of course local bands like Legal Tender and Blues Taxis.

Redmondshows Halax representatives Alan McLachlan and Gillian Boyd around the charitys new social enterprise shop, Wings n Things.“Mrs McFadden would have done a lot of work for charity within our town and in the local community so we really have brought that sense of community back in here,” Ms Redmond explained.Over the past six months charity staff and volunteers have been busy turning the run down pub building into a vibrant community hub which now houses a food parcel distribution project, a catering and education programme for vulnerable adults and those with learning dficulties and a senior citizens’ lunch club. Via Wings at Wellington House also provides space for after schools and parent and toddler groups, a monthly supper club and games nights, as well as volunteer and employment opportunities for many isolated and vulnerable members of the local community.Yesterday the charity held a special event to mark the opening of its new shop Wings ‘n’ Things, which will sell shabby chic and new craft items made by local crafters.Among the guests at the celebration were representatives from the Halax Foundation, which has provided funding for Via Wings to help it expand its Dare  Care project, which distributes food parcels to people in need.Thanking the Halax Foundation for providing £, towards the salary of a project manager, Ms Redmond said: “Their funding has enabled us to run the project much more efficiently because it has grown from a cupboard-sized project into a three-centred project.“We now provide food parcels to around  families every month, which averages out at about  people.Discovery of mans body sparks murder probePolice called to deal with agitated male carrying alleged offensive weapon Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DROM | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DROM | Article Teaser\"“As the number of people using our foodstore increases month-on-month the manager’s role is essential and the funding from the Halax Foundation ensures that we can continue to expand and develop the foodstore.”Gillian Boyd, trustee of the Halax Foundation NI, commented: “The Halax Foundation for Northern Ireland is delighted to support the important work of Via Wings. This particular award will enable the organisation to help those who are most vulnerable in their local community. We wish them every success in the future.”So far half of the old pub building has been renovated and Via Wings at Wellington House now boasts new offices, counselling rooms and a conference room. But that’s not the end of the redevelopment work.The charity is in the process of constructing a new coffee shop with a sensory garden and play area, which should be open within the next few months. And it also has long-term plans to redevelop another section of the building and create a wellbeing centre.“The wellbeing centre is going to be phase four,” Ms Redmond continued. “It would be our passion to have it up and running by the end of the year, but that will depend on fundraising and securing the necessary funding.“We hope the centre will help people – men and women – learn to live with their mental health. We want to provide things like reflexology, aromatherapy, breathing techniques, helping people learn about self care.”Praising the charity’s staff and volunteers for their dedication and hard work, she added: “Without them we couldn’t run this project. We have a team here that have a passion to serve this community, to walk in unity with them and see change happen.”• About the charity and its work...Founded in  by Gail Redmond, Via Wings was set up to help people in need in Dromore and surrounding areas.The faith-based charity’s aim “is to show God’s love in a loving, caring, practical, non-judgemental way.”It runs a range of projects designed to tackle problems such as poverty, loneliness, isolation, deprivation and more.

After giving the matter some thought, Squinter has been unable to separate two candidates, and so the prize is jointly awarded. First co-winner is Andrea Leadsom, Tory Leader of the House, for her reaction to Donald Tusk’s statement that there’s “a special place in hell” for those who promoted Brexit “without a sketch of a plan”.Andrea’s response was rather more temperate than that of Sammy Wilson, who opined that Mr Tusk was a “devilish, trident wielding, euro maniac”. She remarked, with what would appear at first blush to be commendable restraint: “The man has no manners.”But on hearing Andrea’s mention of the word “manners”, a little bell went off somewhere deep in Squinter’s hippocampus and after a short period of beard-scratching and pencils-sucking, it came to Squinter why the Honourable Member is on rather thin ice when it comes to matters of polite conduct.Come back in time with Squinter to the summer of , just two weeks before Britain voted to leave the EU. Andrea was locked in a battle with Theresa May for leadership of the Conservative Party. In an interview with The Times, when asked why the party should opt for her, she replied that her rival “possibly has nieces, nephews, lots of people. But I have children who are going to have children who will directly be part of what happens next.”So there we have it. Andrea pitched for the top job by saying having children gives her more of a stake in the country. At which point, we should remind ourselves that Theresa May has spoken honestly and movingly about the fact that she and her husband Philip were unable to have children.Manners  Yih pays yer money…Joint winner is British Transport Secretary Chris Grayling who announced on Friday that he was cancelling the £ million contract he had awarded to Seaborne Freight just before Christmas to provide a ferry service from Ramsgate to Ostend to ease the pressure on the port of Dover should the UK crash out with no deal.Mr Grayling’s tenure has been one of the great comedy shows of British politics and it’s widely believed that he remains in office only to direct fire away from more senior colleagues. Not that he could have seen this mess developing. After all, Seaborne Freight was a highly respected company with a long history of professional and responsible conduct in the business of ferries and freight, right  Well, since the company only hit the news in December you probably don’t need Squinter to remind you that Seaborne Freight:• Was a completely new company• Didn’t own a ship• Cut and pasted its website terms and conditions from a pizza delivery firmand an online boutiqueThe high-flying cabinet minister sent out to back Grayling when the contract was scrubbed was Communities Secretary James Brokenshire. You know, the bloke was Secretary of State here for a while and nobody noticed.Chris’ll be gone by the end of the week, then.Fail to prepare#LET’S be honest, Jim Wells isn’t flavour of the month within the DUP. The South Down MLA had the party whip withdrawn last spring after he fell out with the top brass over his claim that they had reneged on a promise to reinstate him as Health Minister after he stepped down in  over an election hustings row.Jimbo claimed then party leader party leader Peter Robinson promised to reinstate him when andthe furious furoreblew over . He further alleged that when Arlene Foster took over as leader she ignored two written requests from him to honour Peter’s pledge. These days Jimbo’s something of a voice in the wilderness, technically still a DUP MLA but shorn of any authority to speak for the party. Which makes him of considerable interest to journalists, since the resentment he clearly still feels makes him a little bit more willing to open up about things than other DUP reps.Jim’s been at it again this week and, given the state we’re in at the moment, you’ll probably not be surprised to hear that it’s Brexit-related. Jim revealed that at the extraordinary meeting at which the party decided to back Leave in the months leading up to the EU referendum in , there was zero discussion of what a Leave vote would mean for the local economy. This would be an awkward revelation for most parties, but after the tsunami of controversies that the DUP has been through in the past couple of years, it seems to have reached the point that its brand is so polluted the tin can’t get any more dented, the label any dirtier. But that’s not the disaster that it would certainly be for any other party because the DUP’s substantial vote clearly consists of people who don’t care what they get up to as long as they’re not Sinn Féin.Lack of planning – it’ll do for ye every time. Fail to prepare, prepare to fail, that’s the old saying and nowhere does it ring more true than in the crazy world of Brexit. Let’s take a look at a few of the most notorious failures of a lack of foresight and seewe can work out where the DUP Brexit calamity fits in…Betamax’Member when video cassettes were the most exciting innovation in the history of technology  You don’t  Well, you must be under , so let’s seewe can explain. Two Japanese giants of the global electronics industry were caught up in the race to win control of the massive new market. JVC produced the eventually successful VHS format, while Sony produced the toploading Betamax system. Although the Betamax system was of a superior picture quality, it was considerably more expensive and had a shorter recording time. At a meeting in , Sony were advised by Matsushita engineers to switch to the VHS format, but declined. It wa a historic mistake, dealing the company a crippling financial blow from which it would take years to recover.Ford EdselFord were inordinately pleased with the Edsel, a new model released in the United States in , the year after the Ford family relinquished control of the company. The Edselwas designed to give Ford the upper-hand in the highly competitive premium intermediate market . The company missed the design boat, though, as the car harked back to an earlier age at a time when families were increasingly turning to compact vehicles. The Edsel was discontinued two years later, with sales signicantly less than half the break-even sales figure. Executives took their eye off the ball and didn’t realise the Edsel was flopping until over .bnhad been spent on design, manufacture and new dealerships. To this day, new models that fail are still referred to in the US automobile market as ‘Edsels’.New CokeIn the mid-s, as other soft drinks were increasingly threatening the dominance of Coca-Cola, the company decided it was going to ditch the original Coke formula and go with an improved ‘New Coke’.The  launch was a disaster and sales were badly hit, particularly in the southern states where Coca-Cola was considered an integral part of American culture. Tens of thousands of complaints flooded into company HQ weekly. The problem was not so much with the taste – the company had disastrously underestimated the hold that the Coca-Cola brand had on the American psyche. Smelling blood, rivals Pepsi began a new ad campaign with the strapline ‘Now I Know Why Coke Did It’ . Fans started booing ads for New Coke at large sports events. Just  days after New Coke was launched, the company announced that it was bringing back the old formula.Has to be a Brexit message in there somewhere, no "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-13.55.54.png","title":"eye on the past february","story":"RUC men sided with loyalist strikers last MayA SECRET memo prepared by British army intelligence has revealed that senior RUC men were closely involved with the Ulster Workers’ Council strike last May.The memo, prepared for Whitehall ministers some time ago, shows also that unormed members of the RUC “connived at and assisted with the maintenance of UWC and UDA roadblocks”.Referring to Special Branch actions during the strike the report says: “Co-opted personnel were isolated from information on events by being sent on routine tasks or being given rest days.”The ‘co-opted personnel’ referred to are Special Branch men recruited by British military intelligence to keep an eye on what is happening within the Special Branch.“As a result a ally clear picture of RUC reliability area by area has not emerged,” says the report.And it goes on to say that RUC activity of a routine nature appears to have failed by as much as  per cent.It goes on to predict that in a situation where there were large scale attacks on the Catholic population  per cent of the Special Branch would throw their weight behind loyalist gangs. A copy of the report, which was prepared as a briefing document for ministers in the Wilson Government, found its way into the hands of a number of journalists in London recently.Besides casting considerable doubt on the loyalty of the RUC to the British Government it claims that  to  per cent of the UDR could be regarded as hostile during a doomsday situation.BRITISH military policemen are being trained for civilian duties at a military training camp in Kent and it is believed that a large number of them will be drafted into Belfast and Derry within the next few weeks.The British Redcaps are expected to be used in areas like Falls and Andersonstown to take over from infantry patrols which will be withdrawn from the street.A number of UDR men from the thBattalion have attended a two-week course at the same camp and one report suggests that they may be used to form the nucleus of a ‘community police force’ in Belfast for a trial period. There have been two previous attempts to phase in military policemen to civilian duties. In the Bogside area of Derry they were withdrawn after a few days because of resistence by local people.Price sisters’ lives threatenedTHE Prisoners’ Aid Committee in London has said it is concerned about the safety of Irish political prisoners in British jails because “there is evidence of systematic victimisation by prison authorities and attempts to create hostility among other prisoners.”According to the PAC the Price sisters’ lives have been threatened by prisoners in Durham Jail. Since Christmas seven Irish prisoners have been ‘arbitarily’ moved to prisons far away from their families and another Irish prisoner’s cell has been set on fire. Officially the Home Office would not comment on the allegations but other sources firmly rejected them as being completely unfounded. There was nothing unusual in prisoners being moved to other jails under the nomal “dispersal systems”, they said.Since being transferred to the women’s wing of Durham from Brixton Prison, London, Dolours and Marion Price have been put on dferent floors in dference parts of the wing, the PAC statement said. The reason given by a deputy governor, Miss Ford, for the separation was “security”.The PAC said that the cells to which the sisters were moved were filfthy.The PAC said that in a letter to their father, the sisters said that their lives had been threatened by other prisoners all of whom were in need of medical treatment, some being “drug addicts or sex perverts”. They are being “continually harassed” by short-term prisoners, who wanted information to try to sell stories about the girls to newspapers, the statement said.“They have asked to be separated from Judith Ward, whose behaviour is bizarre, but Marion has been put into the neighbouring cell to this prisoner. Despite the fact that the Home Office describes Durham as a top security prison, Dolours and Marion and Judith Ward, are the only Category A prisoners there.“The other  prisoners in the women’s wing are Category C and they subject the girls to continuous anti-Irish abuses and obscenities.

It said it represented an increase of p per week for the average household and an average increase of £. per week for businesses.Deputy mayor Cheryl Johnston said: \"Mid and East Antrim Borough Councils approach is always to strike a fair balance between keeping rates as low as possible, with securing existing and attracting new jobs, boosting inward investment and promoting tourism and other key priorities across the borough.\"This is in addition to money council has also already secured for the next  years, at no additional unplanned cost to the ratepayer. \"This includes work on St Patricks Barracks development, The Gobbins phase two, Carrickfergus town centre regeneration, and rollout of broadband services in Carrickfergus and Ballymena.\"Derek McCallan, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Local Government Association, said the overall picture from the council rates was one of \"growth and prudence\".\"Growth, in that councils are investing in high quality services from leisure provision to sustainable job creation, plus all of their regulatory and statutory services like environmental health and planning,\" he added.But he warned the Stormont regional rate could be twice as much as the council average. Mr McCallan said the relatively modest increase was in spite of tens of millions being added to employment costs over the next year. He said this was due to national pay agreements on the National Living Wage and new costs associated with increased powers transferred to councils from government departments.\"It is good that councils are combining growth and efficiency, keeping high-quality services, ambition and affordable costs in equal measure,\" he said.He added that the \"wider decision-taking vacuum\" caused by the Stormont impasse made it dficult for councils to plan properly for the future.\"Councils and taxpayers dont yet know what the Stormont regional rate will be, although it is estimated to be over % - double the average council rate and over twice the rate of inflation,\" he added. \"Frankly, unless the councils are given more resources to deal with an increasing set of expectations, they will be forced to make even more service cuts rather than expect local ratepayers to pay for services which should be supported by the rest of government.\"Belfast City Council, the largest, increased rates by .%.This means domestic ratepayers are paying an average extra p per month, with offices and retail paying an extra £. per month. Ulster Unionist councillor Peter Johnston, who chairs the strategic policy and resources committee at City Hall, said the increase had been kept to a minimum and would be accompanied by the £m City Deal for the region.Alliance had favoured a .% rise, claiming that £, for bonfire ersionary schemes - funding which has been criticised for a lack of transparency - was hiking rates higher than necessary.The biggest increase of .%, set by Derry and Strabane District Council, will see bills rise by around £. per month for householders. The council said the increase represents investment in new services, initiatives and strategic projects linked to a prospective City Deal.Earlier this month the councils lead finance officer Alfie Dallas said there had also been a \"signicant challenge\" with statutory pressures, such as nationally agreed pay awards, pay alignment and pension increases. The \"most challenging and disappointing\" aspect, he said, had been central Government grant cuts.\"The council has lost out on £, of rates support grant since cuts commenced in  , income which could have delivered a further minimum £m of capital investment or investment in other strategic priorities identied in our strategic inclusive growth plan,\" he said."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37816684.ece/0ffc1/AUTOCROP/w620h342/equal_marriage.jpg","title":"valentines day call for equal marriage to be introduced in northern ireland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The amendment to the Civil Partnership Bill is being tabled by Conservative peer Lord Hayward.Last year, Secretary of State Karen Bradley told the Commons that the Government would allow a free votethe matter was raised in Westminster, but Baroness Williams opposed the measure when it was first proposed earlier this month.Conor Loughran, LGBT+ officer of the National Union of Students-Union of Students in Irelandsaid the group were appealing to the Minister not to stand in the way \"of the true love of thousands of couples in Northern who just wanted to be treated as equals under the law\".“The Government has to decide whether to stand by Karen Bradley’s public commitment from last year, or to oppose equality for LGBT+ people here. We hope they choose love,” he said.If the amendment passes same-sex marriage would be extended to Northern Ireland, but it would include a clause allowing the Assembly to overturn the decision within six months.Same sex couples are allowed to wed in England, Wales, Scotland and the Republic of Ireland, but it is against the law in Northern Ireland.In November  a majority of MLAs in the Assembly supported the introduction of same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland, but the measure was blocked by the DUP using a controversial petition of concern.Colum EastwoodAn April  Sky News poll showed % support for marriage equality amongst the Northern Ireland public, with just % opposed. Over  of the  MLAs in the Assembly have voiced support for marriage equality legislation.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood backed the call and said it was \"shameful\" that Northern Ireland retained such archaic marriage laws.“I was proud to bring the first motion to the Assembly that received majority support for marriage equality before it was disgracefully vetoed by the DUP,\" the Foyle MLA said.People taking part in the Belfast Pride parade set off from Custom House Square in central Belfast.

the importance of investments on both sides of the border could not be underestimated and the continuation or replacement of cooperation funds must be a key priority post-Brexit.\" width\"\" \"\"

developing a cross-border investment fund to replace any possible loss of the EU’s Interreg and peace funds.“It is hereby recommended that consideration is given to developing an island-wide territorial cohesion policy, which would include a cross-border infrastructure and investment plan   fund, to replace any loss of common Interreg and peace funds,” he said.“However, there is little evidence of such a debate or consideration yet on either side of the border, which is very concerning.”Councillor PJ O’Hanlon of the East Border Region said: “Cross border cooperation has never been easy and must not be taken lightly.“Over the last  years the members of East Border Region have believed that cross border co-operation makes sense.“In the face of Brexit it still makes sense.”Committee member Brendan Smith said cohesion funding was needed to help the region.The Fianna Fail TD for Cavan-Monaghan said: “We should be making a very strong demand for our region, north and south, to get specic cohesion funding because of the challenges we will face as a result of Brexit.”Representatives and committee members voiced their disappointment at the Irish government’s decision to reschedule the A motorway in Northern Ireland due to the cost overrun in the Nation Children’s Hospital.Sinn Fein MP Francie Molloy said: “Unfortunately this week we’ve seen the lack of commitment from the Taoiseach on that one and worse again using it as a political football.”Mr Campbell said the border area had not received its fair share of infrastructure investment compared to other areas, despite there being a high dependency on travel by road in the region.There are more than  million vehicle crossings between the Ireland and Northern Ireland each year, about five million of which are freight crossings.“Both Governments must formally recommit to the long-planned A-N Dublin to Derry dualling project, highlighting its priority nature, and re-pledging what was originally agreed,” he said.“Elsewhere, upgrades are needed to the N-A from Sligo to Ballygawley, the East-West link to Dundalk, and the N from Sligo to Carrick-on-Shannon, with an extension of the M to Cavan Town.He also said the A from Coleraine to Monaghan was a key road corridor for North-South freight movement in agri-food, minerals, engineering and quarry products.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A defaced road sign on the border between Donegal and Derry Senator Gerard Craughwell expressed his fear that Brexit, whether it ended up being a crash-out or a negotiated one, would “change the relationships that exist in the border region forever”.He said the mismatch of funding bothered him.He said the Irish government would continue to push for funding for financial support for projects along the border but he said there was a possibility that the UK would not provide equal funding.“You finish up with a poorer relation the other side of the border.“You could for example end up with a decent motorway in Donegal that stops at the border,” he said.“I remember years ago travelling through Northern Ireland you knew you were in Northern Ireland because you hit the best roads in the country, now you know you’re in Northern Ireland because you hit the worst roads in the country.”"},{"url":null,"title":"minister should have factored in jade goody effect before offering free

Mrs Mitchell explained that following her sonrsquos death, his owed back pay from the Army would have settled the debt.The soldierrsquos mother also revealed that he had told her about two incidents in Afghanistan which had upset him.In one of them, he had been due to be the soldier at the front of the patrol but was swapped with a colleague at the last minute. The soldier who replaced him subsequently suffered severe leg injuries in an attack.Mrs Mitchell also told the inquest that towards the end of , her son had become hyper vigilant, confided in her less, was jumpy and struggled to sleep.She described how he had successfully applied for his ldquodream job in the Army as an outdoor instructor, explaining this had involved undertaking courses in the UK, Spain and Germany which left him very tired.The soldierrsquos mother also described how her son had felt isolated after a knee injury held him back from joining his unit in Afghanistan, and instead had to serve with a dferent unit.She said that when he ed to Ballykinlar and the new job, he continued to feel isolated as a number of soldiers were taking redundancy at that time.ldquoEverything hit him at that precise moment. He thought everyone was leaving, he was exhausted, his back pay hadnrsquot come through, he had had a row with Cherand he had just got back after being away for a long time.Mrs Mitchell added that she did not blame the army for her sonrsquos death but felt more could have been done to help him.A statement form Rleman Mitchellrsquos friend, Kendall Gibson, also referred to an incident when the  year-old ran away from fireworks.ldquoHe said the fireworks reminded him too much of Afghanistan, stated Mr Gibson, adding that he was also concerned about his friendrsquos drinking.Three soldiers mdash friends of Rleman Mitchell mdash who had discovered his body were sent twice to another barracks in Lisburn for treatment which included counselling.The inquest also heard that it was common place for soldiers to refer to the local army base as ldquoBally-kill-yourself.Driving instructor William Riley, who had been taking Lance Corporal Ross for HGV lessons in the week before his suspected suicide, told the inquest that the soldier was one of many who used the term.Mr Riley told how the Lance Corporal had cut a ldquofrustratedrsquo figure in the week before his death, displayed an attitude problem and had been involved in a verbal altercation with another instructor two days before his death.The inquest continues..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Art","story":"A HIGHLY acclaimed Downpatrick-based charity has secured a signicant financial boost from the Department of Justice.The Le Change, Changes Lives organisation mdash based in Market Street mdash has secured a slice of a near poundm funding cake made available under the government departmentrsquos assets recovery scheme.Over poundm has been distributed to organisations across the province since the schemersquos launch in , with the Downpatrick charity aiming to use its pound, three-year funding package to provide its clients with basic food hygiene training, alongside cooking participation and demonstration skills.The charity helps and supports people suffering with a range of mental health issues and addiction problems, offering professional and confidential counselling, mental health and addiction support and suicide intervention services.It also works to help minimise social isolation, alongside encouraging wellness and recovery and family support.Since its launch, Le Change Changes Lives has provided opportunities for people with a iety of problems to engage in constructive activities, including giving new le to old furniture through the very successful Pop Up Art initiative.The money secured under the assets recovery scheme, which is managed by the Policing and Community Safety Partnership, will finance the charityrsquos No Lost Cause project.Charity officials say the project is designed to provide an ldquointergenerational ersionary and therapeutic community programme which aims to encourage disadvantaged and disengaged people to find their potential and build upon it, using activities, counselling, advocacy, training and support.A logo is being used to publicise the project inspired by the lsquoNot Waving but Drowningrsquo poem by Stevie Smyth which is often told in Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. It gives an account of a drowned man whose distressed thrashing in the water was mistaken for waving.Charity officials say the No Lost Cause initiative is designed to complement the highly successful Pop Up Art project which is funded by the Big Lottery until this October.Over the le of the No Lost Cause project, charity officials will strive to reduce crime through erting people away from substance abuse and associated links to criminal activity.Le Change, Changes Lives officials have confirmed that the new project also aims to reduce reoffending by providing training and skills development activities and counselling to deal with substance and relationship family issues and provide support to improve the self-esteem of participants to help them re-engage with family and communities.They hope that through the basic food hygiene training, cooking participation and demonstration project that it will help parents revive cooking healthy, affordable family meals, to be eaten together at the kitchen table, helping achieve interaction and involvement in young peoplersquos livesAilish Teague, who helped establish the Downpatrick charity with her husband Manus, is delighted with the Department of Justice funding.She said competition to secure the money for the next three years was competitive, with groups in each of the provincersquos  councils eligible to apply.ldquoThe application was made through the Policing and Community Safety Partnership and the asset recovery is a brilliant resource, with money taken from criminals invested back into community projects, said Ailish.ldquoWe can use this money for the programmes we deliver, working closely with people who have a range of addictions.ldquoOur clients are also delighted that we have secured this funding which will enable is to deliver an NVQ Level One in hospitality services from our Market Street base with the food hygiene aspect of the course designed to give people a taste of employment.While delighted to have secured funding under the Department of Justice scheme, charity officials are conscious that their Lottery funding ends this October.Mrs Teague says officials have met with Lottery representatives and has suggested that the chances of having their funding extended are ldquozero to nil.She added: ldquoIt will be dficult to secure more Lottery funding which could leave us with no money to finance our core costs including rent and other overheads.

They were well prepared.ldquoThey had carried out research which helped them to face questions about migration and environmental issues. There was no doubt, they had been given the short straw as the other countries were ready to attack them for their current position in wanting to leave the EU.ldquoHowever, the students put aside their own views and represented the country they were delegated, in this debate.ldquoBeing the UK is what made it so challenging and also so rewarding as they did a fantastic job.Mrs Orsi said: ldquoNot being able to participate in future debates is only one of the educational detriments to leaving the EU.ldquoI think our students are going to be greatly affected on many levels, both in terms of academic opportunities, funding and employment.

Well, thatrsquos what happened when all of the farmers featured watched the programme a few weeks ago, said  year-old Geoff.ldquoIt will show that there is a real connection between the family and the animals and itrsquos not all just about sales or winning competitions.Two months before the crew started filming last January, the family were hit with terrible news mdash Bovine TB was discovered in their pedigree herd and  animals had to be slaughtered.A movement restriction then had to put on the herd which meant that no animals could enter or leave the farm until two consecutive TB tests prove negative.The programme catches up with the family on the day a vet calls to carry to do the next test and to determine whether any more of the herd will have to be slaughtered.ldquoIt just happened that the crew came to us in one of the most challenging times for the farm, said Geoff.ldquoAnd while I wonrsquot gave too much away, what happens not only affects me but also my children as they all get involved, especially the youngest Lucy, to help me get the animals ready for the likes of Balmoral Show.ldquoWe not only lost some of the animals but you also lose years of breeding, particularly with some of the animals my father had bred them, which was hard, and then of course, therersquos a knock-on loss of new calves.ldquoIt was particularly hard as I had buyers waiting to buy bulls and cattle of me but we couldnrsquot do anything until we got the all-clear.The tension builds over the next few episodes of the show as the deadline looms to Balmoral Show mdash the highlight of the farming calendar in Northern Ireland and the major sales day for Geoff.Viewers will see that the Rodgers familyrsquos hopes of further success at Balmoral are pinned on bull Mario, who Geoff described ldquoas a real character and his young half-sister, Nadia.This Farming Le starts tonight at pm on BBC ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"British Irish group on High Street conference  ","story":"THE impact of online sales on the High Street was discussed at a recent meeting in Newcastle.Representatives from the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly were in the resort where they were met by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin.Mr McGrath explained the committee has a dferent area of investigation each year and that in  is focusing on the impact of online sales on the High Street and how governments can deliver initiatives and projects to address the problem.The Assemblyman said with the nature of the traditional High Street changing, many people, especially the young, are shopping online with this trend only going to increase.ldquoWe are seeing and hearing that people want experiences and see their shopping trip as much more than simply shopping, wanting to incorporate food and activities as part of their experience, said Mr McGrath.ldquoHaving clean, welcoming public spaces, areas that can facilitate events and having a erse range of experiential shops and boutiques is critical in making the High Street thrive. In Newcastle, the public realm and promenade schemes, in tandem with the shop front improvement scheme, have helped the resort buck the trend and is reporting increasing footfall.Mr McGrath also highlighted the need to continue to develop experiences people can avail of to maximise footfall and is confident ambitious future proposals including a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes will be critical to enhancing what Newcastle has to offer.He continued: ldquoIn Downpatrick, the former Irish Street police station and car park have the potential to redevelop the town and breathe new live back into its retail centre.ldquoDeveloping a space here which can enhance and deliver a customer experience and product will be critical to developing new shops and products, but also complement existing businesses too.ldquoRates and the entire rating scheme was a major recurring theme from business organisations and this will form part of a report being compiled by the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly following their visit.Mr McGrath said the inadequacies of the rating system were well known, with the British-Irish body, of which he is a member, keen to find other ways of helping businesses thrive.The MLA added: ldquoTimes are changing and local authorities and central governments must reflect this in the work they do. I look forward to the report our committee will deliver which will reflect on time spent in Newcastle, Belfast, Dublin, Newcastle Upon Tyne and Stockton on Tees.Cllr Murnin said he was delighted that representatives of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly view Newcastle as an example of good practice for their research into revitalising the high street.He continued: ldquoWe have worked very hard to make our district a better place to carry out business and as a place to visit.

Itrsquos something I have always had to be aware of in my own le. I feel very strongly that there are issues in Northern Ireland that arenrsquot being addressed as far as mental health is concerned.A former pupil of St Malachyrsquos Primary School in Castlewellan, Niamhrsquos dficulties compounded after leaving Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch. A talented actor, who shone in the schoolrsquos theatre productions, she applied for and got a place at Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama in Cardf.Niamh was fortunate that while not academically minded, she found that drama, theatre studies and English always came ldquonaturally to her in school.The youngest of five siblings, Niamh says that she had always wanted to leave Castlewellan for ldquoan adventure. But she did not realise that her living in Cardf, away from family and friends, would take such a toll on her.ldquoI was just very, very homesick because our experiences in Northern Ireland were so unique and I didnrsquot have anyone that I could explain that to, she said.ldquoI felt emotionally unsupported. I felt very much like fish out of water as I was surrounded by a lot of very wealthy people and I struggled to connect with them. I was longing for the familiarity and the closeness, and the craic of home. My homesickness lasted for many years, it didnrsquot just go away.ldquoEvery time I went home for Easter or Christmas I was in floods of tears going back to the airport but yet I made myself do it, nothing nor nobody  was forcing me to do it.She went gone to appear alongside actors such as Sir Patrick Stewart of Star Trek fame in an acclaimed production Macbeth which played Londonrsquos West End and New Yorkrsquos Broadway, as well as former X-Files star Gillian Anderson and  Shades heart-throb Jamie Dornan in the psychological murder drama The Fall.Niamh is currently working on two film projects and says that as a newly married woman, her professional and personal le is going great.However, she maintains her mental health by practicing yoga and mediation and feels it is important to be upfront about having had issues.She explained: ldquoI donrsquot see a problem talking about mental health because I donrsquot like that itrsquos still taboo. If it helps one person seek help, then thatrsquos great.ldquoPeople could be sitting with mental problems and they donrsquot know it. Because thatrsquos what anxiety and depression do, they sneak on you and it really starts to alter your view of the world without you noticing.ldquoOver time with mediation you can be in control of your mind. It does not have to be in control of you. Itrsquos easier said that done as itrsquos a long and slow process but itrsquos absolutely possible.While she has excelled in support roles such as the policewoman in The Fall and a nurse in Holby City, Niamh has her eyes set on being centre stage and ldquoplaying a really bad person in the future.ldquoI really want to play the evil person in something.

Hutley was given another chance around  minutes and this time took full advantage after Enniskillen had been deemed to be offside on the back of a break from Down scrum half, Chris Gibson.For the remainder of the first half, and indeed for  minutes in the second half, the score remained at - with both teams trading blows, but neither were able to alter their account on the scoreboard.Down did have their chances to take the lead, but lacked the finesse in handling that they had shown against their rivals from Carrick and Omagh in previous rounds.As the game entered the final quarter, Enniskillen managed to extend their lead, scoring a try by barging over from short range following a well won line-out.With Enniskillen now in possession of a  point lead, Down were left with no alternative but to chase the game. Again, they created some opportunities and applied pressure in Enniskillen territory with some great carries from Josh Hanlon, Conor Moag and Joe Charles, but the dogged defence of the locals held out and with it, Down frustration grew which made putting quality attacking play together even harder.In the closing minutes and with the outcome of the fixture already beyond doubt, Enniskillen added a final unconverted try confirming them as the team who would progress to the quarter-finals.The final whistle brought bitter disappointment to the hard-working Down squad who knew they hadnrsquot been at their best on this occasion.The side now enter the Subsidiary Shield competition and they have drawn Royal School Dungannon at home in a quarter-final game to be played on Saturday, February, , at am.Having been finalists in this competition for four consecutive years and winners in , everyone at Down High knows there is plenty left to play for this season..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C February 13%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash A Ballynahinch horse breeder is a very disappointed man this week mdash and all because of the lsquoflu.

The link with this area is part of our history, that is why I am here to meet with the council chairman and to visit local schools.The deputy mayor is keen to see links re-established between schools in France and the Ballynahinch area.ldquoThe link can help inspire young people in France and in this area and forging the link again will provide us all with new motivation, she added.David Stewart, who was a member of the former Ballynahinch, Drumaness and Spa twinning group and is now a key member of the Rowallane and Slieve Croob group, is also particularly keen for the formal link to be re-established.As someone who has visited Lamorlaye on a number of occasions and witnessed the value of cultural exchanges involving young people in particular, he hopes formal links with the French suburb can be reformed.ldquoThe old twinning link seemed to lose some of its impetus, but the Rowallane and Slieve Croob group is a much broader association, he continued.ldquoWe are delighted to have some people from Galicia with us at the moment and it would be fantasticthe Lamorlaye folk could join our group as well to be part of the Celtic region partnership.David added: ldquoYasmine has told us about some of the reformed committees in Lamorlaye, some of which are looking at environmental issues which I believe would be of interest to people in our area.Karen Patterson, acting chairwoman of the Rowallane and Slieve Croob twinning group which includes Ballynahinch, Drumaness and Spa area, is also keen to see Lamorlaye join the Celtic region partnership.ldquoYasmine approached David and we are meeting with council officials to discuss reconstituting the twinning link. She is keen to meet with local schools and while the initial focus is on those in the Ballynahinch area, we would be keen to roll this out to others, Karen explained.ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council provides us with financial support as does Sport NI and we are grateful for all the support we have received. As part of our cultural heritage, looking at our past and history and aspart of our overarching Celtic nations initiative, we want to bring everyone together.Karen added: ldquoMoving forward, the focus is on culture, sports, language, arts and crafts, music and dance. Rather than focusing on twinning towns, the emphasis is on twinning regions. We also hope to develop a three-way relationship with Rowallane and Slieve Croob, Vimianzo in Galicia and Lamorlaye.Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess, has praised the work and commitment of the cross-community twinning group.He added: ldquoThe group is all inclusive and open to everyone in the Rowallane and Slieve Croob area. Launched a year ago, I have no doubt that more success lies ahead, with the group building on the good work it has already achieved, fostering good relations, not just in this part of the world, but across Europe.ldquoThe possibilities the Celtic regions partnership are limitless in my opinion, helping make this district a vibrant location, not only to live and work in, but also to visit..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"MRI scanner to remain at Downe for nine weeks  ","story":"A MOBILE MRI scanner at the Downe Hospital will only be in place until early April, health chiefs have confirmed.The South Eastern Trust has revealed that the scanner arrived at the Downpatrick hospital at the start of this month and is to remain in place for around nine weeks.Health officials said the arrival of the scanner is part of a ldquocontingency measure to maintain a service provision during the replacement of an MRI system at the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald.They have explained the scanner mdash which takes detailed images of the inside of the body mdash will help ensure that delays in patient appointments can be avoided.Over recent months, politicians and health campaigners have highlighted the need for a purpose-built MRI suite at the Downpatrick hospital, with health officials agreeing that such a facility would be a real asset to the hospital.They say it would ensure that additional MR imaging capacity was available locally to facilitate increased demand in this area of imaging.A South Eastern Trust spokeswoman confirmed that the organisation was currently in the process of making a case to the Department of Health to provide a permanent MRI scanner in the Downe.She added: ldquoObviously, any decision would be dependent on a successful business case as well as capital funding being made available to the Trust.Politicians and health campaigners have been calling for the capital funding and revenue required to provide an MRI scanner and cover its running costs.They say local access to such a scanner would further enhance the range of diagnostic services provided at the Downe, ensuring local people would not have to travel outside the district to use such a facility.With waiting lists for diagnostic services continuing to increase at other hospitals, which impact on local patients, politicians and health campaigners are keen to see such a fully fledged MRI service available locally.They hope the work on the business case can be completed and that the Department of Health will pave the way for the new scanner to be provided.The provision of a new scanner would be a major boost for the hospital where work is presently underway to prepare for the opening of a specialist centre of excellence for cataract surgery.The Downpatrick hospital will be at the forefront of a new model of care under new Department of Health plans for the delivery of a range of dedicated day surgery services across the province.The new cataract service is designed to signicantly reduce surgery waiting lists, with the new consultant-led, elective care centre providing routine day surgery procedures at an enhanced outpatient department.Health chiefs insist the creation of the new elective care centres represents a ldquosignicant step forward in the transformation of health care and clearly demonstrates the benefits to patients.

His parents and medical team are constantly working to ensure his lungs remain as clear of mucus as they can be.Jen said: ldquoItrsquos hard to believe when you look at him that anything is wrong as he looks so perfect, but inside him the mucus is causing havoc.ldquoDermot and I never expected to becomes nurses as well as parents to our child.

There is no time to wait.ldquoTwo hundred and twenty six people have died in the UK since Orkambi was licensed over three years ago. We need Orkambi and we need it now.The couple have been lobbying local politicians to get their help at keeping their campaign in spotlight in Government.Strangford MP Jim Shannon raised the plight of Lorcaacuten at Westminster this week.South Down MLAs Jim Wells and Sinead Bradley, along with Lagan Valley MLA Trevor Lunn, are planning to host a meeting in Stormont within weeks with Richard

When he was in his s, Pat McKeever took over the farm after the death of his father Peter, who had run an apple canning business on the site. Pat said: “My daddy was one of three brothers who used to can apples. They’d get the apples from the local orchards, peel them and can them. Daddy then started growing his own apples and supplying the fresh market and the cider markets.”Now Pat’s son, and Peter’s grandson – also called Peter – is the third generation farmer who is set to carry on the business. Pat’s we Catherine and their four daughters also have integral roles to play as the craft cider making end of the agri-business continues to grow.Pat, Catherine and Peter McKeever of Long Meadow FarmLong Meadow started off with two craft cider drinks in  before introducing a mulled cider and a cider aged in oak barrels, some of which had been used in the original apple canning business. Over the past two years the company has branched out into flavoured ciders, apple juice and apple cider vinegar – famed for its health benefits.Catherine said: “I know everything goes through a bit of a fad, but I think the craft ciders are still holding their own. The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit. We make it in smaller quantities so it can hold all the flavours, that’s the way we want to keep it. We only use hand-picked fruit, not any that has fallen on the ground.”Of the harvesting process, Pat said: “We would have between  to  pickers. They would come the third week in July and do a bit of summer pruning.Police probe poisoning of two birds Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“Once that’s finished, in August they start into the picking of the apples, that goes right through to the end of October, first week in November.“The picking season we call it the nine weeks of hell. It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children. A family ticket for two adults and two children costs £.Visitors will be given the opportunity to see the pressing and blending facilities on the farm as well as taste some of the products.Artisan food will be on sale as well as some free refreshment including tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Set to benefit from the four-day event is local charity ‘Katie-Rose’s Journey’.For more information on this week’s illumination event and other aspects of the farm go to www.longmeadowcidertry catch  TrendingThe Northern Ireland bucket list -  things every person from N.I. should do before they dieTwo cases of meningitis confirmed at NI primary schoolMeningitis outbreak in N.I. - What we know so farN.I. child hasnt been seen since Sunday - P.S.N.I. investigatingDerry Girls series two trailer released          ..

This comes as no real surprise to LPNI members as the SDLP has never had any credible cross-community socialist credentials.Letter to the editorLPNI is currently under review by the NEC of the Labour Party with regard to the running of Labour Party candidates here.The result of that review has been held up to await the outcome of the SDLP   Fianna Fail negotiations.To date an obstacle to our campaign to run Labour candidates here has been the ‘sister party’ status of the SDLP, as a result of its membership of the Party of European Socialists .The leader of the Irish Labour Party, Brendan Howlin TD has made it clearthat a formal link with Fianna Fail would call into question the SDLP’s continued participation in PES and thus the SDLP’s sister party status.Following the formal partnership vote, we look forward to the situation with the PES being claried in the near future. Clarication will enable Labour’s NEC to complete its review and allow Labour Party candidates to stand here.It will have no further excuse for any delay.We also note that many SDLP members and supporters are very unhappy at this direction of travel by the SDLP.LPNI will offer a welcome home to those whose political priority is to build a strong, cross-community, Labour voice here.Boyd Black, Labour Party NIJPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"politics","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Politics   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Politics Legacy Scandal RHI News Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Politics      Labour Party NI: lsquoThe SDLP never had credible cross-community socialist credentialsrsquoThe Labour Party in Northern Irelandhas noted the decision of the SDLP to enter a formal partnership with Fianna Fail.

I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

While the proportion of lsquoredrsquo schools is still around the same as last year in the primary sector, in the secondary sector, this has decreased by . percentage points.And . per cent of special schools across Wales have been categorised as lsquogreenrsquo, and needing less support, with no schools categorised as red and in need of most support.If you are require any additional information on the National Categorisation system you can get it from visiting bit.ly SfLhou article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When he was in his s, Pat McKeever took over the farm after the death of his father Peter, who had run an apple canning business on the site. Pat said: “My daddy was one of three brothers who used to can apples. They’d get the apples from the local orchards, peel them and can them. Daddy then started growing his own apples and supplying the fresh market and the cider markets.”Now Pat’s son, and Peter’s grandson – also called Peter – is the third generation farmer who is set to carry on the business. Pat’s we Catherine and their four daughters also have integral roles to play as the craft cider making end of the agri-business continues to grow.Pat, Catherine and Peter McKeever of Long Meadow FarmLong Meadow started off with two craft cider drinks in  before introducing a mulled cider and a cider aged in oak barrels, some of which had been used in the original apple canning business. Over the past two years the company has branched out into flavoured ciders, apple juice and apple cider vinegar – famed for its health benefits.Catherine said: “I know everything goes through a bit of a fad, but I think the craft ciders are still holding their own. The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit. We make it in smaller quantities so it can hold all the flavours, that’s the way we want to keep it. We only use hand-picked fruit, not any that has fallen on the ground.”Of the harvesting process, Pat said: “We would have between  to  pickers. They would come the third week in July and do a bit of summer pruning.Resurfacing works on A Portadown Road, ArmaghBrexit and data protection - will firms still have to comply with the new EU GDPR  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“Once that’s finished, in August they start into the picking of the apples, that goes right through to the end of October, first week in November.“The picking season we call it the nine weeks of hell. It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children. A family ticket for two adults and two children costs £.Visitors will be given the opportunity to see the pressing and blending facilities on the farm as well as taste some of the products.Artisan food will be on sale as well as some free refreshment including tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Set to benefit from the four-day event is local charity ‘Katie-Rose’s Journey’.For more information on this week’s illumination event and other aspects of the farm go to www.longmeadowcidertry catch  TrendingThree vehicle crash near PortadownPartner and child were lsquomaking too much noisersquoDiscovery of mans body sparks murder probeJail sentence for man who spat and screamed at hospital staffConcern as disabled woman who carrys oxygen tank slapped with parking ticket          ..

Sinn Fein spokesperson Sorcha McGeown at the top of William St LurganThe decision, made during a confidential special meeting this week, was split with the SDLP and Sinn Fein voting for council to maintain in-house management of the centre.However the DUP and Ulster Unionists voted for a CoCo arrangement which had been bitterly opposed by staff and unions.This week three unions, GMB, Unite and NIPSA jointly issued a statement condemning the decision and calling on any move towards privatising leisure services to be abandoned.The new leisure centre, which is currently being built, is to replace the current leisure facilities in Lurgan, Portadown and Craigavon.Ms McGeown said: “Unions made representations to all councillors, on behalf of leisure staff, urging us to keep the new leisure centre in-house.“Sinn Féin proposed this option however it was blocked by both the DUP and UUP who voted to out source Craigavon leisure.“This was a vote of no confidence in our staff. Our highly motivated and capable staff have the passion and vision to transform to ensure a high quality service at this rate payer funded setting.“The path the DUP and UUP have taken us down is a dangerous one that will have consequences far more wide reaching than leisure.“There is still time to revisit this decision and I would call on both the DUP and UUP to think again.”Trade union Unite has forged links with other unions such as GMB and NIPSA to fight any privatisation of leisure services in the ABC Council area saying their experience of ’outsourcing’ has been ‘higher prices and reduced staffing’.They have vowed to make retaining in-house management of leisure services a focal point of the forthcoming elections.Fight against privatisation after ‘confidential’ meeting on future of new £m leisure centre Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"They have also started an online petition to keep the management of all the leisure facilities in-house fearing that a ‘CoCo’ option could lead to the privatisation of a £m leisure centre paid for by the rate payer.In a statement Unite said: “Workers at leisure centres operated by the ABC Council learnt with dismay of the decision by the council’s Leisure sub-committee to vote in favour of establishing a CoCo model allowing the outsourcing of the local authority’s leisure services.”Speaking on behalf of his union’s members in the council, Gareth Scott, Regional Officer for Unite, challenged the benefit that outsourcing would offer and pledged the unions would back their members’ campaign to keep leisure services in-house.“Unite the union workplace reps have sought to engage positively with ABC council management in the process of replacing three existing leisure centres – in Craigavon, Lurgan and Portadown – with a single one in Craigavon. Workers have raised a range of revenue-raising proposals including new activities and courses for the new facility.

Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pmcg.jpg","title":"ryder cup legend to address belfast leadership conference","story":"Posted on Friday February  by Ulster Business Ryder Cup legend Paul McGinley has been revealed as one of the key speakers at a leadership event taking place in Belfast next month.

The building is being marketed by Osborne King and RHM Commercial. “Given the lack of available grade A office accommodation in Belfast we are excited to bring a building of this size and quality to the market,” Richard McCaig of Osborne King said. “In our experience deliverability of projects is key in order to attract tenants and Lighthouse offers the chance for an occupier to secure the largest amount of existing office space available in the city.” Nick Rose of RHM said it is “extremely rare for an entire building of this quality to become available”. “The superb location combined with a signicant car parking provision will undoubtedly prove attractive to the market. Given that Lighthouse is a few minutes walk from Belfast City Hall and adjoins the -bed Radisson Blu Hotel we expect signicant interest from corporate occupiers.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"kainos taking on bankmore square for belfast office scheme","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by John Mulgrew Tech firm Kainos will take on a massive proposed office scheme in Belfast for its new headquarters, it has emerged.
