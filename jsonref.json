But this will only be achieved if drivers are supported to charge their vehicles typically at off-peak times.‘Support for drivers using their electric vehicles in novel ways will also be needed, for example by “vehicle-to-grid” technology to share energy from car batteries back to the electricity grid when it is needed.’ Ofgem envisages the number of electric vehicles will surge from 230,000 today to ten million by 2030 and 39million by 2050. It argues this will only be possible if the current total of 30,000 public car chargers rises to 210,000, plus 3,500 rapid and ultra-rapid chargers near motorways.         It is suggested that building and running the infrastructure to support the roll-out of electric vehicles could be £2billion a year, equivalent to £30 on every household bill (stock image)At the same time, traditional natural gas central heating and hot water systems will have to be ripped out of millions of homes.These will be replaced with electric heating and, potentially, a new gas system run on hydrogen, where the only emissions are water.The regulator said: ‘The future of heating is less certain, with a range of possible different pathways to decarbonise.‘In 2017, just 4.5 per cent of the energy used for heating the UK’s 29million homes and other non-residential buildings was from a low-carbon source.‘This number needs to rise significantly by 2050.’ Ministers should consider charging farmers per ton of carbon produced by their land, a report released by wildlife charities has said.

He was invited there by a curator whose stipulation was that he make work on the theme of sex and mortality.“Mexico’s anarchic, visceral energy got under my skin and sucked me in,” he recalls. “There is an acceptance that life has no glorious victory, no happy ending. Humour, ritual, a strong sense of community and an embrace of the inevitable make it possible to live with tragic and often unacceptable situations.”Hugo’s approach shifted accordingly to reflect the flamboyance and gritty ordinariness of life there, his images filled with vibrant colours and often mysterious symbolism. This portrait is a case in point. Entitled The Wedding Gift, it shows a young bride in Juchitán de Zaragoza cradling an iguana, a creature considered a symbol of patience, understanding and kindness in Mexico. Conversely, the elaborately competitive mating rituals performed by the male of the species – head-bobbing, nudging, biting and even changing colour – have been mimicked in local song and dance, including a famous traditional ballet, La Iguana de Guerrero.Whatever the symbolism, the young woman seems perfectly at ease holding a lizard in her lap, her direct-to-camera gaze giving little away. Hugo is also noncommittal, refusing to reveal her age or comment on what he calls “the iguana tableau”. From the start, Hugo’s work has been characterised by degrees of ambiguity: his most famous series, The Hyena and Other Men, shot with an itinerant troupe of street performers and their captive beasts in Nigeria. His approach, which merges documentary, street photography and staged portraiture, has led to accusations that he exoticises, even exploits, his subjects, though his photographs are often created through sustained creative collaboration with his sitters.In his Mexican portraits and landscapes,about to go on show at a London gallery, the mood moves between the heightened everyday and the grotesque: weatherbeaten peasants in work clothes, a woman dressed like Frida Kahlo, corpulent nudes, blood-covered faces and a man wearing a crown of thorns. Nothing is ever entirely what it seems, the complex nature of Mexican culture reflected through an outsider’s eyes as a mixture of ritual, role-playing and various degrees of exaggerated reality. “I am drawn,” says Hugo, “to the fabulousness of the banal and the banality of the exotic.” In Mexico, he found his perfect location.Pieter Hugo: La Cucaracha is at Huxley-Parlour Gallery, London, W1 from 19 Feb to 14 Mar"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12223d39ae13f9d988116cba30cffc0f165a5747/0_147_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f0ab160aa76c0c4b5db62489b39167b","title":"british baroque review tate britain london","story":"Tate Britain, LondonIt was a pungent age, with accusations flying about the monarchy and adultery in high places. What a shame this comically inadequate show is more sniff of disdain than blockbusterRestoration Britain may have been outrageous and dirty (in every sense) but it was not boring. Even the lecherous diarist Samuel Pepys was perturbed by the sexual scandals of Charles II’s court. Theatres reopened in 1660 after being banned for decades, and women acted in them for the first time. This hedonist age would soon be put to the test by bubonic plague and the Great Fire of London.Tate Britain’s survey of this pungent age is more a sniff of disdain than a blockbuster. It sucks out every last drop of drama, character and energy, let alone narrative clarity. It misdefines its subject and seems to have no sympathy for the people of the era or their art. What exactly is British baroque? A wall text explains the baroque in a nutshell: “It was an age when art was used to support and advertise the authority of the monarchy.” This is a comically inadequate view of a rich and complex aesthetic.It certainly doesn’t describe the art. In the second room we meet paintings of Charles II’s mistresses and illegitimate kids. Here is Peter Lely’s portrait of the king’s lover Louise de Kérouaille, dressed as a stylish shepherdess flaunting her cleavage in the countryside. Wait a minute. How does this open celebration of adultery in high places help to promote the stern rhetoric of power we’re told typifies British baroque? Nor does Jacob Huysmans’ distinctly Caravaggesque portrait of the king’s illegitimate son James, Duke of Monmouth, posing bare-legged and bare-breasted as John the Baptist, do any propaganda favours for a monarchy fighting off accusations of both sleaze and covert Catholicism.This art shows distinct signs of life and sensuality that defy the show’s determination to deaden it. For the baroque is not just an art of propaganda. It is a style that rejoices in movement, passion and abundance – the energy of which is perfectly summed up in the over-the-top wood carvings of Grinling Gibbons with their masses of fruit and cheeky cherubs. This style could celebrate power, but it could also express desire and feeling.One reason the show goes adrift is by getting its dates inexplicably wrong. It “covers” (as a wall text alluringly has it) the period from Charles II’s restoration in 1660 to Queen Anne’s death in 1714. But the baroque in Britain started with the masques of Inigo Jones and Ben Jonson in the early 1600s. It went electric in the reign of Charles I when a host of baroque artists came to Britain, including Artemisia Gentileschi, Anthony van Dyck and the defining genius of the style, Peter Paul Rubens. Seriously – how can you have an exhibition called British Baroque that doesn’t include Rubens?But the baroque wasn’t just about painting. The worst mistake this show makes is to pile up room on room of portraits and still lifes when the fascination of this art movement was its creation of dynamic spaces. Painting, sculpture and architecture all come together in baroque spaces to create immersive emotions. In other words, it resembles 21st-century installation art. This show fails to capture that.The architecture of Wren and Hawksmoor is reduced to a few framed designs and one model, then the explosion of extravagant palatial houses in late Stuart Britain is made to seem dreary. The crowds who visit Blenheim Palace, Chatsworth, Castle Howard and other gobsmacking masterpieces of British baroque know these are extraordinary cultural achievements. They are evoked here only wanly and conventionally. The biggest effort to convey an actual interior is a big wall photo of the Painted Hall in Greenwich – but it’s too cold and doesn’t capture the optical fun of James Thornhill’s paintings.Then it all collapses into a weary sigh. The reign of Queen Anne gets a perfunctory, portrait-heavy survey even though it saw dramatic entanglements of aesthetics and emotion. Anne’s favourite Sarah Churchill got an incredible prize when Blenheim was built to honour her warrior husband, but fell out with its architect Vanbrugh.

Writing under a pseudonym, this serving emergency worker offers snapshots of people’s lives at the point of crisis in his engaging memoir, Can You Hear Me?“When I started writing it, I wasn’t really in it,” he says. “I was writing episodes about patients – not just their clinical experiences, but their lifestyles, their social settings, their family scenarios and all the struggles that people have, because I feel that we get these insights into people’s situations which are quite intimate, really. It’s quite a privilege but it’s also eye-opening and I thought that a lot of those stories don’t get told.”With poignancy, humour and compassion, Jones invites us into “the invigorating chaos of pre-hospital care”. The encounters are fleeting – average patient contact is about an hour – and the stories stop at handover.The lottery of callouts offers a panorama of experiences: the mundane, the ridiculous, the heartbreaking and the tragic. From the desperate drug addict who urinates on the ambulance floor when denied a fix, to the woman who would rather call an ambulance than read the back of a packet of paracetamol from Reggie, a frail and disabled 46-year-old man, lying in the dark on his bathroom floor for two hours after a fall, to Sharon, difficult to the core, but ultimately calling an ambulance because she is incredibly lonely. Jones evokes the controlled sprint to a heart attack victim on a football pitch and the desperate sadness of the call that “no one wants to receive”: the infant who doesn’t wake up.“We go to everybody, anywhere, with anything happening to them,” Jones says. It was coming across people such as Peggy – an elderly woman living on a sofa in her front room – that made him decide to start writing five years ago. Surrounded by ice-cream tubs full of urine, Peggy has “reduced her world to what she can reach”, Jones writes. And isolated people like Peggy, often on the margins of society, have voices we seldom hear.“There is someone like one of these characters living on everybody’s street,” Jones says. “They come in and out of their house and nobody knows what is going on behind their door.”As he assembled pictures of lives glimpsed through emergency calls, Jones realised he could pull these stories together by telling something of his own. But there were limits to how much he could reveal. Bound by the requirements of patient confidentiality, he worried that identifying himself could make it possible to identify the patients he described, or that being recognised when he arrived at an emergency might interfere with his work. So he decided to remain anonymous.With patients uppermost in his mind, Jones won’t say much about his own life. He says he studied English at university, and has written “bits and bobs” over the years. He is even reluctant to say which city he works in. He’s not trying to be awkward, he says apologetically, it’s just that he fears that offering details about himself could see someone, somewhere, piecing it together.  In the book, he describes how he felt stifled in an office job and wanted to do something completely different, preferably outdoors. So he applied to train as a paramedic – despite having failed to stay upright during the birth of his son, and a “vague phobia of red sticky fluids”. He writes that he’s a family man, a “fairly normal person” doing a slightly unusual job. What else can he tell us? Not much.Writing under a pseudonym could allow an author “to reinvent yourself”, Jones concedes, but says he can’t see the point in doing that. He’s added some “noise” to each story, he explains, changing names and locations to protect his patients’ identities, but he has “tried to be honest and not to clean up things retrospectively”. The names and settings may have changed, but writing anonymously has “allowed me to go into more depth, be more specific and add a level of detail which I wouldn’t have been happy to do otherwise”.The paramedic spends each shift on the streets, up through blocks of flats, down into dark, rubble-strewn basements and everywhere in between. But even if the blue lights are flashing, an ambulance isn’t always shooting off to give “critical care in strange locations”. Paramedics often attend a call that turns out not to urgent or even medical in nature, Jones writes, and the medicine he dispenses most is common sense. Explaining how to use that packet of paracetamol is a constant part of his working life.Can You Hear Me? doesn’t shy away from the challenges and strains facing emergency workers – the public-facing nature of the ambulance service means paramedics are confronted every day with awkward bystanders, verbal abuse, threats and even violence. But Jones says that he has tried to provide a rounded picture of his career and the reality on the ground. His employers know about the book and are satisfied that the anonymity and confidentiality of patients has been preserved. But the people he works with day to day have no idea that he’s been secretly scribbling. He’d like to think that if they read it, they would feel that it gives a faithful portrait of a paramedic’s life. “I hope it’s reasonably true to the range of things that we go to.” It’s just a shame the readers won’t know who the author really is.- Can You Hear Me?

Following the UK’s departure from the EU on Friday, both sides are expected to set out their negotiating positions on Monday before trade talks next month.“We want our UK team of more than 7,000 people to have the best possible chance of future success, which is why we continue to urge UK and EU negotiators to work collaboratively towards an orderly balanced Brexit that will continue to encourage mutually beneficial trade.”Sunderland is the UK’s largest car factory and employs 6,000 workers. It makes three of Nissan’s five flagship models – the Qashqai, the Juke and the electric Leaf.Under the contingency plan, production of the Micra, which is made in France, would be moved to the UK and Nissan would reconsider producing the X-Trail in Sunderland.

It will take a maximum of eight planes a month, or about 50 deliveries a year, O’Leary said.The 737 Max, Boeing’s fastest-selling aircraft, was grounded in March after 346 people died in two crashes attributed to the plane’s anti-stall software.Ryanair’s third-quarter results came weeks after the group raised its profit forecast to between €950m and €1.05bn for its financial year to the end of March, compared with the €800m to €900m it forecast in November, citing a better-than-expected performance over Christmas and the new year.Analysts said the delay of 737 Max deliveries had reduced capacity in Europe, pushing up fares. “The performance was even stronger than we had forecast,” a Liberum analyst, Gerald Khoo, said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cabb63d8d6e794bf6d3711fe9b4af03a2137fec1/0_6_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b147258be72737687a8f11870a6743a0","title":"uk productivity slowdown worst since industrial revolution study","story":"Researchers found slowdown from the pre-2008 growth trends almost four times that of 1930s The slowdown in Britain’s productivity growth over the last decade is the worst since the start of the Industrial Revolution 250 years ago, a dismal track record that is holding back gains in living standards across the country.Research from academics at the University of Sussex and Loughborough University shows that the productivity growth slowdown since the 2008 financial crisis is nearly twice as bad as the previous worst decade for efficiency gains, 1971-1981, and is unprecedented in more than two centuries.Growth in productivity – a measure of economic output per hour of work – has failed to rise in Britain at anywhere near the rates recorded prior to the banking crisis, with severe consequences for living standards. Economists believe productivity growth is vital for lifting GDP and higher wages.Prof Nicholas Crafts and Prof Terence Mills, among Britain’s foremost economic historians, said productivity growth had been dragged down by a combination of three problems: the lasting effect of the 2008 crisis for the financial system weaker gains from computer technologies in recent years after a boom in the late 1990s and early 2000s and intense uncertainty over post-Brexit trading relationships sapping business investment.In a research paper to be published in the National Institute Economic Review this week, they warn there has been no previous point in UK history when these three phenomena occurred in such a short space of time.Crafts said: “It has been shockingly bad. Brexit then comes along towards the end of this 10-year period. Obviously we’ve not yet seen the ultimate effects on trade costs, but it’s undermined investment and erted a lot of managerial time to contingency planning, rather that what you would think of as more productive activity.”The 2010s are also almost four times as bad as the Edwardian “climacteric” and the depression of the 1930s. The climacteric – a term used by economic historians to describe a period of low productivity growth at the turn of the 20th century – occurred between the end of the age of steam and the widespread adoption of electricity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cb721e355f5e6f55890ea2f70498441a76a8e89/292_0_4848_2909/master/4848.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd8db8d77c16a934f8b677f9858c4ed9","title":"coronavirus chinese stock markets sterling brexit pound ftse manufacturing pmi business live","story":"Sterling hit by tough talk on trade deal while investors count coronavirus costThe EU has published its draft negotiating guidelines for the Brexit trade talks, setting out its stall ahead of discussions starting in earnest. The latest update from Michel Barnier suggests the EU will be “very demanding” in setting level playing field conditions for any trade deal.You can follow the Barnier’s question and answer session on the politics live blog here:A quick update on UK stocks: there’s not much happening on the blue-chip or mid-cap indices.Phillip Inman, one of the ’s economic writers, who wrote about the likely impact of the Coronavirus on the Chinese and global economies at the weekend, says some of the optimism among City analysts of a quick bounce back are beginning to evaporate.Diana Choyleva, a respected China expert who leads the consultancy Enodo Economics, says 2020 is going to be a bad year for China, however much credit it pumps into the economy to keep businesses and consumers borrowing. She says:The economic fallout from the Wuhan coronavirus, which is more contagious than SARS, is set to be severe. Importantly, investors hoping for a decisive growth rebound once the outbreak is contained are likely to be disappointed. Beijing will have no choice but to throw money at investment. Even so, the authorities are unlikely to be able to re-energise the economy as they did post-SARS in 2003.China’s structural growth rate has slowed significantly since then, so the short-term hit could well translate into a technical recession. Help is also unlikely to come from outside China, she says. “The sluggish response of officials in Wuhan and the determination of a secretive regime to keep a tight grip on information about the coronavirus is bound to dampen foreign business enthusiasm towards China.”You can read more detail here:Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, has laid out some new red lines for a trade deal which appear to contradict Boris Johnson’s positions.Kit Juckes, chief global forex strategist at Société Générale, said:Brexiteer politicians are moving from celebrating the exit to sounding bold as the trade talk verbal jousts begin. The foreign exchange market is likely to be nervous and with positioning data still suggesting an excessively long speculative position in the market, sterling is vulnerable.The British manufacturing sector performed slightly better than initial figures suggested – the sector’s output was steady rather than the decline seen in early data.The final reading of the UK manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) came in at 50.0 in December, compared to a flash figure of 49.8, according to IHS Markit. The 50 mark is the point where contraction turns to expansion.Rob Dobson, director at  IHS Markit, said:The start of 2020 saw the performance of the UK manufacturing sector stabilise, as receding levels of political uncertainty following the general election aided mild recoveries in new order intakes, employment and business confidence.Improvements were mostly seen via rising consumer demand and renewed input buying by businesses, suggesting that the reduction in uncertainty following the election has encouraged households and businesses to step up spending. In contrast, an ongoing downturn at investment goods producers suggests that the economic certainty required to achieve a full revival in capital spending may still be some way off, likely reflecting lingering uncertainty about the Brexit road-map in the coming year.Speaking of Brexit, Nissan is worth a mention this morning after the Financial Times (£) reported that the Japanese carmaker had drawn up plans to “double down” on the UK in the event of tariffs on car exports following the end of the transition deal.If Nissan were to pursue the plan it would represent positive news for the government, which has had a frosty relationship with the struggling British car industry since the Brexit vote. However, the plans were reportedly only one of several scenarios imagined by the carmaker, whose Sunderland plant is the biggest single car factory in the UK, and the usually reserved carmaker has made voluble warnings against tariffs. And the denial from Nissan is pretty emphatic, with worryingly clear implications for workers in Sunderland.We deny such a contingency plan exists. We’ve modeled every possible ramification of Brexit and the fact remains that our entire business both in the UK and in Europe is not sustainable in the event of WTO tariffs.We want our UK team of more than 7,000 people to have the best possible chance of future success, which is why we continue to urge UK and EU negotiators to work collaboratively towards an orderly balanced Brexit that will continue to encourage mutually beneficial trade.It is still well within the trading range set on Friday – but nevertheless it serves as a reminder that there is no end to Brexit uncertainty in sight in the near term.The government’s majority may have allowed it to “get Brexit done” at the end of last week, but there appears to be little respite for anyone hoping the UK’s exit from the EU will not define 2020 as well.Prime minister Boris Johnson will today lay out his stall in Brexit trade negotiations, refusing close alignment of rules and rejecting the jurisdiction of the European courts.The position will likely not be greeted by the EU, and it sets up a tricky start to a crucial period for determining whether Brexit is a success.Britain won’t align the EU demands it. The scene is set for a showdown and a rocky path for negotiations that introduces new headline risk for the pound – think back to last year and the way GBP pairs were moving around wildly on any report about deal or no deal. Ryanair reported profit after tax of €88m euros (£74m) for the three months to the end of December, the third quarter of its financial year.The Irish airline upgraded its profit expectations last month in a trading update thanks to higher-than-expected bookings over the festive period.The positive financial news came despite the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max, which the company had expected to form a key part of its growth plans. Ryanair has already warned staff that it could be forced to cut jobs because of the delayed arrival of the new planes, which have been banned from the skies since March following two fatal crashes.Asked in a prerecorded video published on Monday about deliveries of the new Max planes, Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary said:What is likely is they will push out that delivery profile with Boeing by at least 12 months. At best that means we will have to roll forward our plans to fly 200m passengers per year ... by at least 12 months, possibly 24.Richard Flood, investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, said:This is a strong set of results in a seasonally weak part of the year for Ryanair. The reduction in seat capacity across the sector as a result of the failure of a number of airlines should enable Ryanair to maintain strong pricing into the key summer months. The European airline industry faces a large challenge should the coronavirus spread to Europe, and Ryanair would not be immune to such a development.In Europe, where traders have had some time to react to the coronavirus outbreak, shares have gained at the open.Chinese stock markets plunged on Monday in a delayed investor reaction to the coronavirus outbreak that has seen increasing numbers of confirmed cases.Markets had reopened after the extended lunar new year break that started on 23 January, accounting for the strength of the move. The fall was expected following weakening share prices in other countries, with economists expecting the outbreak unsurprisingly to weigh on economic activity. The People’s Bank of China was seen by economists as helping to prevent a deeper rout, after it responded to the outbreak over the weekend with measures to keep markets moving that included a £130bn stimulus package.The central bank also on Monday made unusual comments on the stock market, saying that it expected markets to return to a rational state in the long run.Ian Williams, an economist at Peel Hunt, the stock broker, said: There was further dispiriting news for economists fixed on China, as manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) data came in weaker than expected, with a reading of 51.1 points against an expectation of 51.3. However, the survey was carried out mostly before the extent of the coronavirus outbreak was known.Meanwhile, Ryanair on Monday said that the effects of the ongoing Boeing 737 Max crisis will continue to impact it for as long as two years.The Irish budget carrier is one of the biggest customers of the grounded jet. In a video message on Monday chief executive Michael O’Leary suggested Boeing’s delivery schedule could ultimately be up to two years late, meaning it may hit its long-term 200m passenger target by March 2026 rather than March 2024.

So why has it come, over the course of its six seasons, to inspire such love and debate? One of the answers to this question lies in the way the script is shifting around what is allowed to be “profound”. Our lives, lived online and deeply connected at all times, have made us simultaneously more attuned to the significance of the everyday, while also distancing us from things that might appear hokey or overly sincere. We use the therapist’s office as a structure for setting up Twitter jokes about the ways we are lacking as people. We pepper our everyday speech with words like “dissociate” and “trauma”. All this self-awareness is painful, and funny. But I’ll be the first to admit that I didn’t expect this subtle culture shift to manifest in the form of a talking cartoon horse.Somehow, the writers pull it off. Part of BoJack’s charm is to do with the fact that is tightly scripted – full of dynamic, hilarious and profound dialogue. But at the far limits of experience, language is inadequate. So it’s testament to the visual narrative and the careful pathos of the show that one of the best episodes is scriptless. Fish out of Water, a season 3 episode devoid of dialogue, follows BoJack through an underwater world, perfectly capturing the frustrations of being unable to navigate everyday spaces or communicate adequately with those around you. These frustrations are an inherent part of depression and addiction. It’s dreamlike in the way that day-to-day life can be dreamlike with certain mental illnesses: unable to be part of the world, we float away to some other place on the periphery.Comically, the episode also accurately mimics the frustrations of a life where everything repeatedly goes wrong – BoJack’s attempts to make things right are thwarted at every turn. Connection is just out of reach. Without giving the ending away, the entire episode also serves as the build-up to one of the funniest, purest punchlines in the show’s history.And that’s the success of the show overall. It rarely allows itself to linger for so long on painful existentialism that it can’t manage to do the simple job of making audiences laugh whether that’s through the use of unexpected plot twists, animal puns, or the slapstick humour of watching a hammerhead shark trying to hammer a nail using his actual head.The form lends itself to this sort of comedy, and it’s this use of juxtaposition that means the serious moments take us by surprise, and cut deep. “I feel like I was born with a leak,” BoJack says. “And any goodness I started with just slowly spilled out of me, and now it’s all gone. And I’ll never get it back in me. It’s too late. Life is a series of closing doors, isn’t it?” He says he doesn’t know how people get up every day and live, and yet every episode there he is doing just that. Making jokes, having sex, behaving in ways that he is expected to behave and then being punished for it. That’s the beauty of the sitcom set-up. Life is like that, isn’t it? A series of episodes of varying success.There are still questions about how this show gained such an obsessively cultish following. Do we find solace in BoJack’s self-obsession because it excuses our own? Are we desperate to see the cartoonish aspire to be profound? Perhaps! Probably! Isn’t that what art is all about? When I make a pilgrimage to stand in a room full of paintings by Rothko and feel something, I do it with the self-importance that we tend to assign to “highbrow” pursuits. When I am watching the misadventures of a cartoon horse, and I am suddenly face to face with myself, that takes me by surprise, and I am moved deeply and without warning.I know BoJack. I know where he’s from, who brought him up, what he has done, the thoughts that plague him. It’s all monumentally shitty. And yet, there’s no other way his life might have gone, because he sees himself as a person (or rather, a horse-man) without qualities. He expects less than nothing from himself, and when good things happen, he waits for the other shoe to drop. He expects that he will fuck up, and he uses his past to justify his future. And through the ups and downs of knowing BoJack, I have also come to know these things about myself.• Eli Goldstone is the author of Strange Heart Beating"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/795792a3c58859b303bb34159f7f2782163be941/0_42_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cab5b67685e76c453f73f9ad08f53ab8","title":"change mind bernie sanders democratic politician","story":"Despite the dent to my pride, I’m coming round to the idea that the Democratic politician is not as unlikable as I thoughtIf we allow that we live in times of unusual upheaval, then there are almost no certainties but this: that most people don’t like changing their minds. After committing to a narrative about something or someone, most of us will do anything to avoid having to revisit it. It’s partly laziness when I think about how much mental furniture I would have to rearrange if, for example, it were decisively proven that ouija boards work (I’m kidding – of course they do!) I want to lie down. And then there is the dent it would make to my pride.How much control we have over the direction of our thoughts, and by implication over the engagement of our feelings, has always been fascinating, but it is particularly so in the runup to elections.I didn’t like Bernie Sanders much at the last US election and I can’t pretend it was on policy alone. He seemed to me, to borrow a phrase, unlikable – a charmless, barking presence during the primaries, who I could imagine alienating not only voters, but people with whom, if he won, he would be charged with working in government. I elided his style and supporters with the much weaker Jeremy Corbyn, and having written him off had no desire to reassess him.During the early Democratic debates last year, this position held firm. He was too old it was outrageous that his health scares were glossed over in a way Hillary Clinton’s hadn’t been he was so much less engaging than Elizabeth Warren. I regarded male friends who loved Bernie with a deep suspicion, given the degree to which most of them had hated Clinton while remaining passionate admirers of her husband. And anyway, I wasn’t a Bernie person. Somewhere in there, the opinion had compacted down into identity.I can’t isolate the exact moment when this started to give way, but I’m embarrassed to admit it was eased along by Larry David’s turn as Bernie on Saturday Night Live. It was also alleviated by female friends who love Bernie – not simply for his policies, but for the more numinous reasons that turn political admiration into something more personal.Mainly, however, I wondered what would happen if I just decided to change my mind. I did this recently – an instantaneous, 180-degree flip – in two trivial contexts. One at Christmas when, after feeling flamboyantly miserable that we weren’t travelling to see family, I decided this was a dumb, self-defeating position and changed and again, more aggressively, with the reversal of my opinion about someone in whom I had invested some time in deciding was great, but on further evidence forced myself to recognise was awful.

I hope they realise the extent to which the high-speed route, in its current configuration, will mainly benefit London and only make the north-south gap and all the isions that come with it worse. It’s likely they already know: the project exemplifies all that’s wrong with a transport policy that treats mobility solely as an economic engine and commuters as its fodder.Britain’s transport infrastructure is extended and maintained with one thing in mind: economic growth. Where there is more transport there is more growth, and where there is more growth there is more transport, which is why London and the south-east enjoy a ersity and frequency of transport forms that people living outside it can only dream of.HS2 is a prime example of missing the point of what transport investment ought to achieve. The spindly, slow-growing spine of HS2 is puny by comparison to the combined choice offered to Londoners by tube, tram, overground, buses, light rail and (eventually) Crossrail. Having an HS2 spur to Wigan is not suddenly going to make it easier to get around Greater Manchester, or indeed, send Londoners rushing to the north-west.The HS2 plan for Birmingham, where the first phase ends, centres entirely around making Birmingham a commuter city for London, and making its city centre attractive to blue-chip companies priced out of the capital’s real estate. For a city like Birmingham – young and super-erse, yet leave-voting – having its purpose redefined as an extension of the metropolis will only reinforce its ongoing identity crisis, while doing nothing to improve the experience of living there.That’s not to suggest Birmingham doesn’t collude in its own degradation. Already, the city council has churned up much of its city-centre green space to accommodate a new HS2 station half a mile from New Street. On visiting the redeveloped New Street station a couple of years ago, the town planner and writer Adrian Jones noted that “the scale of change at times looks like a frenzy of self-harm, the city having lost its memory but still holding to its psyche of naïve optimism about the value of newness, thereby condemned to a perpetual cycle of destruction”.When Zarah Sultana, the new MP for Coventry South, described living under “40 years of Thatcherism”, this is what she meant. My chief memory of the New Labour years is a constant awareness of the pressure to be productive: yes, there were more buses and trains, but they were there for you to squeeze more work and more consumption, and therefore more baseline economic growth, into the day, rather than more enjoyment. Better transport was about “increasing employability” and not reducing isolation. No one was encouraged to enjoy their lives at a pace with which they felt comfortable: the enforced acceleration of daily life began in the 1980s and has continued apace ever since.It’s a model that doesn’t work and never will. Researchers from Manchester Business School criticised Manchester’s “misguided approach of developer-led regeneration” for failing to address how “transport and housing is failing communities in the outer boroughs”. To put it bluntly, skyscrapers mean nothing when you can’t get out of Salford.Mobility is a fundamental need, and it is as much a part of the foundational economy as housing and healthcare. Instead of recognising this, 60 years of transport policy has defined any travel that isn’t commuting as a sort of optional bonus, a desire to be fulfilled chiefly through private car ownership.There have been brief and notable exceptions to this: for instance, when Barbara Castle, Harold Wilson’s transport minister, redefined railways as a social good and saved the network in the process. And there were the glorious years of the early 1980s when councils actively defied central government to run municipal buses as a foundational service, charging pennies to use them.This, of course, is how London’s transport is still run: highly regulated, with heavy subsidy, the cheap fares encouraging people to travel into the city to make and spend their money. The rest of the country is denied this and given the promise of HS2 instead, as though a high-speed link to Euston will help you get to the doctor’s.Yet with a relatively small degree of improvement to the transport network, both within and outside London, people’s lives can be utterly transformed. Hackney Community Transport, an inspirational bus company (yes, such a thing exists) dedicated to “competing against loneliness”, offers a hail-and-ride bus around the estates of Hoxton and Islington to friends, shops and surgeries for £1 a trip.In Liverpool and Leicester, Arriva is trialling “demand-responsive” buses that enable passengers to share fares and travel door-to-door to places not served by the usual routes. Equally, electrification of the Transpennine rail route, and comparatively low-key projects such as restoring a fast connection between Manchester and Sheffield, would restore what Castle called “the boon of mobility” to people and areas where high-speed rail is less of a priority than simply being able to get to work on time.HS2 isn’t by definition a bad idea: a non-stop London to Scotland line would help kill off domestic flying. But it’s a project with the wrong principles at heart. Mobility is about so much more than the economy: for one thing, it’s about social connection. Extending the right to fast, cheap, decent transport should be at the heart of what government does, because getting around is something you take for granted until the day you can’t.• Lynsey Hanley is a writer and the author of Estates: an Intimate History and Respectable: Crossing the Class Divide"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/230f5cfa63a820b2145a6cd84a113f54d7266eb7/0_115_6334_3801/master/6334.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a9b541b3569ebf5d303b75c7f5228c5","title":"uk firms demand shake up of inflexible apprenticeship system","story":"Government expected to miss target of 3m new apprenticeships pledged by Tories in 2015Business leaders are demanding a shake-up of the UK apprenticeship system, after official figures suggest the government will miss its target for new apprentices.As National Apprenticeship Week gets underway on Monday, business groups are calling for changes to the system to give small businesses desperately-needed funding so they can take on and train more apprentices. Small firms play a critical role, as they offer nine out of 10 apprenticeships for 16- to 24-year-olds, according to the Federation of Small Businesses.This means that the number of people starting an apprenticeship since May 2015 has reached just over 2 million. During the general election campaign in May 2015, the Conservative party manifesto pledged to create 3m new apprenticeships by 2020, but if current trends continue, the government will miss this target.A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We are investing significantly to level up skills and opportunity across the country and apprenticeships are playing a key role in this.“We recognise there is more work to do and we are continuing to look at how the apprenticeship programme can best support the changing needs of businesses so more people can get ahead and all employers can benefit.”The two business groups said in a new report on apprenticeships that the system is confusing for employers in particular, transferring unused levy funds is complicated and time consuming, as they cannot be block transferred but must be transferred on a month-by-month basis.In addition, the funds cannot be spent to cover the administrative costs of hiring apprentices, which can be significant for smaller firms and for the most part, transfers can only fund new starts.The report says the restrictions mean that big companies such as the construction firm Mace are struggling to transfer their unused funds. “If the levy-transfer process were to function optimally, this would result in over £400m transferred to non-levy paying SMEs in the construction industry.”London First and NWBLT are calling for greater flexibility for businesses in how they use funds, allowing them to support a broader range of training activities, and how funds are transferred to other firms.Jasmine Whitbread, chief executive of London First, said: “Many firms want to take on more apprentices but are hamstrung by a needlessly complex and inflexible system.”The Federation of Small Businesses warned that the apprenticeship system and in particular small firms are “facing a crisis”. Its national chair, Mike Cherry, said: “Urgent action is needed to ensure sufficient funding for small businesses in order to be able to continue offering apprenticeships.Kirstie Donnelly, interim chief executive of City \u0026amp Guilds, said the stigma around apprenticeships must be stamped out. “More must be done now to promote apprenticeships both within schools and, more generally, amongst the public.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5ec674e6a24c9db74ba7a94c8cc77034b6d7aed/0_123_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc2b31f091ae5ddb39c4bd6155cb1877","title":"wild grey seal caught clapping on camera for the first time","story":"The sound resembles ‘shotgun-like cracks’ and attracts potential matesA wild grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) has been caught “clapping” on camera for the first time, making sounds that resemble “shotgun-like cracks”.The large male was filmed striking its flippers together off the coast of the Farne Islands, near Northumberland, during the breeding season in 2017.While captive seals can be seen clapping in zoos and aquariums, scientists say this is the first time one of their wild counterparts has been caught on camera performing the action.While humans clap to applaud or express approval, in the case of wild grey seals , this gesture signifies quite the opposite.Scientists believe male seals clap to demonstrate their strength, as part of an attempt to ward off competitors and attract potential mates. The action produces a “loud high-frequency noise”, sending out “a clear signal” to other males in the area.In the video, the male seal can be seen swimming close to a female, with other males lurking nearby, before it starts clapping.Dr Ben Burville, a researcher at Newcastle University who took the footage, said: “The effect of the clap was instant and the rival males rapidly dispersed.“The clap was incredibly loud and at first I found it hard to believe what I had seen.”Burville, who had been trying for many years to capture clapping seals on camera, added: “I’ve heard the distinctive shotgun-like cracks many times over the years and I felt sure this clapping behaviour was the source, but filming the seals in action has eluded me for 17 years.”The video is part of an international study published in the journal Marine Mammal Science.Dr David Hocking, from Monash University in Australia, who led the study, said: “The discovery of ‘clapping seals’ might not seem that surprising, after all, they’re famous for clapping in zoos and aquaria.“But where zoo animals are often trained to clap for our entertainment – these grey seals are doing it in the wild of their own accord.”The researchers say understanding more about grey seals and other marine life could help protect the species against the harmful effects of pollution.Hocking added: “Clapping appears to be an important social behaviour for grey seals, so anything that disturbed it could impact breeding success and survival for this species”.• This article was amended on 3 February 2020.

The talks, to take place in Glasgow this November, are widely seen as the last realistic chance for countries to pledge the stiff cuts needed in greenhouse gases to stave off climate breakdown.But the strategy was plunged into confusion on Friday night as the intended leader of the talks, former energy minister Claire O’Neill, was abruptly sacked.Her sudden removal, by the prime minister’s adviser Dominic Cummings, has left a vacuum that the government said would be filled by a minister.While some observers were encouraged that a more heavyweight politician than O’Neill could take the stage, there were concerns that if responsibility for the negotiations is taken on by the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, that will mean the same officials and politicians who are trying to sign post-Brexit trade deals will also be trying to persuade recalcitrant governments to renew their commitments to cutting carbon.The potential conflicts of interest were clearly illustrated at the UK-Africa summit less than a fortnight ago, when Boris Johnson boasted of ending UK funding of coal-fired power plants in Africa – though there had been no such funding since 2002. But at the same conference, nearly £2bn of investment was poured into African oil and gas.The head of one major international NGO said civil society groups were “not convinced” that the UK could skirt the potential conflicts of interest. “It is very delicate and it’s going to be very interesting to see how they do this.”The media will be largely excluded from Tuesday’s launch, apparently at the behest of Downing Street. That is unusual, as the UN’s climate change secretariat is sensitive to being seen as open and transparent.Forging a global consensus on urgent action on the climate will not be easy. The Paris accord of 2015 marked the first time that rich and poor nations came together resolving to hold global heating to no more than 2C, and preferably 1.5C, which scientists say is the limit of safety.The Paris pledges to curb carbon emissions are inadequate, however, and at COP26, governments must scale up their ambition, or face climate breakdown within the decade. The most recent round of talks, in Madrid in December, were fractious and ended in only a partial agreement, showing little of the spirit of cooperation that will be needed to make COP26 a success.Other developing countries told the  that the sacking of O’Neill was “at best disruptive” but that if Johnson took swift control and appointed a political heavyweight who could inspire confidence in global capitals, the damage could be limited.There were concerns over O’Neill’s handling of the negotiations to date, as O’Neill appeared to downplay the importance of the Paris agreement and gave conflicting opinions of what should be achieved at COP26.O’Neill had already embarked in recent months on a busy programme of meeting environment ministers and negotiating teams from around the world. She attended the last UN talks in Madrid in December, and went to Dhaka to see Sheikh Hasina Wazed, Bangladesh’s prime minister, who will play a pivotal role in the talks as leader of the Climate Vulnerable Forum group of 50 countries. Those meetings will need to be replicated and relationships rebuilt after her departure.He added: “The sacking of O’Neill seems to be a setback which they can only rectify by quickly appointing a political heavyweight to replace her. Hopefully they will do so.”At Tuesday’s launch, Johnson will showcase the UK’s advances in renewable energy, its leadership role as one of the first countries to legislate for net-zero emissions by 2050, and the City of London’s power as a global finance centre to pour billions into greening the global economy. He will hope that these are enough to restore any doubts caused by the stormy start of the UK’s year as hosts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acdb784957dc46c504495e703dfbe30c30a98921/43_0_6086_3654/master/6086.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17536d5b55cc6e93b0a92c34ba92158b","title":"the monarchy al pacino cats key snubs of this years baftas","story":"The red carpet has been rolled and the awards doled out – so who has most cause to go home weeping?

Picking the editing in Ford v Ferrari over Schoonmaker’s virtuoso chopping on The Irishman seems especially wacky.Given the hoo-ha over her omission from the best director list, you’d be forgiven for thinking that Gerwig was something of a shoo-in for best adapted screenplay for Little Women. Maybe they’d give it to Steven Zaillian instead? That could be The Irishman’s consolation gong? Nope! Jojo Rabbit bounced off with the Bafta, following last night’s win at the Writers Guild of America awards, making it a virtual Oscars lock.When your star says she’s just attended the film’s funeral and the host chooses it as his one film to dump on, you can safely consider yourself this year’s dope in the stocks.When you’re the butt of a Rebel Wilson joke (“The Royal Andrew, no, Harry, no Albert, Hall”) after already having been rinsed by Brad Pitt – who said he was calling his award “Harry” because he “can’t wait to bring him back to the States” – you know you’re having a bad night. Particularly when the second in line to the throne is sitting in the front row. Hats were ditched not doffed.The British Academy of Film and Television Arts – or at least its membership – failed to cover themselves with glory with this set of awards. #BaftasSoWhite has been trending, Cynthia Erivo’s refusal to attend was widely reported, People Just Do Nothing’s Asim Chaudhry had a pop at Laurence Fox on stage, and Rebel Wilson drew scabrous attention to the gonads of the best director nominees. But the most ominous sign of the times must be that Bafta’s own president, Prince William, felt moved to give it a royal telling off in his normally anodyne closing remarks. “That simply cannot be right in this day and age,” said the heir to the throne. Bafta will have to get this sorted out sharpish.Netflix has already proved itself a master of the awards circuit (read: throw money at it until everyone else gives up), but even it must have been a bit surprised at its first success of the night at the Baftas. Middlingly reviewed Christmas cartoon Klaus saw off big boys Frozen II, Toy Story 4 and A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon – or, as the industry would term it: Disney, Disney and Aardman. That’s a major Hollywood studio and a national-treasure British powerhouse. Netflix isn’t messing about.Bafta has been roundly applauded – not the least by the casting director fraternity – for its inaugural award for best casting. So who did it go to? The dazzling colour-blind tapestry of Dickensian humanity that was The Personal History of David Copperfield? The immaculate late-60s pop-culture document Once Upon a Time in Hollywood? Or maybe Marriage Story, with its frankly brilliant raft of cameos underscoring two powerhouse leads? Er, no. The winner was Joker. Now, Joker is undoubtedly a superb evocation of a grimy early 80s New York (yes, we know about the King of Comedy references), and revolves around a major-league performance by Joaquin Phoenix. But no one else in the film gets much of a look-in, however good they are. Zazie Beetz, Frances Conroy, even Robert De Niro don’t exactly have opportunities to stretch themselves. We’re not saying just anyone could have done those roles, but apart from Phoenix it’s not exactly an acting showstopper."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/291ca14579ad73214ca579cc13936273e1bcd695/0_111_2732_1639/master/2732.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ceb57b4e1e38677d17dee230b3e2f421","title":"why parasite should win the best picture oscar","story":"Bong Joon-ho’s tragicomic thriller is the dark horse of this year’s Oscars race. An exquisite piece of storytelling, this is classical film-making at its bestBong Joon-ho’s Parasite is already a success story. Winner of the Palme d’Or, the top prize at the Cannes film festival, as well as best foreign language film at the Golden Globes – and the richly deserved best cast in a motion picture at the Screen Actors Guild awards – it is now up for six Oscars including best picture. As well as earning a staggering number of garlands, the film is also a bona fide box-office smash, grossing $73m in its native South Korea and $30m in the United States. Even if Parasite went home empty-handed, it’d still have plenty to be proud of.Parasite is Bong’s seventh film, a tragicomedy that centres on the Kims, a working-class family of four who, one by one, infiltrate and destabilise the home of the ultra-rich Parks from within its sleek glass walls. Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik) lands a job as an English tutor to a posh teenage girl named Park Da-hye (Jung Ziso). He then secures a gig for his enterprising sister Ki-jung (Park So-dam) as an “art therapist” to Da-hye’s pampered little brother Da-song (Jung Hyeon-jun). Their parents, Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) and Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin), also manage to become part of the Park family’s ecosystem, as Chung-sook replaces longstanding housekeeper Moon-gwang (Lee Jung-eun). It’s a giddy thrill to see the Kims swindle and squeeze the Parks for all they’re worth, until, halfway through the movie, Bong ups the stakes by introducing a new layer of drama.Bong has made films in English (2013’s Snowpiercer and 2017’s Okja), but Parasite takes place in South Korea. There is no English dialogue. That this is Bong’s crossover hit, and that it has managed to transcend the best foreign film category (now known as “best international feature”) is its own miracle. Indeed, in 91 years of the Oscars, it is only the 12th non-English language film to be nominated for best picture. None of the previous contenders have won. If the Academy award Parasite the best picture Oscar, it will be a historic result.This fact alone might have made Parasite the underdog of the pack, had it not been for the film’s confrontational class politics. “They’re rich, but still nice,” says Ki-taek to his wife. “They’re nice because they’re rich,” she scoffs. “If I were rich, I’d be nice too.” Except the Parks aren’t nice. Patriarch Park Dong-ik (Lee Sun-kyun) wrinkles his nose at Ki-taek’s smell he’s unable to disguise his contempt for the noticeable stench of poverty.Still, the film is connecting with audiences. This, I think, is because Bong’s sharp sense of social satire plays second fiddle to his storytelling abilities. The film’s five-act structure is watertight, the pacing of its drama exquisitely judged and the tonal swerve at its midpoint handled with utter confidence. What begins as an upstairs-downstairs comedy of manners is transformed into a thriller, and concludes as a devastating tragedy. The protagonists are deeply flawed, the antagonists sympathetic. This is classical film-making at its very best and most rewarding.Speaking to Vulture, Bong described the film’s pessimistic ending as “a surefire kill”, a downbeat doubling down. As a rule, the Academy’s tendency is towards the feelgood. Parasite is such an entertaining ride, voters might be swayed in the opposite direction. It might just be in with a chance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16a1fc1f49a314049e6d4c04e098164696e7b785/0_0_2400_3600/master/2400.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5d09cdded97deaf2393722482e7e5eeb 2020w","title":"rachel roddy recipe lentils potato greens sausage","story":"In Rome, lentils are often tossed with butter or olive oil, parsley and black pepper, mixed into a soffritto, or made into in a delicious, steamy braiseIt was red lentils that were found preserved near Jarmo in Iraq, dating back to the sixth or seventh century BC. Red was also the colour of the lentils that Xin Zhui (Lady Dai), the wife of Li Cang, the Marquis of Dai, took to her tomb in 163BC. They were excavated in 1972, along with 1,000 precious artefacts and Xin’s body, miraculously preserved by an unknown liquid and 20 layers of clothing bound with silk ribbons.Less well-preserved were the carbonised remains of lentils found in Greece dating back to 11BC. The Greeks taught the Romans to eat lentils, and then the Romans marched them all over – although maybe not as far as Britain. The first mention I can find of lentils among my books is in 1956 in The Constance Spry Cookery book, where she gives recipes for soup, puree and a perky-sounding lentil salad with pickled onions, French dressing and celery. All this is to say, lentils, the oldest pulse and one of the earliest domesticated crops, have been nourishing us for a very long time.They nourish the three of us every week, often more than once, which is as much to do with us liking them as the fact that they cost relatively little, feed many and don’t need soaking: just tip into the water like hailstones the impenetrable little lenses turn nutty and pleasantly muddy in 25 minutes.I cook the small, slate-grey and brown Italian lentils in three ways. The first is to boil them in well-salted water with celery, carrot, onion, a clove of garlic and a bay leaf until tender. Once drained, the gently flavoured lentils can be left whole, or pureed (in which case, a bit of cooking water might be needed), then tossed with butter or olive oil, parsley and black pepper. This is also the way I cook lentils before tossing them with orange zest, mint, salt and olive oil.The second way also begins by boiling them in salted water. At the same time, in another pan, fry some finely chopped onion, carrot, celery, garlic and parsley stems in olive oil. Once the lentils are tender, drain, then mix with the soffritto, some chopped parsley leaves, black pepper and a spoonful of olive oil for shine. The soffritto retains its brightness and the lentils their integrity, which makes them a good partner for roast meat and baked goat’s cheese.The third way, the Jackie Collins way, or “steamy braise”, is the way I adopt most of the time. It starts with a soffritto of vegetables cooked in olive oil, to which the lentils are added, then water, and left to simmer until the lentils are tender. How soupy the final dish depends on you: 300g lentils and 1.5 litres water produces a soup to be served just so, or you can add pasta – tiny tubes or squares of fresh pasta for what some refer to as pasta e lenticchie, others minestra di lenticchie. This is halfway to a stew and the basis of today’s recipe, bolstered with potato and greens: a soft, soupy stew that can be served as is or with sausages.I usually cook this for both meat and non-meat eaters I cook the sausages separately, browning them first, then adding a small glass of white wine to the pan so they finish off in a steamy braise. If everyone is eating sausages, they can be started off in another pan, then added to the lentils at the same time as the potato, and therefore braised alongside the other ingredients, which makes for a richer dish. With or without meat, this is a gentle winner that will be feeding us for a long time to come.1 small onion, peeled and diced1 stick celery, diced1 garlic clove, peeled and gently crushed but whole1 bay leaf1 tsp red chilli flakesSalt6 tbsp olive oil300g small brown lentils, rinsed1 large potato, peeled and cubed150g spinach or escarole4 large sausages (optional)In a large, deep frying pan or casserole over a medium heat, fry the onion, celery, garlic, bay, chilli and a pinch of salt in the olive oil until the vegetables are softish and translucent.Add the lentils, stir for a minute, add 1.2 litres water, bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.After 15 minutes, add the potato, and simmer until the lentils are tender but still holding their shape the idea is that much of the water has evaporated, but not all, so the lentils are still slightly soupy. Add more water if the pan looks dry.In the last few minutes of cooking, add the spinach or escarole and wilt down. Serve with some olive oil poured over the top.If you are serving with sausages, you have two options. The first is to cook them in a separate pan and then serve on top. The second is to start them off in another pan and then add them along with the potato so they finish cooking with the other ingredients."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71ef52de92d4eeec69d6e4e8aa8412de5a00b1cb/0_15_1809_1085/master/1809.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7405cfe350f1951177787f07d4c24bd5","title":"pep guardiola swipe premier league chief richard scudamore","story":"• Manchester City manager refers to 2018 quotes from Scudamore• Guardiola concedes title, saying Liverpool are ‘unstoppable’Pep Guardiola appeared to mock Richard Scudamore after Manchester City’s 2-0 defeat by Tottenham Hotspur, sarcastically questioning whether the Premier League is concerned that Liverpool are 22 points clear at the top of the league.Guardiola all but conceded the title to Liverpool after the champions suffered another setback at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and he let out his frustration by appearing to refer back to Scudamore, who was the league’s chief executive at the time, saying he would like “someone to get a little bit closer to City” during an interview in August 2018. City had won the title by 18 points the season before.“Two seasons ago there was the owner of the Premier League who said that could not happen again, it’s not good for the Premier League for City to win the title in that way, with 100 points,” City’s manager said. “Now it’s Liverpool, you have to be concerned if you are the owner of the Premier League.”City paid for their profligacy against Spurs. Hugo Lloris saved a penalty from Ilkay Gündogan in the first half and the game changed when Oleksandr Zinchenko was sent off for two yellow cards early in the second half. Spurs took control, goals from Steven Bergwijn and Son Heung-min lifting José Mourinho’s side four points behind fourth-placed Chelsea, and Guardiola nodded when he was asked if there is no chance of City catching Liverpool now.“They are unstoppable,” Guardiola said. “They have a lot of points, we dropped points in the games that we played quite similar to today. Even when we played Anfield. Now it’s to try to qualify for the Champions League next season.”Guardiola was unable to deliver an update on Sterling, who appeared to suffer a hamstring injury near the end, while Mourinho said he was worried about Dele Alli’s ankle injury. Alli struggled after being caught by Sterling, who was fortunate not to have a yellow card upgraded to a red after a VAR review.Mourinho also questioned why VAR took so long to award City’s penalty after Serge Aurier fouled Sergio Agüero but he was delighted with Bergwijn scoring on his debut after his £25m move from PSV Eindhoven.“It was a good goal and a very good performance,” the Spurs manager said. “It was a very solid performance, very mature. He arrived on Tuesday so he had the week to work and to try as fast as possible to understand what we wanted from him.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef83a7bc41365ce1fde0de615b829b63f99f2b2f/115_187_4474_2684/master/4474.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=486c679a155797fd7ad01d0835bd2233","title":"manchester city spurs mourinho guardiola","story":"Forget fancy formations and statistics. Tottenham’s win over City proves that the game remains riotously randomThere came a point, some time between Ilkay Gündogan missing an open goal and Oleksandr Zinchenko getting himself sent off and Davinson Sánchez heading the ball against his own crossbar from point-blank range, when you realised that whatever they tried, whatever they did, Manchester City were not going to score. It happens. Some days you just catch a whiff of bad juju at breakfast, can’t shake the feeling on the bus to the stadium, miss a couple of early chances and the entire afternoon simply unravels with a strange and unstoppable momentum. Ferran Soriano, City’s chief executive, once wrote a book called The Ball Doesn’t Go In By Chance. This was the shorter and less acclaimed sequel: By Chance, the Ball Doesn’t Go In.It’s possible, of course, to reverse-engineer these things with the benefit of hindsight. You could say City were profligate in front of goal, that Kevin De Bruyne lacked his usual precision, that Raheem Sterling looked like a man who needed a rest a month ago, that a more experienced defender than Zinchenko would have realised that the threat of a sprinting Harry Winks on the counter is really not very much of a threat at all. You could study the goals in agonising microscopic detail and draw little coloured arrows on the screen and make sombre statements like: “For me Brian, Fernandinho’s got to be quicker to close him down there, even if we have used digital technology to slow down his movement to one-12th of its usual speed.”Equally you could pay tribute to Tottenham’s resilience, to the brilliance of Hugo Lloris, to the way they capitalised as the game opened out in the last half-hour. You could point to the increasingly influential Giovani Lo Celso in the centre of midfield and the rapidly improving Serge Aurier on the right flank and the winnowing gap to Chelsea in fourth place as evidence of their progress. You could even regard this game as a companion piece to the 1-0 defeat against Liverpool last month, as a sort of template for how a post‑Pochettino Spurs will approach big games against elite opposition.None of this would be untrue. And yet ultimately, none of it would really go very far towards explaining the result of this match, insofar as it could be explained it at all. It was instead the culmination of a thousand tiny tendencies, all somehow pointing in the same direction like the grain of a lawn. An outrageous accumulation of chance and happenstance, abetted by the usual VAR vaudeville, some outstanding balls‑on‑the‑line defending and the heroics of Lloris in goal: flying around his penalty area, limbs flailing, like a hyperactive child octopus.Naturally it was tempting to chalk this up as a classic José Mourinho spoiler victory: one in the eye for his old foe Pep Guardiola, a salty two fingers to the doctrine of possession football, a gigantic up-yours to Unicef. This is the game of expectations, and some managers are better at it than others. Sam Allardyce used to linger on his wins in near-pornographic detail, leaning lasciviously into the microphone and explaining at great length how the previous 90 minutes had simply been fate’s messenger. “We played the three in midfield and the two up top with the quick switches of play and they couldn’t handle it,” he would gush, and you would sit there nodding sagely, because after all he had just won a Premier League game, and you hadn’t. Then you would leave the room and realise, with a jolt: hang on, didn’t your team just get battered?And yet, for all City’s shot supremacy and dominance of the ball, this didn’t feel like a classic anti-football treatise. Mourinho teams have always been prepared to soak up pressure and take the game deep, but it’s a strange sort of masterplan that owes its success to a missed penalty, at least two knife-edge VAR calls, a shot hitting the post via two minuscule deflections and a freakish red card against the run of play. What may end up going down as the signature win of Mourinho’s first season at Tottenham was the result of no real discernible strategy, no cogent internal logic: just the crude and comical nihilism of football.To Mourinho’s credit, even he didn’t try to dress this one up. Tottenham were, he admitted, “a bit lucky in a couple of situations”. The penalty drama was, he said, “God’s will”.And in a way, this has always been a central plank of his thinking: you can propound your fanciful ideologies and your pretensions to control, and yet there will always be a part of the game that you can never touch. It’s a manifesto of chaos, a template of nothing at all, and yet here, as this game wound to its illogical conclusion, it seemed like the only truth left in the world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e74dd86bcbb44b5880d63e5e3e712f0ddebe98c3/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ab59ae4c1bc978d6d766fec028f6b3d","title":"premier league 10 talking points from weekend","story":"Olivier Giroud’s absence is a mystery, Hugo Lloris proves his worth and Manchester United’s defence continues to wobbleThe debutant Steven Bergwijn will rightfully claim the headlines for Spurs but the contribution of Tottenham’s current third-longest serving player against Manchester City should not be forgotten. Hugo Lloris made one of the saves of the season to deny Sergio Agüero in the first half, somehow getting a big toe to turn a deflected shot on to the post, before he also denied Ilkay Gündogan from the penalty spot (the fourth spot-kick City have missed in their past six). Lloris rode his luck – he was clearly off his line when palming Gündogan’s effort away and fortunate not to concede another penalty when challenging Raheem Sterling for the rebound – but his performance is a reminder that the World Cup-winning captain is a big-game player. His return to form in time for the Champions League knockouts bodes well for José Mourinho. Michael ButlerLiverpool hit a few more milestones on Saturday – including a 20th consecutive Premier League home win that opened up a 22-point gap at the summit, the biggest lead witnessed at the end of a day’s play in English top‑flight history – but Jürgen Klopp took greater satisfaction from several key players hitting their stride. Fabinho rediscovered his rhythm in the second half as he continued his recovery from injury, while Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino flourished as an awkward afternoon became a procession. And Firmino created three of the goals to overtake Salah, Andy Robertson and Sadio Mané on Liverpool’s assist list this season. “He is just exceptional,” Klopp said. “But even a player like Bobby needs an address where he can send the ball. How he uses the skills of his mates is special. I do not know a player like him.” Andy HunterChelsea could have had a commanding lead in the first half at Leicester on Saturday but they were scruffy in the final third, which has been the case too often this season. If they slip out of fourth spot then critics – and possibly Frank Lampard – will point to their failure to sign a striker last month. But is Lampard making the best use of the ones available to him? Tammy Abraham, who hurt his ankle against Arsenal, did not look in top condition at Leicester and it is hard to believe Olivier Giroud would not have been sharper. But the Frenchman, having been denied a move to clubs who would have used him, was not in the squad. He must not be impressing Lampard in training, though Abraham relishes working with him. “He’s like a big brother to me,” the 22-year-old said. “His attitude has been great. In training we are always doing finishing and we have a competition after training as well. He has been encouraging many of the young lads.” Paul DoyleJefferson Lerma has enough bookings to build a yellow brick road, 66 across the past four and a half years (22 in a Bournemouth shirt) and, as much as Eddie Howe would rather the Colombia midfielder was not suspended for the trip to Sheffield United on Sunday, he is equally loth for Lerma to lose his edge. Lerma was superb against Aston Villa until he received his first red card for Bournemouth after picking up the second of two cautions for fouls on Jack Grealish, retribution which his manager felt was a consequence of the player’s reputation. “I think some of the bookings this season have been very harsh,” Howe said. “I think other players wouldn’t have ended up with the same punishment that he has. Unfortunately for Jeff he has put himself in that position and it is very difficult I think to change people’s opinions. I think referees are looking out for him.” Ben FisherBurnley have never beaten Arsenal in the Premier League and, perhaps more remarkable still, this was Sean Dyche’s first point against them in 10 attempts. It probably felt more glass half‑full than half‑empty, all the more so because this fixture came at the end of a challenging sequence. Burnley could have found themselves among the relegation candidates had they failed to take anything from games against Leicester, Manchester United and Arsenal, yet they ended up with a more than respectable seven points. “That’s a really healthy return and the players can have a rest now before we start again,” Dyche said. “They deserve it. There’s some tough challenges in the Premier League and we’ve shown we can hold our own against some of the best teams around.” Paul WilsonDean Henderson’s form in goal for Sheffield United – the clean sheet at Selhurst Park was his ninth in the Premier League this season, the joint-most in the ision – has brought him international recognition with England but Gareth Southgate might well be advised to keep his eye on another member of the Blades’ defensive unit. Though Henderson has excelled, clean sheets are not down to a goalkeeper alone and United are among the Premier League leaders in terms of shots against, allowing fewer than 12 per game on average. The Republic of Ireland international John Egan in the heart of defence has been key to that, but perhaps even more vital have been the contributions of Jack O’Connell on the left of the back three. The 25-year-old, excellent again in south London, surely can not be too far away from Southgate’s thoughts. John AshdownFor prolonged periods it was hard to discern that Norwich were bottom and Newcastle en route to 10th but, as Steve Bruce acknowledged, the Premier League is all about “small margins”. A combination of an excellent goalkeeper in Martin Dubravka and the sensible decision to revert to Rafael Benítez’s five‑at‑the‑back system promises to keep Newcastle safe but Bruce’s side do not score enough goals to feel properly secure. Benítez’s successor believes a lack of midfield creativity – and possession – explains why the £40m Joelinton has scored only one league goal all season, and he has a point. Even so, Tynesiders remain puzzled as to why he prioritised reinforcing midfield above recruiting a striker last month. Bruce did not bid for Jarrod Bowen, who eventually left Hull for West Ham, claiming he was “no better” than forwards he already possessed. Newcastle fans wonder if he was right. Louise TaylorThe relegation battle is increasingly intriguing and Watford are right in it. They are in 19th place, two points from safety, with a negative goal difference surpassed only by Norwich. After the Hornets’ start to the season, this should not be surprising – but such has been Nigel Pearson’s impact it’s sometimes easy to forget. Watford endured a second consecutive defeat on Saturday against Everton and, as against Aston Villa, it didn’t feel like the right result: 2-0 up and cruising, Watford should have gone on to win. But bad marking and, with the late winner, risky play from a high defensive line were punished ruthlessly by Carlo Ancelotti’s men. Such mistakes cannot be repeated and – with Manchester United, Liverpool, Crystal Palace and Leicester in their next five games – Pearson’s relegation challenge has only just begun. Paul MacInnesThe manner of West Ham’s collapse here left them scratching for positives but there was a clear one in their midfield debutant, Tomas Soucek. The 24-year-old Czech looks cut out for better sides than this and was particularly instrumental in a first‑half performance that should have set them up for a comfortable win. Soucek is an imposing figure at 6ft 4in and won most of his aerial challenges in an enjoyable midfield battle even more important was the energy he offered in an all-action display that could have brought a goal. His early header, well saved by Mathew Ryan, came from a free‑kick he had won with a dynamic burst into space. There is much more to come from Soucek but the worry is that, with a devilish set of fixtures ahead, he will have to wield an extraordinary influence if a traumatic end to the season is to be avoided.

I found an answer in becoming much more reflectiveAs the oldest of three daughters, I always felt an acute sense of responsibility and a weight on my shoulders to prove myself. I had to be better than everyone else, excel against the boys and show that I was worthy of my place in the world. Yet, as relatives and strangers speculated over my parents’ future and lack of a son to provide for them in old age, I had a crushing and debilitating foreboding that I would not achieve anything.Growing up in India, my mother made sure that we had the best education, even as my parents made monumental sacrifices, living in tiny one-bedroom rented houses, with no holidays or luxuries. I was clever and that became my identity. At times I would feel overwhelmed by the pressure to succeed, but with the optimism of youth, I was ready to take on the world. Admitting that I wasn’t coping was never an option.From a young age, I started to make meticulous to-do lists, obsessively writing down tasks – “read two new books”, “do an extra hour of maths” – and crossing them off as they were completed, on whatever paper I could lay my hands on. This was a way to organise my chaotic mind as it jumped from one sparkling idea to another. My desk would look like a mess, but I knew exactly what I had to do and when. The problem is the list never seemed to get any shorter.All through my teens, my father battled with alcoholism and I grew accustomed to being wary of the genetic nature of addiction. I would not even take painkillers for fear of getting hooked on them. But I did not realise that my own addiction was my slavery to my to-do lists.As I moved to the UK to study for a PhD, and then started a lectureship, navigating a high-pressured academic environment and single parenthood, I continued to focus on the things that I needed to achieve to maintain a grasp on my life. The to-do lists became akin to a toxic relationship with a friend who was ultimately controlling me.I did not celebrate moving up the academic ladder, winning a book deal, being invited to give two TEDx talks, or surviving the acute sleep deprivation and exhaustion after my twins were born with severe colic and reflux. Instead, I kept writing down all the things that I still had to do, always driving myself forward, looking ahead, never stopping to take a breath.Last year, I had for many months been holed up in my office, trying to snatch every single moment through countless flustered days and sleepless nights to finish writing a book. Juggling furiously the demands of running a home and business, I felt the very foundations of our family life wobbling. I realised that something had to change to stop this constant churn of anxiety.So I decided to start writing a “have-done” list every Friday evening. Initially, it was extremely hard to even remember any wins or achievements, but I persisted. And slowly, as the weeks went by, I started looking forward to writing down the things that I had achieved not only professionally but also personally: moments that had brought me real joy, or personal challenges that I had overcome. So, while I noted down a great talk and workshop that I delivered, or another 2,000 words written on my book, I would also record a situation when I managed to stay calm even as I was exhausted and furious, sent a tricky email or completed a Go Ape challenge with the kids despite having vertigo. Instead of always looking at what else I had to do, I started reflecting on my achievements and celebrating the smallest wins. A tiny change, but it has already been monumental in helping me to evaluate how I perceive success in life. I wouldn’t say that it has solved everything, and it is sometimes not possible to do every single week. But it has been a huge leap forward. I am still driven to succeed but by taking time to reflect on the things that I have achieved, no matter how big or small – from gaining another consultancy project to successfully getting my twins to bed – I am able to set my own standards and measure of success.Writing them down reminds me of the tiniest victories that otherwise might have passed me by. And my self-worth and value are no longer measured by the ticks and crosses on my to-do list.Sway: Unravelling Unconscious Bias will be published by Bloomsbury on 2 April.

It’s a positive step forward - and many hope it will lead to more changeCarrie thought she was ready to go back to work four weeks after the death of Siobhán, the daughter she and her husband lost to brain cancer at seven months old. But, in reality, she wasn’t. “I really struggled to cope,” she says. “I was a teacher and there was nowhere to hide: I had to deal with children, parents and colleagues all day, every day. There was no downtime and no office for me to retreat to.”Returning to work just added to her trauma. “I had to put on a false face, which was exhausting. All sorts of things triggered my grief during the day, but I had to bottle everything up,” she says. “I had to contain and condense my grief into predetermined time slots when I was at home. As a parent who has lost a child, you never stop grieving, but I don’t think that was good for me in the short or long term.”The new legislation, Jack’s law, is said to be the most generous parental bereavement pay offer in the world: it will give all working parents who suffer the loss of a child two weeks of statutory paid leave. But while welcoming the official recognition that bereaved parents need to grieve, Carrie is worried about the two-week time frame: although it offers a cushion for the immediate loss, not only is two weeks not nearly long enough, it might even backfire.“I’m concerned that these two weeks will be seen as the official and ‘correct’ amount of time that people need to get over their loss,” she says. “It is of some help, but it is only a start. Nobody can complete their grieving within two weeks. Parents will still be arranging a funeral to begin with and it is only after that they can begin to grieve. While I appreciate the cost of providing any leave, further support needs to be available once parents return to work, much as it is on return from illness.”The new law, which is expected to come into force in April, is the culmination of a decade-long campaign by Lucy Herd, whose 23-month-old son, Jack, drowned in a pond in 2010. At the time of his son’s death, Jack’s father was allowed only three days off work to grieve, one of which had to be for the funeral.“In the immediate aftermath of a child dying, parents have to cope with their own loss, the grief of their wider family, including other children, as well as a vast amount of administrative paperwork and other arrangements,” says Herd. “A sudden or accidental death may require a postmortem or inquest, and there are many other organisations to contact, from schools to benefit offices.”Until now, there has been no legislation covering how much leave companies must offer when an employee’s child has died: the law simply said that the amount should be “reasonable”.On its website, the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas) advises employers to “be compassionate towards a person’s inidual situation remember that everyone deals with bereavement differently (some people may need more time off than others)”. But in advice that will shortly be out of date, it reminds employers: “There is no automatic right to paid time off for bereavement.”The Rainbow Trust, which supports families with a seriously ill child from diagnosis through to bereavement, was part of the consultation process behind the new law. Anne Harris, CEO of the charity, says that, while she welcomes it, she “would caution that it should not be assumed that grief can be resolved in two weeks. Parents tell us that they never get over the death of their child, they just learn to live with it.“When parents return to work, we would encourage employers to have a conversation with them to agree the approach they would like, and encourage line managers not to shy away from these important, albeit difficult, conversations,” she adds.Small-scale research by the Rainbow Trust in 2014 found that more than half of the 58 bereaved parents who took part in the survey did not feel their employers gave them enough time to cope.The study also found that one in three bereaved parents felt that their employers put pressure on them to come back to work after the death of their child. Ten of the respondents said they had left their job because of the way they were dealt with during their bereavement.Half the parents surveyed took at least one month off work, with more than a third feeling that four months or more would have been ideal.Paul’s daughter died at six weeks old from epilepsy and encephalopathy. He says that, in his case, no amount of leave could have helped that he was only just starting to function again after the six months’ full pay and six months’ half-pay his company gave him. “If I had gone back two weeks after, it would have been very difficult,” he says. “I was very, very angry. I stayed angry for about three months and became a recluse. My wife was in shock. Being pregnant for nine months and not bringing your baby home is something that I could never understand or relate to. So we were on two very different pages.“If I had taken this grief into work with me after two weeks and left my wife at home, it’s really difficult to understand how that would have worked out. My initial thought is that it would have been awful. To have the spotlight on me like that after such a short period of time, in which I did not have time to process what had happened: I can’t imagine how I would have dealt with that.”On the other hand, he says, the acknowledgement that parents need to grieve that comes with Jack’s law is helpful. “Time is the biggest thing when you lose your child,” he says. “Grieving hurts and it takes time to process what has happened. My brain would not let me think about what we had been through for a few days. Every time I thought about the child I had lost, my mind just played music to distract me and I lost my train of thought. It was very weird.”Jack’s law, which will help 10,000 bereaved families in the UK every year, will cover all working parents who lose a child under the age of 18 or have a stillbirth from 24 weeks of pregnancy, irrespective of how long an inidual has been with their employer. In a move that has been particularly welcomed by campaigners, the two weeks’ leave can be taken either in one block or in two separate blocks until the first anniversary of the child’s death.Kiran Daurka, an employment law partner at Leigh Day, says that while two weeks is not long enough for parents to grieve: “The main plus of this law is that fathers now know they have a right to ask for leave. Fathers often feel put to one side, with all the sympathy going to the mother.”Daurka adds that she hopes employers will treat this two-week period as a bare minimum for grieving parents. “Now companies know that parents have the right to leave and that they can claim those two weeks’ statutory pay back from the government, I hope employers will be more generous because they can now afford to offer more on top of those two weeks.”She would also like the new law to generate helpful conversations in companies that have not previously thought about this subject. “The whole issue of compassionate leave is very unclear, with it really being at the discretion of companies, who often make it up as they go along,” she says. “Child bereavement is so unusual that companies often haven’t even thought about it.”For those who have miscarriages, the new law will not apply. Rebecca, 46, was not allowed any bereavement leave after a traumatic miscarriage when she was 10 weeks pregnant. And yet, she says: “The trauma of going through a miscarriage is a physical and emotional pain I wouldn’t wish on the most evil person. It’s agony. Utter, physical agony. Coupled with the emotional and mental trauma, miscarriage is devastatingly overlooked in terms of child loss, unless you have experienced it for yourself.”Rebecca was only allowed sick leave, “so it went down on my HR records that I had had a miscarriage”, she says. She started miscarrying at work. “It was the most traumatic experience I have had,” she says. “No one at work knew that I was even pregnant yet, so I had to inform my manager I was pregnant and losing the baby all in one go. I couldn’t get myself to A\u0026ampE as the bleeding was so fierce and the pain excruciating.“I had two days off, the Thursday and Friday, and then the weekend. I was in shock. I was embarrassed. I was hurt that no one from work seemed to care. The week prior, a colleague had been involved in a car accident. She was fine, just a little shaken. She had four days off work and the office sent her a card and flowers. I didn’t even get a phone call and when I returned to the office, no one asked how I was,” she says.The cut-off age of 18 also strikes many as unjust. Max’s newly married daughter died suddenly last year, two weeks after her 26th birthday. Like Herd’s husband, Max was given only three days’ paid leave. He took the day of his daughter’s death off, but was back at his desk on Monday morning, needing the other two days for her funeral – which didn’t take place for seven weeks because the family needed to wait for the coroner’s report.“The pain is so acute, so physical, that I wondered sometimes how I could continue to breathe in and out. Sleep patterns are shot to pieces. You don’t think about food until someone puts it in front of you. “After two weeks, it’s easier. You can function. The paperwork is almost done. Sleep is settling. You get a feeling that it might, eventually, be OK,” Max says. But he was still far from ready to return to work: “It is now almost a year, which brings its own issues.”Max is critical of the fact that Jack’s law comes with an age limit. “I feel disappointed and slightly distressed that it is only for parents of children under 18,” he says. “My daughter may have been an adult, but was no less my child and I am insulted to think that my grief is somehow less worthy than that of a parent who has lost a child under 18.”Chris Parker wonders if there is anything that employers can do to help when dealing with such a deep level of grief and trauma. His 19-year-old daughter, Laurel, had a life-limiting condition and died in 2015. Parker stopped work when the doctors said she was close to death and says his employers were exemplary. They gave him as much time off as he needed and, after her death, organised a collection for the child’s hospice. Colleagues sent supportive messages while he was off work and were sympathetic when he returned.At the deepest level, however, it did not change anything. “As a parent, having a child die is a life-changing experience, affecting mental and physical health for many years,” Chris says. “Nearly five years on, I still don’t feel like the employee I was before Laurel died.“I will never be as happy as I was when Laurel was alive and that greatly affects me in and out of work. No amount of leave, holiday or joyful experiences makes good the gap in my life.”Some names have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/598629a2778570e49024fed98bb0e0d8c9763f96/0_114_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4e6ea8513ee818bc448aaae655e88ee","title":"fca credit card persistent debt fees","story":"Watchdog tells lenders they should cut or drop fees rather than issue blanket suspensionsBritain’s financial watchdog has warned credit card firms against the blanket suspension of cards of consumers who are stuck in a debt spiral, telling them to reduce or waive interest and other charges instead.The Financial Conduct Authority’s affordability rules brought in in March 2018 to cut problem credit card debt have put thousands at risk of having their accounts suspended from this month.The watchdog has written to the bosses of credit card firms to express concern that they may cancel or suspend credit cards for everyone in persistent debt, including those willing to engage and come to an agreement. It told firms that they are not allowed to suspend a credit card without having an objectively justifiable reason.Under the new rules, credit card providers, including Barclays, Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland, were forced to identify customers who had been in persistent debt for at least 18 months, and were given a further 18 months to convince customers to increase their payments. This means that from February, when the first 36-month period draws to a close, customers who fail to respond or cannot afford higher payments could have their credit cards suspended.As of November, there were 1.78 million people stuck in persistent credit card debt where they end up paying more in interest, fees and charges than they are paying off their balance. The FCA estimates that getting them out of this cycle could save them up to £1.3bn a year in lower interest charges.The watchdog is concerned that those borrowers may not respond to letters from credit card providers, which have been ordered to send at least three letters. It said that if customers cannot afford the options proposed by the firm, they must be treated with forbearance and due consideration.Jonathan Davidson, the executive director of supervision for retail and authorisations at the FCA, said: “Under our rules, firms must help customers to reduce the level of debt they have on their credit card more quickly. If a customer cannot afford the firm’s proposals for how to do this, the firm must offer forbearance, potentially including reducing, waiving or cancelling any interest, fees or charges.“My advice to consumers is don’t bury your head in the sand.

Wales has its own variation in the form of land transaction tax (LTT) which has been run by the Welsh Revenue Authority since April 2018.Given the hefty sum you might have to part with to pay the ADS and the tighter deadline for selling your old home, I’d be tempted to sell first and then move to Scotland and find somewhere to buy once you get there. On a practical note, house hunting in situ rather than from a distance is also likely to be more fruitful. Also on a practical note, I’d only move in with your daughter if she has offered to house you otherwise I’d rent somewhere to live in in the interim.* The exempt amount is £125,000 in England and Northern Ireland £180,000 in Wales. The rates charged and the amounts they are charged on also vary between the countries. Find out more about LBTT, LTT and SDLT at the UK government website.

The resulting clarity shines through Fire, the first song from the extraordinary album Saint Cloud, out in March. Not only is it sparser than her prior work, trading rocky exuberance for a spindly front-porch meditation that foregrounds her gorgeous southern accent, but it also conveys the shock of seeing life and one’s own actions clearly. Prone to running and maintaining a facade to deflect intimacy, Crutchfield anxiously comes to terms with trust in a new relationship, her heightened state conveyed in a nervous falsetto. “I can learn to see with a partial view,” she sings as the melody starts rolling and the song’s textures soften. “I can learn to be easy as I move in close to you.” LSTenor saxophonist Joe Henderson’s Black Narcissus is a slow-swinging, nocturnal number that teeters from louche to lonesome between Henderson’s breathy melody and Herbie Hancock’s soft piano comping. What Tortoise guitarist Jeff Parker adds in his take on this jazz standard is inimitable swagger. Straightening out the groove into a woozy, J Dilla-style beat, he stacks the hearty bassline with a synthesiser and unapologetically thrusts the melody into the light. His own playing is a suggestive background presence, but his arrangement is a poignant tribute to and radical reimagining of the original. AKThe Brighton band reinvent the Pixies’ loud-quiet-loud trademark with meteorological force. Dana Margolin and co swap muttered, malevolent verses with sudden blasts of swashbuckling noise, as if commanding an intermittently calm and aggressive sea. It’s hard to remember the last song that unsettled like Sweet, particularly once you delve into Margolin’s lyrics about depressive codependence, which she delivers with sullen, blunt force. Anyone who misses Nick Cave’s devilish side is well served here. LSYou couldn’t call Disq original: they evidently love Pavement so much they probably have tattoos of Stephen Malkmus’s face hidden on their bodies. But this teenage quintet from Wisconsin burst with joie de vivre. Their debut London shows the other week were fantastic – ragged yet coordinated – and their terrific second single does all the good bits from Pavement. It keeps threatening to fall apart, but then the band pull the guy ropes and the structure returns to its proper shape. Fantastic stuff, and their debut album, due in the spring, is a cracker. MHTo listeners outside the Toronto indie underground, Meg Remy’s brilliant 2018 album, In a Poem Unlimited, came as a revelation. To be fair, its pointed glam strut, an upgrade of her DIY aesthetic, was probably a surprise to her OG fans too. She pulls a similar trick with the first single from her forthcoming record, this time literally reinventing a 2013 US Girls track – giving what was queasy and chaotic a vamping, hall-of-mirrors makeover fit for Jenny Lewis (with a bracing solo from E Street Band saxophonist Jake Clemons). Similar subject matter to Lewis’s 2019 album, too, as Remy discovers that a former partner was drinking themselves to death on the sly. LSOn Repeat, J Hus and Koffee – the first woman to win the Grammy for reggae album of the year – trade verses about going wherever the money goes: “Dollar signs, no coins, but mi still a jingle,” Koffee sings. But this rich, low-slung collaboration couldn’t be further from the clout-baiting neediness that has come to underpin most high-profile collaborations. Instead, the oaky-voiced Hus dabbles in a little French then cedes the floor to his partner, who shows off her lovely, melancholy singing for the first time. LSIt will surprise some that Scottish folk, Hindustani classical music and jazz can be instinctive companions, but they continue to be on YorkstonThorneKhan’s third album, Navarasa, named after the nine emotions found in the Hindu scriptures. This luscious instrumental track named after a Scottish lightship, written by singer-songwriter James Yorkston, is a particularly beautiful thing. Suhail Yusuf Khan’s sarangi (a classical instrument with a sound close to the human voice) improvises delicate leaps of laughter as Jon Thorne’s double-bass anchors the tune’s drift between minor and major keys. Yorkston’s guitar adds texture and determination. Give these boys soundtrack work, film directors. They’re giving you the world. JRAlthough she’s best known as a figurehead for emo, music’s most cathartic genre, you get the impression that Hayley Williams has suppressed a lot of rage over the years. As Paramore members came and went, often insulting her as they left, she maintained a dignified diplomacy. Their last album, 2017’s brilliant After Laughter, arrived just as her marriage was ending, another exposing experience that she kept quiet about. Her solo debut suggests someone who has spent a long time meditating on how to deal with anger, not least as a young woman in the public eye who might be undermined if she showed much of it. The sound of her short breath opens Simmer, a surprisingly low-key exercise in “how to draw the line between wrath and mercy”. Far from her day job’s polychromatic emoting, this tense, melancholy number recalls Wild Beasts at their subtlest. LSChannelling the energy of the “new phone who dis?” post-breakup meme, Ella Eyre’s latest single – her best by a country mile – also works as a fairly obvious statement about phase two of her career. Her initial run of solo singles eventually led her down a retro-soul cul de sac. But a new label, a new mindset and, according to a recent interview, a reacquaintance with the kaleidoscopic pop melange favoured by Basement Jaxx, has resulted in a third-person stomper that accentuates rather than deadens her not inconsiderable voice. Bonus points for following an already top-notch hook – “Ella ain’t here, it’s a new me” – with a skyrocketing post-chorus that rhymes “key” with “weave”. MCWhen it first appeared on the patchy 1989 debut album by Bowie’s short-lived hard rock band Tin Machine, I Can’t Read – written with guitarist Reeves Gabrels – came decked in guitar squalls and metallic feedback. However, this acoustic version from the forthcoming Is It Any Wonder? EP, cut during sessions for 1997’s Earthling but dropped from the final album, peels away the noise to reveal the subtleties of the gem beneath. Once described by Bowie as being “full of remorse and agony”, the haunting, ghostly beauty will be familiar to fans of Quicksand from Hunky Dory.

In Calixto Bieito’s 2012 production for ENO – now in its second revivalat the Coliseum – the Spain is General Franco’s rather than the exoticised landscape of mid-19th-century engravings, the sun beats down on an almost empty stage and the only bull we see is a massive horned signpost in silhouette. But the tourist-snap principle persists. In place of the corsets-and-cigarettes ubiquitous elsewhere, Bieito delights in 70s references, from Gypsies – who could have been Top of the Pops 2 backing dancers – to a small fleet of vintage Mercedes sedans, apparently the ride of choice for Franco-era smugglers. The Saturday-at-the-supermarket parking scramble got a laugh.And Carmen did, after all, start life at Paris’s Opéra Comique, where frivolity was encouraged, but the updated setting otherwise remains, frustratingly, just alternative costuming for operatic business as usual.The singing was mixed. Back in the title role, Justina Gringyte moved with ease and shone in Carmen’s seguidilla (a showcase for the ultra-rich lower reaches of her full-fat soprano), though her tuning elsewhere was sometimes uncomfortable. As José, Sean Panikkar was a fitting combination of needy and nasty, channelled through an effective mix of slightly nasal earnestness, fleeting lyricism and brute force. Nardus Williams’s Micaëla – another big, creamy voice and one to listen out for on the basis of this ENO debut – was a steelier foil for Carmen than most. Ashley Riches’ Escamillo (a lone suit-wearer among the riot of patterns and khaki) was at the lighter end of the bullfighter spectrum but had suavity to burn. Alex Otterburn’s razor-edged Moralès stood out among the smaller roles.The highlight of this performance, though, came from the pit. Conducted by Valentina Peleggi with immense energy and decisiveness, the ENO orchestra was on excellent form: deliciously pert in a fast, taut prelude feather-light in the seguidilla expansive, with beautifully sculpted woodwind solos in the atmospheric opening of act three – and constantly, minutely sensitive to the shifts of dramatic temperature on stage throughout.• Carmen is at the Coliseum, London, until 27 February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b81993fdd8b2b80449dc3ccb85de285cfd06c59a/0_182_3117_1870/master/3117.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=accffafdc1cee092a7c08a09ce1dc14e","title":"us elections the importance of iowa podcast","story":"Chris McGreal visits the first US state to vote in this year’s race for the Democratic party’s presidential nomination.

Because she was in full-time employment, she was unable to claim any help with rent or council tax. When her husband died in 2018, her debts became unsustainable.“I have always had credit cards and had never missed a repayment but I was struggling to meet my financial commitments. Going bankrupt was the only way forward,” she said. “The thought filled me with absolute despair but there was no other way out.“Emotionally I hide how I feel to others,” she added. “Truthfully, I am very sad and as a woman and of my age, I find it even harder as I feel I am hiding a terrible secret.”Stuart Lewis, founder of Rest Less, said the rapidly increasing rate of insolvency among all women is “cause for concern” but is particularly concerning among women over 55, “many of whom are already at higher risk of finding themselves in a financially precarious position”.“The over-55s are more likely to be made redundant, to be in long-term unemployment and to face age discrimination in the recruitment process when applying for jobs,” he said. “Women in their 50s and 60s are also more likely to have taken time out of the workplace and to have caring responsibilities, whether for elder relatives, partners or grandchildren.“Add to this, the wide gulf in private pension savings between men and women – due to 40 years of a historical gender pay gap – and it’s no surprise to see why insolvencies among women over 65 are rising faster than other groups,” he said.Mark Sands, chair of the Personal Insolvency Committee at R3, the insolvency trade body, said the statistics suggest women are seeking help for debt problems instead of letting the cycle continue.“These new statistics show that women account for two thirds of those applying for Debt Relief Orders, introduced a decade ago to offer a cost-effective, easily-accessible way out for those under £20,000 in debt and have few, if any assets,” he said.Sands also said women reaching retirement are likely to be more vulnerable to insolvency than any other group. “Women of that age are least likely to have a workplace pension. They’ll be relying entirely on the state pension which isn’t enough to continue to make any debt repayments they’ve been making.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6e86c0a995605b560414527e77404149eba503f/0_84_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c895201ee6d270bdf4aa276a79413b84","title":"have you been affected by changes to disability welfare payments","story":"We’d like you to help us document how problems with welfare benefits have affected people with disabilities.

We need that shot in the arm and we need some new blood in the women’s game.”The American, who won 18 of her 34 grand slam singles finals, was talking about her 15-year-old compatriot, Coco Gauff, who had already put Venus Williams out of a slam in the first round for the second time in seven months, and had then beaten the defending champion, Naomi Osaka. Tennis was ready to crown its new princess.Sofia Kenin was not quite so ready. The 21-year-old American, seeded 14th, might have reckoned there would be more noise attending her own progress, as she worked her way into the fourth round past two qualifiers and the unseeded Shuai Zhang without dropping a set.There she looked across the net at Gauff, the player nearly everyone wanted to embrace as the next big prospect, an articulate and thoughtful teenager, respectful of her peers and the history of the game, and owner of a game that combined exquisite touch and growing power.Kenin, it was said, lacked pop on her serve, especially if her first effort did not land, and her volleying needed work. But she beat Gauff, whom she likes, in three sets, the last without conceding a game. She found a way. Now they began to talk about the daughter of impoverished immigrants, about her father and coach, Alex, who had arrived in the United States from Russia with just $300 in his pocket, three months after she was born, and occupied the front row of her players’ box all fortnight like some knowing old party apparatchik.Now Sofia – or Sonia, as he calls her – was going to pay him back, big time. In the quarters, she beat the unheralded Tunisian, Ons Jabeur, who had done some giant-killing of her own in beating Johanna Konta, the two Carolines – Garcia and Wozniacki – and the 27th seed, Wang Qiang. She fell to Kenin in straight sets. As did the world No 1 and home favourite, Ashleigh Barty. The clamour for the American with no discernibly big weapons but a huge fighting spirit began to grow.On Saturday, it appeared her run to glory, in her first slam final, might shudder to a halt when Garbiñe Muguruza, the double-slam champion, won the first set. Yet again, Kenin found a way. In just over two hours on Rod Laver Arena she ground down the experienced Spaniard 4-6, 6-2, 6-2. Evert, who has known Kenin since she was six and watched her grow up in Florida, a shy but determined young player, said: “Sofia has been undervalued and she has been overshadowed by a lot of the American power players. But now America knows her and what she has. They know she is a champion.”She is also the new American No 1 – eclipsing Serena Williams – and the world No 7. She is moving comfortably in space occupied by Gauff, Osaka, Barty, Bianca Andreescu and Simona Halep. She is a threat to all of them.Kenin, who beat Serena Williams in the third round of the 2019 French Open and has twice reached round two at Wimbledon, will look towards Europe when the dust settles.“Wimbledon is such a tradition,” she said. “You really feel it there. I love coming back, I love the people the crowd is so fun.”She appreciated that her parents struggled in Russia. “My dad has told me that it was a tough time for them. They didn’t have that much when they came to the States. They wanted to give me the American dream. I am really thankful. Without them, I wouldn’t be where I am today.“Some people didn’t really believe in me. They turned me down and said I wouldn’t make it or I was too small. We never took that seriously. I had a goal, I had a dream and we achieved it.“A lot of youngsters are coming up and winning grand slams. I think it’s great for women’s tennis. It is changing and has become more exciting for everyone.”Kenin retained her beguiling innocence, a slightly overawed kid, still, in front of the world’s media late on Saturday evening, nursing a large glass of champagne and glancing over to her proud father for guidance. He is not an overbearing “tennis dad”, more a kindly mentor, who – like Maria Sharapova’s father before them – knew hardship and found a way out of it.Kenin, who more than doubled her career earnings with a winner’s cheque for $A4.1m (£2.08m), stopped smiling long enough to reveal she would be raiding the Cartier shop in Melbourne . “I got my eye on a few things,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e37107031998721973cdbd8fe8f975f91562a44/0_269_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dda5009861ba3ae7bebf1f8444750a88","title":"patrick mahomes super bowl mvp nfl football kansas city chiefs","story":"The young Chiefs star who’s already been likened to the all-time greats rebounded from a nightmarish opening to make the plays when they mattered mostFor three-and-a-half quarters, we waited for a ‘Mahoment’. It seemed as though we would be waiting in vain. Super Bowl LIV was meant to belong to Patrick Mahomes, the 24-year-old quarterback with a rocket launcher for an arm and a league MVP award already in his locker. Instead it was passing him by.With just under 12 minutes remaining in the game, and his team trailing 20-10, Mahomes threw his second interception. It was a bad throw, intended for Tyreek Hill on a crossing route but arriving behind the receiver, who bobbled it into the hands of San Francisco’s Tarvarius Moore. At that point, Mahomes had completed 18 of 29 passes for 172 yards and no touchdowns.Hardly the numbers expected of a player who had thrown for eight touchdowns in his two previous playoff games, one who was already being compared to the all-time greats. Mahomes has been reminded often enough this week that Tom Brady won his first Super Bowl at 24, and Joe Montana just a year older than that.Yet there was another, less encouraging, comparison that hung over him here, in Miami of all cities. Dan Marino went to the Super Bowl in his second season as an NFL starter for the Dolphins – the same career stage that Mahomes finds himself at now.The parallels are striking. Marino was the first quarterback ever to throw for 5,000 yards in a season, and shattered the league record by throwing for 48 touchdowns in 1984 as well. Mahomes, last year, became just the second player ever to throw for 5,000 yards and 50 touchdowns in a single campaign.Marino wound up on the losing side at Super Bowl XIX, throwing a pair of second-half interceptions as the Dolphins slumped to defeat against these same 49ers. As Moore led San Francisco’s defenders off the field in celebration after his fourth-quarter pick, it seemed as though history was repeating. What if Mahomes’s career were to go down the same path as Marino’s, and he never returned to this stage again?But this story had a different ending. The Chiefs’ defense dug in, forcing a punt and putting the ball back in Mahomes’s hands with eight minutes and 33 seconds remaining. He needed fewer than six of those to turn this game on its head.Suddenly Mahomes was, well, Mahomes, the freelancing, rocket-armed quarterback who does not know when he’s beaten. He threw to Hill short, long, and long again. He dematerialized in front of defenders just at the moment when they thought they finally had him in their grasp.Perhaps things still would have ended differently if it weren’t for a pass interference call against Moore in the end zone on third-and-10 from the San Francisco 21. Mahomes capitalized by hitting Travis Kelce in the back of the end zone one play later. Suddenly, the 49ers were drowning. They gave the ball back, and the Chiefs returned it to the end zone, twice. In a blink of an eye, the Chiefs had scored 21 points, unanswered.The only surprise is that we were surprised at all. Kansas City had overcome double-digit deficits against two pretty good teams already in this playoff run. What’s a 10-point gap to overcome, to a team that trailed by 24 against Houston, and already had the lead by half-time? Andy Reid has a reputation as one of the great game-planners, a man who never loses when he has a bye week, yet it is the Chiefs’ in-game adjustments that have been to the fore in this run.This night belongs to Reid as much as Mahomes, named as the game’s MVP. Only five head coaches in NFL history have won more games and each of those has at least two Super Bowls to their name. Reid was surely already destined for a place in the Hall of Fame, but he may well cherish the ring that he earned tonight even more.Reid has earned himself a place forever in the hearts of Kansas City’s fans. The Chiefs had waited half a century for this return to a Super Bowl. The last time they were on this stage, Mahomes’s father was yet to be born.Those fans turned out in huge numbers at Hard Rock Stadium. They were doing all they could to make their team feel like it was back at Arrowhead, ending the national anthem with that familiar ‘home of the Chiefs!’ refrain. All that was missing was the smell of brisket wafting up from the tailgate.Reid and his team have that to look forward to upon their return home, for what will be a memorable celebration. With Mahomes’s career ahead of him, there should be plenty more yet to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25d2ce02a7d6afacb704880624891c3e7e718ffc/274_266_3226_1935/master/3226.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e78550f3ddc1134bf7fa579c89b61294","title":"shaun wane appointed england rugby league head coach","story":"• Former Wigan coach Wane succeeds Wayne Bennett• RFL rugby director Kevin Sinfield resigns from postThe former England captain Kevin Sinfield has quit the Rugby Football League following the appointment of Shaun Wane as the new head coach.Wane, the 55-year-old former Wigan coach, takes over on a full-time basis from Australian Wayne Bennett on a two-year contract which will take in this year’s home Ashes Series and the 2021 World Cup.Wane left Wigan after guiding his hometown team to a third Grand Final at the end of the 2018 season and has spent the last year working as high performance coach for the Scottish Rugby Union.Wane said: “I am honoured to be appointed head coach of my country’s national team at such an exciting and important time for rugby league in England. Everyone who knows me knows that I’ve always loved the game of rugby league and been proud of British rugby league.”The appointment brings to an end the four-year reign of Bennett, who steered England to the 2017 World Cup final but lost much credibility while in charge of the re-formed Great Britain team that lost all four matches on their recent tour of New Zealand and Papua New Guinea. Bennett’s part-time contract with the RFL ended after that tour and the decision not to renew it led directly to the resignation of RFL rugby director Sinfield, who was a big supporter of the veteran Australian.“I would like to thank all the staff and players who have worked so hard on all the six England programmes during my time at the RFL,” said Sinfield, who was instrumental in creating the England performance unit.“Our aim was to put the national teams at the pinnacle of our sport in terms of preparation and development, which I believe we have gone a long way towards achieving. I would particularly like to pay tribute to Wayne Bennett as England head coach. Wayne has always shown nothing but complete commitment to the England cause during his time in charge of the national team and the wealth of knowledge he has given to our players and coaches will enhance the game in this country for many years to come.“His passion for this group of players to succeed in a home World Cup was evident every time I spoke to him about his players and I know it will be a disappointment that he cannot complete that journey with them.”The RFL’s chief executive, Ralph Rimmer, who recently admitted that ticket sales for the Ashes Series would be a consideration when it came to appointing the next coach, says it is time for a change of direction with a full-time UK-based man in charge.Rimmer, who with Sinfield carried out a review into the Lions tour, said: “We think this is an exciting appointment that will be welcomed by England rugby league supporters as we prepare for this year’s Ashes series and the 2021 Rugby League World Cup. Shaun is passionate about the game and his country and is also an outstanding coach, as shown by his record in eight seasons as Wigan’s head coach, a major feature of which was the success he and the club had in developing so many home-grown players.“After careful consideration of the review report, the RFL board concluded that a change of direction on the position of head coach was the next evolution alongside adopting several of the recommendations made. We are confident that one of the benefits of Shaun’s appointment will be to further build support for and belief in the national team from the rugby league community and know that he will work closely with the clubs within this process.“I’d like to place on record on behalf of the RFL and England and Great Britain Rugby League our thanks to Wayne Bennett for his immense contribution as our head coach over the last four years, when England reached the 2017 World Cup final and had an excellent home series win against New Zealand in 2018.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dd989f70bc471a8dd2970d87c5338501bb88af1/202_231_3187_1912/master/3187.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43149c7299aabb58c6cbe93cae804b02","title":"nike world athletics eluid kipchoge","story":"Stop me if you’ve heard this before. An athlete smashes the world record in special shoes that L’Équipe says act as “little trampolines” and Sports Illustrated warns “take advantage of the easygoing old rules”. But the athlete in question is not Eliud Kipchoge or Brigid Kosgei. And the shoes are not Nike Vaporflys, with their platforms that could have been borrowed from the Bay City Rollers.Instead the reports are from 1957, after the Russian Yuri Stepanov set a high jump world record in a shoe with a 4cm heel. It was so big, in fact, that it caused him to limp during his run‑up. But it worked. Stepanov had failed to qualify for the Melbourne Olympics. Yet suddenly the shoes, as one reporter colourfully put it at the time, allowed him to “emerge from mediocrity like a chorus girl hopping out of a paper cake”.But this is where 1957 and the modern day erge. For after Stepanov’s world record, athletics’ governing body promised to “take a stand”. And it did. For while the record stood, the heel height on jumping shoes was quickly limited to 13mm and the controversy soon faded.Do not expect the same closure in the Great Shoe Wars of the 2020s, despite World Athletics’ new regulations on Friday. In fact, the battle is rapidly moving to a second front: the track.You will have read the headlines. Nike’s controversial Vaporfly shoes, which typically improve marathon times in elite men by around 90 seconds, are officially legal. Meanwhile limits have been placed on the height of new shoes (40mm for road shoes, 30mm for track spikes) and the number of plates they have – and any swizzy new shoe tech must, from 30 April, be available in the shops before being used in a race. It means that the AlphaFly shoes worn by Kipchoge in his recent sub‑two‑hour marathon almost certainly do not comply. But pretty much everything else does – and that is good news for Nike.Over the past year its shoe technology has been changing the game on the track as well as on the road. And while some have claimed that under the new rules Laura Muir’s prototype spikes would be banned, that is not the case. Indeed Muir and her training partner Jemma Reekie wore them in an indoor 800m race on Saturday, where Reekie ran a remarkable 1min 57.91sec – not only a personal best by nearly four seconds but the fastest time indoors by any woman since 2006.Reekie’s time has catapulted the European under-23 champion into a genuine Olympic contender overnight. And, inevitably, there were questions on social media about whether she was wearing souped-up spikes. The shoes are indeed special. But, crucially, they seem to be legal. Andy Young, who coaches both athletes, tells me that, while they contain the special Pebax foam used in Kipchoge’s marathon shoes and a plastic plate, they meet all the new regulations.“These are not the carbon-plated spikes referenced online in pictures of patents,” he said, before confirming the spikes would shortly be available to buy.However, there are other prototype Nike shoes that appear far more space age – including ones worn by the Dutch athlete Sifan Hassan when she won world 10,000m and 1500m gold medals and others worn by the US runner Donavan Brazier last week.No one knows for sure about their status. But rival brands are certainly worried about how closely World Athletics will enforce its own regulations. The three years it took the governing body to make a decision on the Vaporflys makes many nervous – as does the close relationship between the organisation’s president, Seb Coe, and Nike. Another concern is that Nike has so many patents out on its technology that it will be hard to catch up. One source I spoke to reckoned that it was two years ahead of its rivals. And so the familiar issues remain: will major races on the road and on the track be decided by shoe brand rather than human endeavour?It has certainly happened before. At the 2016 US Olympic trials Kara Goucher finished fourth behind two athletes wearing Vaporfly prototypes disguised as normal running shoes, which may well have cost her a place in Rio.So what next? When I spoke to the scientist Geoffrey Burns, one of the world’s leading experts on shoe technology, he predicted more fireworks on the track. “The ruling for road-racing shoes made sense at 40mm, as that effectively included all current production models of racing shoes,” he said. “The spike rule, however, leaves an enormous space for future development.”What does that mean in practice? “The Nikes we saw last summer seem to be the first iteration of a spike that really deviates from convention,” he said. “It looks as if they extend the shoe with a forefoot air bladder andor more foam. It’s easy to see how those elements, with the right configuration and properties, could give a runner a mechanical advantage. So it’s back to the question – and everybody’s answer exists on a spectrum – are we OK with that?”And so here were are again, arguing about shoes and how much technology should be allowed. To paraphrase Winston Churchill: this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. It is, perhaps, the end of the beginning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23a01194f8769080986a0dd8103225ead4a9ea2b/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81114cc5e2be21ac9403640d313da473","title":"rugby union six nations talking points","story":"Eddie Jones made a selection mistake, Ireland count the cost of their bruising win and Wales start the post-Gatland era brightlyHowever Eddie Jones hoped England’s back row was going to go, it didn’t. The decision to pick Tom Curry out of position to cover for Billy Vunipola cost them twice over, because it meant they didn’t get the best out of their star flanker and also lacked a real ball-carrying threat at No 8. He has options, since Ben Earl and Lewis Ludlam are both in the squad and can cover the position, but given that he could have had one of Alex Dombrandt, Sam Simmonds, or Nathan Hughes playing there instead it might be time to admit he got this one plain wrong and pick a specialist to do it. Andy BullWell as the French played in the final quarter, when they came uncomfortably close to blowing it, was a reminder of just how young and inexperienced they are. They should sweep past Italy at home easily enough next week, so we’ll have to wait to the Test against Wales in the third round to get a clearer idea of exactly what they’re made of. They were hints of greatness about the way they played against England in the first hour here. If they can reproduce that form over the entire match when they’re in Cardiff, then everyone else really will have something to worry about. Andy Bull• France’s hellfire and brimstone crush Red Rose in a Can-Can cauldronAs an opening statement of Andy Farrell’s regime, it will do. But no more than that. Farrell was rightly delighted with Ireland’s grit, their absolute refusal to give up their line easily, no matter how inevitable the opposition’s crossing of it might seem. Elsewhere, there were too many technical errors for celebration, and the edge they yielded at the scrum was a concern as much as it was a surprise. Further, Ireland emerged with a list of wounded. Caelan Doris must be doubtful after his concussion. Garry Ringrose suffered a hand injury, and that chastened front row lost Tadhg Furlong and Andrew Porter. But another home match, this one against World Cup semi-finalists Wales, is more in line with what the doctor might order. Michael AylwinScotland remain a delight to watch, a nightmare to support. Few teams on the international circuit delight and enrage in such equal measure. Gregor Townsend hailed this latest exposition of exhilarating attacking rugby, but the sense there was nothing new to see here hung over his every utterance. Scotland, as always, lacked the discipline and nerve to make their bewitching approach play tell. There will be those who might start to question Townsend himself, but this trait feels so utterly ingrained in this era of Scottish rugby that it is doubtful blame for it can be laid at his door. A lack of punishing physical heft is also a factor, one common to any era in Scotland’s history of feisty underdogs. Michael AylwinAnother new coach but the same old result, 23 defeats and counting in the Six Nations. Franco Smith, in charge for the Six Nations as the Italian federation scours for a permanent successor to Conor O’Shea, was asked a question that recurs every tournament: do Italy justify their place in the championship? “I can understand there are questions around it,” he said. “It makes sense but what I know about Italian rugby and what is coming through – we beat Wales in the under-20 championship. There is a good group emerging. I would have not accepted this role if I did not believe Italy could step up. They can and they will.” When? Paul ReesWales 2.0: width, wit and wile. Wayne Pivac said that change from the Gatland years would be a slow burn, but the 42-0 victory over Italy, the first time Wales had kept their opponents pointless in the championship for 46 years, signalled a change in emphasis: kicking out of hand was more strategic rather than an invitation to take on a team that used defence as a means of attack and when boot was put to ball, they were prepared to kick it out of play. A comfortable victory, in which all five tries were scored by three-quarters, was not without its blemishes, not least in the scrum, and they will face a far greater test at the breakdown in Dublin on Saturday, but Nick Tompkins provided a spark in midfield and there remains a selfless quality about Wales, who rise to each challenge.

That’s the case for the Swallow the Sea company, which – for one day only – has broken out of its regular caravan theatre to play the Summerhall basement. At the end of the two 20-minute shows, Journey and Lamp, the performers blink out at the assembled hordes, overwhelmed by the numbers. They needn’t worry it’ll be a while before anyone accuses them of selling out.They’re here as part of Manipulate, the annual festival of visual theatre, which, having made the move across town from the Traverse, has exploited the rough-and-ready spaces of Summerhall to usher in a broader range of work, from the scratch to the accomplished. The opening Rising Voices programme on Saturday afternoon gave way to the evening’s heavy hitters to create a busy mix of object theatre, silent comedy, modern dance and the hard to define.Swallow the Sea’s shows take delicate steps into the imagination. Performed by Jemima Thewes, Journey is a shadow-puppet fable about a girl whisked into some treacherous netherworld. It’s a simple tale made special by the echoing Swahili love song Thewes sings unaccompanied. Lamp is also enhanced by otherworldly vocals, this time sung by Thewes and Jess Raine, in a witty riff on the visual potential of two lampshades. They create everything from visions of architectural elegance to squawking birds, discovering the erotic potential of lampshade fringes en route.Also fun is Blackout by Connor Bryson and Craig McCulloch, recent graduates in British Sign Language performance, who apply the double-takes of a silent movie to a dark comedy of corpse disposal. There’s room to develop their double act and work in a few more gags, but it’s full of potential.By some distance, the best show of the day is Ersatz by Collectif Aïe Aïe Aïe. Performed by Julien Mellano, it is a dazzlingly inventive exploration of the meeting point between man and machine. With a microphone sensitive enough to respond to the blink of an eye or the raising of an eyebrow, Mellano sits at a luminous desk creating a pulsating soundtrack – and waves of laughter – just by twitching his face.For all the wit, there are darker forces at play. This is a man stepping from an arts-and-crafts past into a digital future. His cardboard laptop lights up magically, controlled by a brain-like mouse. After a few deft cuts with a scalpel, he builds his own 3D headset to enjoy virtual-reality wildlife encounters. He is not just in thrall to technology but subsumed by it.Demonstrating the festival’s fluid genre boundaries, Katie Armstrong’s Sketches is a spirited promenade dance performance that fuses the chamber music of Bach with the electro beats of DJ Mariam Rezaei to accompany a set of closely synchronised solos and duets.Inclusiveness isn’t always a good thing, however: Transfigured by Oceanallover is an excruciating piece of punk street theatre in which a pack of human playing cards shuffle through an endless parade of meaningless poetry and song, as if brashness and extravagant medieval costumes alone could sustain a purposeful performance. It’s like being trapped with the extras from an Adam and the Ants video – one where they blew the budget before they could make any sense of the story – made worse by the thought of the effort that’s gone into such an unrewarding show."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c806a8508a51066ebdc1a32153b4c4d5ede13b9/0_0_2119_1271/master/2119.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dba38e560bdc93bd19c4e35624eadab0","title":"five ways to start enjoying your holiday before you even get there","story":"Holidays should be relaxing, but all too often they end up being incredibly stressful in the run-up. Travel writer Lizzie Pook shares her tips for starting your holiday as you mean to go onHave a planning partyIf there was ever an excuse for a party, a holiday is it, and there can be something quite ceremonial about plotting your annual escape from the drudgery of everyday life. So make an occasion of your holiday planning. Take care over it. Set some time aside, throw some snacks in the oven, round up your family, other half, group of friends, or pour yourself a glass of something fancy if you’re travelling solo, and actively brainstorm holiday activity ideas. If one of you fancies horse riding at sunset on a footprint-free beach – whack it on the list. Heard of a must-visit farm-to-table restaurant in that tiny French village you’re heading to? Get in touch with them see if you can make a reservation. You don’t have to plan everything to a tee (unless you’re a laminated itinerary kind of traveller, and that’s fine too), but making an occasion of plotting, and getting excited about your upcoming trip will make you value it (and the people you’re sharing it with) even more.Book through one providerIt can be tempting to take a scattergun approach to booking your holiday a train trip here, a hotel there. But booking through one provider not only makes the process less stressful and more streamlined, it also means that if you come up against any niggles along the way (such as last-minute cancellations or unforeseen delays), they are easily ironed out because one company is overseeing everything. With Brittany Ferries Holidays you can book it all – from ferry journeys to quaint rental gites – in one go, with sailings from Portsmouth, Poole and Plymouth to multiple ports on the picturesque west coast of Europe. It’s Abta-protected and offers everything from motorcycle tours and family camping holidays to disability-friendly trips and golfing breaks. So whether you’re off to Aquitaine or País Vasco, keep it together, your stress levels will thank you.Go slowWe’re talking slow travel here: trains, two feet and ferries. The slow travel movement is gaining (snail-paced) momentum right now, with many tour operators, travel experts and trend forecasters citing it as one of the biggest developments for 2020. And it’s not just better for the environment to sidestep carbon-heavy air travel and opt for a slow, satisfying glug of a journey instead. Not only do you gain a new appreciation for a landscape by walking or driving, but sailing to your destination by ferry means you can load up your car with all your essentials, instead of attempting to squeeze everything you need into a woefully tiny carry-on bag. So there’s far less packing-induced stress, and far more space for novelty pool inflatables. Win, win.Make a destination-based reading listThe buildup to a holiday can be almost as exciting as the holiday itself the so-close-you-can-almost-touch-it anticipation of shortbread-coloured beaches, peacock blue seas and the gentle flutter of the warm breeze on your skin. Get yourself firmly in the mood by reading books based on or set in your chosen destination. Heading to Spain? Try the off-kilter Hot Milk by Deborah Levy or Chris Stewart’s Driving Over Lemons. Pick up Circe by Madeline Miller if you’re planning a trip to Greece, or dip back into Louis de Bernières’ fantastically evocative Captain Corelli’s Mandolin to be transported straight to sun-scorched Kefalonia. And if a ferry trip to France is in the offing, ramp up the excitement by rereading Joanne Harris’ fantastically cosy Chocolat, or the wonderfully complex All the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr.Get the right insuranceIt may not sound glamorous, but ensuring you’re covered against anything that might befall you on your holiday (and in the preceding days and weeks) will give you the peace of mind to really relax and enjoy the buildup. A European health insurance card doesn’t cover your belongings, travel delays or cancellations, so it’s crucial to sort insurance before you travel. While you’re sorting that out, don’t forget to organise your European vehicle breakdown cover at the same time too. So whether you need emergency medical assistance after an accident, or simply don’t fancy being stranded on the side of the road in a remote rural French village with nothing but chattering birds and the slow drone of bumblebees for company, then do your future holidaying self a favour sort your insurance before you go."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8104590a3bacd49905447494648e16a8745c5663/0_115_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f3b6b1265f6d36477bc5c0d67e727e5","title":"support local businesses and six other ways to be a responsible tourist","story":"If you’d like to make sure your 2020 summer holiday has less of a negative impact on the planet, follow these seven simple tips ...More and more of us are faced with a dilemma: how do we explore the world without contributing to the destruction of the places and communities we’re visiting?The answer? Responsible tourism – a movement that encourages us to travel in a more conscious, sustainable way. From how you reach your destination to how you treat the people and environment once you arrive, there are dozens of ways to make your trip more mindful. And the good news is, being a responsible tourist comes with its perks, and can make for a much more meaningful and enjoyable trip.Here’s your rough guide to responsible tourism ...Skip the tourist hotspotsYou’ve been to Paris five times before and it’s teeming with tourists – so why not head to Nantes, set on the banks of the Loire, instead? Smaller, less well-known cities are often packed with just as much charm, history and culture, and are keen to welcome visitors. Barcelona is another famous city that’s suffering from overtourism – so much so that there have been protests by locals. So if you’re looking for a stylish Spanish getaway, head to Santander. The belle époque capital of verdant Cantabria is a real foodie hub, and a world away from other Spanish coastal spots.Support the local economyOne of the best ways to help the places you love is by supporting them financially. There are dozens of ways you can do this, from frequenting family-run shops and restaurants to using local tour guides and services. Another great way to support the local economy is to seek out independently owned places to stay. Brittany Ferries Holidays, for example, offers lots of locally run accommodation options – from boutique hotels and charming B\u0026ampBs to coastal campsites and self-catering villas.Leave no traceIt’s a message we hear again and again, but somehow when we are abroad it slips to the back of our minds. Whether it’s the temptation to collect shells from the beach, to pack a picnic filled with single-use plastic, or to seal a romantic moment by fixing a love lock on a bridge – it’s vital that you think about the effect your actions will have on that place once you’ve left. The best thing you can do for the landscapes you love is leave them exactly as you found them.Have a little respectMuch as you might want to take that arty shot of the little old lady buying her apples in the market, she may not appreciate becoming the star of your social media post. Just as you probably don’t like to be photographed going about your daily life, chances are neither do the people living in the places you visit. Maybe zoom out a bit and take a general shot or, if you want to snap a market display, buy a few things from the stallholder first. A little modesty when entering a place of worship goes a long way, as does a “good morning” as you pass someone in the street, if that’s what the locals do. Become part of the community and you’ll enjoy a much more authentic experience.Learn a bit of the local language None of us wants to be that tourist, so it’s worth swotting up on a few words of the local language before you depart. Often a simple “hola” or a “merci” will put a smile on someone’s face and show that you are at least trying. If your language skills take a nosee after that first introduction, all will be forgiven because you showed a little courtesy. Feeling ambitious? Attempt to learn a few simple phrases and test them out in shops and restaurants. Who knows, you might even end up making some memorable connections with locals.Eat local, eat seasonalThis is undoubtedly one of the most pleasurable ways to be a responsible tourist. After all, what could be better than dining on truffle-infused dishes in France in January, or the freshest of seafood paellas on the sunny Spanish coast? Make your food choices count don’t just hit the supermarket, shop at the local market to support farmers in the region, and dine in restaurants where they serve seasonal produce and the catch of the day fresh off the local fishermen’s boats. It keeps the local economy going, cuts down on food miles, and often involves ingredients that are exposed to far fewer chemicals and pesticides.Keep it greenEven the smallest things can have a positive impact on the environment. Take a reusable water bottle with you instead of buying endless plastic ones. Choose environmentally friendly sun cream, so you cause less damage when you swim in the sea. And if you’re looking to make a more significant difference, explore alternative ways of reaching your destination. Ferries, trains and even driving all result in fewer carbon emissions than travelling by plane, and can result in a far more exciting and memorable journey. And if you want to go even further, consider offsetting your carbon emissions once you return."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6133b0c61ec42c6831047a70046a5951cdb66278/0_126_1722_1033/master/1722.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bdf8a10383d178af37cb2d29144d3e2a","title":"the art of slow travel the journey is just as important as the destination","story":"Forget last-minute dashes to the airport, ticking off top 10 sights and desperately searching for that perfect Instagram snap – the future of travel is slowWhen was the last time you really slowed down?

Step on to a ferry, for example, and sail to your destination of choice. Gaze out at that wide expanse and try to remember the last time you saw such an uncluttered view, just you and the horizon.You can even make it an overnight trip – after all, what’s the rush? Is there any better way to disconnect than by reading a good book with a sea view, enjoying a meal then retreating to your cabin to be rocked to sleep by the sea?Back on dry ground, modes of slow travel range from your own two feet to two wheels. There is nothing like a hike or bike ride through pristine scenery to set the heart soaring. Head off the beaten track and you could find yourself in a village where nobody speaks your language, where you have to negotiate menus scrawled by hand and sip on the local table wine served up in hearty jugs. And it could well be the best meal you’ve ever tasted.You can slow travel through mountains and forests or along coastlines, reconnecting with nature – but slow travel in cities is just as rewarding. The tangled streets of old towns are perfect for getting lost and discovering unexpected little squares. The chances are, in one of these squares you’ll find a slice of original slow life taking place – old men sat on benches catching up on the day’s news, women in tiny corner cafes enjoying a drink and a snack.The car may not feel slow, but try to beat that sense of freedom when you drive off a ferry in your chosen destination and can simply put a pin in a map and head off to explore. Spend days wending your way through country lanes to visit towns and villages, perhaps the odd vineyard or castle. Stay in an old converted farmhouse here, a cosy family-run boutique hotel there.In slow travel there are no specific rules. The aim is simply to enjoy authentic experiences, to push pause on all the stresses and pressures of modern life and treasure those little moments.For you, slow travel could be spending more days in one place, really getting to the heart of it, or choosing to stay in locally run accommodation. It can mean dining on wonderful locally sourced produce, the conviviality of a shared experience, or simply leaving city life behind and reconnecting with nature.Whether you are literally travelling slowly – hopping on a ferry instead of taking a flight, for example – or simply taking on some of the slow travel ideas (there’s nothing slow about mountain biking, but that uplifting feeling of being surrounded by nature and breathing in crisp, fresh air certainly fits in with the movement’s ethos), slow travel is the antidote to modern life.So the next time you’re planning a trip, make it a slow one. Wander, explore and lose yourself. Savour those fleeting little moments of perfection. Give yourself the journey to truly unwind. Relax and press reset.That’s what the slow travel movement is all about."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f772e52a6e06d71b2644d4ed3fa9e301fb03fcd3/0_746_2566_1539/master/2566.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c7468f80498be934d7a739f40905860","title":"my favourite family holiday summer fun adventure uk europe","story":"Memories of summer fun and family adventures come flooding back to our tipsters as they recall halcyon days on the beach, under canvas and on the roadFamily holidays for us require three things: fantastic food, guaranteed sun and something different. San Stefanos on Corfu provides all three and much more. Instead of hiring a car to get around, rent a small motor boat from the beach and spend the days hopping from bay to bay, discovering little coves and deserted beaches as you explore. Greek Night at Nikolas’s Taverna gets even reluctant teenagers on their feet, and Taverna Agni, right on the beach, provides something a little more grown-up – its chilli prawns are a must.Isobel KnightI spent the summers of my youth in Super-Besse, a village at the foot of Puy de Sancy mountain, surrounded by extinct volcanoes and the mysterious yet peaceful Lac Pavin. The name comes from the Latin pavens, meaning fearing or worried, due to its various legends including one referring to a dragon. In reality, it has scientific explanations from underground stream and gas reactions. I loved breakfasts in the chalet overlooking Lac des Hermines, with its green scenery. We then hiked the mountain, picking blueberries, before fooling around in the snow at the top in our T-shirts! My all-time favourite cheese was mature Saint-Nectaire, for its stinging taste.• auvergne-sancyArinnaWe planned our campervan trip with two teenagers down the Italian coast, from the French border to Rome, avoiding expensive toll motorways, with the freedom to stay as long as we wanted if we liked somewhere, and save a fortune on hotels. The kids learned to cook pasta sauces from friends they made. We swam on the free beaches when we could and often parked our van in clearings or on quiet country roads. In fact, we liked the bays and beaches on both sides of Genoa so much that we never made it to the Eternal City! We will leave that for another road trip next year.Peter RileyWe had an amazing adventure travelling around Jutland last summer. We loved the huge, windy beaches of Rømø island, where we stayed in a small cabin on a campsite. The iron age village of Hjemsted nearby was a highlight, and the kids had a really fun day in the Lego House in Billund. Aarhus, Denmark’s second city, was fantastic for culture, and the coast up in Skagen was perfect for beach time and exploring. We drove to Denmark from Leeds, via the ferry from Harwich to Hook of Holland. All our accommodation, including places breaking the journey in Germany on the way and the Netherlands on the way back, was self catering via Airbnb.Catherine BorseThe small town of Puerto Pollença in northern Mallorca is the perfect destination when travelling with small children. The beach has crystal- clear shallow waters for paddling, and playgrounds are dotted along the way. Pine Walk is a mesmerising pedestrianised path on the water’s edge which is great for spotting aquatic wildlife. Child-friendly restaurants are plentiful, though we sometimes opted for a takeaway paella from Restaurante Brisas on Passeig d’Anglada. The budget family-friendly Flora Aparthotel apartments are well- equipped and only a five-minute walk to the beach, restaurants and Pine Walk. Prices start at €59 a night for a family of four.Jess BowlesEyes lit up at the first glimpse of our travel-weary backpacking family’s paradise – the Lavanta Hotel in Bodrum. From our hillside apartment a bougainvillea path led to a pool overlooking azure seas. Home-baked fare (“Cake for breakfast, Mum?”) was partaken alongside tortoises munching pink petals hand-fed them by the kids. Family-friendly walks by olive tree-lined roads to the marina to devour (almost) an enormous plate of delicious ugly fish. Then to nearby Bodrum Museum of Underwater Archaeology for Phoenician amphorae, Roman jewellery and the Knights of St John castle. Lynda PenningtonThe Isle of Wight is great for family holidays across the generations – we range in age from 10 to 81 and regularly visit. We’ve just booked for 10 of us to stay in Freshwater on the western tip of the island. We enjoy the beaches, old-school seaside resorts, cycling, riding and places to visit like Osborne House and the Needles. I particularly like Dimbola, the former home of the Victorian pioneer photographer Julia Cameron, which has great photography exhibitions and in its permanent collection a book about the Isle of Wight festival by my cousin Rod Allen, who died recently, so that feels like a family connection as well.Chris AllenSince my children were babies we’ve been to Folk Camps every summer. They’re great-value, green holidays, held at different beautiful UK countryside or coastal locations each year – like a mini private festival for 120 people! My children are now young adults and still love Folk Camps as they’ve made such great friends over the years. There are lots of workshops to take part in, a cèilidh every evening with lots of fun dancing, and the chance to sing, tell a joke or play a tune if you want – or just sit back and enjoy the music. Three meals a day and snacks are all included, so you’ll barely need to spend any other money. • Adults £308 a week, child prices vary by age, under-5s free (weekend breaks also available), folkcampsHelen SelfLooking for a holiday with a difference?

If they have children, then they’re not telling their children anything.”Smith, 46, who got his bachelor’s degree after getting released from prison said he had been closely following the caucuses and has been going to rallies and encouraging others to caucus, even though he can’t.A few miles north, Gretchen Brown-Waech was getting ready for a historic caucus designed to serve another community often sidelined in the political dialogue: the 300,000 voting-age Iowans with disabilities.For decades the population has struggled to take part in the caucuses, which requires Iowans to physically show up at a location and spend hours choosing a candidate. Brown-Waech, who is deaf, first tried to caucus in the 1990s, but when people started talking over each other, she found it overwhelming and left early. She didn’t try again until 2016 with the help of a friend because she felt the choice was so important.Now, on Monday, after pressing state Democratic party officials, Brown-Waech is leading the first ever Iowa caucus in American Sign Language. She expects about 20 people to come to the event on Monday, some from hours away, including a deaf couple in their 60s that has never voted. “Anytime anyone who is not part of the mainstream is shut out of the political process, our country loses,” said Brown-Waech. “If we don’t design something for people on the margins, someone will always be left out.”Since 2016, advocates have been pushing the Iowa Democratic party to address obstacles like transportation, navigating crowded spaces, and seating that people with disabilities face to caucusing. The party has introduced some solutions – like allowing some groups to hold satellite caucuses in their homes or accessible locales.“We’ve made it easier for Iowans to request accommodations, get in the room faster, and caucus at a site that’s more convenient to them,” said Mandy McClure, a spokesperson for the Iowa Democratic party, in a statement. “Expanding participation has been at the heart of all of these changes.”But many advocates say the party’s approach has been abysmal, noting that a staffer handling disability outreach wasn’t hired until January.“Because there’s such a lack of understanding about this constituency, not only in the Democratic party, but just systematically, there’s a reticence to engage in the process of making spaces more inclusive and accessible,” said Reyma McDeid, executive director of the Central Iowa Center for Independent Living. “The thought is, ‘it’s going to be confusing, it’s going to be expensive. It’s going to be time consuming. Let’s just put this off.’”That places undue burden on people with disabilities to create their own caucuses, said Emmanuel Smith, a disability rights advocate who works at Disability Rights Iowa. Smith, who has brittle bone disease and uses an electric wheelchair, said they had to travel over an hour each way to caucus in 2016.This year, Smith is hosting a caucus event at their house. But they’ve had to spend time learning the rules for caucuses and on Monday, they will have to leave work early to set up. “The very people who need their voices heard the most in our democratic system are facing all these barriers. They’re often the populations that are going to be directly threatened or bolstered by the policies that get implemented,” Smith said.As Monday approached, Brown-Waech worked on the final touches to the American Sign Language caucus she was planning. She was making sure that people knew to arrive on time and wanted to make a video explaining how it would work for the attendees, but had yet to receive their information from the state Democratic party.Brown-Waech is hoping her single ASL caucus will evolve to be 15 or 20 during the next time around. But for the men in YMCA room, the ability to participate remains out of reach.While Iowa governor Kim Reynolds, a Republican, supports a constitutional amendment to end the policy, a push to put it on the ballot failed last year. Reynolds has declined to follow the lead of the governors of Kentucky and Virginia in issuing an executive order to automatically restore voting rights to some people with felonies once they complete their sentences. Currently, the only way for someone to have their voting rights restored is to have Reynolds approve their right to vote on an inidual basis after they’ve completed their sentences entirely, including probation and parole.Over the last month, Reynolds’ office has reviewed more than 400 applications, a sliver of the population in question. Until there’s a sweeping reform, Iowa will continue to leave out tens of thousands of people. People like Aundrey Roberts, 44, who was released in 2017 and has never voted in his life.“It sends the message that once you’re a felon you basically are nothing,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5654ca330bdbf10c091f23c875ec1026660ef141/0_210_5564_3338/master/5564.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c41198a50b3da6a522f28a7f5c021340","title":"iowa caucuses democratic candidates make final pitches","story":"Polling shows no clear frontrunner in tight race as four Democratic candidates are knotted together at the topAfter more than a year of ideological clashes and policy debates, voters in the midwestern state of Iowa are set to have their say on which Democratic presidential candidate they believe is best positioned to defeat Donald Trump in November’s election.Hundreds of thousands of Iowans will gather in high school gymnasiums, local libraries and church basements on Monday night to participate in the Iowa caucuses, the first official nominating contest of the 2020 primary race.Recent polling has provided a consistent snapshot in the closing weeks of a tight race with no clear frontrunner. Four of the eleven remaining Democratic candidates are knotted together at the top – former vice-president Joe Biden, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren and former mayor Pete Buttigieg – and more than half of caucus-goers say they are still open to changing their minds.On 3 February, the midwestern state of Iowa will kick off the long process of choosing the Democratic party’s presidential nominee, who will take on Donald Trump in the US election in November.\u0026nbspMost US states hold primary elections, in which voters go to a polling place, mail in their ballots or otherwise vote remotely. But a handful of states hold caucuses – complicated, hours-long meetings with multiple rounds of balloting until one candidate emerges as victor.Both Democratic and Republican caucuses will take place on 3 February. But because Trump doesn\u0027t face any serious Republican challengers, all eyes will be on the Democratic contest.\u0026nbspPut simply, Iowans aged 18 (at the time of the November 3 election) and over who are registered Democrats will gather in caucus sites (school gyms, churches, community halls) in their designated precinct, and vote with their feet by splitting into groups based on their preferred candidate.\u0026nbspOn the night, the candidate with the most SDEs is considered the winner.Iowans famously take this responsibility seriously, and since 2000, every Democratic winner of the Iowa caucuses has gone on to win the party’s nomination. But the prospect of four more years of a president Democratic voters view as singularly dangerous has added to the pressure. Their choice will reward one candidate – or possibly multiple – an early advantage as they compete in primaries across the rest of the nation.After a yearlong leadup shaped by ideological clashes and a contest of ideas over issues of healthcare, climate change and income inequality, the leading candidates spent the weekend crisscrossing the state to make their final appeals.“I respectfully suggest, not because I’m running, but because of the man who’s president, you’ve never had a greater responsibility than you have today,” Biden told a crowd of more than a thousand people his at his final campaign rally on Sunday in a Des Moines middle school gym.Biden has pitched himself as a steady pair of hands and the strongest choice against Trump, a view that polling suggests is shared by a large constituency of Democrats, particularly among African American voters who play a critical role in later primary contests. But he faces competition for moderate voters from Buttigieg, the 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who has risen from relative anonymity to the top of the field.“In looking at the lessons of history, our party wins when we have a nominee who is looking to the future,” Buttigieg told reporters in English – and in French – on Saturday drawing a thinly veiled distinction between himself and the rest of the leading candidates, all of whom are older than 70.Warren, a former public school teacher and Harvard law professor turned senator, has pitched herself as an unabashed liberal with an arsenal of detailed policy proposals for “big structural change”. But in recent days she’s sought to emphasize what her allies argue is her unique capacity to unite and excite Democrats from both ideological factions as she also confronts doubts that a woman can beat Trump.“We will – we must – come together as a party and defeat Donald Trump,” Warren told voters at a gymnasium in Cedar Rapids. “And I’ve got a plan for that.”On Saturday night, Sanders, whose 2016 presidential campaign helped reshape the policy debate on the left, held a concert in Cedar Rapids with musical guest star Vampire Weekend. The event drew more than 3,000 people, according to the campaign, which claimed it was the “largest rally any presidential candidate has held in Iowa this cycle” and a sign of their building momentum. Recent polling shows the Vermont senator has consolidated support among the party’s most liberal voters and edges past his rivals in state and national surveys.On 3 February, voters in the midwestern state of Iowa will kick off the long process that will eventually choose the Democratic party’s presidential nominee, who will take on Donald Trump in November\u0027s US election.The primaries and caucuses are a series of contests, in all 50 US states plus Washington DC and outlying territories, by which each party selects its presidential nominee.Iowa is extremely influential in US elections because, since 1972, it has voted first. After months of campaigning, this will be the first chance to see what support each of the presidential candidates actually have among voters.Winning Iowa matters because it can give candidates a huge boost in momentum and name recognition before the other states cast their votes. Underdogs can triumph, and frontrunners can fall. Since 2000, every Democratic winner of the Iowa caucuses has gone on to win the party’s nomination.Meanwhile, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang predicted that his performance in the caucuses would “shock” the nation. And not contesting in Iowa is former New York mayor and billionaire, Michael Bloomberg, who has already spent more than $100m on a gamble that he will win big in later contests.The impeachment of Trump upended travel for Sanders, Warren and Klobuchar, who were required to be in Washington during the Senate trial, where Republicans are poised to acquit the president this week. That leaves the fate of the presidency in the hands of the nearly one dozen Democratic hopefuls left in the race.“If the Senate is the jury right now, we are the jury tomorrow,” Buttigieg said in an appearance on Meet the Press on Sunday. “However frustrating it is to watch that process, you can’t switch it off, you can’t walk away, and you can’t give up.”Republican caucuses will also take place on Monday night, but as Trump faces no serious challengers for the nomination, all eyes will be on Democrats. In a bit to take back some of the limelight, White House officials, cabinet secretaries, members of Congress and Christian evangelicals will be in the Hawkeye state on Monday to offer voters a stark reminder of who and what the Democratic candidate will be up against.“This will be the strongest, best-funded, and most organized presidential campaign in history,” said Brad Parscale, Trump 2020 campaign manager, last week. “We are putting the Democrats on notice – good luck trying to keep up with this formidable re-election machine.”Additional reporting: David Smith in Des Moines"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3874c48b60c19700154945c030a400899b62a52e/0_112_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f36dd7b83a1122fa74359f71b9e6aa1c","title":"galapagos experts find a tortoise related to lonesome george","story":"Thirty tortoises partially descended from extinct species found, including one of same species as famed inidualConservationists working around the largest volcano on the Galápagos Islands say they have found 30 giant tortoises partially descended from two extinct species, including that of the famed Lonesome George.The Galápagos national park and Galápagos Conservancy said one young female had a direct line of descent from the Chelonoidis abingdonii species of Pinta island. The last of those tortoises was Lonesome George, who died in June 2012 and was believed to be more than 100 years old.Another 11 males and 18 females were from the Chelonoidis niger line of Floreana island.The 45-member expedition was working around the Wolf volcano on Isabela island. It said pirates and whalers had taken tortoises from other islands in the archipelago and left them near the volcano.Those found during the latest expedition were hybrids descended from both the extinct and other species.The Galápagos is a volcanic archipelago and province of Ecuador in the Pacific Ocean. The islands, whose variety of endemic species helped inspire Charles Darwin, were home to 15 closely related species of tortoise, according to the Conservancy, which estimates that 20,000-25,000 wild tortoises live there. At least four of the species are considered extinct.

Photograph: Nick BradshawA reader called Elizabeth took out a health insurance with Laya Healthcare at the start of January 2017 on “a bargain-basement plan” and a year later she upgraded it to a better one.In January 2019, she moved to another plan with the company and then at the start of this year upgraded her health insurance again.“In 2018 I had a niggling pain in my right shoulder-blade and couldn’t raise my arm fully above my head,” she writes. “I spoke to the GP in September and he sent me for an MRI. That came back fairly normal and I went for some physio sessions for ‘frozen shoulder’.”Then last year Elizabeth had “much worse pain, at the front of my shoulder and down my arm”.She went back to the doctor in late April and he said he would send her to a consultant at the Hermitage.“I called Laya and was told I could see the consultant there. On a call yesterday they said that I was told at that point I wouldn’t be covered if I became an in-patient at a private hospital. I don’t remember that, but it’s certainly possible. I didn’t think it was going to be an issue, I never thought I’d need surgery,” she writes.She saw the consultant last July and had an ultrasound last August followed by a cortisone injection.‘Unfortunate’Elizabeth called Laya in November to ask if she was covered for the procedure and was told that she was but would have to pay an excess of €500 if she was in overnight and €149 for day case.“That was fine, I knew that was the case with my policy. I distinctly remember the lady I spoke to asking when symptoms started, and saying that I was covered as long as I didn’t have symptoms before January 2017, when I took out my health insurance with Laya.”She was scheduled for surgery on last Tuesday at the Bon Secours Glasnevin. “I am booked to be in overnight but was told I can go home if I’m feeling well. I was told I would need to take two weeks off work, so I have been working over-time in the past couple of weeks to have everything covered. My partner planned to take two days off so that he could help me in the early stages.“I only received my letter from the hospital yesterday. It stressed that checking insurance was my responsibility and gave the code again. I was sure everything was fine but I had changed my plan (upgraded though) so thought I should just double check.“I spoke to a lady who said I was not covered, as it’s a pre-existing condition from 2018. My current plan would cover it, but not until a two year waiting period has passed. So I’m not covered until January 2021.“I explained that I had been told otherwise on my November call, and had only proceeded because of that. She said she would check and come back to me, which she did, after half an hour or so. She and a supervisor had gone back over previous communications. She said I shouldn’t have been told I could have the procedure and that she appreciated it was unfortunate.”ErrorLaya insisted that she was told in April that she didn’t have private cover so should have known. “I can’t remember the April call, I had forgotten there had even been one but I know that what I called about then was seeing the consultant not surgery.“My November call was about surgery, with the exact code of the procedure, and they said it was covered. I know mistakes happen, and this obviously was one, but it really is a mess.”She said she did not have a way of knowing how much her treatment would be delayed by because of the mistake “but if I had been on the correct list, for the correct hospital, I imagine I would have been seen sooner and without all the stress. I am in so much pain. The thought of waiting much longer for the operation is unbearable really.”We contacted the company and they said that Elizabeth had been told in error last November that the procedure would be covered. The company accepted that it was its mistake and while she was not covered for the procedure they agreed to make an exception.The full statement from Laya reads: “While rare, mistakes do happen unfortunately and on this occasion we gave our member incorrect information regarding her cover when she rang us. We’ve contacted the member to apologise and assure her that we will fully cover her upcoming procedure. We hope it all goes well and will follow up with her to ensure she gets all the support she needs to make a speedy recovery.”Last Tuesday, our reader had the surgery and she got in touch with us after it had taken place to say that all was well.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4160155.1580727616!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus new test with faster results available in ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIndian medical staff wearing full protective suits hold medical waste as they exit from a coronavirus isolated ward in Keral,  India.

Photograph: Alex PlavevskiEPAA passenger who arrived in Dublin Airport and was suspected of having the coronavirus has tested negative for the disease.The passenger, who was placed in isolation after arriving in Dublin Airport on Saturday from Moscow, was tested yesterday by the National Virus Reference Laboratory in UCD.The NVRL has in recent days acquired the ability to test for the new coronavirus previously, test samples had to be sent to the UK, where the turnaround time for results was up to 48 hours.The Health Service Executive confirmed there are no confirmed cases of the virus in Ireland as of Monday morning, and that testing is now operational at the NVRL.With the death of a 44-year-old Chinese inidual in the Philippines at the weekend, the first fatality outside China the death toll from the virus has reached 305, with 14,564 cases now confirmed, health authorities said on Sunday.The head of the World Health Organisation’s emergency team, Dr Mike Ryan said he has “every confidence” public health authorities in Ireland are making the right preparations for the virus.“We handled Sars quite well and sensitively,” the Geneva-based Sligoman told The . “A key thing is for doctors and emergency departments to be in a position to be alert for, and to detect, cases.”With China’s stock markets preparing to re-open on Monday after an extended Lunar New Year holiday, there is growing nervousness about the impact of the crisis on the country’s economy.Suspected caseThe passenger in Ireland’s first-known suspected case was removed from Dublin Airport by ambulance after arriving from Russia.Other passengers were told in leaflets they had been “on a flight with a possible case of novel coronavirus” and were advised to “avoid contact with other people as much as possible tonight”.They were due to be contacted by a public health doctor on Sunday.They were also told to stay at home or in their hotel room if they became ill, “especially with cough, sore throat, breathlessness or high temperature”, and to phone a doctor or 999, mentioning that they had been on the flight.Under existing procedures, airline pilots are required to radio ahead to ground staff where a medical emergency arises involving a passenger, so that the person can receive immediate medical attention on landing.The Department of Health and the HSE declined to provide any information about the incident and the department said that as part of the response to the virus, it will not be providing information about the activation of protocols “other than confirmed cases”.ProfilingSpeaking on Saturday, Dr Ryan warned against profiling specific groups when checking for cases.“I’m conscious that we over-associate this disease with China. This is the country where it emerged, true, but it could have emerged anywhere.”The swine flu epidemic started in Mexico, and Ebola in the Congo, he points out.“China needs our solidarity right now, and recognition of what they’ve done to fight this. We need to work closely with them.”“This is a time for facts, not fear. A time for solidarity, not stigma.”He also pointed out: “There’s a much higher chance in Ireland of getting flu and, if you’re not vaccinated against flu, that translates into a bigger risk of getting sick and dying.”While some countries are operating temperature tests on passengers arriving at airports, Ryan says the WHO does not support entry screening, and considers exit screening more effective.“If it is used as part of a broader set of measures, that’s fine, but entry screening alone is certainly not enough. You can’t just put up a few thermal cameras. The real point of entry for cases is probably in the GP surgery or the emergency department, when someone shows up.”Hand hygiene is more useful in preventing the spread of the virus than wearing face masks, he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4160198.1580733014!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 twin pressures for fianna f%C3%A1il candidate catherine ardagh","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                             Fianna Fáil election candidate  Catherine Ardagh is pictured with  her five week old twins Seán and Darragh Óg and Christabelle Feeney in Crumlin, Dublin.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe .The timing of the general election could hardly be less favourable for Fianna Fáil’s Dublin South Central candidate Catherine Ardagh. The Senator gave birth to twins Darragh Óg and Seán on December 29th after what she describes as a “serious operation” in the Coombe Hospital. On Sunday the twis sit in their car seats, dummies in mouth, beside teddy bears dressed in Fianna Fáil colours in the offices of Ardagh’s company, Ardagh McCabe Solicitors in Crumlin, which is doubling as a campaign headquarters. When Ardagh found out she was pregnant last April, she anticipated that an election would occur some time in April or May of this year - plenty of time to make childcare arrangements. Events, though, intervened and the Taoiseach called an election for a time not of his choosing, and certainly not of Ardagh’s. “Absolutely delighted,” she says ironically when asked for her view on the February 8th polling date. “You have to deal with whatever comes your way.” To add to the frenetic atmosphere, Ardagh’s husband Darragh McShea is Fianna Fáil’s assistant general secretary. “We are likes ships in the night,” she says, adding that the boy’s grandmothers have been a big help. Ardagh says people have been supportive. One exception is independent candidate Alan Kerrigan. Nobody in political circles had heard of Kerrigan, who claims to have been born in the constituency and to have held senior positions in some tech firms. He has had plenty to say to fellow candidates in Dublin South Central, particularly Ardagh, who he claimed the electorate deserved an answer from about any plans she had to take maternity leave after the election. BizarreHis approach did not go down well on social media, but it’s not a forum Ardagh takes seriously. “I know nothing about him whatsoever. I had never heard of him. It’s kind of bizarre,” she says. Ardagh says she plans to put the twins into the creche in Leinster House that’s “if I get elected and if I can get a place. It’s very hard to get into I believe”. And if she doesn’t get elected? “I have to come back to work anyway because I’m self-employed. I never really thought about maternity leave,” she says. “One way or the other, I’ll be going back to work. Sorry Alan to burst your bubble.” Ardagh says that if she is elected to the Dáil, she will campaign for a State-funded crèche system so mothers are able to return to work after their maternity leave ends. It’s an ambitious plan that is not in Fianna Fáil’s manifesto. “Women going back to work are paying lots of tax. It pays for itself. It doesn’t make sense not to do it. They’re sitting at home on unpaid leave. We need to be much more radical. It doesn’t make sense to crucify families.”  Ardagh came agonisingly close in 2016 to winning the Dáil seat held by her father, Seán Ardagh, between 2002 and 2011. The count went on for four days and she finally lost by 35 votes to People Before Profit’s Bríd Smith. Family matters soon put her loss in perspective as her father was terminally ill from Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and died three months after the election. “We could tell that he wasn’t in great form, that it was rearing its head again. In previous times when there was a count on, he would be scrutinising every vote. He just didn’t have the energy for it.” She was then elected to the Seanad’s Industrial and Commercial Panel and was appointed Fianna Fáil’s leader in the Upper House. It was a bitter sweet time. “He didn’t come into the Seanad, but he was aware and compos mentis when I was elected. He was in a hospice at the time.”‘People’s Republic’Ardagh is standing in a constituency dubbed the ‘People’s Republic of Dublin South-Central’ due to its left-wing tendencies. Three of its four outgoing TDs are from the left - Sinn Féin’s Aengus Ó Snodaigh, Independent Joan Collins and Smith. The seat of Fine Gael Minister of State Catherine Byrne is regarded as vulnerable and the Green Party’s Cllr Patrick O’Connell is seen as one to watch in the constituency, which has a large transitory population and a lot of residential turnover.Only Ó Snodaigh’s seat is regarded as safe, and Ardagh should have a better than average chance of being elected based on the poll numbers. Housing is the big issue in the constituency, she says, and this is borne out on the doorsteps in Perrystown. Even in this settled suburb, those with homes fret for those who are without. One woman says she has two children abroad and wonders will they get housing if they return. Another, a teacher, says it is hard to get younger colleagues into her school. The biggest housing issue in the constituency is the redevelopment of St Michael’s Estate in Inchicore, a flagship programme for the outgoing Government’s “cost rental” scheme. The plan was to build 420 homes and rent them at affordable prices. This provoked an unseemly spat between the Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy and Byrne, who said the proposal would bring a transitory population to the area. The project is yet to go ahead. Ardagh says she will support the St Michael’s proposal if elected. “As politicians, if we really want to sort the housing crisis, we are going to have to let nimbyism slide. If you look at every constituency you will find examples of sitting TDs or senators coming out against certain housing developments. We need to be generous in allowing social and housing developments be constructed across the city.” In that spirit, she says there is no appetite on the doorstep for tax cuts and the electorate are prioritising spending on public services.“I think people are a lot less greedy than you give them credit for. We have everything. People aren’t as flash these days which is very welcome.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4159309.1580657195!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 as a minority in a country you need to participate","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Labour Party general election candidate Kamal Uddin with the trees he gives to people while canvassing in Castlebar, Co Mayo. Photograph: Keith HeneghanKamal Uddin first ran in a general election in 2016 as an independent. Four years later the Bangladeshi-born business owner is back on the Mayo ticket as a Labour candidate.Canvassing for a second general election is much easier than the first time, says Mr Uddin, who has lived in Ireland for more than two decades and runs a petrol station in Castlebar.“I’m going back to the same people and they accept me. They see that I’m a hard worker and believe in my desire for change.”Mr Uddin says he joined the Labour party last year because of their focus on “building equality in society”. A small number of people have reacted badly when he knocks on their doors but the majority are accepting of a political candidate from a different background.“There were maybe one or two negatives when they see you’re from a different background with a different skin colour. But 99 per cent of Mayo people are very accepting and there’s no racism towards me. Mayo is going to show in this election that there’s no room for racism, it doesn’t matter what colour you are.”Instead of handing out leaflets outlining his policy commitments, Mr Uddin has been distributing birch saplings, which he encourages constituents to plant in their gardens. “We have to think about the next generation environmentally. I have a plan to plant 5,000 trees. I’ve started this in Mayo but I hope all politicians can follow and then the whole country will be green.”‘Politics has to do with everyone’s future’On the other side of the country, in the Dublin Fingal Constituency, Oghenetano John Uwhumiakpor is canvassing in his hometown of Balbriggan as a People Before Profit candidate. He ran unsuccessfully in the 2019 local elections but is optimistic about Saturday’s vote.While Mr Uwhumiakpor says most people have responded positively to his campaign, he was dismayed by a recent Facebook post which poked fun at his surname as “another wifi password looking for votes up in Balbriggan”.Asked if he considered the statement racist, Mr Uwhumiakpor says on reflection he believes it was just meant as a joke and is trying not to take the comment personally.“I was taken aback. I’ve lived here for almost 14 years so I think I understand the Irish sense of humour. But sometimes people misuse humour. There are lots of Irish names that are difficult to pronounce but they are unique and they have their own importance.“But my name shouldn’t be the main issue, there are lots of problems in the country that we should be focussing on rather than dwelling on my name.”Mr Uwhumiakpor believes most constituents around Balbriggan are looking for a change in government and has witnessed real anger around the cost of renting and childcare.He has also encountered new Irish citizens who choose not to vote because they became disillusioned by the corrupt politics in their home countries.“I try to explain that this is a different society, it’s more transparent. I hope as time goes on they’ll understand that politics has to do with everyone’s future. If we have good leaders today then we have a future tomorrow. As a minority in a country you need to participate.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4159329.1580658416!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 i couldn t imagine not voting here it s my country now","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tChairman of Forum Polonia, Barnaba Dorda. File photograph: Bryan O’BrienOn February 8th, Karolina Ó Beacháin will cast a vote for the first time in an Irish general election. Originally from Poland, Ms Ó Beacháin became an Irish citizen four years ago specifically because she wanted to vote.“I couldn’t imagine not voting here, it’s my country now. I’m Polish by birth but Irish by choice. I was voting in the locals before, but the fact that I couldn’t vote in the generals wasn’t natural. How could I have an influence?”Ms Ó Beacháin is one of the 5,072 Poles to have become Irish citizens in the past four years. Since 2016, 32,247 people from around the globe have become citizens of this country. They are all eligible to vote, yet have they taken the time to register? How interested are our new citizens in Irish politics?Like all Irish, new citizens who were not included in the 2019-2020 electoral register can only vote on Saturday if they added their name to the supplementary register by the January 22nd deadline.While many new Irish citizens are Polish, data released by the Department of Justice shows 2,891 Romanians, 2,837 Indians, 2,067 Nigerians, 1,974 people from the UK and 1,604 Filipinos secured citizenship between 2016 and 2019.More than 1,200 Latvians and Pakistanis have also become Irish citizens since 2016 followed by around 900 Brazilians and Chinese.Nearly half of adults who obtained Irish citizenship in 2019 – some 2,627 people – lived in Dublin city and county, according to Department of Justice statistics.An additional 1,342 new citizens were based in Leinster 1,125 were living in Munster 407 were living in Connacht and 193 lived in Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal.RootsDr Adrian Kavanagh from Maynooth University says regardless of whether a person has secured citizenship, people only tend to vote when they have set down roots.“The longer you’ve lived in an area the more you know the local issues. If you’ve spent 70 years in west Offaly you’re very clear on the candidates and their backgrounds. But if you’re new to an area you’re not tapped into that.”The “cost of voting” theory – meaning a person’s access to information around an election – also plays a strong role in whether they participate.“Affluent areas are more tied in with better education and find it easier to get information on voting. People in less affluent areas find it difficult to get this information. The same applies to younger people, and new citizens would also fall into this category.”Prof Mary Gilmartin, who specialises in migration and mobility at Maynooth University, is more positive about new Irish citizens’ electoral participation, particularly among Poles. “EU citizens have pretty similar rights so not being able to vote in elections is something that would motivate many to seek Irish citizenship.”While EU citizens are entitled to vote in local elections, Prof Gilmartin believes many are actually reluctant to get involved until they have Irish citizenship.“They feel as if they aren’t really entitled to vote. There’s also limited power at the local level so not having a vote in the Dáil elections is quite exclusionary for people.”However, confusion around how to register and where the local polling station is located can act as a barrier to many, she says, adding that the decision to hold the 2020 general election at such short notice, and before the new electoral register came into effect, will have excluded many new Irish citizens from voting.“We also know migrants are significantly more likely to be living in rental accommodation. Our system is predicated on the idea that people live at the same address and don’t move. It hasn’t kept up with the reality of contemporary Ireland.”‘It’s the same crisis’Chairman of Forum Polonia Barnaba Dorda has noticed far more political participation among Ireland’s Polish community in this election than ever before. “Poles are settled here now so national politics is more appealing to them. They want to have a say in what’s going on at the national level.”The housing crisis, the cost of childcare and access to healthcare are issues that affect the Irish-Polish community as well, says Mr Dorda. “It’s the same crisis for Poles in Ireland as it is for the Irish.”Following the announcement of the 2020 general election, Forum Polonia launched a campaign urging Poles with Irish citizenship to register to vote. “We’re trying to encourage people to think about what is important for their lives here and to talk to politicians about their concerns,” says Mr Dorda.Ms Ó Beacháin, who is a Green Party campaign manager in Dublin north west, does not believe many new citizens will take part in this election. Unless political parties actually target these communities and factor their needs into policy commitments, new Irish citizens are unlikely to take an interest in national politics, she says.“Parties don’t really address the problems of the new Irish, they don’t recognise the different challenges we face like bilingual education for our children. But there’s a lack of targeting, even in terms of their messaging.”While the 2019 local elections saw a small number of candidates from migrant backgrounds secure seats, Ms Ó Beacháin believes it’s almost impossible for similar candidates to secure a win in the general elections. “They will have to break through another glass ceiling. In order to be selected you have to work at it for many years breaking that circle takes so long. Even if someone works very hard you still need the local connections like ‘I knew your father or your grandfather’.”The election of just two candidates from migrant backgrounds to Dáil Éireann would create representation at Government level that new Irish citizens can relate to, says Ms Ó Beacháin. “The new Irish have different political views there should be a place for them in every party.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4159614.1580712256!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 varadkar says fianna f%C3%A1il opposed to social progress","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar and Fine Gael candidate Gabrielle McFadden canvass at Sheraton shopping centre in Athlone, Co Westmeath. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireParty leaders are preparing a series of last-minute attacks on each other’s policies and records as they jostle for advantage in the final week of the election campaign.It drew an angry response from senior Fianna Fáil figures, who claimed the Taoiseach’s “mask slipped”, as well as causing concern among some Fine Gael campaigners in rural Ireland. Party sources acknowledged Mr Varadkar’s comments could anger some, but felt it was a risk worth taking to put the spotlight on Fianna Fáil’s record on social issues.It was claimed this could be used to persuade urban, liberal voters to vote for Fine Gael rather than smaller parties who could form a coalition with Fianna Fáil. Senior Fianna Fáil figures said the party will concentrate on outlining its plans for government, with party figures confident it will win the most seats. There will be no last-minute deviation by leader Micheál Martin from the overall party strategy.Senior Fine Gael sources said they would concentrate on attacking Fianna Fáil and the Greens, as the party seeks to persuade “Fine Gael defectors” to return before polling day. Despite the strength of Sinn Féin in recent opinion polls, one senior party figure said that “Sinn Féin doesn’t matter to us”, although Fine Gael will pursue Fianna Fáil over the question of coalition with Sinn Féin, something which Mr Martin has said he will not agree to. Mixed viewsViews in Fine Gael are mixed on the party’s prospects after a series of opinion polls showed it behind Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin. “They are probably tired of us,” one Minister in rural Ireland said of the electorate. “We are there nine years. They want change but they don’t know what they want. But I still think we can pull it back.”One Dublin TD said: “I came off the back of a very good set of Mass canvasses today, not reflecting the polls at all. Am I reading it completely wrong?” A number of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil TDs said the issue of Sinn Féin being in government had begun to register with older voters opposed to such a prospect, particularly after weekend newspaper coverage.However, some Fianna Fáil TDs said they were criticised on the doorsteps for ruling out coalition with Sinn Féin.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald on Sunday again asked voters to give her party a chance and said its poll ratings are “reflective of an energy and a momentum for Sinn Féin and for change”. RTÉ is expected to make a decision on the matter on Monday. Mr Varadkar said Ms McDonald’s participation would allow for scrutiny of Sinn Féin policies, while Mr Martin said he had “no difficulty” with a three-way debate. Labour has requested that all parties who may enter into a post-election coalition be included.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4159554.1580674457!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"howlin wants to build progressive alliance before coalition talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLabour Party leader Brendan Howlin TD canvassing in Dun Laoghaire with the party\u0027s  candidate Juliette O\u0027Connell.Photograph by Crispin Rodwell for the Labour Party leader Brendan Howlin will seek to negotiate a common platform with the Green Party, the Social Democrats and like-minded independents in a bid to elbow his way into government formation calculations after the general election.Mr Howlin will not form a government with Sinn Féin, but will seek to negotiate a programme for government with either Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael, effectively playing the two parties off against one other to secure maximum policy concessions.Before he does this, though, he will seek a “progressive alliance” with other parties and TDs of the left.“We need to build progressive alliances,” he says, adding that he wants Labour voters to continue their preferences for Greens and Social Democrats candidates after voting for his party’s candidates.“I think we’ll have a critical mass of maybe 25 or more seats, maybe more, if we could nail down a policy platform, so that we’re not picked off by other parties ... If we have a clear policy platform that is progressive that says we can’t afford massive tax giveaways if we’re going to fix health, and housing and have a decent childcare system ... we can have a real influence,” he says in an interview with The .He says that this policy platform would have to be agreed immediately after the election before the “progressive alliance” opens negotiations with Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil.“If you want change, that’s the real change agenda,” he says.Mr Howlin says he hoped “personal issues” with the Social Democrats could be overcome.“I would certainly be willing to offer full co-operation on behalf of the Labour Party” he says.The animating spirit of this campaign has been change. How does Labour relate to voters who want change?“We’ve been the pathfinders for every social movement in this country,” he says, citing the party’s opposition to the eighth amendment in the 1980s. “When we finally repealed the eighth 30 years later a lot of people crowded onto that particular platform and we got crowded out.”Isn’t that why the referendum was passed, though?“That’s the point. But someone has to keep the flag ... and the same with marriage equality. Somebody has to be the agents of change. And we’ve always been the agents of change.”“By and large,” he says, “modern Ireland has been shaped by the Labour Party more than any other political party”.Labour has made much play of promising to stop the increase in the pension age – a move it supported and argued for in government. Howlin doesn’t deny that the demographics of pensions require the pension age to increase, but he says that 66 is a “reasonable age” for retirement now.“We can be prudent but we don’t have to be excessively so,” he says, somewhat unconvincingly. “If we have to think about this in another decade, then we can think about it in another decade.”HealthChildcare has been another mainstay of the Labour offering. His party has proposed a State-provided national childcare service – a huge and expensive undertaking he accepts will take years to construct and will certainly not be achieved in the lifetime of the next government. But the party has promised a pilot scheme to gauge the appetite for such a service, and to examine how it would work in practice.“It’s not for the next five years because it can’t be afforded,” he says. But the pilot scheme will provide a “blueprint” for a new national service.Health is also a centrepiece of the Labour pitch. Like other parties he cleaves to the Sláintecare plan to separate the public and private healthcare systems through massive investment in the public system. In the short-term, he acknowledges the pressing need for more GPs. Where do we get them? “We have to train them.”Should they be obliged to stay and work in the Irish health system for a few years after graduation? “I think there is a growing argument that they should be incentivised to stay for at least three years,” he says. He suggests that their student loans could be subsidised. None of this is in the manifesto, but Howlin – a former health minister – is animated on the question.Like all the small parties, Labour is struggling to get heard in this crowded, noisy election. Its focus is on a handful of constituencies where success would mean the party returning to perhaps double figures in seat numbers and being back in the government formation again – relevant again after years of irrelevancy.Failure in those constituencies would consign Labour to – what? Four or five seats in total, maybe. Not just irrelevancy, but something near to invisibility. The struggle to reassert the Labour Party’s place on the national political stage remains on a knife-edge.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4160151.1580727561!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"martin restates opposition to sf coalition after poll bounce","story":"Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has again firmly ruled out any prospect of leading a coalition with Sinn Féin. Despite a number of his TDs suggesting such a deal could be done, Mr Martin said there is “a fixed will in the party” against it.“I keep getting asked this question. The Fianna Fáil party will not be going into government with Sinn Féin,” he told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland. Mr Martin said Sinn Féin’s tax proposals would destroy enterprise. “Do no underestimate the strength of will within the Fianna Fáil party . . . within the parliamentary party . . . who have all rejected the prospect of a Fianna FáilSinn Féin coalition.”The Business PostRed C poll puts Sinn Féin at 24 per cent, up 3 per cent on the previous survey by the same pollsters a week earlier.Fianna Fáil is down 2 per cent to 24 per cent and Fine Gael down 2 per cent to 21 per cent. In the space of the two surveys, Fine Gael is down 9 per cent and Sinn Féin up 11 per cent, confirming a trend in other polls.Mr Martin said there will be no argument about a Fianna Fáil-Sinn Féin coalition after the election as a majority of the parliamentary party have been “consistently against going into government with Sinn Féin”.“No one could sign up to what they are promising. They are not doable in the first instance but they will be deeply damaging to enterprise and jobs in the country,” said Mr Martin.Fianna Fáil is the only party that can lead an alternative government and the Green Party and Labour should not be ruled out of coalition prospects, he said.People are ruling out Fianna Fáil leading a government with “like-minded centre parties”, he said. “I think they are being written out of the equation far too easily and far too early.” Mr Martin said the confidence and supply arrangement with Fine Gael was “out of necessity” as a no-deal Brexit would have been “catastrophic” for Ireland. “It was difficult for us, very frustrating,” he said.The “world will not collapse” in relation to Brexit if there is a change of government, he said. “What Fine Gael have been trying to do in this campaign, unfortunately, and I regret it really, because there was a genuine national consensus on Brexit, Fine Gael have now attempted to party-politicise Brexit during this election campaign. I don’t think people are going to buy into it, I don’t think it resonates with people.” Mr Martin said a change in government will not change or undermine the country’s approach to Brexit.Suggestions by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar that Fianna Fáil would stymie social change in Ireland was “more of this relentless negativity name-calling which is beneath the office of An Taoiseach I would say”.“It is also regrettable,” he said.Fine Gael was the last party to support marriage equality and Mr Varadkar was the last party leader to declare a position on the Eight Amendment, he said.“It is very regrettable that the Taoiseach in the middle of an election campaign is trying to make these issues isive once again.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons february 2020matt cartoon february 1","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Lent 2020: how the test of willpower is linked to the days getting longerStreatham terror attack: Ex counter-terror officer warns British prisons are more dangerous than Syria for returning jihadisBoris Johnson signals end to early release for  terrorist prisoners after Streatham terror attackBrexit latest news: Boris Johnson says UK must become champion of global free trade Iowa Democratic caucuses 2020: when do they start, how do they work and why are they important?   Comment: More money won\u0026#39t save the NHS.

He was 21 when he settled in France and speaks fluent French. “My home is here,” he said. “In my head, I was French. Now it’s as if I’ve lost my place. I’m neither English, nor French.” At his local café, everyone seems to know him. He says he was conceived in the Dordogne after his parents bought a small farm in a quiet, wooded valley 50 years ago.“I’m made in France,” he joked, saying that as a child he holidayed in France with his parents two or three times a year and it felt natural to make his home in their farmhouse, surrounded by walnut trees. He passed language and culture tests required for citizenship, but his application was rejected in April, and again on appeal in October.

This can pose problems for independent craftsmen.Mr Lawrence stopped working for a period about 10 years ago to look after his children after his ex-wife had an accident. His current partner is unemployed.   British residents’ groups have reported several cases of longtime residents being turned down for French citizenship ahead of Brexit because they failed to show “sufficient and stable resources”.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"inside bernie sanders iowa campaign have nothing lose chains","story":"In a windowless room next to a Salvation Army donation centre in rural Iowa dozens of people are chanting in unison: We have nothing to lose but our chains! It is our duty to fight for our freedom! It is our duty to win!Mostly in their early 20s, they join hands in the air in front of a sign saying The Revolution Will Not Be Televised. And then they fan out across the frozen corn fields of a state larger than England, trying to convince Iowans that democratic socialism can save America.These young men and women are part of Bernie Sanders\u0027 volunteer army, and it is unprecedented. They have arrived independently by plane and car, and on organised Bernie Journey buses, from across the country.In January they knocked on 500,000 Iowan homes. According to campaign data they have made seven million phone calls in the state. Through the Bern app they have collected an ocean of granular data on Iowans, and what they think.Mr Sanders, 78, is no longer the surprise package he was in 2016, with his plans for NHS-style healthcare, free college tuition, and a $15 minimum wage. But his supporters grow ever more fervent, the Bernie chants ever louder, and his grassroots operation ever wider.Four years ago he lost Iowa by a whisker to Hillary Clinton. His supporters are determined the revolution will not be quashed this time.A lot of my friends supported Bernie in 2016 but didn’t register to vote in time. No-one\u0027s making that mistake again, said Michael Sayman, 22, a Sanders volunteer who flew in from San Francisco.My parents immigrated from South America, started a restaurant, and lost it in the recession. We were evicted. It\u0027s because of that, the recession, that a lot of my generation have a different view of what should happen next in America. That\u0027s why we support Bernie.Amy German, a Sanders volunteer from Rochester, New York, said: My friend had a car with snow tyres so we just dropped everything, jumped in and drove 14 hours to Iowa. I knocked 100 doors yesterday. I\u0027ll do it again today.For most of the final week Mr Sanders has been unable to join his campaign. As a juror in Donald Trump\u0027s impeachment trial he cut an increasingly frustrated figure, fidgeting in his seat, and wiping his nose with Kleenex.At the height of the trial he shuffled out of the senate chamber to make a quick call. On a stage 900 miles away in Iowa City, the documentary maker Michael Moore, one of his celebrity campaigners, answered.Is that...Bernard from Brooklyn? said Mr Moore. As Mr Sanders\u0027 voice crackled through a speaker, the crowd went temporarily insane.I\u0027m sorry I can\u0027t be with you, Mr Sanders whispered, his voice heavy with cold. But, as you know, we are impeaching the president. It was hard to hear him over the noise of millennials screaming.Mr Sanders finally appeared in person, in front of 3,000 people, at a concert with the Grammy-winning rock band Vampire Weekend on Friday night.In addition to Mr Moore he has had Kendrick Sampson, a Hollywood TV actor, touring field offices. In terms of energising volunteers Mr Sampson has proved something of a secret weapon, leading charged chants before sending volunteers out into the snow.He told The : It’s been my first time in Iowa and it’s been pretty amazing. These people are enthusiastic, they are dedicated. Canvassing events are full until late at night. It’s not just young people. Some grey hair too.The Sanders campaign set out to make five million phone calls to Iowa voters, but achieved that some time ago. Last week, in an email to volunteer leaders Claire Sandberg, the national organiser, wrote: We have already run through most of the calls we wanted to make. This is definitely a great problem to have.On occasion the enthusiasm has spilled over. In Des Moines, the Iowa capital, 30 Sanders supporters invaded his rival Joe Biden’s campaign headquarters, singing In Joe Biden’s office, I’m gonna let it shine. Five were arrested.Mr Biden, meanwhile, visited 20 cities across Iowa in the final days, suffering several awkward moments. After a disagreement over climate change one voter accused the former vice president of pushing and poking him.Meanwhile, Pete Buttigieg, the third placed candidate, raced across the state holding up to five events a day.Mr Buttigieg, 38, appears to own lots of sets of the same clothes, always campaigning in black trousers and a crisp white shirt. He looks a bit like a waiter.But it takes only a short time with him to realise that Mr Buttigieg is the smartest person in the room. He never gaffes. He never misspeaks. No policy question throws him because he knows all the answers, and can probably deliver them in Norwegian if asked. His crowds do not go wild like Mr Sanders\u0027, and are often more cerebral and moderate.Paul Stenger, 67, a retired aviation worker, switched his support after hearing Mr Buttigieg speak in a cold, corrugated iron shed. You can\u0027t bulls--t people here, in person, like you can on the national scale with TV ads, said Mr Stenger. Pete\u0027s wise beyond his years, and demonstrates a high level of intelligence.Regardless of who wins, and who eventually becomes the Democrat nominee, they will have a hard time convincing Republicans in Iowa to vote for them in the general election in November. In 2016 Mr Trump beat Hillary Clinton by 10 points.On Thursday night the Democrat contest was overshadowed as Mr Trump arrived for a rally, far bigger than any Democrat has managed. The queue to get in began 24 hours before his arrival, despite sub-zero temperatures.I wouldn\u0027t vote for a single one of the Democrats, and I did like Bill Clinton.. said Tonya Schwenn, 49, an aluminium worker in a Trump bobble hat.These Democrats are all a little bit scary, and Bernie\u0027s the scariest.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 3rd february 2020","story":"Renee Zellweger with her Best Actress Bafta award attending the after show party for the 73rd British Academy Film Awards.Lent 2020: how the test of willpower is linked to the days getting longerStreatham terror attack: Ex counter-terror officer warns British prisons are more dangerous than Syria for returning jihadisBoris Johnson signals end to early release for  terrorist prisoners after Streatham terror attackBrexit latest news: Boris Johnson says UK must become champion of global free trade Iowa Democratic caucuses 2020: when do they start, how do they work and why are they important?   Comment: More money won\u0026#39t save the NHS.

I mean, very basic. I’ve driven a fair few in my time – and this year will be sampling many more. This is a bit of what I’ve learned, imperfectly, thus far.\u0026nbspIt is not, for these purposes, a “hybrid”, like the Toyota\u0026nbspPrius\u0026nbspor any other vehicle that also has an internal combustion engine on board (with one of two very particular exceptions).\u0026nbspAn electric car is a pure thing – it runs completely and solely on its batteries. When they run out, you stop moving.\u0026nbspI like to think of it as a cross between a washing machine, a laptop and,\u0026nbsperm, a car. So, your car is driven entirely by electric power – powerful lithium-ion batteries (like in your laptop) sending electricity to an electric motor (like your washing machine) which drives the road wheels (like on your motor car).\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch. Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.210 Prince of Wales Drive, Battersea, London210 Prince of Wales Drive, Battersea, LondonThe electricity stored in the batteries mostly comes from being plugged into the mains (there are various charging options, most commonly a fast charger attached to the side of your home, if you have the space). Some will be regenerated from the car itself, saving power otherwise wasted when braking, for example.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp2 Don’t some electric cars run on hydrogen?Yes, but they are not much more than prototypes, with only a handful of filling stations currently. Critics say using a hydrogen fuel cell to generate the electricity for the batteries simply adds an additional stage of energy accumulation and the manufacture of the hydrogen could be problematic, if it requires a disproportionate amount of non-renewable electricity.\u0026nbsp3 How far will one go on a charge?Well, that depends, but you can count on a modern mainstream electric car these days to bae able to take you 200 to 250 miles (conservatively) on a single charge – a\u0026nbspKia\u0026nbspe-Niro, say, or Hyundai\u0026nbspKona\u0026nbspelectric. In the right hands, 300 miles might be possible. This, by the way is two or three times the usual range you’d experience a few years ago.\u0026nbspFeeling the spark: Drivers learning to love electric carsThe most advanced models, such as the famous Tesla range, will go on and on for near enough 400 miles. Some of the smaller more urban-oriented models, such as the new electric Smart cars will be good for about 100 miles.\u0026nbspThe rest is down to how you drive and when. Winter means the batteries tend to run down faster and you’ll likely get a shorter range.\u0026nbspIf you drive hard and fast you’ll use up more energy than otherwise, just like in a petrol or diesel car. Over along time the ability of the batteries to take and store a charge will deteriorate (just like your smartphone or laptop).Yes. To buy or lease you’re looking at a premium of some thousands of pounds. So, let’s take an example, the Hyundai\u0026nbspKona, a compact\u0026nbspSUV.\u0026nbsp With a conventional petrol engine you can pick one up at a list price of £17,505. For the hybrid version (petrol plus electric power generated on-board) you’ll need to fork out £22,495. For the\u0026nbspBEV\u0026nbspHyundai\u0026nbspKona\u0026nbspelectric, the price jumps to £35,100, or £32,600 when you take into account the government grant for electric cars of up to £3,500. \u0026nbspAgainst the usually higher purchase price or monthly PCP or lease fee you need to balance the savings you make compared t petrol or diesel: far cheaper fuel spending on your electricity tariff) lower running costs (fewer moving mechanical parts and consumables eg exhaust pipe, alternator, engine) and a range of lower taxes and congest and parking charges. Electric cars are exempt from road tax, carry lower benefit-in-kind tax liabilities for commercial users, usually form congestion charges and city bans, and can enjoy cheaper parking. There’s also a government subsidy of up to £500 for a home charger.\u0026nbspWhy have electric cars failed to spark with consumers? Has Tesla hastened the death of Britain’s electric car revolution?Grant Shapps’ plan for electric cars will make China a motoring giantWhether this makes financial sense really depends your pattern of car usage – the number of miles you do a year, and the type of journeys. With a lot of medium range commuting for example (say 60 miles a day) an electric car could pay for itself within a few years for sustained long-distance travelling then a diesel might make more sense.5 What are the advantages of an electric car?Apart from the financial ones it is of course far better for the environment. There are many debates about, say, the cost (in environmental terms) of mining rare minerals for the batteries, or transporting them vast distances to factories, or the energy used in making them. Also obviously an electric car that runs on electricity generated from soar power is better than one where the electricity happens to be generated by burning coal (ins or far as anyone can know this when they plug in).\u0026nbspHowever a reasonable assumption is that all electric cars are greener than any internal combustion engined equivalent, and that any public transport (rail or bus) is usually greener than any private alternative.Don’t forget that electric cars are very refined – being almost silent at any speed, and the acceleration form rest is startlingly fast, though they tend to run out of puff as they approach their top speeds. In other words they can be good to drive and to be driven in.6 What are the disadvantages?Surprisingly few, though it does depend on your circumstances. If you live in a flat or a terraced house, charging from home is obviously impossible or difficult, and the ease of use of an electric vehicle is much reduced. If you imagine that you’ll have to do journeys of more than 400 miles without warning, then an internal combustion engine is a surer way of getting wherever it is you might conceivably wish to go – though you’d need to take a break anyway.\u0026nbspIt’s fair to add that some of the public charging infrastructure leaves a bit to be desired – it could usefully be much bigger, more reliable and easier to use.And of course you do need to balance the financial sums against the clear practical and environmental plusses of being a green driver.\u0026nbsp7 Don’t they take ages to charge?Yes and no. The Tesla is an exception, in many ways, because it has a dedicated network of ultra-fast chargers, as well as being chargeable at home.\u0026nbspMost owners of electric cars have to rely on charging at home – but don’t\u0026nbsp have much trouble charging because they most likely have a home charging point, which does mean off-street parking for the moment. If you take a mainstream option like the Hyundai\u0026nbspKona\u0026nbspelectricity home, using a regular\u0026nbsp7kW\u0026nbspcharging point via its own cable a near-full zero to 80 per cent charge takes around 9 hours.A similar charge with a rapid charger (such as you’d fine at, say, motorway services)\u0026nbsptakes around an hour and a quarter. 75 minutes.\u0026nbspIn an emergency, you can also use a domestic three-pin charging lead, plugged into the mains at home like you’d plug in a kettle. However you’d looking at about 24 hours for a full charge – because the batteries are so big and the trickle form the domestic system so modest.\u0026nbsp8 Will they get easier to charge and go further in future?Yes. Much of the progress in the usefulness of the electric car is coming from improvements in battery “density” – the amount of useful power that can be stored in a an ever-more compact way.The battery pack is usually stored lower in the car, under the floor or the seats, and this can help with keeping the car stable (lower centre of gravity). Given that these units can grow very hot and need ventilation or water cooling for example, and have to be protected from water ingress (if fording a stream say, or just in a heavy downpour) , the progress in engineering in this field is truly impressive.\u0026nbspHowever, eventually the rate of improvement in range and efficiency will slow, and that might well mark an optimal moment to make a purchase or take on an electric car lease. But we cannot know when this will happen.9 What about hybrids?Well, what about hybrids? They are not electric cars. This is because they are, as the name implies, hybrids – a cross between an electric car and a traditional one powered by a petrol or diesel engine. Thus well-known hybrid models such as the Toyota\u0026nbspPrius\u0026nbsphave an internal combustion engine on board, as well as an electric motor and some batteries to boost performance and economy.\u0026nbspIn a hybrid the electric power is “self-generated”, which is to say that it comes from the engine regenerating and recycling power that might otherwise be wasted. So for example some of the power usually lost in heavy braking is instead sent back via the electric motor working “backwards” to the batteries, where it is stored for later use.\u0026nbspI drove 300 miles in an electric car and here’s what happenedMost hybrids pair an electric and a petrol engine because the two units tend to complement each other in use diesel-electric hybrids are rarer. “Mild” hybrids are just that – they have only a small ethic motor and minimal battery storage just to give a slight edge to reduce emissions and improve economy. The green advantage is quite marginal.\u0026nbspPlug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) have the additional option of charging from the mains, as with an electric car, but it is not necessary to do so.\u0026nbspThe drawback with the hybrid technology is the constant trade-offs that have to made between the energy saved through the battery-electric motor system, set against the additional weight of them, which of course tends to raise fuel consumption. Clever software can minimise these trade-offs to more acceptable levels, but they will always be there, as compared to a\u0026nbspBEV. Hybrids, indeed, in their complexity and weight, can represent the e worst of both worlds.\u0026nbsp10 Aren’t electric cars all a bit oddball?They have been, yes, but the next few months year will see the launch of some very well-known models with full-electric versions.\u0026nbsp These will include: the Vauxhall\u0026nbspCorsa-e Peugeot 208 electric Volvo\u0026nbspXC40\u0026nbspRecharge and the Mini electric. They join an already quiet impressive variety of electric cars on sale or soon to go on sale.From the tiny\u0026nbspSkoda\u0026nbspCiti GOe-iV\u0026nbspand Smart EQ through the Renault Zoe to the Nissan leaf to MG ZS and the Jaguar\u0026nbspiPace\u0026nbspthere are already options to match your tastes and budget. And there is also a small market in used models such as the Renault\u0026nbspFluence, Mitsubishi\u0026nbspIMEV, Vauxhall\u0026nbspAmpera\u0026nbspor first generation Nissan Leaf that might also suit.These cars will tend to have shorter ranges, though, while older Renaults may still have their batteries on monthly lease from the company. As always – do your own research, but you can approach an electric car with more positivity than ever before.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

His celebrity crush is Lily James.Meanwhile, the show has been sponsored by fast fashion brands (Missguided and then I Saw it First) for the last three years, giving viewers the opportunity to shop the female Islanders’ looks directly. Personally, I’ve always thought that Love Island contestants dress terribly: it’s Benidorm beaches meets Kardashian kitsch. But with prices starting at £5, the clothes are devastatingly cheap. Far cheaper than the designer garb we see on most TV stars. So I can understand the appeal. But I also know that every time someone buys one of those bikinis, or sparkly bodycon dresses, they’re adding fuel to fast fashion’s ever-blazing fire.But perhaps the onus is not on the consumer, or even the Love Island star. Lauren Bravo, author of How to Break Up with Fast Fashion, explains that the brands are the ones who should really be shouldering responsibility here. “These days we’re so used to instant gratification, and the idea that anyone can aspire to celebrity, that it seems reasonable for TV stars to sell us clothes and vice versa,” she tells me. “And it’s really hard, because I know what it’s like to love fashion and crave the clothes you’re seeing on people you admire, not to mention the huge social pressures on young people to keep that endless parade of new looks rolling over on their Instagram grid, so telling people who can’t necessarily afford to spend any more that their shopping habits are destroying the planet can feel snobbish and unfair.”Why I\u0027m giving up fast fashion #20PledgesBut, Bravo adds, the fact remains that those clothes simply cannot be made as cheaply as they’re sold. Somewhere down the line, someone is paying the price, whether it’s a garment worker barely surviving on poverty wages or a community grappling with industrial pollution.That’s not to say you can’t “get the Islander look” in a sustainable and eco-friendly way. Bravo suggests heading to secondhand shopping apps, like Depop, where you’ll find plenty of pre-loved items not dissimilar from the ones you see on the show. Some of them will be from fast fashion brands, but if you’re buying it there, you’re keeping that item in circulation as opposed to letting it wind up in landfill.\u0026nbspOr, you could take a closer look at some of the trends championed by Love Islanders, both past and present, and see that many (cycling shorts, mesh, high-waisted jeans and leopard print) hark back to another era, like, say, the 1990s. And what better way to shop Nineties fashion than by heading to your local Beyond Retro or Rokit, which will be jam-packed with original clothing from the decade that is not only more sustainable, but a hell of a lot cooler, too.How to Break Up with Fast Fashion by Lauren Bravo (£12.99, Headline Home) is out nowOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s an expected turn of events, as the First World War\u0026nbspfilm is currently a frontrunner at the Oscars and also happens to be packed with British talent.Other British-backed films honoured during the ceremony included Mark Jenkins’ Bait, which won Best British Debut, and For Sama, a collaboration between Syrian filmmaker Waad Al-Kateab and British documentarian Edward Watts. The latter won Best Documentary.\u0026nbspHowever, Joker had the most nominations of the night, with 11 in total, but only walked away with three wins. These included Best Actor, which saw star Joaquin Phoenix deliver a powerful speech in response to this year’s total lack of ersity within the nominees.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“We really have to do the hard work to truly understand systemic racism,” the actor said. “I think that it is the obligation of the people who have created and perpetuated and benefited from a system of oppression to dismantle it… so that’s on us.”Phoenix’s comments reflected the general atmosphere of the night, in which the overall lack of ersity across all categories (no women were nominated for Best Director) seemed to hang over the proceedings.Host Graham Norton, in an otherwise mild and pleasant opening monologue, called this “the year when white men finally broke through”. Norton continued by describing Joker as “the story of a white man who makes himself even whiter”.Created with Sketch.19 films to look out for in 2020 Show all 19Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An intoxicating and romantic drama about lovers on the run, Queen \u0026amp Slim marks the first feature film from Melina Matsoukas, the director responsible for music videos including Beyoncé’s “Formation”. Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith are the unlikely couple thrust together on a go-nowhere blind date, only for tragedy to transform them into folk heroes roaming across the USA searching for shelter. It’s a spellbinding debut. (Adam White) Guaranteed to be one of the major players in next year’s Oscars, Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite works better the less you know about it. What you should know is that it is a devilishly inventive deconstruction of class, brimming with energy, dark humour and nervous tension. (Adam White) Rising from the ashes of the aborted Universal Monsters multiverse, which was due to star Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise, this rebooted Invisible Man uses the iconic branding to tell the smaller and far more intriguing story of a woman on the run from her invisible ex. Elisabeth Moss is the domestic violence survivor convinced that her supposedly dead boyfriend has merely mastered the art of invisibility. Leigh Whannell, who directed 2018’s wonderfully inventive sci-fi thriller Upgrade, is behind the camera. (Adam White) A Quiet Place would surely have been better off as a standalone film, but the financial success of writer-director John Krasinski’s B-movie-style horror tale put paid to that. This isn’t to say there’s no more story to tell. In fact, Krasinski made no secret of the fact he had a whole universe he could one day explore, and sure enough, joining returning stars Emily Blunt, Millicent Thomas and Noah Jupe (so brilliant in Honey Boy) are new additions in the form of Cillian Murphy and Djimon Honsou. (Jacob Stolworthy) 519 No Time to DieWhile Daniel Craig’s Bond tenure has been marked by severe whiplash in terms of quality, there remains something incredibly exciting about the arrival of a new 007 movie. No Time to Die, Craig’s final outing as the super-spy, also boasts an intoxicating array of talent on and off screen, from Cary Fukunaga on directorial duties, to a script co-written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge and cast newcomers including Ana de Armas, Rami Malek and Lashana Lynch. (Adam White) Little is known about the plot for Antebellum, the feature film debut of artists and music video directors Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz. But the thriller\u0027s trailer is a visual feast, with Janelle Monáe appearing to be caught between the present day and the horrors of a 19th century plantation. From producer Jordan Peele, director of Get Out and Us, it also features Jena Malone, Gabourey Sidibe and Kiersey Clemons. (Adam White)719 The Woman in the WindowAn adaptation of the pulpy bestseller (which itself was engulfed in mystery when a New Yorker feature claimed its author, AJ Finn, had extensively lied about his personal life and history), The Woman in the Window puts Amy Adams centre stage for the first time since 2018’s Sharp Objects. She’s an agoraphobic psychologist convinced she has witnessed a murder across the street from her apartment. Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman and Brian Tyree Henry co-star. (Adam White) Watchmen star Yahya Abdul-Mateen III continues his incredible ascent with the starring role in this remake. Produced by the ubiquitous Jordan Peele, the new Candyman revives the hook-handed killer originated in 1992’s genuinely terrifying Bernard Rose film, but with a black and female director and predominantly black cast – which ought to mean the frustratingly ambiguous racial themes of the original can finally be given their due. (Adam White) The sequel to 2017’s mega successful Wonder Woman is a rare thing: a DC film worthy of excitement. The first outing saw Patty Jenkins become the highest-grossing woman director in cinema history, and she’s looking to beat her own record with a follow-up centred on the Amazon princess’s battle against a villain named Cheetah (Kristen Wiig in her superhero film debut). That Jenkins describes it as “a grand tentpole like they use to make in the 1980s” is reason alone to mark its release on your 2020 calendar. (Jacob Stolworthy) Soul is a curious new Pixar film that appears to emulate the philosophical wonder of Inside Out with the lived-in cultural exploration of Coco. Jamie Foxx is a struggling musician who finally gets his big break, only to experience a freak accident that propels him into a mysterious netherworld in which souls are imbued with talents and passions, before being implanted in newborn babies. It looks gorgeous, is potentially insane, and is co-written by Tina Fey. (Adam White) Hours after the first reviews of both Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Cats took over social media, Warner Bros dropped the trailer for Tenet, Christopher Nolan’s top secret espionage thriller. It’s fair to say plenty of sunshine was stolen – and for good reason. Tenet marks Nolan’s return to the mind-melting thrills of Inception and, while the plot remains unknown, it seems to focus on a team of heroes who must rewind time to prevent the outbreak of war. Sign us up. (Jacob Stolworthy) Tom Cruise is taking a (short) break from carrying out impossible missions in 2020. Instead, he’ll return to the cockpit for a sequel to the daddy of all Eighties films, Top Gun. There’ll surely be an element of “teach new dogs old tricks” in the Joseph Kosinski-directed film as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell mentors a new generation of US Navy fighter pilots. We’re hopeful the result will – wait for it – take our breath away. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1319 Barb and Star Go to Vista Del MarIt’s not the Bridesmaids sequel everyone begged for nearly a decade ago, but Barb and Star is its spiritual follow-up at least. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumulo, the women behind the 2011 smash, write and star in this new comedy, playing two best friends who venture out of their small Midwestern community for the very first time. They soon get mixed up in a villainous plot to kill an entire town, while Jamie Dornan and Damon Wayans Jr also star. (Adam White) 1419 The Many Saints of NewarkWhether you like it or not, a film prequel based on The Sopranos is being released in 2020. The presence of David Chase, the HBO show’s creator, goes a long way to abate any concerns fans might have, and it’ll at least be a fine chance to explore the mobsters’s family history. The film is expected to focus on Dickie Moltisanti, the father of Christopher, whose memory loomed large over the series. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1519 Last Night in SohoEdgar Wright is adding “psychological horror” to his filmmaking repertoire with Last Night in Soho, a neon-soaked thrill ride starring quite the ensemble (Anya Taylor-Joy, Matt Smith, Diana Rigg). The intriguing plot focuses on a young girl for whom “time falls apart” after she’s somehow transported to the 1960s. It sounds like a cult hit in waiting. (Jacob Stolworthy) The feel-good West End smash is transformed into a feel-good movie, with Richard E Grant, Sarah Lancashire and Sharon Horgan leading the story of a teenage boy who overcomes insecurity by embracing drag. Newcomer Max Harwood portrays the title character. (Adam White) Regardless of whether you’re a keen follower of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or not, The Eternals should pique your interest. Sure, it may be spearheading a brand new phase of Marvel franchises – there really is no end to the studios’ box office stronghold – but it features what has to be one of the most eclectic casts ever seen in a superhero film: Angelina Jolie, Kit Harington, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry and Salma Hayek. Colour us intrigued. (Jacob Stolworthy) Alberto E. RodriguezGetty Images for DisneyA remake of David Lynch’s Dune would ordinarily cause our eyeballs to rattle around our sockets, but not when Denis Villeneuve’s in the director’s chair. So committed to his vision is Warner Bros that they ignored the fact his breathtaking Blade Runner sequel flopped and handed him the keys to a fresh adaptation of Herbert Ross’ novel. He did direct Prisoners, Enemy and Arrival, after all. Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya head up the cast. (Jacob Stolworthy) Long in the works, Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story looks set to be a festive smash this time next year. Speculated to be closer in spirit to the original Stephen Sondheim musical than the iconic 1961 film, this new version casts Ansel Elgort as Tony and newcomer Rachel Zegler as Maria – the latter, incredibly, beat out more than 30,000 candidates for the role, after submitting an audition video via Twitter.

The reading was in line with analysts’ forecasts that it would hit the neutral 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction.New export orders slipped back after rising for the first time in over a year in December. However, the survey was conducted before January 20, the day the world receiving reported numbers of cases of the virus. “So this will be seen as largely meaningless,” said Jim Reid, global head of credit research at Deutsche Bank.There have been 213 confirmed deaths (up from 170 on Thursday) while the number of confirmed cases stands at 9,692 (up from 7,783). The number of confirmed cases has now topped the official recordings of 8,096 cases in the SARS epidemic.Deutsche’s China economists believe the turning point is not far away, and that assuming the measures taken are effective at containing the outbreak, the peak of new cases outside Hubei province — where Wuhan is located — will likely happen at some point next week.There has been growing concern in financial markets that Beijing may have sought to conceal the start and full extent to the virus to contain the risk of panic.Georgieva said the world was facing more unpredictability whether from pandemics, climate shocks and geopolitical tensions. “Preparedness, prevention and early action have to be in the bloodstream of policy makers,” she said.According to research by ING bank, SARS knocked 1.0 per cent off Chinese GDP back in 2003, but the huge uncertainty around the spread of the coronavirus makes the macro impact very difficult to forecast.It said that a 1 per cent fall in Chinese growth would mainly hit the Asia-Pacific region with countries such as South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia losing 0.3 percentage points. The impact on the UK would be around just 0.02 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.On Thursday, the Bank of England kept interest rates on hold after signals of a pick-up. The minutes of its meeting showed that it expects the UK House Price Index to have risen quite strongly in both the final quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of this year.Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said the figures were another sign that the UK housing market has “at least temporarily stepped up a gear”.“Mortgage approvals in December were\u0026nbsphighly likely\u0026nbspsignificantly lifted by increased confidence and reduced uncertainties among housing market participants following the decisive general election result,” he said.Why the calm over interest rates might not lastFigures from the bank on Friday also showed growth in consumer credit, rising\u0026nbspby £1.2bn, while credit card borrowing increased\u0026nbspby the most since February, up by £412m.Household spending has helped to drive Britain’s economy over the past few years, helped by record levels of employment and a recovery in wage growth,\u0026nbspbut there were signs of a slowdown in spending in late 2019.The bank’s data also showed that December saw the biggest increase on record in net purchases of British government bonds by foreign investors –\u0026nbspan increase of £28.6bn. The records date back to 1982.Meanwhile, it emerged that the bank will be repaid €58m (£49m) by the European Central Bank after the UK leaves the European Union. Brexit will mean that the Bank of England pulls out of the European System of Central Banks.The bank holds 14.3 per cent of the European Central Bank’s subscribed capital, of which 3.75 per cent –\u0026nbspequivalent to €58m\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspis paid up. The capital will be reallocated between the other EU central banks.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The reading was in line with analysts’ forecasts that it would hit the neutral 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction.New export orders slipped back after rising for the first time in over a year in December. However, the survey was conducted before January 20, the day the world receiving reported numbers of cases of the virus. “So this will be seen as largely meaningless,” said Jim Reid, global head of credit research at Deutsche Bank.There have been 213 confirmed deaths (up from 170 on Thursday) while the number of confirmed cases stands at 9,692 (up from 7,783). The number of confirmed cases has now topped the official recordings of 8,096 cases in the SARS epidemic.Deutsche’s China economists believe the turning point is not far away, and that assuming the measures taken are effective at containing the outbreak, the peak of new cases outside Hubei province — where Wuhan is located — will likely happen at some point next week.There has been growing concern in financial markets that Beijing may have sought to conceal the start and full extent to the virus to contain the risk of panic.Georgieva said the world was facing more unpredictability whether from pandemics, climate shocks and geopolitical tensions. “Preparedness, prevention and early action have to be in the bloodstream of policy makers,” she said.According to research by ING bank, SARS knocked 1.0 per cent off Chinese GDP back in 2003, but the huge uncertainty around the spread of the coronavirus makes the macro impact very difficult to forecast.It said that a 1 per cent fall in Chinese growth would mainly hit the Asia-Pacific region with countries such as South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia losing 0.3 percentage points. The impact on the UK would be around just 0.02 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things.

Last year, the company unveiled the Switch\u0026nbspLite\u0026nbspas well as quietly bumping up the battery life of the larger version of the console. Those were made possible as a consequence of updated Nvidia chips on the inside.EA says people prefer not to play its games on the Nintendo SwitchFurukawa suggested that the console is in its midway phase and that it would be looking for further growth opportunities for the new console.“According to the conventional wisdom for dedicated video game platforms, Nintendo Switch should be entering the midway phase of the hardware lifecycle,” he said. “But we believe we have built a foundation on which we can pursue further growth opportunities for Nintendo Switch.”He pointed to the recent announcement of a special Animal Crossing version of the Switch, which will arrive in Japan alongside the game\u0027s release date in March. That suggests that yet more special designs might come to the Switch, even if there is no update to the hardware inside for 2020.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But the effect is very small, difficult to measure and hard to examine.More massive objects, such as neutron stars or white dwarfs, give scientists the chance to examine the phenomenon at a much grander scale.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

The pulsar served as something of a clock: they could watch as the pulses arrived, measuring them very precisely, over a period of twenty years, and watch for changes as they did.Scientists release audio recording of sound of gravitational wavesThey found that the pulses did indeed drift, as predicted by the theory. After discounting other possible causes, they were able to conclude that the drift was caused by the white dwarf causing the phenomenon of frame-dragging.The idea that rotating bodies would be able to drag spacetime\u0026nbsparound with them was first suggested by Austrian\u0026nbspmathematicians Josef\u0026nbspLense\u0026nbspand Hans\u0026nbspThirring, who suggested it three years after Einstein published his\u0026nbspgeneral theory of relativity.Though the effect can be seen at a very minor and subtle level on Earth, using gyroscopes and other technology, it is 100 million times more potent in the case of a rapidly spinning white dwarf.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I’m not sure European leaders, let alone leaders here in the UK would actually welcome that kind of language.”Renewed calls for Scottish independence follow UK’s departure from EUIn response to accusations there was no plan for Scotland, Mr Raab added: “I don’t think that’s right, we want to make sure, with the levelling-up agenda, with the opportunities of Brexit right across the board, that Scotland’s got the great opportunity to take advantage of all those benefits.“At the same time, we obviously expect the SNP to deliver on its commitment to honour the outcome of the independence referendum and not keep coming back and asking for a second one.“But a lot of this is a distraction from the standards in schools, the high level of taxes, that actually the job of the Scottish government in discharging its responsibility to the Scottish people ought to be focused on.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I will always argue for that UK and I’m hoping they don’t go along that path.“But I just say to Boris Johnson and his colleagues, do not do things that will threaten the unity of our country – and the language that we’ve heard even in the last 24 hours is isive, rather than holding the country together.“And if he can’t secure a good deal, it will again encourage others therefore in Scotland to go their own way and I think it would be completely counterproductive for the Scottish people.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

While most states hold primary elections to determine their party nominees for president, Iowa, Nevada and Wyoming have continued to hold caucuses.\u0026nbspIn Iowa, the Democratic precinct caucus is a personal, complicated event in which Iowans gather in gyms and libraries and churches to essentially cast a vote with their bodies indicating their preferred candidates.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.The Democrat challengers to Trump in 2020 Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Vermont senator has launched a second bid for president after losing out to Hilary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primaries.

With just a few short months until the first voters flock to the polls, the former governor is running as a centrist and believes he can unite the party\u0027s various voting blocsDemocratic presidential hopeful billionaire and philanthropist Tom Steyer is a longtime Democratic donorAt the beginning of the caucus, voters arrange themselves into groups based on their preferred candidate. If their candidate doesn’t acquire enough votes to clear the caucus’ viability threshold – usually 15 percent of attending voters – then supporters of that candidate have a few options before the next round of voting: they can either attempt to sway supporters from other candidates to their side, join another candidate, or sit out the remainder of the caucus.\u0026nbspWhile it seems like the obvious choice for a supporter of a candidate who failed to clear the threshold would be to attempt to sway support away from their competitors, it’s actually a gamble. Any supporters who stay with a candidate that doesn’t clear the threshold and progress into the second round of voting are effectively eliminated from their vote counting towards the number of delegates that will eventually be counted at the state level to determine which candidate wins the caucus.\u0026nbspIn the second round of voting – called “alignments” in the caucus – participants have the chance to once again support a candidate. After voting is closed, a head count is taken and each precinct determines the number of delegates it will send to the county convention. That number is reported to the state party, which uses those numbers to determine the winner of the over caucus.\u0026nbspWhy Democrats should change the rules for BloombergWhy is it so important?\u0026nbspIowa has a relatively low population – only 16 percent of which turned out for the caucus in 2016 – and is overwhelmingly white. So why is it such an important indicator of determining a presidential candidate?\u0026nbspFirst, Iowa is important because it is, well, first.\u0026nbspIowa is the first time the primary candidates actually can point to a for-real election and make the case for their viability as a general election candidate. The results can propel relatively unknown candidates to the top of the dog pile and give them the momentum to stay on top heading into the broader primary season. President Barack Obama wasn’t viewed as a serious threat to Hillary Clinton’s 2008 primary run until he won Iowa, and four years earlier John Kerry’s lifted him out of the pack to frontrunner status.\u0026nbspThe winners of the Iowa Caucus or New Hampshire primaries – the so-called Granite State state is next to vote after Iowa – have gone on to become the party nominee in almost every election dating back more than 30 years. In fact, the only outlier is the 1992 race, as Iowa senator Tom Harkin was running and was favoured to win the state due to name recognition but not carry the rest of the country.\u0026nbspSecond, Iowa is important for reasons of perception.\u0026nbspOnce a candidate proves they can win, it makes a big difference in the eyes of voters, donors and volunteers.\u0026nbspIf a candidate performs poorly in Iowa, donors, volunteers and voters can view it as a sign that the campaign isn’t viable and take their time and dollars elsewhere.\u0026nbspBernie Sanders leads 2020 Democrats with massive fundraising haulThat perception is aided and amplified by the media presence surrounding the whole ordeal. \u0026nbspIn his 2008 book Grassroots Rules: How the Iowa Caucus Helps Elect American Presidents,\u0026nbspChristopher Hull reports that the Iowa Caucus 143 times as much media coverage as other presidential primary elections.So the importance of the caucus isn’t so much indicative of some Iowan power of precognition or their great representation of the American appetite, but rather its power comes from the importance that we – the gawking masses – put on the results.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I suddenly had to find a months money.I didnt know what I was going to do.Nichola, who works for a charity and used to be a benefits adviser, wasnt eligible for the Flexible Support Fund or a budgeting loan to help with the costs.She added: I looked at every opportunity for some help, but I dont have a wealthy family, or someone in the area to look after my child.Nichola says the current system unfairly penalises lower earners, when other childcare systems dont require Brits to fork up upfront.And like many working mums, over the school holidays she has to folk out thousands of pounds extra upfront too.Its women who are struggling the most here,  per cent of single-parent families are women, she added.I dread to think what its like for people on minimum wage, how they can afford it.How can you justy paying childcare costs upfront for someone earning £, in advance, but not someone who is on £, Its so frustrating, so detrimental, to iniduals lives, and potentially hundreds of thousands of lives.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. Luckily her new job allowed her to cut her hours and work from home to make the situation work for her.But she hopes the DWP will shake-up the system for it to help others in future get back into work.A DWP spokesperson said: We cannot comment on an ongoing case."},{"url":null,"title":"eu uk leave brexit independent","story":"Forty-seven years and  days after we joined. Three decades since the rot set in with the drive towards a United States of Europe. Seven years after David Cameron promised a referendum and ½ traumatic years since Leave won it. It is hard to exaggerate the magnitude of this moment.Or the relief that Brexit, after all the ision and rancour, will at last be done. That our democracy ­ultimately prevailed over those who fought to thwart it.Other EU nations saw their referendums overturned or ignored. We would not be bullied into a rethink.It is true that nothing much will change this year during the “transition period”. But at pm Brexit becomes irreversible.We will be the first country to leave the EU. And in The Sun’s view we will never rejoin, never again surrender our independence.Instead we will be firing the starting gun on a new era full of excitement, potential and promise:The birth of a new Britain, setting our own laws, controlling our borders and trading independently with the entire world.This will not be Little Britain — quite the opposite. Brexit is not some nostalgic fantasy about the Empire.We will be outward-looking, a magnet for the brightest and best migrants — and for those already making a living here, a permanent, welcoming home.Many Sun readers will be ecstatic to be out. Some not so much. We understand that.But this paper — which was always pro-Common Market but increasingly eurosceptic as the EU grabbed more and more of our ­sovereignty — backed leaving all the way.So we want to pay tribute here to the heroes of Brexit, the men and women without whom it would never have happened:Boris Johnson, who went from eurosceptic Brussels reporter to charismatic figurehead of the Leave campaign and finally to the Prime Minister whose election victory last December  assured he could deliver Brexit.Michael Gove, his cerebral and articulate Cabinet ally who sacriced political and personal friendships to fight for his principles.Dominic Cummings, the campaign genius who with Matthew Elliott and the Vote Leave team triumphed against huge odds in  and last year helped orchestrate Boris’s ­decisive win at the polls.Nigel Farage, the controversial former Ukip chief whose pressure forced David Cameron in  to offer a referendum — and whose Brexit Party then terried the Tories into getting serious about delivering Brexit in full . . . out of the single market and customs union.Dan Hannan, the brains behind the project for  years, whose powers of persuasion rallied Tories to the cause. His ally Douglas Carswell was pivotal too.Jacob Rees-Mogg, Iain Duncan Smith, Steve Baker, Bill Cash and their ERG of Tory backbenchers whose refusal to compromise was admirable, evenThe Sun did despair of it when it threatened to destroy Brexit entirely.They have been vindicated. As has the ERG’s founder, the late ex-Tory MP Michael Spicer.We salute the Tory Cabinet ministers who campaigned for Brexit — notably Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, Home Secretary Priti Patel and Environment Secretary Theresa Villiers.From the Labour benches, Gisela Stuart and Kate Hoey shattered the Left’s bizarre consensus that the EU is a near-flawless bastion of liberal values and backed Leave.Ex-Labour MP Caroline Flint, like millions of other Remainers, insisted that upholding the result and our democracy was paramount.But other heroes and heroines planted the seeds of Brexit much earlier.Such as Corbyn’s idol Tony Benn, who before the first referendum on our Common Market membership in  rightly said it “would mean the end of Britain as a completely self-governing nation”.Margaret Thatcher, who in  discovered EC president Jacques Delors plotting to hand back union powers she had removed. She was having none of that — as her famous Bruges speech made clear.Later, as calls grew for yet more Brussels control, she told the Commons: “No, no, no.”The Sun’s “Up Yours, Delors” front page in  summarised our own feelings.Eurosceptic tycoon James Goldsmith launched the Referendum Party in  with just one policy: a vote on EU membership. Three years later Ukip picked up the baton.But not all our Brexit heroes backed Brexit.Many of its most outspoken opponents inadvertently steered millions towards Leave, hardened their resolve and even turned Remainers into Brexiteers:David Cameron, who promised a referendum he was far too confident he would win and catastrophically misjudged the electorate.George Osborne, whose apocalyptic predictions failed to terry Leave voters.Angela Merkel, whose refusal to give Cameron a better deal for Britain cost both dear.And the EU’s Jean-Claude Juncker, Donald Tusk and Michel Barnier, whose sneering and threats emboldened rather than cowed us. Likewise the EUParliament’s Guy Verhofstadt, who foolishly let a camera crew capture his team boasting of turning the UK into a “colony”. Imagine the effect that had.Then, of course, there’s Jeremy ­Corbyn, who damaged the Remain campaign and then gted Boris a stonking mandate.And ex-Lib Dem leader Jo “revoke Brexit” Swinson, who agreed to last month’s election under the delusion she could win it — but managed only to lose her own seat.There’s John Bercow, the ex-Speaker whose blatant bias and constitutional trickery convinced Leavers they made the right call. And his arrogant Tory co-conspirators Dominic Grieve and Oliver Letwin, who hoped to establish a Remainer pseudo-Government to enforce a second referendum — testing the public’s patience to their own destruction.Let’s not forget too the former Tories who merely pretended to “respect the referendum”, notably Anna Soubry, who then said single market and customs union membership was inevitable and charmingly told Leavers: “Suck it up”. And how about the glittering cast of Remoaner foghorns Take Tony Blair who, but for The Sun and others, would have forced us  years ago into the disastrous euro — the “burning building with no exits” as William Hague accurately described it.Blair, who then opened our borders to a flood of low-skilled migrants, ­further exposing the folly of free movement.Or his old spin doctor Alastair Campbell and former lackey Andrew Adonis, whose deranged doom-mongering and playground insults hardened Leavers’ hearts and repelled pragmatic Remainers at the same time.Or John Major, whose decision to adopt the  Maastricht Treaty, tying us even closer to the EU — but without a referendum — turbo-charged euroscepticism. A man whose increasingly shrill anti-Brexit outbursts merely convinced Leavers they were right.And how about the clueless celebs who thought abusing Leavers would compel them to think the “correct” thoughts  Or the BBC, whose routine europhile propaganda delivered vast numbers of votes for Leave  But there are Brexit heroes still greater than any of these:They are the .million voters, many Sun readers among them, who braved every threat and every slur, backed Leave in  and stuck to their guns last December.The Sun salutes you.Brexit will not be plain sailing. We are under no illusions. But we are convinced a fully independent Britain has a rosier future.And YOU made it happen. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

At last we will take back control of trade, human rights and migration.You will forgive us I hope, Mr Juncker, a moment of celebration as we raise a glass to an independent and prosperous future. It has been a hard path to get to this point — one you, of all people, know.But as we drink and make merry you — and everyone  from Amsterdam to Zakynthos — should know this.We are not going to wake up tomorrow morning feeling any less European.Ireland, France, Belgium and the Netherlands will still be our neighbours.We will still be eating Brie and driving Volkswagens, and we will still be sending brown saucein the other direction.Indeed, we might now feel more European.No longer will we have to worry about those fabled traffic jams which were going to block the M. We won’t be bothered about the planes not taking off or shelves emptying of fresh food.We will be able to get on with sharing and enjoying European civilisation.We will still be watching European football matches and knocking back German beer. We will still be taking holidays on Spanish beaches, Greek Islands and French ski slopes.It’s not you, dear European friends . . . it’s EU. You see, Britain never did fit well into the structures of the European Union.Our legal system was never very compatible with the European Court of Justice. Our farmers never did get on with the Common Agricultural Policy.We never did take kindly to the undemocratic European Commission, from which directives used to spring without most us even being aware of what was coming.Our political traditions were incompatible, we had a dferent attitude to regulation and business. The tragedy of this was that “Europe” became a dirty word.It became a byword for inefficiency, for overbearing rules, for having things foisted on us that we didn’t really want.But from pm tonight, all that goes. Europe can go back to being synonymous with culture, good food, great landscapes.And we are in good company.

The conditions are right to put the ­ision and rancour behind us. For our United Kingdom to be truly united.That will mean Leavers respecting and understanding their opponents’ sorrow. A tall order, perhaps, given the vitriol they have endured, but essential.It will mean the more extreme Remainers ending the abuse — and resisting the temptation to seize triumphantly on any setbacks that now arise. Indeed, it would be better to let the very terms “Leavers” and “Remainers” fall into irrelevance and disuse.Ours is a great country, of course, but one with substantial problems and a deep ­economic ide.The new freedoms over our laws, money, borders and trade — and our powerful new Government — can be catalysts for a vibrant, energetic, prosperous and more harmonious new era where wealth and opportunity are sp evenly across the country.It can be achieved by everyone coming together.

The EU is living in the past, issuing bleak threats asstill dealing with the faint-hearted Theresa May Government and a country racked with self-doubt.It acts asBoris Johnson could even now negate Brexit by locking us into EU rules and ECJ judgments and allowing unfettered access to our fishing waters.But everything changed at the moment of his victory. His Government has a huge mandate and will sign the barest of free trade deals, or none, rather than sacrice ANY sovereignty.We will remain an integral part of the continent of Europe, physically and culturally. We can be the EU’s strongest friend as well as its neighbour.

Brexit parties were held from Cornwall to Cumbria.Parliament Square was awash with Union Jacks as Nigel Farage had a beano that he had been planning for  years, chucking a metaphorical milkshake over everyone who ever dissed him.But this was not VE Day.Where Brexit was celebrated, the mood was one of patriotic pride rather than euphoria unbound.This was a very British departure — respectful, self-effacing and anxious not to cause offence.We refrained from sticking up two fingers. We were scrupulously polite.The UK started le outside the EU with no Big Ben ringing the chimes of freedom, no firework display setting the post-Brexit sky ablaze, no laser show on the white clfs of Dover.The big moment came at pm rather than midnight — the UK, now as always, a little out of step with our continental cousins in Brussels — so it did not even feel like New Year’s Eve.By midnight — already am in sleepy old Brussels — the party was winding down.As we left the EU, Downing Street lit up with red, white and blue lasers and an image of Big Ben, complete with a recording of the bongs.But the door of  Downing Street stayed firmly shut as the Prime Minister hosted a private party for staff.For all the nation knew, Boris could have been having an early night with Carrie and Dilyn the dog.Downing Street was as deserted as the Marie Celeste.Here was the strangest thing about Friday night — the total absence of Boris Johnson.The PM had recorded a speech full of optimistic talk about making Brexit a “storming success” and bringing the nation back together.But the BBC and ITV both refused to broadcast the speech, as Downing Street aides had refused to let them film it.Soyou wanted to see what the British Prime Minister said about this truly momentous moment in British history, you could not have seen it on our state broadcaster’s channels. UNBELIEVABLE.The BBC news studio was bathed in Brussels blue, asin mourning — so censoring Boris felt small-minded, ­churlish and petty beyond belief.I strongly suspect that ­refusing to broadcast Boris’s big Brexit-night speech will turn out to be the beginning of the end for the licence fee.If the BBC cannot look like a state broadcaster on a night of historic national importance, then it never will.But we didn’t need the Beeb to tell us that this was history happening before our eyes.The biggest mandate for anything in British history had FINALLY been honoured. Democracy had triumphed.After more than  years inside the European federalist experiment, the British people were masters of their own destiny once more. And while the national mood on Friday night was respectful for the feelings of the losers, perhaps that was because there is no need for ­triumphalism when you know you have won.The clock struck pm and Leavers and Remainers were all suddenly extinct.All those eye-swivelling nutjobs threatening to shove a Brexit p coin up their pious rectums in protest no longer seemed like a threat to ­democracy.They seemed worthy of pity.But after all the toxic ­isions of the past four years, the wounds will not heal quickly.The most vicious insult thrown at those of us who dared to vote to leave the EU was that we would all soon be dead. And so it is a bitter irony to reflect that Tony Blair, Michael Heseltine, John Major, Lord Adonis, Gina Miller, Anna Soubry and all the rest will never live long enough to drag us back into the European Union.At long last, Brexit’s uncivil war is done.And why Because the roots of British democracy run deep.Once we had voted to leave, it was ultimately unthinkable that we would ever remain — despite the fervent wishes of almost the entire British establishment, from the House of Lords and House of Commons to the civil service, the BBC and big business.Once the people had spoken, in the end they had to be obeyed.No parliamentary paralysis could ever stop Brexit. No clever lawyers could thwart it forever.That historic moment on Friday night felt it had an historic inevitability about it.British democracy could not be denied. How did the arrogant, out-of-touch establishment ever imagine they could overrule the largest vote for anything in our history So au revoir, monsieur, and adios, senor and bye-bye, mein liebe herr. Except — we are not leaving Europe, are we We are only leaving the European Union — that unloved, corrupt, expansionist empire.And the British people have nothing but love in their souls for Europe.Here’s the great Brexit irony. The British are probably the most pro-European nation on the continent. We revere European culture, drink their wine, holiday at their beaches, cities and moun-tains, eat their fruit, vegetables and cheese and buy their cars.But the British have always been a lousy fit in the EU.We do not like having leaders who we cannot kick out.We do not enjoy unelected old geezers in foreign cities telling us who can and can’t come into our country.We — one of the oldest democracies in the world, a country that has not been invaded for , years — truly do not need anyone  to make our laws or to tell us what justice looks like.The EU just lost its second-largest contributor while the largest contributor — Germany — teeters on the edge of recession.We should try to be understandingthey sound bitter.Our stormy relationship with the EU has lasted all my adult le.The first time I ever voted was in the  referendum, when I girded my flared jeans and enthusiastically voted “Yes to Europe”.But like my nation, over the course of the decades I fell out of love with the EU.Like my nation, I began to feel that I had been lied to about what the project really meant.Like my nation — and around .million of my countrymen in  — the thought of “ever greater union” made my skin crawl. For I believed with all my heart and soul that my great nation’s identity is worth preserving.Leo Varadkar, the Irish premier, sneers that the UK must “come to terms with the fact that it is now a small country”.Leo’s line is that the UK is now an isolated little rain-lashed rock, cowering timidly off the coast of the mighty European Union empire.But it doesn’t feel like we are a small nation today.It feels like we are a global nation once again, open for business with the world.It feels like we are the world’s sixth-largest economy, a cultural superpower, a warrior nation with a nuclear deterrent and the best armed forces in the world, the oldest parliamentary democracy on the planet and the longest-reigning monarch in history.All of that, plus the new added ingredient of post-Brexit va-va-voom.And in a Europe blighted by fragile coalitions and leaders with feet of blancmange, the UK boasts a popular Prime Minister presiding over the strongest, most stable government in Europe.British democracy has a far longer history than the European Union.If we were a small nation, then we would never have had the guts to leave the EU.If we were a small nation, then after the EU referendum of , we would have done what all those other EU countries did when they came up with a referendum result that Brussels didn’t like.We would have voted again, until Michel Barnier put down his cane.But the UK was always dferent.Unlike so many of our neighbours, we have not known the terror of fascism and communism, we have never experienced the jackboots of an invading army on our land, we have never seen our country chopped up by cruel foreign conquerors.We are a small nation in size but, through the centuries, we have always proved too big to bully.And what now The extremist voices — on both sides of the Brexit debate — will fade away because extremism is never the British way.Even with a year of transition and haggling about trade ahead, Brexit feels like it is slipping into the history books.The EU referendum in the summer of  seems long ago now.But as I recall, all we ever wanted was for our country to be a self-governing, sovereign nation once more and to restore the freedoms bought with the sacrice of the generations who came before us.Big Ben was silent on Friday night, but did you hear the church bells ring in all the faraway towns That is the sound of a country that just got its mojo back.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Last year from April to December, we received more than , boxes.“They’ve all got to be opened and,there’s an email address, acknowledged.“We try to be organised but you are talking about cardboard boxes with pants in them, all labelled, on the floor.”The charity started out small in  with Maria asking friends and family to donate towards a target of , pants for charities in Africa.She was overwhelmed when she received , pairs and delivered them to orphanages, hospitals and refugee camps in Kenya.She said: “These kids do not have underwear, they’re wearing rags and sometimes plastic bags.”Maria registered the charity in  and was working with friends from her home in Livingston, West Lothian.She said: “I managed it really well until  when we went viral on Facebook. We went from  likes to , in a week.”Maria recruited more volunteers and left her insurance job to go part-time at the charity.She said: “Imagine you didn’t have any underwear – how would you go about your day “Our work means girls get to go to school and stay in school.CARING husband and we Terry and Annette Marsh were so disappointed by the lack of sports facilities for ­disabled youngsters in their area, they decided to set up a club just for a few months.That was more than  years ago and the Hampshire Harriers has since gone on to help hundreds of young people, disabled and able-bodied, to participate in sports on equal terms.Wheelchair basketball is the club’s forte and many of its members have gone on to gain confidence and better health while several have excelled to ­represent Great Britain.New arrivals to the club, however, often find their heavy wheelchairs make it dficult to compete, so Terry and Annette visit schools regularly with the old-style chairs to show able-bodied pupils just how hard it is for their disabled classmates to get around.Modern, lightweight made-to-measure sports wheelchairs are expensive, ranging from £, to £,-plus, but the donation of £, from The Sun Readers’ Fund will buy new wheelchairs for four more disabled youngsters.Retired labourer Terry, , who is still the head coach and treasurer for the Portsmouth-based club, said: “I was shocked when I heard we had been chosen to receive the money from Sun readers. It’s wonderful and will make a real dference.”He added: “We’ve got one young lad who is typical. His father said he used to sit at home all day just playing on his computer because he felt he could not get involved in sport because of his ­disability. He is now a changed person.“He has become more sociable, more independent and goes to watch sport as well as playing it with us.“It’s so nice to see the change in youngsters when they are given the chance to get involved.”FOUNDED in honour of seven-year-old Madison Allan – who died from cancer on Boxing Day  – Maddi’s Butterflies offers other children fighting the disease a chance to have a holiday in a specially adapted caravan in Blackpool.And a £, donation from The Sun has now guaranteed it can continue for another three years.Maddi’s Butterflies was set up in  by Madison’s parents Samantha, , and Mark, , who also have ten-year-old daughter, Scarlett.In its first year, they raised enough money to buy a six-berth caravan in their home town of Blackpool, where up to  families a year can now enjoy a break from hospitals and cancer treatment.Samantha, who runs the charity full-time alongside three employees, said: “Maddi was diagnosed with neuro- blastoma, a rare childhood cancer of the nerve tissue, in July , aged only ten months old. It changed our lives forever.“Maddi hated hospitals and despite how poorly she was, she was determined to come home for Christmas in her final year.She managed to open her main present, an iPad, and although she was too ill to eat, she sat with the whole family for Christmas dinner, taking it all in.“She had fought so hard, stayed so positive and suffered so much.When she left us the next day it was ­gentle and peaceful.”A precious family break at a caravan in Blackpool during Maddi’s final months inspired Samantha to offer the same opportunity to others.She says: “The ­caravan is somewhere families can relax and spend happy time together.“Travelling abroad is often impossible, but this is accessible to everyone.”But the charity struggled with the costs and came near to having to close down.Samantha says: “When I heard we were going to receive The Sun money, I cried with relief.“Maddi was our hero, and her strength and determination in le continues through ­us helping other children like her.”THEY are a hardy bunch in the ­Scarborough And Ryedale Mountain Rescue Team.

For  years Great Grimsby was a solid brick in Labouraposs “Red Wall” which, until December, reached across the Midlands and North. North East Lincolnshire, which includes the North Sea fishing port, backed Brexit by % to % in . Labour’s MP during the referendum campaign, Mel Onn, was a Remainer who, immediately after the result, realised Labour was in dangerit failed to respect the outcome. She was surprised to hold the seat at the  election. But in the two years between then and the  ballot, Brexit dominated politics and she realised she was doomed. “I wasnapost surprised,” says Onn of her defeat. “There was a noise growing in the area that was not positive and it became quite obvious, particularly when the campaign started, that people were not keen.” Voters “increasingly” believed it was “Labouraposs fault” that Brexit was being delayed, “that we were blocking it, too clever for our own good and we were ignoring what they said and wanted”, she says.  While Boris Johnson was pledging to “Get Brexit Done”, Jeremy Corbyn was promising another vote - and initially refused to say whether he would support Leave or Remain. When he finally broke his silence, he declared he would be neutral. Many believe that unclear position - designed not to alienate Labour Remainers, while also trying to keep alive the Brexit hopes of Labour Leavers - sounded the death knell for Labour in seats like Great Grimsby. Onn admits her attempts to make Brexit happen, and convince voters she respected their decision to Leave, were “completely incompatible” with the frontbenchaposs pro-Remain message and push for a second referendum. “It felt asthe Labour Party had convinced itself that even though it didnapost have a majority in Parliament for a aposPeopleaposs Voteapos, one was going to come and would deliver a dferent outcome from the  referendum,” she says. “There was no real evidence for any of that but everybody had talked themselves into it. “It was increasingly frustrating – andyou think itaposs going to go down well in places like Grimsby, that you say, aposLetaposs do it all againapos – no amount of explaining is going to make them feel any better about it.”  Corbyn was “very unpopular on the doorstep”, with people telling canvassers they “thought he was for other people, he wasnapost for them”. She adds: “His internationalism had been interpreted by people that heaposs much more interested in things going on overseas than concentrating on the issues affecting people here. “There was concern around the stories of people heaposd associated with – Hamas, the IRA. “I know people around Corbyn say thataposs a smear but whether itaposs true or not doesnapost matter because it was absolutely ingrained.” Some Labour supporters were in tears as they confessed they would not back the party, Onn reveals. Others were angry at Corbyn for not singing the National Anthem and accused him of lacking patriotism. “In the end there was an overwhelming, howling rejection of what Labour was offering,” she says. “It felt like they hated us, like they saw the Labour Party as a bit of a joke.” With Brexit done and a new party leader announced on April , many hope Labour can rebuild the Red Wall. But Onn, who is backing Lisa Nandy for the top job, warns: “I donapost think the Labour Party can rely on those people automatically coming back. “It will be a tough challenge.”  Labour had held Great Grimsby from . Previous MPs include Anthony Crosland, a former Foreign Secretary, and Austin Mitchell, who represented the constituency for  years from . Labour’s majority declined from , in  to just  in . There was a brief uptick to , in  when Onn was newly-elected. But in  that plummeted to , - and on December  Tory Lia Nici won a , majority. Mitchell expected Labour to lose the election, but was stunned when Grimsby fell. “I expected Labour not to win because Corbyn wasn’t a popular character and we had a cram-bag of policies which was too big and too bulky, so there was clearly a problem when we started out,” he says. “But I never thought we’d lose Grimsby – Grimsby has been loyal to Labour. “Ever since the War it has had Labour MPs and I could see no reason why that would change. “Grimsby is a naturally Labour town.” He blames Corbyn, a manesto voters did not believe was deliverable, and Labour’s Brexit policy.  “Elections are a choice between two leaders. The argument in America is, ‘Which one do you want to have a beer with ’” he says. “Most people would rather have a beer with Boris - evensome of it got spilt - than with Corbyn, who would be having a milkshake. “Corbyn is a nice man and a good man and a principled man. “But he was viewed as disloyal and the friend of Britain’s enemies. “Grimsby is nothingnot a patriotic town. People are very patriotic.” He believes Brexit played a “substantial” role in Labour’s defeat here, with voters thinking the party “helped sustain” the rows which repeatedly delayed departure. “The responsibility of the Opposition is to see the Government fulfils the wishes of the people – not to say that people are wrong and start overruling them and telling them they’ve made a terrible mistake and been very naughty,” he says. “We failed in that direction. Corbynaposs instincts were probably in favour of Brexit but he was put under terric pressure by the euro enthusiasts who threatened to create endless trouble unless he turned Labour into a Remain party. “It was damn silly.” He accuses the frontbench of targeting “the metropolitan vote that might go to the Liberals rather than appeal to places like Grimsby, which had been strongly in favour of Brexit”. “I don’t think the policy was geared in any way towards the needs of Grimsby, it was geared to middle-class London voters,” says Mitchell. Labour “looked like a party of London smart alecks”, he adds. “Our rank and file members are idealistic, naïve and enthusiastic, but out of tune with the basic conservatism of this country.” While “most of thepolicies played well in Grimsby because they were aimed at benefiting the less well-off and the working class, it was a programme for  years rather than five years,” he says. “If you cram too much in people think, ‘Where the hell is the money coming from ’ “It looks like a fairyland proposal. The policies were so expensive and so numerous it looked like it was going to be chaos. “People didn’t believe in fairyland.” He thinks Labour became a “coalition of causes instead of a party representing the working class”. He praises the - Labour Government for measures like the minimum wage, but claims: “All the goodies were concentrated on the big cities where the voters were rather than on the small towns. “Grimsby continued to have problems, it didn’t get enough support and it was the last to receive the benefits the Labour Government was offering.” Mitchell believes Labour will eventually win back the seat but “it’s going to be a long and dficult job” - and will only comethe party focuses on “the wellbeing of the ordinary people of this country”, he says. Voters in Grimsby issued a damning verdict on Labour today. Lelong Labour supporter Martyn Mortlock, , voted Tory in December. Echoing the Tory campaign slogan, the car painter said: “I wanted to aposget Brexit doneapos and they were the only ones that were promising it. “I voted Out in the referendum – and still I wanted Out in December.”  Shop worker Angela Wilkinson, , voted for the Brexit Party – helping slash Labouraposs hopes of retaining Grimsby. She last voted Labour  years ago but drted away because “of the mess they made of the country, and the Iraq War”. But while Corbyn was a steadfast opponent of the  US-led invasion, Angela was unable to support him as Labour leader. She said: “I donapost like him. “If the leader had not been Jeremy Corbyn I may have voted Labour, but he was too pro-immigration. “He wouldnapost have come out of the EU, he would have been quite happy to stay in. “I voted Out in  because I didnapost like the money that was wasted. “It should have gone into things like our NHS, which is falling to pieces. “Hopefully being outside the EU will help our fishing industry.” Asked how she would vote next time, now Brexit has happened, she said: “I like Borisaposs policies but Iaposm not sure heaposs right for the job. “He comes across as a bit of an idiot, not really that mature.”  Former RAF man Trevor Green, , also blamed Corbyn for his decision to vote Conservative. He said: “I didnapost like Labouraposs leader for starters. “Heaposs a terrorist sympathiser and Iaposm ex-Forces, thataposs why I couldnapost touch the Labour Party – and the manesto was c**p. “The Labour MP here was on a hiding to nothing.” He was unsure whether he wouldto Labour. “I want to see what the policies are,” said Trevor. “But Iaposve got to give this guya chance to try and turn things round.”  Retired nurse Kathryn Piggott, , planned to vote Tory for the first time having supported Leave in . But she was at a funeral on polling day and did not cast a ballot. Revealing why she has abandoned Labour, she said: “A very high percentage of people in Grimsby voted to Leave the EU. “Melanie Onn was a brilliant MP but I donapost think she represented the wises of the people of Grimsby on Brexit. “I come from a staunch Labour family but I just thought that voting Conservative would aposget Brexit doneapos.” She added: “I donapost think Jeremy Corbyn has good leadership qualities. “I remember a debate way back when he said thatwe faced a nuclear attack he wouldnapost press the button. “Heaposs also had alliances that maybe he shouldnapost have.” She did not knowLabour could win her back, saying: “Letaposs seethey have a credible leader that is for the people, that promotes industry and jobs in this country.” "},{"url":null,"title":"hs2 doesnt go ahead itll","story":"NewsopinionIf HS doesnt go ahead itll mean  years of travel misery - and theres no alternativeLabours Hilary Benn says the voices urging the Boris Johnson to scrap the scheme are “profoundly mistaken”ShareByHilary Benn:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsopinion \" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters. Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailBuried at the back of the business pages of a national newspaper this week was a letter that set out starkly why we need HS. Sent by Network Rail, it warned thatthe project doesn’t go ahead then there will be three decades of travel misery on the trains, with shutdowns across all major lines every weekend, to relieve pressures on the existing network. This goes to the heart of the argument around HS. There is simply no real alternativewe want to create a world-class rail network that will allow people and businesses - large and small - across the North to thrive. Together with Northern Powerhouse Rail, linking the great cities of the North east to west from Liverpool through to Hull, it will create a network that can help us make the most of our potential. Our railways have seen no investment on this scale in new lines since the Victorian era, and we know that the North has long been short-changed when it comes to transport spending.  As a result, trains are congested and unreliable, frequently leaving passengers stranded and frustrated. How are we to create a thriving economy in the North, attracting businesses from all over the world, when a journey from Leeds to Manchester – theof the Central Line on the London Underground – can take well over an hour on a packed, three-carriage train  There are voices - including disappointingly some from our region - who are urging the Prime Minister to scrap HS. I think they are profoundly mistaken and I am proud to have fought for it alongside the business community and leaders in local government like Judith Blake, our Council leader in Leeds and Sir Richard Leese in Manchester, along with colleagues from all parties in Parliament. After months of delay, the Government is expected this week finally to make a decision. We need this vote of confidence in the UK because any scaling back of the project, to appease those who oppose the scheme, would be a betrayal of the North. The Government will be judged on the promises it has made. Empty soundbites about ‘levelling up’ are simply not enough.  HS is above all about capacity and connectivity. New high-speed lines will allow trains to run more smoothly and reliably around our network. Far from being a fast train to London, it will link up the North and the Midlands, opening up new job opportunities for people who currently can’t get to work that far from their own town or city. The journey from Leeds to Birmingham, which at just under two hours barely anyone uses on a regular basis, would drop to just over  minutes, so opening up the East Midlands and South Yorkshire regions for businesses to grow.

I wasn’t able to drive. “I had  appointments altogether and I got a sick note from the doctor.” She added: “I’ve always worked hard and feel like I’ve been kicked in the teeth.  Now Natalie has lost her appeal in a last-ditch attempt to be reinstated. She claims the outcome has increased her anxiety-levels. She added: “I suffer badly with anxiety and I’ve barely slept since I was let go. “Now I’ve got to find a new job and I’m so nervous about meeting new colleagues. “I won’t be able to use MS for a reference and it’s not my fault that I wasn’t very well. “I’ve provided for my family for so long that it feels strange not to get up and go to work. I feel like Iaposve lost my purpose. “I was heartbroken to lose my job. I couldn’t drive home I was crying that much. I cried for two hours in the car park before I could drive home.”  MS carried out an investigation after Natalie lodged her appeal. In a letter to Natalie, the company stated: During a meeting you raised you were feeling discriminated against and that you did not believe your dismissal to be fair when your absences were genuine. I have investigated the absence review meetings and the outcome letters sent to you and I am satisfied that the MS absence policy has been followed and no discrimination has taken place. Therefore, I do not uphold this point of your appeal. MS says it cannot aposdiscuss inidual casesapos.

Following a Sunday People campaign, Labour MP Mike Amesbury will introduce a bill this week which is likely to become law by spring. Schools will be told they can specy basic items such as trousers and shirts - but not styles. This means parents can buy cheaper supermarket kit instead of branded gear from a single suppliers that cost an average £ a year for secondary schools and £ for primaries. Dad Howard Callaway, , and we Karen, , dread the cost of fitting out their children with compulsory branded kit. Mum-of-three Karen, a teaching assistant in Hull, said: “We can’t afford three branded sets so this news is fantastic.”  Mr Amesbury said: “Head ­teachers will be required to draw up a totally ­inclusive unorms policy. This issue has been ­brilliantly highlighted by the Sunday People.” Nearly one in six families say school unorm costs are to blame for them having to cut back on food and other basic essentials, compared with one in seven in . One parent told the Poverty Commission: “The cost of school unorms is like having to afford two Christmases. You start shopping at the beginning of the summer holiday, so you can pace yourself over the six weeks. “To do that you have to take money out of the food budget, or less on the electric. But this stuff is essential, so you have to afford it.”  Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner wrote to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson asking him to honour the pledge the Tories made four years ago. They promised to bring in statutory guidance in a bid to end the practice of forcing parents to buy unorms from one expensive supplier. But it never happened. The new law would force the Government to follow the example of Wales, where school heads can specy basic items, such as trousers and shirts, but not styles – so parents can shop around. Private Members Bills give backbench MPs priority time in Parliament to introduce their own laws.  A draw takes place and twenty MPs are picked at random who are allowed to decide on a subject of their choice. The higher up on the list the MP comes the more chance he or she will get Parliamentary time to see the Bill through all its stages.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThree British Airways crew members have sued the airline for more than £, after battling to help passengers escape from a plane fire. Marie Dyos, Lynette Robinson and Suely Goncalves-McLoughlin sued BA because theyaposve suffered post traumatic stress disorderfollowing the blaze. They were on duty when one of the Boeing aposs engines burst into flames at McCarran Airport in Las Vegas, Nevada, in September . It was bound for Gatwick Airport but the pilot had to execute an emergency evacuation. And City of London Court today heard the cabin crew members dashed to make passengers safe as black smoke billowed from a wing. They remained onboard until all passengers had left. But the lawyers allege negligence by BA in failing to follow the engine fire checklist, leading to  gallons of fuel spilling onto the runway and allegedly feeding the fire. They say the captain was also at fault. Judge Stephen Hellman QC ruled against BA. Ms Robinson, , had opened a door on the right hand side of the plane, but the escape chute was unusable due to the blast from the still-running right engine. Martin Haukeland, representing the women, said Ms Robinson, of Peacehaven, East Sussex, is now haunted by nightmares and flashbacks and remains anxious and hyper vigilant.  She is undergoing further treatment and a final prognosis awaits this. The current view is that the prognosis is poor, the lawyer told the court. Ms Robinson claimed £,. Miss Goncalves-McLoughlin also opened a door on the right side of the plane to release the escape chute and hurt her ear and eyes. Mr Haukeland added: When she looked out, her eyes were exposed to high velocity particles thrown up by the still running right-hand engine. The woman, from St Leonards on Sea, East Sussex, also suffers from PTSD, is plagued by intrusive memories, and remains socially withdrawn and hyper-vigilant, the lawyer added. Miss Goncalves-McLoughlin got £,.  Mrs Dyos, of Horley, Surrey, has since continued to work for BA, but is struggling to cope with symptoms of her PTSD, the court heard. She claimed £,. She is undergoing treatment for her anxiety, and although currently able to carry on, the future of her chosen career remains unclear. The prognosis - for her principal symptom of anxiety - is poor and she will probably be unable to continue in her current work as cabin crew, Mr Haukeland explained. But BA denies all blame. All the passengers survived the fire but  were injured, mostly when exiting the plane by the escape chutes. Defence lawyers dispute the crew failed to follow the engine fire checklist and also deny the pilot was to blame in ordering evacuation before shutting down the right engine. The case reached court in a pre-trial clash as British Airways tried to block the womenaposs claims from going ahead in the UK.  Lucy Wyles, barrister for the airline, pointed out that all three have settled separate lawsuits brought against The Boeing Company and GE Aviation Systems LLC in the United States. In the US case - settled in  - Miss Goncalves-McLoughlin received , , while Ms Robinson and Mrs Dyos each walked away with , . The three women have made clear they accept that any UK award will have to give credit for their US settlement pay-outs, the court heard.

The adult suffered an injury that will require surgery, police said, and the attack is being treated as a hate crime. It happened in Omagh, County Tyrone, in Northern Ireland, on Saturday night. A -year-old man has been charged with eight offences including making threats to kill, grievous bodily harm with intent, possession of an offensive weapon, criminal damage and harassment. Witnesses said the man attacked the house, shouted racial slurs and attempted to force his way past a -year-old man to get inside the property at about .pm, police said. A PSNI spokesman said: A -year-old woman and three-year-old boy who were inside the home were so in fear that they jumped from a first-floor window to try to get away.  As a result, the woman has sustained pelvic injuries that will require surgery. The child was not harmed. We are treating this incident as a hate crime and I am appealing for witnesses. Hate crime has no place in society and should be rejected and reviled by everyone.

Doctors and nurses dressed in full hazmat gear and goggles helped deliver the healthy .lb boy on February  -  days after Wuhan, China, was first put on lockdown. Footage from Wuhan Union Hospital, one of the facilities on the front line of the viral outbreak in Central China’s Hubei Province, shows Dr Song Bo holding the newborn boy. The hospital’s isolation unit is the designated national location for pregnant patients diagnosed with or suspected of having the Wuhan coronavirus. Dr Song, who is pictured wearing goggles and a full decontamination suit, said: “The patient successfully gave birth to a ,-grammeboy. “The child is healthy and everyone is very happy. He’s been sent to Wuhan Children’s Hospital for further tests. “As a father-of-two myself, it’s been tough being on the front line day and night, but we’re all so excited to see this new le. “I believe we will win the fight against this disease.” Medics such as Dr Song have been sent from numerous other provinces to assist with the influx of people at Wuhan Union Hospital. The now mum-of-two, named only as Ms Gong, was transferred to the hospital from China’s north-eastern province of Heilongjiang on st January. She was placed under the care of Dr Song, who is with the department of infectious diseases at the Fourth Hospital of Harbin Medical University in Heilongjiang. The new mum has been in isolation as a suspected carrier of the deadly pneumonia-like disease, while her husband remains in quarantine after having previously been diagnosed with the virus.

Doctor Li Wenliang, who worked at a hospital in Wuhan, sent a message to a group chat of medical students saying Quarantined in the emergency department - at the point when just seven patients were confirmed as infected. One member of the group chat replied saying So frightening before askingit could become as serious as the SARS epidemic that began in China and killed  people. Three days later, Dr Wenliang was arrested in the middle of the night after police turned up at his home. He was allegedly then made to sign a statement saying his actions were classed as illegal behaviour, reports The New York Times. The Chinese government has been criticised for attempting to suppress news of viral outbreak The coronavirus death toll in mainland China has overtaken the SARS epidemic of  while a new ,-bed hospital to help tackle the outbreak has been built in just eight days. Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan, where the virus originated, is one of two dedicated facilities being constructed with  deaths now confirmed since the outbreak started in December. Patients will begin to be admitted from later today, according to reports. Three-hundred and forty-eight people died on the Chinese mainland as a result of SARS almost  years ago. The hospital, Huoshenshan, or fire-god mountain, is designed to have , beds for patients with confirmed infections to ease a shortage of beds where in the city as the virus spreads. The epidemic has infected more than , in China and at least  overseas. There are more than , cases in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, state television said today. Construction of Huoshenshan was copied from a hospital built in Beijing in  that was dedicated to the fight against SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. More than , workers took part in the fast-build project, which commenced on January  and finished this weekend. China is also building a second hospital in Wuhan dedicated to the treatment of coronavirus patients, with , beds. Leishenshan, or thunder-god mountain, is scheduled to be completed on February . There are , confirmed cases of coronavirus, as of Sunday, the same day the first confirmed fatality outside China was announced.

Scientists say it may also bring a shortage of many popular wines forcing growers to plant grapes more resistant to climate change. Researchers, led by the University of British Columbia in Canada, say that over half of current wine-growing regions could be losttemperatures rise just C, a level the world is on track to exceed, hitting the cellar hard. A C rise would mean three-quarters of these areas would be lost, partly down to factors such as rainfall but the main driver will be heat, which may damage plants or speed up ripening, making the grapes too high in sugar. Some countries will be more affected than others, with those already warmer less able to compensate for future losses and hitting up to % of Italy and Spain’s grapes. The scientists said the damage could be mitigated by switching to grapes that perform better in the heat.  But this will mean the growers abandoning the grape ieties they have relied on for centuries, and the distinctive flavours of wines from regions such as Burgundy and Bordeaux are likely to be lost for ever. There are also complex rules about how wines are labelled. For example, the name “champagne” can only legally be usedthe sparkling wine comes from the Champagne region of France.

There is no suggestion that I personally falsied this email.“The suggestion is that I forwarded the email after it had been falsied by someone .“I refute the allegations made against me and I can confirm I will be appealing against my removal from my post.Mr Christie also said he felt that the penalty seemed to be “disproportionate” to the accusations made against him.“No other allegations have been made against me,” he said.“I have worked in my current role for  years and have had an association with the council for  years.“I continue to have a huge respect for my council colleagues, council officers and elected members.“This is a very unfortunate time for me and I will need to take time to look at things moving forward.“I don’t wish to say anything further at this stage but will be making my intentions clear in due course.”Blue Parrot had provided sound equipment for DSMT for previous shows.DSMT producer and manager Lina Waghorn said: “I am shocked and saddened that Kenny Christie is no longer working with the council.“He was a great asset to DSMT and an inspirational teacher.”It’s understood students at DSMT were informed on Sunday January  that Mr Christie was “moving on to new projects”.It was made clear to students he was not ing and that Kris Mordente, a St John’s Academy teacher, would be taking over director permanently.A source at DSMT said: “It’s just a bit strange that he’s gone. Kenny was DSMT and DSMT was Kenny. I don’t think anyone knows how we’re going to operate without him.“He had been growing distant for a while, we have only seen him three times since August and at one point Lina mentioned bringing in an assistant director.“It’s not something we’d expect, I think everyone here including Lina would be reluctant to let him go.”A Blue Parrot spokesman said the company was not awarded the DSMT contract because “strictly speaking, we did not meet the deadline.”A Dundee City Council spokesman said: “We do not comment on inidual personnel matters.”Kenny Christie has been described as one of the most “sought-after” musical theatre directors in the country.He has worked with DSMT for over  years, producing several musicals like Les Miserables and Annie.His directing career began at the age of , producing a one-act play as part of the SCDA drama festival.In , Mr Christie became the world record holder for the fastest theatrical production, taking one piece from book to stage in just . hours.He has also taught and organised dance workshops ,in Dundee and Perth, and has worked with Dundee City Council to organise dance activities for school pupils.Mr Christie has also held the title of chairman of the Heads of Instrumental Teaching Scotland, as well as being the first Youth Adviser for Scotland for the National Operatic and Dramatic Association.Kenny Christie’s sacking comes in the wake of a separate fraud scandal that has rocked Dundee City Council in the past year.In October, the council’s head of construction Mark Ross quit in the midst of an investigation into claims he was treated to a golfing trip on the Spanish coast by bosses of a firm awarded an £ million local authority contract.The £.m deal to provide heat and smoke and carbon monoxide detectors was awarded to Edmundson Electrical without going out to tender.The trip to Spain took place weeks after the contract was awarded and included Mr Ross, a senior Edmundson staff member, another council employee and representatives of two other firms.It was later revealed that the second council employee was Kenny Muir, who also worked in the council’s construction department.He was sacked from his role earlier this month.Mr Muir is the fourth senior employee to leave construction services since September, following the resignations of Mr Ross and electrical supervisor Iain Gardyne, who is accused of selling thousands of pounds’ worth of council smoke alarms online."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/05/5ce8028c52cc77.74312060-140x70.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"majority of dee squad havent done enough squad slammed by paul mcgowan","story":"“Probably only two, maybe three players, can look in the mirror and say they have done enough this season.

We gave away a silly free-kick and they scored from that and held out,” added McGowan.“They make things hard, go very direct and make it a horrible game. Credit to them, they have picked up some good results and nearly beat United at Tannadice last week.“We know what to expect and we have to be up for it.“That’s what they do, they go a goal up and make it hard, work their socks off all over the pitch and have players that can hurt you.“It will be a hard game at Cappielow so we’ll have to be at our best to get anything.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"united enforcer calum butcher urges winning run to seal promotion","story":"It’s in our hands, now let’s go get the title.That’s the message from Dundee United midfielder Calum Butcher.The Terrors welcome Arbroath to Tannadice tomorrow, sitting  points clear at the top of the Championship table.It looks a case of when notUnited will seal the deal and end their four-year absence from the Premiership.With glory so tantalisingly close with only  games remaining, Butcher is keen for United to kick on and wrap things up as soon as possible.Despite already smashing their targets until this point, the best way to do that, according to the -year-old, is get back to winning ways after a cup exit at the hands of Hibs and a draw with Morton in the past week.“We split the quarters and we knew at the start of the season to achieve promotion what kind of targets we needed to hit,” he said.“On the run we’re on we have exceeded that a little bit but we know there’s  games left and we have to win the majority of those to make sure we go up.“It’s in our hands and we know,we go out and perform like we can, we’ll do that.“I don’t think there’s any complacency, no one has got above their station and everyone is working for the team.“For us to achieve promotion, we need to stick together. There’ll be dips along the way, like Tuesday night, but we need to bounce back tomorrow.”First up for United is the challenge of Dick Campbell’s Red Lichties tomorrow afternoon.The teams have played out two tight games this season with United coming out on top by one goal on both occasions.However, a scrap wouldn’t bother Butch, so long as they pick up those all important three points.“They’re a dficult side to play against as we’ve seen, home and away,” he added.“It was tough at their place because of the conditions but the onus will be on us at home. It’s a dferent game.“Last week was dficult against Morton. They had something to hold on to but we did really well to come back into the game in the last minute.“It was a big point for us.“It was, obviously, very disappointing to go out on Tuesday night but, ultimately, it’s about the league and promotion.“It was a strange feeling to lose on Tuesday after such a long period without losing a game, so that’s something we’ve got to deal with. I think, personally and for the boys in the dressing-room, we were looking forward to tomorrow straight away just to get back out there and win a game again.“We’ve dusted ourselves off and we’re ready to go tomorrow.”A lot has been made of the rumours surrounding Lawrence Shankland’s future at the Tangerines as the January transfer window gets set to slam shut at midnight.However, Butcher insists the noise around their star man has had little affect on Shanks or the squad.“Lawrence is a great guy and since he’s come here, from day one, he’s got on with it.“He knew that he had to score goals and he’s done that. He’s been absolutely fantastic for us.“He deals with everything great. He’s not big time about it at all and doesn’t take things too far in terms of getting too high or too low.“It’s great for him but I think there’s a lot of boys in the dressing-room there’ll be speculation about because the side’s doing so well.“It’s something we’re having to deal with now and probably in the summer. It’s just one of those things but I think, at the moment, everyone is happy with how things are going.“Lawrence being here after the window is great.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets.

We did not have the new kitchen then. The hotel has always cooked the turkeys for us but cooking big pots of potatoes and vegetables was quite a job with just the gas rings. Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival. Later, Margaret dressed up as Mrs Brown from Mrs Brown’s Boys to entertain the audience, something for which she is well-known.Martin Jefferies thanked everyone who had helped make the evening such a success with the happy gathering agreeing with loud applause.By Joan Crooks"},{"url":null,"title":"winning start to new year for star youths","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe Now kicked off with a flying start for both Red Star s and s.The s headed to Glasgow in a top of the table clash against Glasgow Boys.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

Graham became the fourth generation Williamto work in the business after leaving school and in  took over the business when his father, Bill, retired.The Douglas family took over the building of the annual Border Union Show and Kelso Ram Sales in  and the Championship Dog Show since the first Show in , completing  years for the former and  years for the latter respectively in .It is interesting to note they succeeded Messrs. Bulman, builders Kelso who had been involved with BUAS since . To have had only two main Contractors in over  years is indicative of their skills and loyalties.Graham was very clever at school with a good practical brain and I heard from his le long friend, Andy Shortreed, that he was an expert at, among other things, technical drawing and would make all manner of things out of wood and other material.He was encouraged to study and utilise these skills while at High School in Hawick but Graham was stubborn! All he wanted to do was leave school and join his father, Bill, and be a fencer, which he duly did in .Countless number of farms and estates throughout the Borders have benefited from Grahamrsquos skill, as have the three core events at BUAS. His younger brother, Neil, was in partnership with Graham for a number of years before ing to utilising his skills with heavy plant machinery.I cannot have more regard and respect for Bill and Graham and how they nurtured me when I joined BUAS as Secretary in . I listened and I learnt from them all the ins and outs of both the Showground and preparing these massive annual Events and bringing them together in such a professional manner and with an uncanny calmness that sometimes was frustrating but one knew that come the day the target was reached. The Ram Sales have evolved over the last  years with many changes and updates and it was a pleasure working with someone who was always conscious of the huge responsibility he had to the many thousands of people, whose livelihoods were often very dependant on a good Ram Sales or a good Show, whether buying, selling, exhibiting, a Trade Stand, providing a service or a member of the public.Grahamrsquos other passion in le was his racing pigeons, which he has bred and raced for over  years - and for the last  with his friend and near neighbour in Lilliesleaf, Bob Spearman. They had many years of great fun and indeed numerous successes with their birds and it was always a great pleasure and exciting for those at the Showground when in the spring Graham would very often bring a crate of young birds when he came to work and released them as part of their early training. A master breeder even he did not understand how the young birds knew which direction was home!He had a great eye and would spend many long evenings just watching the birds to learn which would be potential race winners and which to keep as breeding stock. They had their fair share of success in UK races, whether from Edinburgh or the south coast of England but their biggest success was when one of their favourites ndash Bonnie Lad ndash finished th out , birds released from the South of France. No-one does fathom how these incredible birds find their way home and I believe these two wise owls were also baffled but enjoyed the discussion and banter over a pint or two in the local pub.

I thought it was worth a concerted effort to seewe could make a dference to the state of our streets to benefit everyone. I was prepared to make a personal commitment of time and effort to this cause.The project got off ground last January when Innerleithen community councillors made the decision to try and rid the streets of dog mess.Reflecting on the actions they undertook, Jackie said: ldquoI became involved after Gordon Daly taped plastic bottles to lampposts to dispense free poo bags to those in need.\"Susan Meikle and I offered to help these from supplies Gordon had procured from the Dogs Trust.The following month, the community council was encouraged by local authority councillors to apply for funding through the Localities Area Bid Fund.ldquoThis concentrated my mind and I took it upon myself to complete the application with offers of help from both a previous applicant and The Bridge, said Jackie.ldquoWe heard our project had been shortlisted to be put to the public vote in time for our May community council meeting.But the timetable for the public voting process was disrupted by other political happenings, and after a tense wait and a flurry of activity to encourage voting, good news was delivered.Jackie added: ldquoWe heard our bid was successful in time for our July meeting.\"Various conditions had to be met before the funds could be released, including  percent of the amount applied for supplied by us, copies of our constitution and accounts.ldquoHaving won the funding, final details of ordering, delivery, installation and maintenance had to be agreed.Whilst waiting on the new bins to arrive, the community councillors did not rest on their laurels.With the help of SBC leader Shona Haslam, Jackie and Gordon stencilled anti-fouling signs on problem pavements in Innerleithen.Community councillors also mapped out locations for the new bins and Scottish Borders Council agreed to install these and remove or relocate the redundant ones.ldquoOperationally, the local authority agreed to provide the litter bags and to replenish the poo bags with us taking responsibility for funding them, added Jackie.With the bins now in place, the community council is due to meet on Monday to discuss further fundraising initiatives.The townrsquos community council, in particular, the poo-busting trio of Jackie, Gordon and Susan, have worked tirelessly this last year to combat the dog fouling issue in Innerleithen.Nevertheless, inevitable questions remain.Will they no longer witness the flattened deposit bearing the imprint of a shoe, the stressed parent quickly steering their child away from the offending brown mess, or irritated adult repeatedly scraping their foot off a kerb Probably not says Jackie, adding: ldquoWas it worth it  Yes.\"And in the shorter term it has made a dference.\"Longer term, my feeling is that it will depend on continuing effort and collective ownership of the problem. People have generally been very supportive although every post on social media has triggered lsquothey wonrsquot ever pick up commentsrsquo.\"Despite the campaign Jackie says itrsquos unlikely that everyone will become law abiding citizens and pick up after their dog, but says shersquod do it all again in an effort to keep clean the streets and grass verges of the bonnie town she resides in."},{"url":null,"title":"michel-barnier-lays-eu-terms-fishing-deal-uk","story":"The European Union will link any access to its market for British products directly to the access that EU boats will be given to UK waters, the blocrsquos chief negotiator has said.EU negotiator Michel Barnier underscored the dficulties of the trade negotiations with Britain ahead for the rest of the year when he highlighted the small but emblematic fisheries industry, which was a key issue in the protracted Brexit process in the United Kingdom too.Mr Barnier told France Inter radio that ldquothere will be no trade deal with the Britishthere is no reciprocal access deal for our fishermen.Mr Barnier said ldquowe will negotiate access to the British territorial waters for European fishermen at the same time that we negotiate access to European markets for British fisheries products.ldquoI hope I make myself clear.Overall, the EU is willing to grant the U.K. the fullest possible access to its lucrative market of some  million consumers but onlyBritain abides by EU standards on such things state aid, social legislation or environmental protections.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has already indicated he does not want to make a binding commitment to remain in line with EU law, saying it was an essential principle in the move to walk away from the Union.Britain on Friday left the EU, becoming the first nation ever to do so.The official break-up came last Friday and Mr Johnson has said he wants a trade and cooperation deal by the end of the year, a time frame which the EU has called unrealistic..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Michel Barnier lays out EU terms for fishing deal with UK"},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week january 3 2020","story":"This week#s Photograph of the Week shows one of the best locations in Kintyre for one of those walks # The Gauldrons, at Machrihanish.The image, taken at sunset in November, was recently sent in by Alan Ogg, who said: #It just captures, for me, this wonderful stretch of beach.#Alan, who lives in Glasgow, met his we in Machrihanish in  while they were working in the Ugadale Hotel as a waiter and a porter, and it became their #favourite place on Earth#.Alan said: #I come down to this beautul area a few times each year.

I use this phrase to describe the spectacle of street lights at night when viewed from a vantage point.One of the best places in East Lothian to view the lsquoupside down skyrsquo is from the road by Farsquoside Castle. This vantage point gives you views over Wallyford, Musselburgh, Portobello and Edinburgh beyond.These urban areas create a sea of lights which look like a sky full of bright stars, except, of course, itrsquos lsquoupside downrsquo and theyrsquore not really stars. But it looks spectacular in its own way. In fact, views with bright city lights are these days often considered tourist attractions.But Irsquove recently realised something: while the lsquostarsrsquo of the lsquoupside down skyrsquo are getting more numerous and extensive every year, the real stars in the actual sky are becoming more dficult to see at least where I live.Literally thousands upon thousands of houses are being built in the western part of our county. Much of the rural landscape in this part of East Lothian, which I knew when I was a child, is going fast.Most of me understands and accepts the needs for this, but a part feels sad at the loss of a recognisable landscape. And already I have noticed that a by-product of this has been increased light pollution in areas close to where I live. It is going to get much more noticeable as more development takes place.I know many people will say there are many more things to think about, especially in late January, when the Christmas turkey is coming home to roost and all those bills have to be paid at a time when we are already financially drained from festive expenditure, and stressed out. Thank goodness for Burns suppers, a highlight of a month that often seems both the darkest and longest of the year.But this is all the more reason to pause. When was the last time you really had the opportunity to sit under a dark night sky full of visible stars  This is one of naturersquos free gts and stargazing has real benefits for our mental health and emotional wellbeing.I remember some years ago, when visiting a friend in a very rural part of Scotland, I went out to put something in the bin. My friend came out to seeI was OK, as I hadnrsquot ed after  minutes. I had been struck by the beauty and power of the starlit sky, unpolluted by city lights. Without noticing the time, I had sat just gazing at the universe above me.I can remember the sense of awe and peace it created. Sure, part of it was also the quiet and stillness in that area, but sitting under the canopy of stars is what overwhelmed me in that moment.Itrsquos an experience fewer of us can enjoy because of the increase in light pollution, but also noise and general busyness all around us. So we often donrsquot even realise what wersquore missing. Perhaps there is a cause and effect here: the less you notice the absence of something, the less you think itrsquos important or relevant.Our ancient ancestors understood its power. But I think we have lost the sense. I recently asked a group of young people how many of them had sat under the stars and just gazed and wondered at them. Sadly, none had done so, and some thought the idea ldquoweird. I think a lot of adults would share that opinion.But taking time to sit and really wonder at an unpolluted night sky can fill us with awe, as I experienced that evening at my friendrsquos house. It makes us feel small and in so doing it puts our worries and anxieties in perspective. It can promote inner peace and calm.For sure, the bills wonrsquot go away neither will the stress at work or whatever is dominating your thoughts most of the day. But in taking time to pause and wonder at the vast and almost timeless beauty of the stars, your soul gets time to catch up. It can help you see things dferently, in a more creative way. Itrsquos a form of meditation with something bigger than we can imagine, but also something incredibly beautul.And itrsquos fascinating, as you try to identy the dferent constellations, and perhaps realise how much you donrsquot know or have forgotten. Could you identy the northern star, and what constellations can you see  Sailors in days of old were experts at identying the stars to aid direction, but Irsquom sure they also marvelled at the unhindered beauty and mystery of them as well.There are still many places in our county where we can be wrapped in star-lit darkness. But as the lsquoupside down skyrsquo gets bigger and brighter, the real stars are fading in so many places.The real shame is, as the stars disappear from our sight, they may disappear from our consciousness as well.Letrsquos not let that happen. Let us gt our children, and ourselves, with the noticing and gazing at the real stars in our sky and somehow find the time, even briefly, to stargaze."},{"url":null,"title":"garry-oconnor-referees-haddington-amateur-teams-successful-charity-match","story":"Haddington Town FC took time out over the festive period for a special friendly in aid of Back Onside.Former Hibernian and Scotland striker Garry OrsquoConnor, who is an ambassador of the good cause, refereed the match, which saw members of the amateur teamrsquos squad come up against one another on January .Matt OrsquoConnell, chairman of the club, which was formed last year, said they were determined to help support the charity, which helps young people and adults who face mental health challenges.He said: ldquoWersquore a club that was founded on the idea of bringing local guys together into a positive social and active environment.ldquoItrsquos well documented that the highest proportion of suicide across Scotland is men aged - and thatrsquos something we hope to positively redress in our town by facilitating a great environment in which local guys can improve not only their physical but also their mental health.ldquoOur connection with the charity Back Onside was really born of their slogan, #SupportThroughSport, a powerful statement that really resonated with us.ldquoTheyrsquore a great charity who are doing a hell of a lot across the UK and so for us, a small amateur club barely nine months old, to play a small part in helping a charity who share our ethos was immensely rewarding.Haddington Town play on Sunday mornings in Division Two of the Lothian and Edinburgh Amateur Football Association , alongside fellow county side Meadowmill.The charity match, played at Knox Academy, finished - in favour of the lsquoawayrsquo Haddington Town team.Libby Emmerson, founder and CEO of Back Onside, said: ldquoWe are beyond grateful for the support received from Haddington Town Amateur Football Club and guest referee Garry OrsquoConnor.ldquoAs a small charity with a huge clientele, community events such as the Haddington Town AFC charity match are key to raising funds and awareness so that we can continue to support those facing mental health challenges.Mr OrsquoConnell thanked everyone for their support, with the match raising pound, ndash more than double the target.He said: ldquoHuge thanks to Libby Emmerson, FES FM and Garry OrsquoConnor.

To turn the area over to commercial activities from November, with an unsightly and unpassable clear-up lasting from January to May, is to commandeer the place for more than half the year. Eight weeks would be acceptable  is not.Naturally, this eyesore wont be published on any VisitScotland website. Most sightseers wont ever catch a glimpse of this inglorious aftermath. Meanwhile, between now and the middle of May, those who live and work in Edinburgh must pass by and avert their gaze, wondering how their city became a mere pawn of the entertainment industry and not an illustrious capital of which they could once be proud. As one of many disgruntled locals tweeted, this is ruination \"in the name of greed\".I cannot think of a city of comparable elegance, venerability and wealth ndash a Unesco World Heritage Centre to boot ndash where the first thing you see as you emerge from the train station, or arrive from the airport is a wasteland. Welcome to Scotland! Here we dont roll out the red carpet, but ndash after an agonisingly long delay ndash we do renew the turf.Theres a palpable feeling at the moment that Edinburgh is undergoing seismic change, under our noses but without public consent. News last week that planning regulations could be relaxed to allow restaurants, cafes, and a host of other non-retail outfits to move into Princes Street is a fresh cause for concern. If approved, this new dispensation could mean that one of Europes most beguiling bouleds ndash the street that sells Scotland ndash could become home to a casino, cinema, or even a sports facility.Why should this concern us  Given the tawdry quality of some of the shops currently trading, wouldnt bright cafes or restaurants be a welcome improvement  After all, the array of tartan tat, cheap-as-chips fashion and even an emporium dedicated to sugary sweets ndash the smell alone could rot your teeth ndash is hardly in keeping with the magnicence of the venue.Yet given some of the poor decisions already taken by the councils planning committee, it is hard to feel confident that this incomparably lovely avenue is in safe hands. One member of the committee says the idea is to create a \"more authentic\" space. Im not sure what that means, but it sounds like double-speak for attracting lucrative footfall. And while pubs wont apparently be allowed onto the street, this relaxing of regulations extends to George Street, Hanover Street, Frederick Street and Castle Street. Like it or not, the face of the New Towns commercial district is set for a facelt.With the demise of House of Fraser at the West End, now transformed into a whisky experience, and towards the East End the once-beloved Jenners department store due shortly to close , the heart of the city is struggling to keep up with bewildering change. Fortunately, nothing so awful is in the pipeline as the notorious proposal some years ago to build an elevated shopping mall in the gardens. Perhaps the most worrying aspect of a less stringent commercial climate is the signal it sends, and the trend it looks set to deepen.Wherever you go, Edinburgh is turning into a visitor attraction, a living museum and gallery. Useful shops for locals are a rarity. In their place is a proleration of chic cafes, glitzy on-trend eateries and luxurious hotels, all pandering to the tourist market. Thanks to the make-over of old premises and investment in new, the capital has a superficial shine, a high-cost stylish patina. But as Dickenss Mr and Mrs Veneering showed, putting your faith in appearances is risky. Yes, it creates jobs, though mostly of a lowly-paid, transitory kind. But at what cost  Do people make the trip to Edinburgh for its pubs and coffee shops, or to soak up the atmosphere of culture, history and daily le that, over centuries, have made its name Princes Street has undoubtedly been in need of improving its image for a long time now. Some initiatives are to be welcomed, such as the Quaich project, to renovate the run-down Ross Bandstand, and to \"wild\" the western part of the gardens, so they look less like a postcard from the s and rather more invitingly freeform. While that is a laudable aspiration for one side of the street, however, the other is in danger of losing whatever soul it has left.I understand that the council is in a dficult position, trying to safe-guard the future of a district caught in the retail nightmare of swtly changing, quixotic customer behaviour. That it is hoping to welcome a greater ersity of trade suggests that in one aspect at least, human habits are unchanged: eating and drinking and watching the world go by. In fact, we are consuming far more than we ever did before, willing to spend money as well as countless hours sipping lattes and beer and scoffing burgers and sushi. So much for austerity. When it comes to leisure, wallets fly open.There would be nothing wrong with broadening Princes Streets commercial scopeyou could trust those at the controls. Sadly, I have no such faith. On the evidence of recent years, the citys development is geared towards immediate gratication, mainly for migrating flocks of cash-splashing customers. Where is the long-term perspective, tailored to the true character of the city, and to the requirements and concerns of those who live in it  Why bother to ask. Such a perspective requires serious thought, knowledge and imagination, luxuries the current decision-makers dont want to afford. As they say, Rome wasnt built in a day ndash but a theme park could be."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10969268.jpg?type=article-full","title":"green-go-benefits-purchasing-leasing-electric-hybrid-cars","story":"Intelligent Car LeasingElectric cars offer the practicality of a normal petrol or diesel car but with greatly reduced emissions. In the case of fully electric cars, those emissions are zero.There are plenty of electric cars to choose from. There are the self-charging hybrids. These use a combination of an engine with a battery and have the ability to run for a short while in zero emission mode. Such vehicles do not require charging by you.On the other hand, Plug-in Electric Hybrids - often abbreviated to PHEV - have an engine but feature a larger battery that can be charged from the mains or from a home charging unit. These have the ability to run emission-free for around - miles - enough for your daily commute.Finally electric cars - often called EVsor BEVs- only have a battery. They require charging from a home charging unit to run continuously in zero emission mode.Of course, technology is fast-moving. Where once a fully electric car had a range of barely  miles, todayrsquos electric cars offer in excess of  miles.So how do you stay ahead of technology without incurring huge costs and loss of value in a car One way is through car leasing. Leasing companies, such as Intelligent Car Leasing, are specialists in electric car leasing.Although you never own the car, you can lease the vehicle over ,  or even  months for regular and affordable monthly payments.At the end of each lease, you simply renew for a brand new, more technologically advanced vehicle.

Despite there being more than a quarter of a million electric cars registrations in the UK between  and , many prospective buyers remain cautious.The top concern of car-buyers is the range of EVs. Of course, itrsquos true that in some of the fledgling models, range was an issue, but technology has moved on. The Nissan Leaf, for example, will drive for  miles before needing a recharge. The range is clearly displayed on the dashboard, so therersquos no danger of getting caught short. And the reality is,  per cent of journeys in the UK are shorter than  miles, so there is a high likelihood that it will meet the needs of most people.Charge times are another concern. A full charge on the Leaf takes eight hours but a quick charge will provide  per cent capacity in only half an hour. And with more and more investment being ploughed into EV infrastructure and charging points around the country, filling up the tank is becoming easier and easier every day.Speed is a popular misconception too. If when you think about an electric car, golf buggies and dodgem cars spring to mind, it might be time to think again. Far from being sluggish, modern EVs have excellent acceleration. The new Leaf can go from -mph in . seconds and has a top speed of mph. And they produce instant torque, meaning the start-stop transition is slick and immediate.Fully electric vehicles are, of course, only the tip of the iceberg for the eco-conscious, eager to get ahead of the curve on green issues. Hybrid cars have batteries which are charged up on long motorway journeys, enabling them to power shorter trips about town, saving fuel without the need to schedule trips around charging points.Hybrids are a good compromise for those who arenrsquot necessarily ready to make the full leap to electric, combining some of the benefits of EVs like lower road tax, savings on fuels and reduced carbon footprint, without taking the plunge into completely new territory.Both Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow Central and Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow South have gained Electric Vehicle Approved Status , so the teams there are well-equipped to advise customers about changing to an electric or hybrid vehicle.Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow South,  Welbeck Road, Darnley, Glasgow, G SDwww.macklinmotors find-a-dealer nissan-glasgow-south Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow Central,  Port Dundas Road, Glasgow, G HZwww.macklinmotors find-a-dealer nissan-glasgow-central ------------------------------------------------------------------------Helensburgh Toyota For Toyota, hybrid really isnrsquot anything new as they first manufactured hybrid vehicles more than  years ago.

The cars are self-charging which means every moment you are driving, your battery is charging even when slowing down, so no need to plug anything in. Whether in the town or on the motorway, hybrids feel no dferent to drive than a petrol car, offering a quiet and relaxing ride and still delivers the power you need.Speaking about the increase in hybrid orders, Kirsteen McGuire, Helensburgh Toyota Sales Manager said: ldquoThe hybrid message across the car industry is finally hitting home. More and more people are making the switch to hybrid and in turn benefitting from lower tax and petrol costs. Where other car manufacturers are playing catch up, Toyota has been a trusted advocate of hybrid technology for many years. The reality is that manufacturers are moving to eventually producing only hybrid vehicles. I have worked for Helensburgh Toyota for  years and demand for hybrid has never been higher.If yoursquore new to Hybrid and are looking to experience Toyota Hybrid for yourself, why not book and appointment at the Helensburgh Hybrid Drive Event on Saturday  February.The team at Helensburgh Toyota are only too happy to give you more information and take you out on a test drive.www.facebook HelensburghToyota videos  sfnsmowww.facebook HelensburghToyota videos  sfnsmowww.helensburgh.toyota-------------------------------------------------------------------JorroIn  Jorro was created to be specialists in EV Charging for drivers and businesses across Scotland. Taking experience in renewable energy using Solar PV and a passion for zero emission transport, they decided that an independent company not linked to any manufacturer of cars, charge points or energy provider, would allow them to offer impartial advice to customers choosing to go electric for the first time.When plugging in the car at home, the smart charge point automatically decides when it is cheapest to charge. Paying just p per kWh overnight, which means you can travel up to , miles for just pound, compared to over pound in an efficient mpg petrol or diesel car. Even using typical electricity tarfs, customers are travelling over , miles per year for less than pound.To encourage EV drivers to charge safely at home rather than relying on the pin plug adaptor, the UK Government offers pound OLEV grant towards the cost of installing a home charge point. In Scotland, a further pound cash-back is available from Energy Saving Trust , reducing the cost further and in some installations covering the cost completely. To access the grants and extended three year warranty you must use an approved installer and check that like Jorro, they are approved by both OLEV and EST.The smallest fast charger on the market, which is smaller than an A piece of paper, EO Mini Pro is proving very popular for those looking for a discreet solution.Did you know Jorro offer charge points that can charge the car for free  If you have Solar Panels you can use the generated electricity to power the car with a Zappi Charge Point. Even in Scotland a typical Solar PV System can provide more than  miles of range per day.Some drivers may not have a convenient place to charge at home so installing charge points at work may be the solution with businesses able to claim up to pound, in grant funding to install charging for staff. Benefit-in-Kind is now  per cent for EVs, saving  per cent taxpayers up to pound, over three years compared to a typical diesel company car The team at Jorro are ready to help you switch to electric with simple, practical options at home and cost-effective commercial installations with free site surveys available across Scotland.www.jorrowww.jorro our-charge-points-models "},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  There won   t be a  legal and legitimate  referendum next year or for many years after that  Get used to it","story":"But it ainrsquot gonna happen.

There are a good range of candidates who are standing to be the deputy leader of the Labour party.Pressed on the point, he said: ldquoLook, Ian is a very, very competent candidate who is saying some interesting things, whether itrsquos around the Scottish constitutional question, where the Labour party needs to be, the need for a long-term vision.ldquoBut the other candidates are also setting out their stall as well, so Irsquom not going to come out and publicly back one candidate or the other.Asked why not, given Mr Murray was his only MP in Scotland and was standing to represent Scotland better inside the party, Mr Leonard said: ldquoIrsquom not going to make a public declaration about which candidate for leader or which candidate for deputy leader Irsquom backing, because I will need to work with whoever is elected.Pressed yet again, Mr Leonard said: ldquoIn the end itrsquos a political choice for members of the Labour party to make across the whole of the UK and they will exercise that right and make that choice about who they think is the best leadership team to help lead us towards the next general election.A source close to Mr Murray said: ldquoIan has entered the deputy leadership race to ensure Scotlandrsquos voice is amplied and the issues in Scotland are well understood by all. Thatrsquos why he has already gained the support of the majority of CLPs in Scotland that have nominated. Hersquos doing all he can to try and help the Labour Party in Scotland so that should be welcomed by Richard.Mr Leonard also restated his position, first set out in the general election, that an SNP majority in the  Holyrood election would justy a second independence referendum.Asked about Scotlands biggest public sector union, Unison, voting on Saturday in support of Holyrood having the power to call Indyref when it wanted, Mr Leonard said it showed some people had been \"driven to despair\" by the Tories.:Iain Macwhirter: There wonrsquot be a legal and legitimate referendum next year or for many years after that. Get used to itUnison Scotland said it would now promote the issue at the STUC congress in April.The motion put to members stated Unison \"supports the call for a second referendum, at a time to be determined by the Scottish Parliament, by means of either a section  order or an amendment to the Scotland Act as a satisfactory means of transferring the power over independence referendums\".Mr Leonard said: ldquoI understand completely, given the prospect of five more years of a Boris Johnson government, why some people are driven to anger and some people are driven to despair.ldquoSo I understand and we will listen to Unison, who are an important part not just of the Labour movement but of the Labour party.ldquoWe will listen to the reasons why their members... reached that conclusion.ldquoBut Irsquom bound to say that the prospectus for independence put forward by the SNP and their Growth Commission report is one fo a very hard dose of austerity which would lead to cuts in public services that Unison and other public sector trade union members work in.ldquoEven among those people who support independence, there is very little appetite for a referendum to be called in the very near future.He admitted that Sir Keir Starmer, the favourite in the UK Labour leadership race, had not consulted him before giving his personal position on Indyref last week.The Shadow Brexit Secretary had said an SNP majority win in the  Holyrood election would constitute a mandate for another vote.Mr Leonard said: ldquoIt shouldnrsquot be for the politicians from other parts of the UK to pronounce on these issue,.

The Calcutta Cup has always been one of my favourite events in the sporting calendar.And I admit there are few experiences so guaranteed to make me fill with emotion as that moment when the pipers fall silent and the Murrayfield crowd continue unaccompanied with ‘Flower of Scotland’.For  minutes England are the Auld Enemy and the taste of victory, on those occasions when we have it, is sweet. But it is a game. A game that I love, but a game nonetheless.And the rivalry is entirely about who will prove to have the more accomplished experience on the day. It is also the only time when I will wear national colours or consider waving a flag. Any flag.Don’t get me wrong there are occasions – like when I saw it fluttering in the breeze over the Church of Scotland in Jerusalem – when the sight of the Saltire fills me pride.And walking down Whitehall I get a huge sense of security from the Union Flag above parliament.: Brexit: EU flag will fly at Holyrood after Brexit, after government overturns decision of impartial parliament body: Why Scotland is still perfectly entitled to fly the Flag of Europe – John McLellanBut I have also come to resent the way in which flags have somehow become not just central to the political debate but regarded as central to what politics is about. I cannot see that.I care much more about tackling the homelessness that I see every day, even in the entrance to the parliament of the fth largest economy in the world.Or cleaning up the air that makes Edinburgh the most polluted city in Scotland and is now so dirty that a recent report estimated one in  deaths in our city is in some way attributable to it. And then there are the problems in our schools, our NHS, our public services and the sickening growth in food banks.Flag-waving doesn’t solve problemsNone of those issues will be resolved by waving a flag. Nor by wrapping ourselves in it and claiming that it somehow makes us more Scottish or British with an enhanced right to speak for the rest of us.They are not the preserve of any single political party, or to be used by them for narrow self-promoting purposes.Over the course of the past few years, I have begun to feel the same sense of attachment to the flag of the European Union as those of Scotland and the UK.But, unfortunately, that is also now being drawn into the political mud-slinging.For more than a decade, it has been flown proudly among the flags above the entrance to the Scottish Parliament. That flag represents a body which is now, sadly, no longer part of our constitutional framework. We are not entitled to either its protection or its patronage.And to that extent, the flag of the EU is no more relevant to our lives now than the flags of the United States, France, Germany, Japan or any other nation.Believe me, that is something which fills me with a huge sense of regret.I and my party, the Liberal Democrats, dedicated every possible moment we could, took every opportunity available and followed every route open to us to keep us in the European Union.In the end, we couldn’t and so it is no longer our flag to wave. I imagineScotland had voted to leave the UK in  many of us would have found ourselves in the same situation with the Union Flag.Union Jacks after independence And , for example, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Highland or any other local authority chose to continue to fly it above their headquarters or for that matter a pro-UK political party in administration at Holyrood in future raised it above parliament, there would be an outcry from the nationalists.Which is why I find the current attack on the corporate body of the Scottish Parliament and, for that matter, the Liberal Democrats so offensive.My colleague Liam McArthur MSP reminded the Scottish Parliament this week that the flying of the EU flag was a reflection of our membership of the EU and removing it does not make us anti-European as leaving it up would not make us pro-European.The flag is, he said, “a statement of legal fact and not a political desire”. But the latter is exactly what it is being usurped for. A political move designed to fan the flames of a particular desire by one party to promote its own agenda. That is not what I believe my parliament, or its flags, are for.They are there to represent the people of Scotland, regardless of their politics, religion or any other inidual factor.And, above all , they are a symbol of the sources from which the Parliament takes its authority. Those are now only the UK and the people of Scotland.I do not want to see the flag of the EU removed, that single act would represent everything I and so many other people have worked so hard not to lose. But I accept that it should be.Our attention now should be on working for the best possible relationship with our neighbours for the good of us all.And let’s keep our flag waving to the sports arenas.Christine Jardine is the Liberal Democrat MP for Edinburgh West©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish independence is not inevitable nothing in politics is brian monteith","story":"I have never been a believer about inevitability of political outcomes. I remember how we were constantly being told by what was the Europhile establishment that joining the euro was inevitable. Well, look at us now. Not only did we dodge that bullet but we have finally left the European Union.There are some who claim or imply Scottish independence is inevitable. Part of their reasoning is the UK’s departure from the EU will cause such a rt with the rest of the UK the Scottish people, when given the chance, will choose the European continent over our island brethren. It’s inevitable, they say.I choose to dfer. In  the SNP would have taken Scotland out of the EU in pursuit of achieving independence now the SNP pushes EU membership as its major reason for independence. Believing in political inevitability is a foolhardy self-deception. We do not know what the future holds, nor can we tell what geo-political events might arise and how they shall impact on our thinking or that of future generations. It would be just as foolish for me to claim the unity of the United Kingdom is inevitable. It is not, its benefits require to be repeatedly explained or their attraction may fade and the Union fall accidentally into abeyance.I am moved to ponder how political developments can come at us from nowhere rather than be inevitable because of the historical rupture between our country and the European Union on Friday night. It was the Scot, Alan Sked, now professor emeritus at the London School of Economics,who founded what became Ukip following the EU’s Maastricht Treaty. Nigel Farage joined Ukip and in  was elected to be an MEP along with just two other colleagues. When they arrived in Brussels they were treated as a British curiosity and a joke. No one in the European Union’s elite are laughing now.Was our departure inevitable  No. Had Margaret Thatcher not been deposed by her EU-phile critics it is hard to believe she would have accepted the treaty. Indeed, the written evidence of a letter to Bill Cash, MP, states she would not have agreed to it. No Maastricht would mean no Ukip and no Farage . EU-philes should have been careful what they wished for.Likewise, was the outcome of the  referendum inevitable  No. It is conveniently forgotten how Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg had called for a referendum on EU membership because he believed endorsing membership would kill the issue stone dead and allow the UK to play a more active role building ever closer union across Europe. He should have been more careful what he wished for.Similarly, Prime Minister David Cameron thought he could heal the ide in the Conservative Party over EU membership by holding a referendum. He believedhe negotiated fresh membership terms he could demonstrate how helpful and warm EU leaders were towards our country and that reform of the institutions was possible from within. Well, he certainly initiated the healing of the ide in the Tory Party – for it is more united now than at any time in my living memory – but not in the manner he anticipated. Cameron miscalculated badly on the motives of EU leaders. Just imaginethey had given him some genuine changes in our terms of membership. Imaginehe had been able to come back from Brussels with something substantial that limited the centrugal forces of ever closer union  Cameron’s Eurosceptic critics would have been muted and sounded shrillheard at all, while the EU’s advocates would have turned up the volume to . Instead of being able to run a positive campaign about EU co-operation, cohesion and solidarity the EU-philes were put on the back foot embarrassed by EU technocratic indference they were forced to rely on the Treasury’s project fear playbook that had nearly lost the union to secessionists in the independence referendum two years before. This time the suggested nightmare scenarios became more and more absurd and thus their campaign more and more disreputable. Last Wednesday I held my nose and voted in the European Parliament for a rotten transition agreement that would take us out of the EU two days later. On Thursday I made the last speech of any MEP on the subject of the UK’s departure, explaining how our Prime Minister’s legal enactment of having no further extension of membership and his public commitment to allowing ergence in our laws where we choose made my support possible. On Friday I joined the tens of thousands in Parliament Square, celebrating my redundancy as an MEP and my job was done.None of that process or the outcome it led to was inevitable. All of it had to be fought for all of the plans, strategies, tactics and reasoning in the ensuing debates had to be adjusted repeatedly to take account of events – such as President Obama saying we would be sent to the back of the “queue” .The lessons of what should be seen as the Great European Disruption should be understood and learned by those wishing to defend the United Kingdom. Its maintenance is not inevitable. It requires blood, sweat and toil. It cannot be about economics alone, but should be about solidarity, community and harmony. Its advocates and their advocacy must have a positive tale to tell.By May this year Nicola Sturgeon’s SNP shall have been in power for  years – the majority of the period we have had a Scottish Parliament responsible and accountable for Scotland’s health, education, justice and economic development. It has been a time when even more powers have been transferred from London to Edinburgh – and yet the standards and outcomes that were claimed would improve have in so many cases fallen. The SNP’s focus on the constitutional debate is undoubtedly a large part of the reason. Yet the SNP appears poised to remain in power. We should remember, however, that nothing in politics is inevitable.Brian Monteith is no longer a member of the European Parliament.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nafc pair shortlisted in national lantra finals ","story":"Valentina Romano and Jimmy Dakin are in the running for the Lantra Scotland awards.Jimmy Dakin from Sanday in Orkney has been shortlisted as Aquaculture Learner of the Year.

I’ll try where I can to find outanybody nearby owns the property. These places are almost always in a bad state of repair – broken windows, roofs and doors missing. “If it’s somewhere that’s been left open you’re not breaking and entering and you’re not going in to commit a crime so you can’t be prosecuted for that either. Michael likes to tell a story through the items that have been left behind“You’re going in at your own risk. If you can’t get in you write it off and move on. Like I say it’s a grey area so I prefer to keep a low profile and let my pictures speak for themselves.”Michael shares the photographs he takes via his Facebook and Instagram pages entitled Forgotten Places NI: “I respect people’s privacy andI’m ever asked to take any photos down I do it straight away.“I do it for the love of old buildings and their contents, it’s as simple as that. It’s a hobby and I don’t try to make any money from it. “I had been taking photos for my own pleasure to start with but when I showed them to other people they said I needed to share them online because they were so good. That’s why I started up Forgotten Places NI.”An old ambulance found at a derelict propertyMichael’s photographs are posted with a short description of the property but little detail about the location unless it’s somewhere that’s easily recognisable. He said he likes to keep his best finds to himself: “I know a couple of other guys who do this. There’s ones who take photographs and sell them. Mine is purely a hobby.“I’ll get messages from other people asking where I’ve been. I don’t always tell them. It’s dog eat dog. It sounds stupid because there’s nothing to gain from it. It’s one-upmanship to find somewhere that no one  has posted about.Masonic supports Charity work Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“I don’t get why people would exchange locations. I don’t see the point. It’s finding the places and not knowing what’s going to be inside that does it for me. If you go somewhere that’s already been documented it takes the excitement out of it.”Most of the properties are in a bad state of repairHe said: “What I do I call it documenting. I go in take pictures and write a wee blurb about the place I’ve been. “Sometimes it’s a property that’s got a ‘for sale’ sign at it. You’ll come back in three months and it’s gone, it’s been flattened for redevelopment. It’s sad because when you’re in it you get a real sense of the character of the house, the essence of it.”Michael said he used to have a penchant for ghost hunting, but with his new pursuit he tries to steer clear of the paranormal: “I used to have a bit of a fascination with paranormal investigation, though I think it had more to do with the old buildings. I love walking round old places as you can pick up so much of the history from just walking around. “I used to do a few paranormal investigations so that gave me an appreciation of old buildings, the character of them, just how dferent they are to the ones now.“With Forgotten Places NI I don’t like to spook things up to be scarier than they are. That said, there’s a post I put up just this weekend about a house that I called the House of Ambivilence. It really did have mixed feeling about it. “It looked lovely from the outside, a nice farmhouse. Downstairs had a nice calm atmosphere, but when you went upstairs, honestly, you wanted to get out again, something just didn’t sit. I felt uneasy about the atmosphere. A well lived in room“That’s not generally the case, mostly you get a good feeling about the place because of the items you find in them – kids’ toys, religious pictures, birthday cards. It’s that connection I like.”Michael’s photos are largely focused on derelict properties in NI but he has also ventured into the Republic of Ireland: “Banbridge is a good location to have as a base. I can be in the south in  minutes, quicker than to get to Belfast.“For me it’s trying to find places that haven’t been documented. Everybody’s done Cairndhuand because of its popularity it has been subject to vandalism. Nevertheless it’s a fascinating place. It doesn’t matter what people do to it.” Michael, who has three children, said: “My daughter would come out with me from time to time for a wee spin. We’d trek up country roads to seewe can find any or maybe I’ll have some place marked to check out. “I’ll maybe read around online about an area to seethere’s any stories relating to old mills, old schools. You can look at satellite images before you go. We’ll maybe have eight or  places marked.“These places that I’m going into, people don’t even know they’re out there. There’s hundreds of them. I mark them on my Google Maps – there’s five or six hundred on there to explore.”Michael said he has a bank of photos stored on his phone that he hasn’t shared yet: “If I didn’t go out for another three months I’d have enough to keep posting. “Looking back at some of my older photos, they aren’t great. I think I’ve got better. “In July or August I had , likes on the page, by December it had doubled, now I’m pushing towards ,. “It’s amazing because I’m not doing anything with it, I’m just publishing photos with a small bit of a story, I’m not promoting it or trying to make money from it.”Michael is quick to point out that he is not the first person to find beauty in the Province’s derelict properties. He said Abandonned NI set the benchmark for this sort of photography.Michael said his obsession was a year-round one: “I’ll be out in winter as well as summer. In winter it’s good because the foilage dies back and you’re able to see things that would previously have been hidden. I remember once crawling through a hole and the hedge to find this property that you’d never know was there.” Asked what led him to begin searching for old houses Michael said: “It was my son who got me started, it must have been about three or four years ago. “He showed me this video on YouTube of a guy in America who was exploring this derelict mansion that used to belong to a drug dealer. “It looked fantastic, all the broken windows and doors hanging off and the stuff that was left inside. “My son said we should try to find something like that here. I said, ‘you’re not going to get something on that scale but we’ll have a look’. “What we did was we went to Cairndhu which is near Larne. It’s pretty much where everybody that does this starts. It’s so well known, it’s such a tragic story of how it fell into such disrepair. It’s so vast. As soon as I got in I was hooked.”Cairndhu which was built around  is the former home of Sir Thomas Dixon. It became a convalescent home before it was closed in .Michael said: “There are people on social media who tell me about a derelict house near to them, sometimes it can be just a shell. For me that’s not that interesting. “What I find interesting is somewhere that has personal possessions still inside. It could be furniture, it could be letters, there’s houses you go into and you’d think people had just walked out and left everything still in it.Michael said his passion was driven more by what people had left behind inside the properties rather than the buildings themselves.He commented: “Some people would look at a man in his forties out exploring the country like this as stupid, but for me it’s just that sense of adventure. “It’s good to be out and about. It’s a healthy interest and no one is harmed.“It’s like how you feel when you’re a kid when you go out exploring. “I’m not sure I was even this adventurous as a kid. Maybe I’m making up for it now.“It’s that excitement of the unknown, that danger of not knowing what you’re going to find. That’s why I do it. “It’s those wee unassuming houses that look like nothing and you go in and they’re just filled with stuff. You find out all about the owners, the le that they led.”Discussing some of the remnants of the past he has uncovered, Michael said: “You see so many of the old Singer sewing machines.“There was one house where I found the shell of a Mk II Jag. I found an old ambulance as well.“For me the best finds are the wee personal things like a Valentine’s card or a kid’s note that says ‘mummy has been mean to me and daddy’ – you’re hoping that was just a wee fleeting moment.”He continued: “I try to capture those items as they sit to tell the story of the house. “I take the photos on my phone, maybe I’ll upgrade to a fancy camera someday though photographers will tell you it doesn’t matter what you use, it’s your eye for a photo.“People say to me they can imagine a story around my posts. In my wee blurb I’ll not give the location away unless it’s a well known building. I’ll just describe it a wee bit as best I can and let the pictures tell the story.”Offering suggestions as to why houses end up derelict yet full of possessions, he said: “A lot of the time you’ll get an elderly person who will pass away, they may have nobody to leave it to or they may leave it to the family and they can’t agree what to do with it so it just sits.“Sometimes you get people who buy the property for the adjoining land but don’t knock down the original property.”Some of the items left behindThe scene in an abandonned kitchenBoots no longer made for walkingThis cupboard remains well stockedAn Evening Prayer"},{"url":null,"title":"orangemen aim to scale kilimanjaro","story":"A dozen Orangemen from Co Down are planning an ambitious trip to Africa during which they will attempt to scale Mount Kilimanjaro.The men from Banbridge District No  have a proud history of undertaking gruelling fundraising ventures, with this particular challenge requiring two years of groundwork.Deputy District Master Stuart Magill said: “In this last  years at Banbridge Orange Hall we’ve raised over £, for dferent causes and charities.“Drumming For Heroes from LOL  has raised £,. They’ve carried a Lambeg drum up to the top of Ben Nevis and cycled from John O’Groats to Landsend with a Lambeg on the back of a bike. “They also did the four peaks of the UK in four days, and walked the route of King Billy from the south of England to Carrickfergus and down to the Boyne, also bringing the Lambeg.”Banbridge Orange Hall is home to several dferent lodges including LOL  and LOL  of which Stuart is a member. “This time it will be our lodge that’s doing Kilimanjaro though we won’t be bringing a Lambeg – it’s going to be hard enough as it is,” he continued. “It’s a follow up to the Walk of Remembrance when we walked  miles from Thiepval Memorial to Menin Gate.”The -year-old added: “It was my idea to climb Killimanjaro. I’ve never done it before, that’s why I want to do it. “There’s  of us doing it. My biggest worry was getting .

There’s a big build to allow us to pay for it, the cost of the trip is coming out of each person’s pocket so that every penny raised is going to the charity. It also gives us plenty of time to train for it, and also to raise money for the two charities.”Two charities are set to benefit – the Children’s Cancer Unit in Royal Victoria Hospital and Angel Wishes which helps children with cancer and supports their families.He said the two charities were close to the hearts of those taking part in the trek as they were good friends with a family from Banbridge who are indebted to the services provided by the organisations.In pictures: NI man finds beauty in derelict properties around the Province Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Stuart said: “The oldest person taking part is in his sixties and the youngest is in his twenties. “The majority of training will be in the Mournes for fitness and stamina, but there’s no training over here really for the altitude.

I want to be in a position to make robust decisions on key issues and I hope Casement will be one of those.”Another key decision for Minister Mallon will be on the York Street Interchange, which was specied as a commitment for the Executive in the New Deal, New Approach document.“There was a procurement process that was challenged. We now have to commence that procurement process again,” she explained.“It certainly is an issue that needs to be addressed. Anyone who travels in that part of the city will know it is hugely congested when it comes to traffic. It is also bad for emissions and the climate which is one of my priorities.“I want to try and progress that but also balance it around connecting people and doing what we can to tackle the climate emergency.“The project is stated as commitment for the Executive but it also features in the New Deal New Approach and I very much welcome that commitment is in there.“Infrastructure is central to the new document and it recogniseswe are serious about transforming lives and ensuring people have real opportunities in areas were people are really struggling then we need to be investing in infrastructure.”As for a possible Glider extending to link South and North Belfast, Nichola saidone of her priorities is “about increasing public transport and people’s access to it”.“I have asked officials for an urgent briefing to see where that is but encouraging people to use public transport and encourage people to walk and cycle are priorities for me.”After three years of no Stormont Executive, Nichola said she is under no illusions to the challenges facing her around Infrastructure, including a huge backlog of work to tackle street lighting, potholes and climate change.“The financial situation that I have inherited is extremely challenging. If you look from , there have been systemic signicant budget cuts to the department.“One of the areas which has been affected has been street lighting and it is something I am very aware of. It is on people’s front doors and gives people a sense of safety and confidence.“If we want to make a dference to people’s lives, we need to address issues like street lighting and pot holes.“I would be hopeful of working with Minister Conor Murphy in the Department for Finance to secure more money to address some of these issues.“Pot holes is a big issue across the North and mainly due to budget cuts to the department. I want to try and address it.“I think we could be doing so much more in Belfast, especially around cycling. We need to encourage and facilitate parents who want to be able to walk their children to school. It will involve safety mechanisms but it is something I want to have a big conversation about with not only my officials but people as well. It is beneficial for the climate but also for people’s physical and mental health.”Asked about many people’s negative attitudes at -hour bus lanes in the city, the Minister stressed she is keeping an open mind but called for better conversations around such controversial issues.“It is about a balancing act. It is about encouraging people to use public transport but in a way to promote local businesses as well.“I have an open-door policy here and I want to engage with everyone. When we all put our heads together, that is when you get to a better place for policies and decision-making.”As for rumours of potential water charges being introduced for residents, she was quick to spell out her position.“The SDLP is opposed to water charges and I have been very quick to say that it won’t be the case under my watch.“I also welcome the fact both the First and Deputy First Minister have come out as well to say it also. I view my role as important in helping struggling families and not to add to their burden.”On a personal level, Nichola is “excited” about her role over the next two years but stressed she will not forget about her local constituents in North Belfast who elected her to Stormont in the first place.“It’s very exciting. It is a very big department. I think a lot of people think it’s just about roads but in actual fact, the department impacts on everyone’s daily lives.“Infrastructure covers things like whether houses can be built or not which is important because we have a housing crisis and other things like waste and water.“When you turn on your water tap, how you travel to and from school and work, MOT to ensure your vehicle is safe, road gritting in winter – all fall within the Department for Infrastructure.“I haven’t forgotten I am here only because the people of North Belfast elected me. I am keen while I take up this role I don’t lose sight of that and continue to be focused also on my constituency and the service I provide.“I will still be a familiar face around North Belfast. The reason that I got into politics is to serve people who put their faith in me.“I won’t lose sight of that and I am very clear that I want to be in the constituency and welcome people to still come to me with their problems and their issues because my job is to try and help them.“I am a parent too and for all parents, it is important to balance your work and your le. I am very lucky I have a supportive family. I look forward to family time and spending time with my children is important but I will do my absolute best in this role.”As for her hopes for her two-year tenure at the helm of Infrastructure, Nichola concluded: “I really want to make the most of these two years. I understand I am coming into a position where we haven’t taken decisions for three years so there is a backlog.“There are huge financial restraints but I really want to make an impact.

He has alerted the relevant authorities. The site is just yards from the St Gall’s GAC clubrooms. Belfast City Council waste bags, household fridges, cemetery headstones, construction rubble, wood and huge amounts of other waste have een dumped on to the land and the massive mound is sliding close to the Ballymurphy Stream.The land is known as Milltown Glen and is situated between Maguire’s Garage, Milltown Cemetery and the Bog Meadows.Michael Culbert of St Gall’s GAC said that the issue of land ownership needs to be claried. “There is a gateway that runs from Milltown Cemetery, a lane, and it’s that land that is being dumped on,” he said. “We want a clean environment, we care about the environment. We have all age groups at St Gall’s, from six-year-olds up and have been in this area for approximately  years. We have never seen the like of this. This is a beautul glen, you have the Bog Meadows and here it’s the epitome of fly tipping. This is going on in the heart of West Belfast and it’s not on. We need someone with responsibility to hold whoever is doing this to account for the contamination of this area. We don’t want the river polluted.“It needs to stop and it needs to be cleared up and now our local councillor Steven Corr has taken up this issue.”Ulster Wildle Nature Reserve Officer Deborah McLaughlin told the Andersonstown News that the dumping has got worse since the start of the New Year.“This is an absolute eyesore and I have contact DAERAin relation to it as a lot of the rubbish will end up in the stream,” she said. “We are concerned at the level of fly tipping going on and concerned for health and safety. DAERA are aware of the issue and at the minute we are waiting to hear back from them.”Local Sinn Féin Councillor Steven Corr said the illegal dumping is “destroying the landscape”.“What we are seeing is a localised environmental nightmare,” he went on. “We are only a few feet away from this stream being contaminated. I can’t get my head around why somebody thinks it’s ok to do this. There are lorry loads of rubbish being dumped down a riverbank, killing wildle as it goes. I’ve never seen anything like this, on this scale, in West Belfast. This is fly tipping on an industrial scale, there is industrial waste on the site, glass, headstones. There is confusion as to who is responsible for the land but we would be calling on the Rivers Agency and the NIEAto work with us. Belfast City Council have offered support as their bags are also being dumped on the site. This land needs to be secured as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mclaughlin pays tribute to reds second half hunger","story":"CLIFTONVILLE boss Paddy McLaughlin paid tribute to his side’s second-half effort in their dramatic injury-time County Antrim Shield comeback win against Ballymena. The Reds battled back from Leroy Millar’s early opener in the second half to stage a smash-and-grab - win and McLaughlin felt his side emptied everything into their search for a route back into the game. “I’m delighted,” reflected McLaughlin. “You saw how much effort that players put into the second half and you’ve got to give Ballymena credit – they were good on the break, got their lead with a soft goal we gave away and they defended their lead really well. But you saw how much our boys put into the second half, they emptied their heart on to the pitch and gave us everything.“To get the equaliser, we were happy with that and to go into extra time because I thought the momentum was with us. But to go and win it a minute later was an incredible finish to the game. It’s a sore one for Ballymenayou’re a Ballymena fan or player tonight. I’m sure they’re going back absolutely devastated at losing the game in the th minute. Unfortunately someone had to lose and you don’t want to see young players going off with their heads down but you can’t take it away from our boys. They gave it everything and they probably slightly deserved it in the end.” McLaughlin refused to take any credit for substitutes Thomas Maguire and Ryan Curran popping up with the late goals, but he praised the duo for putting their personal disappointment to one side for the good of the team. “The players on the pitch did the business,” he added. “The players on the pitch worked Ballymena really hard, they tried their best to work opportunities, Ballymena defended brilliantly well, you can’t deny them that, but when the seven minutes went up we looked like we had a goal in us. I was just hoping it wasn’t going to be one of those days where it would be a sad story – could we have done this and should we have done that “I felt we would get one chance in that seven minutes and take it to extra time, I felt we were finishing the game the stronger. For Thomas [Maguire] and Ryan [Curran] to pop up, fair play to them because I’m sure they were disappointed not to be starting the game. They put their own personal disappointment to one side to go and do a job for the team.”Such was the intensity of that seven minutes of madness, McLaughlin was unable to remember his feelings during the late drama but acknowledged the backing of the Red Army and paid tribute to their “incredible” support. “I pulled two hamstrings running on to the pitch celebrating and anything after that, I don’t know what happened,” admits McLaughlin. “Your emotions take over you because you can see what it means to the players and what it means to the supporters. You can’t go through any interview and not talk about the supporters tonight. “That was incredible support that Cltonville brought tonight in the County Antrim Shield on a Tuesday night. I think there is only one team in the ision that has that support and it’s Cltonville. You saw what it meant to the players and supporters from the goals went in. My mind went blank straight away and only now am I settling down.”Tuesday’s victory ends a four-year wait for silverware and McLaughlin hopes it will give his players a taste for future success. “Sometimes the first trophy is the hardest one to get. “I didn’t come here to make up the numbers, I came here to try and establish Cltonville back as a contender for the ision and as a team who should be challenging to win trophies. “If I didn’t see that potential in them, I wouldn’t have come up,” said the Derry man. “When I see the quality within the playing squad and the support they get when things are going well, when I see how hard they work, I know they’ve got potential to win trophies. All that hard work’s been justied tonight. “It’s one trophy but we’re not going to rest on that, we want more. It’s such a young squad and for a lot of them it’s their first senior medals. Hopefully now they’ll get that appetite for success and to challenge for trophies even more and you never know where this team might go.” "},{"url":null,"title":"sdlp urges parties to continue working together after eu exit","story":"Nichola Mallon PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappNichola Mallon By Christopher LeebodyFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe SDLP has made a renewed call for parties here to find a way forward through Brexit together after Friday#s historic exit from the European Union.Nichola Mallon said that while all the parties here dfered in their position on Brexit, all agree that the way in which Northern Ireland is being dragged out of the EU is not acceptable.During the first main sitting of the restored Assembly last month, all the Stormont parties rejected the Government#s EU withdrawal plan without dissent, following a near three-hour debate in the chamber.The SDLP#s Assembly leader urged the parties here to work collaboratively as the Brexit process moves forward into the transition period, in which key trading agreements are set to be decided over a period of  months.We believe Brexit is a socio-economic and political disaster for all people living on these islands, said Ms Mallon.There is a responsibility on all parties in the Assembly to resist the opportunity to point-score and instead to show real leadership and maturity.While we certainly welcome the fact that there is to be no border on this island, we recognise the serious consequences for our business communityunfettered access is not secured for trade east-west also.The possibility of a new clf edge into a no-deal Brexit at the end of this year still looms.New questions remain unanswered on trade and future relationships.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadBrexit: Parties and protests in Northern Ireland as UK leaves the EUNo signs of Brexit unity in Northern Ireland as new era dawnsSDLP urges parties to continue working together after EU exitBeers over Brexit: #Le goes on# say Belfast pub goersBrexit: Six former Northern Ireland MEPs on work and le at the European Parliament,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He added: A number of these rises are very generous to put it mildly.The Northern Ireland Local Government Associationadded that it was not in a position to formally comment on inidual allowances. It added: However, we would like to highlight the signicant role delivered by each of the council first citizens which can include presiding over council meetings promoting and raising awareness of key council objectives attending and supporting a range of civic, public and sporting events receiving and hosting distinguished visitors and guests to the area promoting the council area as a tourism and business destination supporting and encouraging community engagement and pride of place and supporting, as appropriate, local charitable appeals.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadSaoradh criticised for heavy presence at Bloody Sunday commemorationMan charged after woman injured jumping from window with child to escape racist attackInvestigation launched after teenager dies on Bangor street DUP#s bid to revisit  legacy deal ignites a storm of criticism Missing woman found on Cave Hill after three-day search operation ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It’s not an easy thing to do but the plan is on February  and  from pm to pm in the Nerve Centre there will be a photography exhibition, short film showcases and, obviously, a gig. The event will be a creative arts festival following the completion of the Education Authority’s CADi scheme that provides young people with qualications and key skills in the creative arts such as film, live sound, photography, graphic design and events management. Live sound is underlined because, obviously, it’s the most important thing in the world.The festival will contain an exhibition of photography, showcase of short films and two days of music including  bands highlighting the musical talent throughout Northern Ireland. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED: Megan Watton and Oisin Clenaghan. This celebration of youth culture has been completely organised by the young people involved with the CADi project to showcase youth within the arts. This should be just about enough to keep the adults interested.Featured acts include Villa in FranceGrace Mullan,Vanilla Days, Meeks, Wasted Wild,Juno Hasson and Aimee Tourish, a bit of trad from Jordan Lively and songstress Maya Patterson, all who have been paving their way through the music scene across the north coast and Derry and in recent months.I spoke to one of the organisers, Megan Watton, and first asked what does CADi mean and what made you all want to do it in the first place  “Well, I joined three years ago it stands for Creative And Digital Innovation.“The course is one year and you get an OCN level one, two or three, depending on what age you are which is the equivalent to an A level or GCSE. “I, personally, wanted to do it because it would give me new skills and quality’s I could use in the future. It has been a programme run by the education Authority for three years and the numbers grow each year The Nerve Centre has been a fantastic help as they provide the tutors of each discipline events management, film, photography, graphic design and sound.They also have connections in the music scene which helps when booking bands,” she added. “Just that this programme has aided so many young people with their mental health and self-confidence and the out of school conditions helps. Without CADiI wouldn’t have gotten into my tech course.” Ethan Martin, who also helped organise it, said: “CADi means working with others in a small group to achieve the same goal. It’s been hard as we had to learn how to run an event, the Nerve Centre has been a huge help.”Events manager team member Clodagh McKenna, said: “The CADi Youth Takeover is an event for young people by young people. “It’s a chance to show how talented the youth of Northern Ireland is particularly in its music scene which has so many hidden gems. It also contains amazing work from the photographers, and film makers from the CADi programme.“CADi is a cross community programme aimed to give young people aged - the opportunity to gain skills in areas they wouldn’t usually get an opportunity to within school. “These include photography, graphic design, live sound , film and events management. The bulk of the programme consists of three residential weekends which lead up to the final event.“We’ve worked hard over the past couple of months to produce an event we hope the public will love. CADi really is like a second family to lots of us and you can see that when we come together. “We’ve created friends and memories that will last a letime.” AdultMarty Coyle said: “The CADi courses are a fantastic opportunity for young people to get some real-le experience in arts related subjects whilst gaining a qualication at the same time. “The upcoming two-day event at Nerve Centre will showcase the hard work they have put in throughout the course, showcase their own work as well as presenting a broad demographic of their peers within the arts throughout Northern Ireland”.

I got this cold off all the little two and three year olds in nursery, not that I actually wanted it you understand. Of course I understand we can’t keep our children off nursery because of a snfle, butthey’ve a proper cold with coughs, sneezes and that yucky green stuff it means they are not well - not well enough to be in nursery. For just as I didn’t want this cold neither did they, but because a few decided to come in with their nasty cold germs, with the yucky green stuff, we’ve now all had it - thanks. googletag.cmd.push Of course, I understand this is not the children’s fault but, and sorry to say, it is down to those few parents who think ‘go to nursery however snotty and yucky you may be’. So I’m writing this article, for a few reasons, the first to say please do keep your child off nursery they aren’t well, it’s no fun for them and no fun for anyone  when they get the bug too. I know le can be hard with a sickly child, I know how much we need that break sometimes but please, please keep your bugs at home. googletag.cmd.push My next reason is to share with you some tips, ideas and thoughts that I’ve heard and used over the years to help with coughs, cold’s and sneezes, please do remember though I am not a doctor soyou decide to use one of these ideas that I’m passing along to you then do check with a pharmacist or doctor that is is okay to do this with your baby, toddler and  or child. . DO make your child wear a vest or t-shirt under their jumper. Believe me I have met a few children this winter who just wear t-shirts, and always look and feel cold, winter clothes are for winter and summer clothes for summe.!  . TEACH your toddler how to blow through their nose, yes literally show them how to blow, this makes runny noses so much easier to manage. Yes of course you have to hold the tissue for them, butthey can blow then that means less of the runny stuff.  . DO put a little vaseline around their noses when your little one has a cold - this stops their nose getting sore, but also makes it sooo much easier to wipe. . Do keep this little pot of vaseline just for their nose though. . TREAT, some people do use medicines, paracetamol, baby Sudafed etc and this is a personal choice, it’s up to you as parents. But as my mum said, ‘with medicine the cold will be there a week, without medicine it’ll be there for a week’. The medicines are designed to make your little one feel better, they won’t necessarily cure the cold. Remember you know your child best, whether this be they need a little something, or an appointment at the doctor.  . WHEN your little one goes to nursery do pack a spare outfit including socks, shoes or wellies and trousers - not for toilet accidents but because it is till nice to play outside but it can be wet or muddy and it is not nice to sit about later in damp clothes.  . HELP your two and three year olds learn how to blow their nose AND put the tissue in the bin not back in the box- it is a skill and does need practise but the sooner they learn the more comfortable they feel. . TEMPERATURE, a normal temperature in babies and children is about .C but this can y slightly. A fever is usually considered to be a temperatureof C or above’ . It is handy to have a thermometer at home for these worrying times - do ask for advice from a pharmacist about which is best to buy and easiest to use. But always be mindful of your little one’s temperaturethey are poorly - and especially mindful with babies.  . PLEASE don’t wipe their nose with kitchen roll - this can make it sore, use tissues with balm in them - yes I know they can be more expensive but bargain shops do great deals.Be careful wiping noses with wet wipes as some can sting - soft tissues and vaseline don’t! . EXTRA, sometimes people use a vapour, like Vicks, to rub onto their baby, toddler or child’s chest, or feet, these can be soothing when applied to the body but you can also get them as a humidier, or as an oil to pop in the bath - it’s up to you to choose what is right for your little one. Please do be aware that there are age restrictions on them and not all are suitable for all ages.  . DO make your child wear a coat and a hat for very cold weather and maybea scarf and glovesit’s very chilly.  . DON’T force your child to eat too muchthey are poorly, little and often is best, snotty noses can often lead to sickly tummy’s, but do make sure they are getting plenty of fluids so they do not become dehydrated, water, water and more water or failing that juice. . . EVEN though it’s cold outside and your little may be full of cold sometimes a walk in the fresh air for a short time can help - fresh air can make you feel better and help your little one sleep better too - just remember to wrap up warm.  . DO encourage your little one to eat lots of vegetables and fruit, all the time not just when they have a cold, these are full of vitamins that will help them to develop a good immune system. Fingers crossed these few little things help, good luck fighting the cold bug. Atishooooo!

You have Celtic Thunder and Celtic Woman but theres not one man doing this, like a young Tommy Fleming.This last couple of months it has all kicked off for me with the successof the album and my show at the Millennium Forum being announced.Ive always wanted to do my own show in my hometown.Ive supported The Fureys at the Millennium Forum and hada few other guest spots but to have my own show is amazing.It has storytelling and uses a voice from beyond, so its quite dferent.Conor is currently in rehearsals for theMillennium Forum show and there are still a small number of tickets available.His -track album, A New Dawn, is available from his Facebook pageConorMcGintyMusic and on iTunes and Spoty at pound..His show of the same name will be at the Millennium Forum on March  and tickets are priced at pound. from the Millennium Forum Box Office   . googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

when he ran onto a pass from Marty McCourt to shoot past Blackwood.Forest replaced Kane with Matt McCormick and the young striker almost scored immediately, but was denied by an excellent save from Blackwood whose out-stretched leg prevented a certain goal.In the th minute McCormick did find the net after some excellent approach play from Burkowski.Moments later a superb run from Olympicrsquos Thomas Rogers almost ended with a deserved goal, but his shot flashed over the Forest crossbar.A good performance from Tollymore that resulted in a deserved win, but can they repeat the performance this weekend as consistency is whatrsquos important Best for Tollymore were James Jennings and a remarkable first half performance from Paul Devlin, but in truth it was a good team performance.Match sponsor: Diamond Patrsquos, Newcastle.Tollymore Forest Ballynahinch Olympic III NEWCASTLE LEAGUE DIVISION .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th January 2020 Flagship.jpg","title":"Flagship Festival of Flight set to return  ","story":"IT has been confirmed that the Festival of Flight will be ing to Newcastle in June.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos flagship tourist event will take place on Saturday, June .This festival, which comprises exciting displays both on and off the ground is expected to attract tens of thousands of visitors to the resort.It has not yet been confirmedthe RAF Red Arrows display team will be taking part.The Festival of Flight is part of the councilrsquos lsquoGiant Adventuresrsquo programme of events which was announced this week.They include Wake the Giant in Warrenpoint in August, and Footsteps in the Forest in Slieve Gullion Forest Park.The Councilrsquos tourism programme will also include the DownTime Festival in Downpatrick from June -, the Strangford Lough Skfie Festival from July -August , and the Strangford Lough and the Narnia Festival in Kilbroney Park, Rostrevor, from November -.Council chairman Charlie Casey said: ldquoThese flagship festivals are key events in our programme of tourism events.ldquoWe are very pleased that the Festival of Flight, Wake the Giant and Footsteps in the Forest are all scheduled toto our district in .ldquoThese festivals act as a catalyst to inspire visitors to visit our area.

It has been downgraded to a Type II emergency unit which we believe is not sufficient. The Downe was only one of two hospitals in the past  years which had had its needs fully assessed before it was built.ldquoThere is a clearly established case for a -hour emergency service in Downpatrick operating seven days a week and nothing has happened at the Department of Health or anywhere  to suggest otherwise. Service changes were made in the past due to staffing issues, nothing .Mr McGrady also revealed that changes are planned at the Downe with surveyors visiting the hospital recently to examine where the proposed new MRI scanner will be located.He said the provision of the scanner will result in an extension being built and also open the door to allow the hospital to do so much more in terms of diagnostics and other opportunities,Campaigners also insisted at last weekrsquos meeting that space is needed to reopen  beds closed in the same week of the new Downersquos official opening in , highlighting the need for everyone mdash including politicians and Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash to work together on this particular issue and that it was time for the ldquoinjustices of the past in terms of local health care provision to be addressed.Mrs Anne Trainor highlighted the lack of investment in local hospital services in the past and said it was time that the Downe Hospital was firmly on the ldquolips of the decision makers and that the local area got its fair share of funding.Looking to the future, she saidthe Downe does become a centre of excellence for the elderly, this will pave the way for other new services to add to those already in place.She also backed calls for more beds to be provided in the Downpatrick hospital and is keen to see the local council taking an active role on health and working alongside campaigners.ldquoHealth is the single most important issue and we have been hammering home this message for years, she declared.ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council needs to play a serious role in the delivery of healthcare. The former Down Council put its hands in its pocket to help the hospital campaign but its successor has been lacking in this regard.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoWe want a fully ing hospital that provides this community with the services it needs. We already have an excellent hospital and fantastic staff, but the community deserves what everyone  has.ldquoWe also need to to engage with local medical providers who are the experts.

In addition to her work with children, Laura is also keen to show her support for the work carried out by the charity.Explaining the nature of her work, Laura said that it centres around helping children deal with emotional behavioural problems through play.She has a dedicated toolkit to help which includes sand trays, miniature toys, stuffed toys, hand puppets and books containing therapeutic stories to help deliver the so-called Play  Grow project.A qualied play therapist who is registered with Play Therapy UK, Laura has been working with children since  and previously spent time working in Downpatrick where she did her voluntary placement with Action for Children based at the Ballymote Centre.She explained that the opportunity to set up her new service came about as a result of her volunteering work with Le Change Changes Lives, with her work focusing on children aged between four and .ldquoI work with children who have emotional behavioural problems, those dealing with bereavement and loss or who have separated or orced parents, Laura continued.ldquoI also work with those who have anger of anxiety issues, those who may have become withdrawn, have communication problems or have suffered forms of abuse or nightmares. I also work with those who are being bullied or who are bullies themselves.Laura, who offers a free consultation with parents, said children can release their inner feelings through play.She explained that play is a childrsquos natural medium of self expression, highlighting the number of times children ask their parents to play with them and have a chat. Laura said children feel most comfortable in this environment.ldquoAs play is what children are comfortable with, it makes sense that you would use this method to help them through a dficult time. This is particularly effective for children who cannot or who do not want to talk about their problems.ldquoThey can play out their feelings and problems anda child wants to talk to me here of course they can do that. Some children say that they do not want to talk about whatever trauma is in their lives and I say to them that is great because they do not have to.ldquoHowever, they will still express those feelings through play and may in fact not be aware that this is what they are doing. The metaphor is very powerful in the play therapy room and children can hide behind a mask to demonstrate their feelings and using a puppet is a very good example of that.Laura said her work is a method of helping children with behavioural and emotional problems to help themselves, explaining that is the children do all the work.ldquoI am just here as a facilitator, she said. ldquoPlay therapy is not always fun and sometimes the children will encounter dficult feelings. I adopt a child-centred approach where the child leads the way and the therapist follows which is non directive.ldquoOne of the most important aspects of play therapy is the element of control. For some children when something has happened in their le or environment it is a thing which they cannot control which causes trauma. When they come here, this is the one place they can come in and say lsquoright we are doing this my wayrsquo and it can take back control.Laura described play therapy is ldquonon judgemental and said children know they are in a safe environment and can express themselves in any way in which they will be accepted or who they are.She added: ldquoThe children will learn that while here they can be themselves and they will feel comfortable to be themselves.Laura can be contacted on   or via her social media page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th January 2020 New.jpg","title":"New minister at Lissara church  ","story":"A NEW chapter in the history of Lissara Presbyterian Church opened last weekend with the installation of the Rev Alan Burke.A large congregation attended last Friday eveningrsquos service in Crossgar with the new minister looking forward to his time working in the area.For the past two and a half years, Mr Burke was assistant minister at the Loanends and Killead churches near Aldergrove.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win. Keir fits the bill. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
