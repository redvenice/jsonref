parliamentary proceedings and brought about a \u0027constitutional collision\u0027.He told the Marr Show: \u0027If an amendment goes through where Parliament takes control of the order paper then that leaves open the door to Parliament then legislating to take no-deal off the table.\u0027And that is something that Brexiteers like me would see as a massive risk to Brexit because if Brexiteers and Parliament votes against the deal and also votes to take no-deal off the table then the only option is to then have European parliamentary elections.\u0027Mr Barclay said if the Commons takes control of the order paper and votes for a different outcome, it would \u0027potentially collide with fundamental commitments the Government has given in their manifesto\u0027, though he said the vote itself would \u0027not be binding\u0027.Explaining the scenario, he said: \u0027What Parliament has done is vote for a number of contradictory things so we would need to untangle that but ultimately, at its logical conclusion, the risk of a general election increases because you potentially have a situation where Parliament is instructing the executive to do something that is counter to what it was elected to do.\u0027  Hilary Benn, the Labour chairman of the Brexit committee and a supporter o a second referendum, told Ridge: \u0027Whoever is the leader of the Conservative Party, if Parliament decides that it is prepared to support a way forward, and if Parliament decides that it then wants to put that to the British people in a confirmatory referendum, then the nation needs leadership that is prepared to compromise.\u0027That\u0027s the crucial point and the reason Theresa May is in such difficulty this morning is she has steadfastly refused to shift an inch.\u0027\u0027And it\u0027s no

Then, to the surprise of friends, in 2009 he married Rose Hanbury, a willowy ex-model, 23 years his junior.They had met at a party at the Villa Cetinale, the grand Italian home of the disgraced Tory peer Lord Lambton — Rose’s sister, Marina, is married to Lambton’s heir Ned, the Earl of Durham.         In 2014 William and Kate decided to move full time to Anmer Hall, the country house close to Sandringham that was given to them by the QueenThe comely sisters, who were once pictured in swimsuits with former prime minister Tony Blair have an impeccable pedigree. Their grandmother was Lady Elizabeth Longman, a bridesmaid at the Queen’s wedding to Prince Philip.The Cholmondeleys’ home is Houghton Hall, a stunning Palladian mansion built in the 1720s for Britain’s first Prime Minister, Sir Robert Walpole. The 106-room pile is barely four miles from Anmer and it was soon being reported that the Cholmondeleys with their three children were part of the so-called ‘turnip toffs’, a set of well-born friends of William and Kate with North Norfolk homes.           Among their near neighbours was the Marquess of Cholmondeley, 58, who as Lord Great Chamberlain had a unique role at the State Opening of Parliament (pictured in 2007)— walking backwards in front of the QueenMembers were said to include William and Rosie van Cutsem, the Earl and Countess of Leicester, who live at Holkham Hall and James and Laura Meade, who is a godmother to Prince Louis.One weekend report said the Cholmondeleys’ twin sons, Alexander and Oliver, were playmates of Prince George, despite the four-year age gap between them.Rose and David were both guests (of the Queen) at William and Kate’s wedding in 2011, and three years ago the royal couple attended a black tie gala at Houghton Hall. Rose and Kate, meanwhile are patron and royal patron respectively of the charity East Anglia Children’s Hospices, and the Duchess has attended the Houghton Hall horse trials with her children.William and David would appear to have less in common. The marquess — French-speaking, piano-playing and a lover of modern art — is, after all, the same age as his late mother. The men have been shooting together, but this is normal among landowners in Norfolk.So does all that add up to a close friendship? According to an authoritative family source, the two couples have been to each other’s homes only three times.                William appears to have little in common with the marquess — French-speaking, piano-playing and a lover of modern art — who is, after all, the same age as his late mother. The men have been shooting together, but this is normal among landowners in Norfolk‘They see each other occasionally and like each other,’ a figure close to Rose tells me.‘They are not part of each other’s close circle. It isn’t even remotely a bosom-close friendship.’Nevertheless, tongues started wagging. Last week the Daily Mail did report in its diary gossip that there was competition between the duchess and the marchioness. But Saturday’s Sun newspaper reported that the ‘falling out’ was ‘much worse than first thought’.A source was quoted by the newspaper as saying: ‘They used to be close but that is not the case any more.’ It said William offered to make peace but added: ‘Kate has been clear that she doesn’t want to see them any more and wants William to phase them out, despite their social status.’At first, William and David laughed the rumours off — I am told they even reached the ears of the wider Royal Family. But the latest reporting has changed the atmosphere.I understand both men are baffled by the rumours and insist there is no rift between them or their wives.A family source told me: ‘These hurtful rumours of a fall-out are simply false. William and David were in touch with each other over the weekend, not knowing whether to laugh or complain. Both wives are hurt by the suggestion that there is any argument or even a coolness between them. They have plans for future events involving their charity.‘This is a question of a lie going round the world before the truth has even had time to take its boots off.’ Another family figure said: ‘A whisper which had no basis or truth has turned into a roar.                 William and Kate (pictured at the St Patrick\u0027s Day parade in Hounslow) have not been photographed exchanging so much as a cross word in public. Richard Kay understands that both William and the Marquess of Cholmondeley are baffled by the rumours and insist there is no rift between them or their wivesBoth couples laughed when it was first carelessly put around and endlessly repeated, even though it was patently not true. As more and more people passed it on, it took on a life of its own and has now become hurtful and toxic.’A family friend of Rose said: ‘It has now become very upsetting and they are all concerned for each other, as they have never before had to start denying something for which these is no evidence or even a smidgen of truth. It is just mad.‘David and Rose have been to Sandringham and shot with William and Kate, but they have been to each other’s houses fewer than three times each — some rift!’For William and Kate the developments are especially troubling. They have always been enormously careful about friendships and they have placed a premium on trust. They have eschewed the celebrity friends that Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex appear to like to surround themselves with.No friends of Kate have gone chatting to gossipy magazines as Meghan’s have done to People and Vanity Fair. As a royal wife and mother, Kate has never put a foot wrong, her family are loyal and discreet. She carries out her official duties with enthusiasm.She and William have not been photographed exchanging so much as a cross word in public. But while William has never indulged in the kind of ‘what Meghan wants, Meghan gets’ foot-stamping as Prince Harry is said to have done, he knows how important she is as a mother and a future queen.And if this whole sorry episode turns out to be some cack-handed attempt to dent Kate’s unshakeable standing with the public, it has almost certainly backfired.

Effectively there would be a bus and cycle lane running where gardens are now, and then stopping abruptly when it meets the embassy wall. I can see why, in that it would be difficult, and maybe impossible to compulsorily purchase embassy lands, but it makes no sense.”However he said, the map indicates part of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) embassy on Pembroke Road is proposed for acquisition.“The difference is the Dutch embassy is marked on the Ordinance Survey map the NTA used, but the UAE isn’t. It indicates to me that this was just a desktop exercise and no one actually went out and walked the route.”There were also major road changes, that would have a significant impact on Ballsbridge traffic, the significance of which seemed under-appreciated, he said.“Elgin Road at the side of the American embassy is being closed as a through road and turned into a quasi cul de sac. I can’t quite see the logic in that.”The maps also gave no indication of how much of people’s gardens were proposed for acquisition, he said.“It could be 5m it could be 7m. The only way to do it is to look at the existing road and try to judge how much wider it would have to be to accommodate two more traffic lanes and two cycle lanes.”What do residents think?Pierce and Freda Meagher who live next door to the Dutch embassy said it “appears about 12ft ” of their garden would be required.“It seems odd that they won’t be touching the embassy, but they could take up to 12ft of our garden – that’s a phenomenal amount of space – then what happens? The bus just stops at the embassy wall?” said Mrs Meagher.Mr Meagher said he was not opposed to improving bus service. “We do use the bus and I cycle”, but he said he hoped any land acquisition would be minor.“You don’t defeat something like this, there has to be compromise. I would like the chance to negotiate, but they don’t tell us how much they want to take.”Hilary Hough lives on Nutley Lane and part of his garden has been earmarked for acquisition, but he is primarily concerned about the changes proposed to the roadway.“They are proposing to convert a two-lane road into a six lane highway it will totally destroy the lane. The traffic is is already constant . With a car lane, a bus lane and a cycle lane on both sides it’s going to make it virtually impossible for people to exit their houses.”A spokeswoman for the NTA said: “If widening of the road is required we would seek for this to occur by agreement between the NTA and the parties involved.”In relation to the issue at the Dutch embassy she said there was “sufficient width to accommodate the layout required”.The UAE embassy did not respond to queries from The ."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Five-block complex planned for St Peter\u0026rsquos Bakery site on Parnell StreetLeaflets distributed to 5,000 public offices to help public prepare for UK\u0026rsquos exit from EUDelay to nationwide ban has also provoked strong criticism from fuel distributors who have invested large sums in clean fuel plantsMartin Swords insists he was wrongly punished twice at Carrickmines Luas stationLegislation to pass Seanad, D\u0026aacuteil by Brexit deadline despite claims haste unnecessaryFG plan would consign people to poverty while claiming to help them, says Willie O\u0026rsquoDeaMap \u0026lsquoanomalies\u0026rsquo mean some embassies protected while others not, claims FG councillorTwo-thirds of command posts for troop rotation in Lebanon remain unfilledResearch contradicts earlier study showing decriminalisation led to greater uptakeCommon reasons include inadequate signage, notice errors and motorist proof of paymentFinance Bill introduced stricter penalties after claim producers had been manipulating systemNTA hiring extra staff due to build-up of appeals and complaints about private clampersUnions say the practices cost the State hundreds of millions of euro in lost revenue, and can deny workers key rights and benefitsAudit of Malawi scheme found governance and safeguarding fell \u0026lsquofar short\u0026rsquo of required standards\u0026lsquoI really believe that if it happened on the east coast it would have been sorted out long ago\u0026rsquoDaily expenses allowance increases to \u0026euro38.80 a week for adults and \u0026euro29.80 for childrenWatchdog seeks more clarity from Oireachtas committee on legal protection for reportEco-friendly journey to use biomethane in bid to play part in reducing carbon emissionsNeed for cost-benefit analysis on projects slowing down new homes, council chief saysAncient Order of Hibernians says it was \u0026lsquoshocked\u0026rsquo by post mocking Beto O\u0026rsquoRourke"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3837190.1553456358!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"future of border fudged in 750 000 brexit information leaflets","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe information leaflets say that avoiding a hard border remains a priority for the Government “in all circumstances”. Photographer: Bryn ColtonBloombergThe Government has printed 750,000 information leaflets to prepare people and businesses for Brexit but has fudged the issue of what would happen to the Border if the UK leaves the European Union without a deal.The leaflets are being distributed to more than 5,000 State outlets and public offices such as post offices, Garda stations, public libraries and GP surgeries as the Government ramps up preparations for Brexit.The public are being told in the two leaflets – one aimed at citizens and the other at businesses – that avoiding a hard border remains a priority for the Government “in all circumstances” but offers no clues as to how it would go about achieving this in the event of the UK crashing out of the EU without an agreement.The leaflet says that without the proposed EU-UK orce deal “avoiding a hard border is more challenging and requires detailed discussions between Ireland and the EU and, ultimately, with the UK”.“In that scenario the outcome will be made public as soon as possible,” the Government says in the section under “Northern Ireland”.Irish citizens in the North are assured in the citizens’ leaflet, entitled “Brexit and You,” that they will “continue to have EU citizenship wherever they live” and that they will “continue to enjoy the right to travel and live and work anywhere in the EU and have EU protection against discrimination”.Common Travel AreaThe information leaflets highlight the Common Travel Area, the long-standing arrangements that will remain in place after Brexit that give Irish and British citizens the right to live and work in, and travel freely between, each other’s countries.The leaflets aimed at businesses encourage them to consider UK-issued certifications and licences that may no longer be valid in the EU after Brexit, particularly for medical devices, chemicals and building products.There had been plans to test some of the Government’s no-deal contingency planning this week ahead of the UK’s original departure date of March 29th but these have been put on hold after EU leaders last week granted Theresa May’s UK government an additional two weeks to find a solution to the Brexit stalemate.If the British prime minister can convince MPs to pass her withdrawal agreement, already rejected twice by the UK parliament, then the exit date will be pushed back to May 22nd to pass the necessary legislation.If she fails to get the agreement passed, the UK must propose an alternative plan by April 12th including the possibility of a longer Brexit extension and running candidates in the European elections on May 23rd.The Government’s more intensive preparations include a public information campaign that is likely to involve national adverts, highlighting information on Brexit preparedness that is already available publicly and directing people to information about Brexit on the Government’s main Gov.ie website.No decision has yet been made about the timing of possible adverts on the public awareness campaign that would run under the Government’s long-running “Getting Ireland Brexit Ready” slogan.The Revenue Commissioners and the Office of Public Works, which are involved in no-deal planning, have said for operational reasons they are not in a position to provide detail on what, if any, simulated exercises may be planned to test the capacity of Dublin and Rosslare ports to handle post-Brexit border checks.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

So I’ve a body of work today.” However, Fianna Fáil social protection spokesman Willie O’Dea said he will resist any attempts to introduce this policy in the budget later this year. Fianna Fáil’s acquiescence is needed to pass the budget. “If she pushes this, we will have to push back. I am completely opposed to it.”Mr O’Dea said the CPI reflected the price of “Ferraris, yachts, the whole lot” and could not be applied to those at risk of poverty. He said it would be “effectively maintaining the status quo year to year” and was indicative of Fine Gael’s general approach. The Limerick TD said Fine Gael would be consigning people to poverty while claiming to help them. How do we tackle climate change?Meanwhile, new climate change targets will mean 70 per cent of the State’s electricity will be generated from renewable sources, such as offshore wind farms.In the coming weeks, Minister for Climate Action Richard Bruton is expected to publish a plan outlining how we can improve our performance in tackling climate change. Speaking at the Fine Gael conference in Wexford over the weekend, Mr Bruton said the plan will include a commitment to increase the electricity target to 70 per cent by 2030 from its current level of 55 per cent. This is in line with the position of the all-party Oireachtas committee on climate change. And Mr Bruton said it will be “a very substantial step up in ambition in terms of a switch to renewable. The reason for it of course is that there is no point in switching to electric vehicles unless you have a clean and renewable electric network. “It will require significant changes. We will have to strengthen our grid. It will mean we will look beyond onshore wind and we will have to prepare for a significant offshore wind capacity in our system.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3837260.1553470631!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pressure mounts on may to set out timetable for resignation","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s prime minister Theresa May leaving church near High Wycombe, England, on March 24th. Photograph: Henry NichollsReutersTheresa May’s cabinet will seek to agree a new strategy for Brexit on Monday amid mounting pressure on the prime minister to set out a timetable for her resignation. Mrs May and senior ministers met leading Brexiteers, including Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, at Chequers on Sunday in an attempt to win support for her Brexit deal.Earlier two cabinet ministers rumoured to be ready to replace her as prime minister offered public support to Mrs May, and said there should be no immediate change of leadership. David Lidington, Mrs May’s de facto deputy, and environment secretary Michael Gove both dismissed speculation about a possible caretaker premiership.“I don’t think that I’ve any wish to take over from the PM who I think is doing a fantastic job. If there’s one thing that working closely with the prime minister does it’s cure you completely of any lingering shred of ambition to do that task,” Mr Lidington said.Mr Gove and Mr Lidington joined the prime minister at Chequers alongside chief whip Julian Smith, Brexit secretary Steve Barclay, foreign office minister Alistair Burt and Conservative party chairman Brandon Lewis. Mr Johnson and Mr Rees-Mogg were joined by fellow backbenchers Steve Baker, Dominic Raab, David Davis, Iain Duncan Smith and Damian Green. “The PM and a number of government ministers met today at Chequers for lengthy talks with senior colleagues about delivering Brexit. The meeting discussed a range of issues, including whether there is sufficient support in the Commons to bring back a meaningful vote this week,” a Downing Street spokesman said.Indicative votesMPs will vote on Monday on whether to take control of the parliamentary timetable this week to stage a series of “indicative votes” on alternatives to Mrs May’s Brexit deal. Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond acknowledged on Sunday that if MPs reject the deal for a third time they will have to seek a cross-party majority for a different option.“Parliament will have to come together around a proposition that can gather a majority, and what I’m hearing in parliament at the moment is lots of different ideas from different factions, but that won’t solve the problem. “Those backbench leaders of different groups have got to get themselves together in a room and decide what they can compromise on because if parliament won’t compromise we’ll end up at the end of this process no further forward than we were at the beginning of it,” he told Sky News.Mr Barclay described MPs’ attempt to take control of the parliamentary timetable as “constitutionally unprecedented” and a very serious risk to Brexit. He suggested that if parliament instructed the government to negotiate a softer Brexit, including customs union or single market membership, there could be a general election.“Ultimately at its logical conclusion the risk of a general election increases because you potentially have a situation where parliament is instructing the executive to do something that is counter to what it was elected to do.” PostponedMonday’s votes follow last week’s decision by EU leaders to extend Britain’s EU membership, which was due to end next Friday, until April 12th. If Mrs May’s deal wins parliamentary approval this week Brexit will be postponed until May 22nd to allow Westminster to pass necessary implementation legislation.Hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated in London on Saturday demanding a second referendum, and 5 million people have signed a petition calling on parliament to cancel Brexit by revoking article 50.Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said on Sunday that his party would demand that any Brexit deal MPs approve must be put to a confirmatory referendum before it can be implemented.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Friday was not the end of what the American president tweeted was ‘the World’s most expensive Witch Hunt’. Photograph: Evan VucciAP I got a call at 3pm Friday from the Washington electric company telling me that a manhole in front of my house was smoking, that the underground cable to my house had burned up because it was old and that all the power in my house was out. “I can’t come home now,” I told the electric guy. I was extremely busy doing what everyone else in town was doing – nothing. Waiting. My house was the least of it – the whole city was short-circuiting.After word spread that Robert Mueller was going to deliver his report to the Justice Department at noon Friday, a fog of anxiety crept in on little cat feet. (Sorry, Carl Sandburg. ) After the president flew off to Mar-a-Lago, the skies darkened and rain pelted down. We drank coffee and waited. We ate burgers and waited. We watched basketball and waited for Mueller’s March Madness. All day, cable chatterers ranted about this being a significant moment in American history, but no one was sure yet what the significance was. As William Goldman once said of Hollywood, “Nobody knows anything.” And as Tom Petty sang, “The waiting is the hardest part.”Democrats yearned to have Mueller scream “Collusion!” like Marlon Brando once screamed “Stella!” And come to the podium to announce: “This is a real national emergency. The president is a Russian agent and needs to go immediately, along with his family.” They wished Bobby Boy Scout would go up to the Capitol and act like Rachel McAdams’ Regina George in Mean Girls, when she strides down the halls of the school scattering pages into the air that she had copied from the dishy Burn Book. No chance.MeticulousThe 74-year-old, an Ivy League graduate and a decorated marine in Vietnam, is so meticulous that he would not even deviate to wear a blue shirt when he ran the FBI, seeing that as compromising his integrity. He has run the only disciplined, airtight operation in the undisciplined, leaky Trump era. Not even Rudy Giuliani, the president’s lawyer, knew what was happening when the Times’ Katie Rogers tracked him down at the Trump hotel at 1.30pm, as he sat at a table in the lobby and worked his cellphone trying to get information.No one, from the president on down, knew exactly when the report would come or what it would say. With his usual bravado about his base, Trump told Fox’s Maria Bartiromo that “people will not stand for it” if the report was damning. All we really knew was that this was a pivotal moment, not only for Trump but also for his Javert.If the special counsel delivered a weak gruel, after all the time, money, newsprint and digital space lavished on it, people would demand to know why he hadn’t pulled the plug long ago. By Friday morning, White House officials had been feeling better and Democrats who had once fantasised that Mueller would put Trump in a jumpsuit to match his hair began to emphasise that it was their congressional investigations and New York prosecutors that were going to bring Trump to justice. Still, no one knew for sure.Happy HourIt was not thought that Trump would be indicted, because Justice Department rules say a president can’t be indicted. So, the question was: Would Mueller imply that the only thing that saved Trump from an obstruction charge was the fact that he was sitting in the Oval Office? How much evidence would Mueller show that Trump actually tried to obstruct justice? As Happy Hour approached, Attorney General William Barr notified the White House and congressional leaders that Mueller had delivered his report. The two Republicans are good friends who go back decades, a fact that startled Trump when Barr mentioned it during his confirmation hearings. (When Barr was attorney general the first time, under George HW Bush, he was Mueller’s boss, when Mueller led the criminal ision.)In his letter to the leaders of the House and Senate Judiciary committees, Barr said he might be able to brief them on the main conclusions of the report this weekend. The Justice Department said no more indictments were coming in the Russia investigation. Could Don Jr. and Jared have shaken off the bloodhounds? The scene Friday was far more occluded than the media hullabaloo on September 9th, 1998, when two dark vans pulled up to Capitol Hill with 36 boxes containing Ken Starr’s report on presidential chicanery.Starr was a star leaker and showboat, and journalists and the public were quickly able to get their hands on the document on which the fate of the Republic was hanging. It was something of a shock to learn that the supposedly dignified independent counsel – who was once on a shortlist for the Supreme Court – had delivered a 445-page bodice ripper, a trite story of an office affair in all its seamy particulars, told with such sanctimony that it was redolent of Nathaniel Hawthorne. It was clear that the sins recorded were not black enough to merit impeachment. Politicians in Washington have been having illicit sex and lying about it since George Washington slept here.Impeaching ClintonBut that didn’t stop Republicans from impeaching Bill Clinton that December. In the end, the reputation of Starr and the hypocritical Republicans, some of whom were having their own affairs with young government aides, suffered. And the country suffered as well. Clinton came out more popular, until #MeToo caught up with him. As much as Trump will spin victory and claim it’s all over, Friday was not the end of what the president tweeted was “the World’s most expensive Witch Hunt”. Democrats, aflame with investigative zeal, demanded that the report be made public and all of Mueller’s files be turned over to Congress. Mueller may be winding down, but the Democrats are just getting wound up.Read more about the Donald Trump administration"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/10/TELEMMGLPICT000051671687_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqO65TkrT7BriBrd3fK6VEg2oOnP5Tf-6BsL77M1adEXU.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"sir philip green staff told wear revealing clothes visited","story":"Sir Philip Green in 2014 with models, left to right, Suki Waterhouse, Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne, Sienna Miller and Naomi Campbell.

Mr de Bernhardt Wood previously worked for the Diocese of Oxford and was made national adviser for giving and income generation by the Church in January.In 2007 he published a book of advice called the Porcupine Principle, described as a unique, fund-raising classic, which is promoted on several Church of England websites.In it he writes: Standing orders are God\u0027s special gift to fundraisers.They are administratively easy, they feel painless to the donor and, as you have probably worked out, you often forget to stop them.Fundraising through forgetfulness may not seem particularly noble or principled, but it is pragmatic, and in fundraising pragmatism is king.Later in the book he tells an unnamed charity that those most likely to leave legacies to charities were single, elderly, poor females, and advises that they should target those most vulnerable to our fundraising message.Without exception, the trustees were appalled, he admits.He goes on to say: In my book, and let\u0027s face it, this is my book, the ends justify the means.Wendy Cocks, vice-chairman of the charity Christians on Ageing, said she feared the Church was now backing a more aggressive way of fundraising.Forgetfulness should never be a way to make money, she said.It feels like the Church has resorted to chugging.Older people are especially vulnerable to this sort of thing. If they become unwell then they need their financial resources to pay for care. We can\u0027t allow people\u0027s cash to drain out of their bank account.I totally understand the appeal of regular donations, and the Church does need to raise money, but it needs to act with caution.A spokesman for the Church defended Mr de Bernhardt Wood\u0027s appointment, and confirmed that senior staff had been aware of his views before he was hired.Recent figures show that churchgoers gave £751million from 12,000 parishes, but offerings have declined in recent years and up to 20 church buildings are closed for worship each year.Contactless collection plates have even been introduced in some churches to encourage parishioners to use their bank cards to donate money.Sign up for your essential, twice-daily briefing from The  with our free Front Page newsletter.Church of EnglandPlease review our commenting policyWinston Churchill\u0026#39s top hat and cigars liberated from a rubbish dump - and valued at £10,000Children of Isil\u0026#39s caliphate left to toil in squalid refugee campsBrexit latest news: Theresa May told to quit as Tory Remain rebels admit plan to seize control could backfireNetanyahu cuts short US trip after rocket attack from Gaza wounds sevenBrexit: What will MPs vote on in Parliament this week?Victoria, series 3 episode 1 review: Victoria returns with poise, passion and higher stakesThe \u0026#39children of the Caliphate\u0026#39 face an uncertain future as SDF urges west to take citizens backThe migrants plucked from the sea, only to face TB in Libyan detention centresComment: Friendship is perishable – just ask the Duchess of CambridgeRead in full: US attorney general\u0026#39s summary of Mueller report into Trump and Russian meddlingImpeachment drive skids to a halt as Mueller backs Trump on collusion David Lidington and Michael Gove deny they will replace Theresa May in coup over BrexitChild, 11, and woman injured in suspected shooting in LondonCriminals use dead rats to smuggle Spice into jail because prison black market in drug is so lucrative Charity launches super-complaint against police for treating slavery victims as criminals, rather than protecting them from perpetratorsPrince Charles pays respects to revolutionary hero in landmark visit to CubaTrain bosses try to stop antisocial behaviour by playing classical music at hotspot stationsBaptiste, episode 6, finale review: an oddly paced and underwhelming finale for the French detectiveVictoria\u0026#39s forgotten sister Princess Feodora: the real story of the queen\u0026#39s relationship with her beloved German siblingBaptiste, episode 6 finale recap: dirty dossiers and inside men, but who gets to live happily ever after?We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/03/20/19/Brexit-angela-3.jpg  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6995831  role= photo  tabindex= 1  width= 135  height= 108  layout= responsive  alt=   srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/03/20/19/Brexit-angela-3.jpg","title":"brexit delay pound euro gdp exchange rate no deal","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

This is what he did at the Dormen Food Company, and then at Lovedean Granola.However, after selling the granola business he was “looking around for something to do”.Created with Sketch.Stunning photos of food by Anett Velsberg Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.“Then I met Paul,” he says, referring to Paul Lindley, the founder and former chief executive of Ella’s Kitchen.“He’s a very persuasive and inspiring man,” says Cuddigan. “I have been selling stuff to supermarkets for 25 years but Ella’s has changed what I think about business and how it should be done.”One of the reasons that Ella’s Kitchen sparked Cuddigan’s interest was that the opportunity to work there arose just after the birth of his first baby,\u0026nbsp“so I was quite interested in the baby arena”, he says.“In any business there’s a certain intuition. For me having two kids means I’m interested. It certainly helps, it means I can empathise with our customers.”He joined the group in 2011 as a director, and became chief executive in 2013, taking over from Lindley.\u0026nbspThe widely held view is that it’s difficult to step into a founder’s shoes, but Cuddigan says that wasn’t the case for him.“Most people say it’s really really tricky but I have to say Paul was incredible. He knew how difficult it would be for me to take over with him sitting in the background, I knew it was difficult for him because he wanted to stay involved but he took a massive step back. Taking over was relatively easy because he was there to support me, and he gave me total autonomy.”Ella’s Kitchen dominates in two very important, overlapping markets – it makes food for babies and toddlers, and all its products are organic.“We are really proud of what we have achieved nutritionally,” says Cuddigan.Food in general has become too cheap and undervalued\u0026nbspand as such I think the quality of the food that we are eating is pretty poorHowever, despite the popularity of his brand, he thinks there is a long way to go with encouraging British consumers to make healthier choices when it comes to food.“I’m not sure that people are opting for healthier alternatives.”Cuddigan blames the low price of the products on offer in UK supermarkets.“Food in general has become too cheap and undervalued and as such I think the quality of the food that we are eating is pretty poor.”He gives the example of a ready meal that might retail for £1.50: “Once you have taken in the producers’ margin, you are probably talking about something that’s been made for 15p.Food exports to be turned away in no-deal Brexit ID mark \u0027chaos\u0027The surprising ingredients lurking in your foodInflation hops up with rising beer and food prices“We need to reset that in consumers’ minds, that good quality food costs money.”He readily acknowledges the reason Ella’s Kitchen is an outlier in this regard.“It’s difficult but ever so slightly easier in our category, because parents prioritise their children’s foods.”This adherence to high-grade, organic ingredients has made Ella’s Kitchen the popular brand that it is today, but it has also created obstacles.For one thing, it makes it difficult to compete on price. In recent years, Cuddigan says, Ella’s\u0026nbspKitchen came up with a new snack offering, but as it got closer to the launch, it became clear the product would be “more than two times the price of the nearest market rival” and so it had to be spiked.So would the company opt to use cheaper ingredients in order to lower retail prices?“The temptation is there but we are not going to do it, that’s a zero-sum game,” says Cuddigan.Meanwhile, the brand\u0026nbspis also facing turbulent times heading into Brexit.“A hard Brexit would be devastating to our business, because we have a very complicated UK supply chain and we use high-grade organic produce,” says Cuddigan.“We have been planning for over a year. In terms of time resource it’s been one of our biggest projects.“The most frustrating thing is we don’t know what we are planning for.”However, Cuddigan is clear that potential disruption will not have any impact on the quality of the products Ella’s Kitchen brings to the market.“The number one priority has to be trust,” he says, illustrating this point with a reference to the horse meat scandal which rocked the UK’s food sector in 2013.“We survived that scandal, we knew we were going to be fine, because we knew exactly where our meat was coming from.”“I want to be happy at work and I want to do work that’s valuable,” Cuddigan says.“I feel quite strongly that when you look at these companies that have been in scandals they will have values that are stuck up on the wall. If they followed those values they wouldn’t be in those scandals.”We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

It was on the side of the angels with the second of those, and stands a better chance of winning the next fight\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentHyundai\u0027s patriach Chung Moon-Koo. The family Chung family is locked in a battle with Elliott over HyundaiHyundai Motor was celebrating victory this morning. Its investors rejected a demand for the appointment of several new directors and a huge special idend, tabled by the activist investor, Elliott Advisers, which has become a major thorn in the side of the South Korean conglomerate.\u0026nbspPaul Singer’s outfit may have pushed too hard when it came to the size of the Won7tn (£4.7bn) idend it wanted. Hyundai has vast reserves of cash, but its profits have been in decline and the global outlook is cloudy for the motor industry. Given the latter, it’s perhaps understandable that investors baulked and opted for the company’s offer, even though it is worth less than a sixth of what Elliott was proposing.It was on far firmer ground with its demand for a shake up in the boardroom to foster improved governance and greater accountability at the firm, one of the country’s famed family controlled Chaebol that have long dominated the South Asian nation’s vibrant economy. They have been facing criticism on a number of fronts, including the charge of taking minority investors for granted.\u0026nbspHyundai creates app to unlock and control vehicles with mobile phoneHyundai unveils walking car to help save livesHyundai to introduce new electric cars for 2022While this battle may have been lost Elliott’s war is far from over.\u0026nbspIt won a dust up\u0026nbspover a proposed\u0026nbspownership restructuring last year, which critics held was designed solely to benefit the Chung family, and cement its control.The next one will come when a revised plan is submitted later this year. Hyundai only needed the support of 50 per cent of its investors to knock Elliott back over the idend and board seats, and it was assisted by investors such as South Korea’s National Pension Service, the second biggest shareholder, falling in behind the Chung family.\u0026nbspA revised restructuring plan could require up to two thirds support to pass. Elliott should find that easier to win if it objects by aligning with other overseas investors. They hold about half the company.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

They can be of benefit to lumbering,\u0026nbspunderperforming companies with moribund boards that get stuck in the mud and are in need of a good jolt. But they can also cause a great deal of damage in their desire for a quick buck, leaving scorched husks behind them and longer term investors scratching their heads and wondering how it happened.\u0026nbspHowever, while its demand for a huge payout from Hyundai is debatable, Elliott’s call for improved governance sees it on the side of the angels. It\u0027s a sad fact that good corporate governance is an under rated virtue\u0026nbspand it sometimes seems to require the movement of financial mountains to achieve it. Elliott is a rare outfit with the clout to make it happen when so minded.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspIts activities are certainly being watched very carefully by other Chaebol for fear they’ll be next\u0026nbspas investors in the country demand more influence, better returns.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The supermarkets described the CMA’s provisional findings into the merger, as “prohibition in all but name”.Sainsbury\u0027s boss Mike Coupe and Asda chief executive Roger Burnley added: “We have asked the CMA to correct significant errors in its provisional findings.Created with Sketch.

Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Before Garden State and 500 Days of Summer, the team behind the adaptation of Nick Hornby’s novel compiled 15 tracks like a mixtape. It was one its lead character would have approved of: as with many of the soundtracks on this list, High Fidelity’s success lies in a balance between old-school gems by the Velvet Underground, The Kinks and Elvis Costello to Noughties newcomers like Stereolab and Royal Trux.This may seem like sacrilege given that the first Dirty Dancing soundtrack is indisputably the more iconic of the two. And yes, the sequel (essentially a remake set in Cuba during the 1950s), starring Romola Garai and future Rogue One star Diego Luna, suffered from a plot loaded with clichés and lack of chemistry between its two lead actors. But the soundtrack – featuring the Grammy-nominated Latin fusion band Yerba Buena, Colombian rock band Aterciopelados, and the Cuban hip hop group Orishasis – is what draws me back to this guilty pleasure of a film. Dirty Dancing 2 didn’t really deserve such a soundtrack, but it adds some actual heat to a film that, asides from the superb dance routines, leaves you cold.Martin Scorsese had strict rules for the soundtrack to his film Goodfellas: each song had to have been around during the time in which the scene was set, and the tracks had to make some kind of comment on the scene or character in question “in an oblique way”. A staggering 48 songs are heard during the film, including classics by Dean Martin, Fred Astaire and The Drifters, Sid Vicious, The Who and The Rolling Stones. One of the most unforgettable moments is when Bobby Darin’s “Beyond the Sea” plays as the Wise Guys cook dinner, which was “always a big thing” in prison.When it comes to soundtracking your movie, it helps if the director is a massive music nerd. Of course, music was always going to play a huge part in a film about a boy in a band and his video game quest to win the girl of his dreams. But Edgar Wright, a former music video director, found a way to seamlessly integrate his soundtrack into Scott Pilgrim vs the World’s narrative. Beck, who wrote the music for Scott Pilgrim’s garage band Sex Bob-omb, was a perfect match for their chaotic, DIY approach, while Metric’s song “Black Sheep” was used for a performance by ex-girlfriend Envy Adams’s (Brie Larson) band The Clash at Demonhead.Drive wouldn’t have worked as well as it did without the soundtrack. Steven Soderbergh\u0027s go-to composer Cliff Martinez assembled the songs for Nicolas Winding Refn’s ambitious indie project, showing an understanding that the most effective soundtracks are often the ones that transport you into the movie without you realising. By using a set of mostly female vocalists, all of whom sing over dry electronic beats, Martinez achieved a sonic portrayal of Drive’s startling juxtaposition between beauty and violence.It’s the biggest movie soundtrack of all time and the 15th best-selling album in the US. Whitney Houston breathed new life into songs by Dolly Parton (“I Will Always Love You”) and Chaka Khan (“I’m Every Woman”). Five of the songs performed by Houston were hits: I Will Always Love You, I\u0027m Every Woman, I Have Nothing, Run to You (both Oscar-nominated), and Queen of the NightYes, it was the Fab Four\u0027s worst film, but the soundtrack is packed with some of their best songs: “I am the Walrus”, She Loves You and “Hello, Goodbye”. Where A Hard Day’s Night, Yellow Submarine and Help were undoubtedly more influential on popular culture, Magical Mystery Tour is the most fun to listen to – regardless of how much effort is required to watch.Few films offer as comprehensive a look at hip-hop stars during the heights of their creative powers – even though the movie itself was a clumsily written crime drama. Belly’s soundtrack captured the East Coast rap scene as it stepped towards a grittier sound and underwent one of the most important transitions for any genre in music history – with contributions from the likes of D’Angelo, members of the Wu-Tang Clan, Nas and Jay-Z.At the time, it felt like Richard Kelly’s dark and gloomy film starring a young Jake Gyllenhaal was one of the few to truly capture what it meant to be a confused, alienated teenager. With composer Michael Andrews, Kelly picked some the best songs from an era that dealt in existential angst via upbeat synth-pop: Echo and the Bunnymen, Duran Duran, Tears for Fears, The Pet Shop Boys and more. By choosing to close the film on Michael Andrews’ cover of Tears for Fears’ “Mad World”, Kelly underpins both the self-absorbed attitude of teenagers convinced that only the artists singing these songs truly understood them, and the nostalgia felt by their parents who were there in the moment.Midnight Cowboy – the first X-rated film to win the Oscar for Best Picture – took original material and pre-existing songs to complement the theme of a naïve cowboywannabe sex worker trying to survive in a big city, and the juxtaposition between Jon Voight’s character Joe Buck and dying con artist “Ratso” (Dustin Hoffman). Fred Neil\u0027s song “Everybody\u0027s Talkin\u0027”, which underscores the first act, won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Vocal Performance, Male (for Harry Nilsson).Trent Reznor’s work on David Lynch’s 1997 neo-noir movie is loaded with stark electronics and instrumentals by Angelo Badalamenti. In between, you have Smashing Pumpkins, Nine Inch Nails and, of course, This Mortal Coil’s “Song to the Siren” – a track that caught Lynch’s attention and inspired him to co-write two albums for Twin Peaks chanteuse Julee Cruise.1240 29. The Last Days of Disco (1998)Whit Stillman’s 1998 indie-classic starred then-virtual unknowns Kate Beckinsale and Chloë Sevigny as friends and roommates in early-Eighties New York. Add that to a wall-to-wall disco soundtrack and you’ve got an intoxicating film, set 20 years after the genre’s heyday, with classic dancefloor anthems from Chic, Diana Ross, and Sister Sledge belted out one after the other.  In the summer of 1992, the soundtrack to a film that flopped at the box office offered the masses the gateway they needed into the Seattle grunge scene. Cameron Crowe wanted the Singles soundtrack to be “more like a simple mixtape of Seattle’s finest”, and ended up with a veritable who’s-who of every important band from that moment in music history: Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Smashing Pumpkins, Soundgarden and Mudhoney… everyone apart from Nirvana. Regardless, almost three decades after the film’s release, the soundtrack serves as a landmark for one of the most pivotal moments in music history.Adapting literary classics to modern-day high-school scenarios was the big thing in the Nineties. Cruel Intentions came from Pierre Choderlos de Laclos’s 18th-century work, Les Liaisons Dangereuses, and starred Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe as Kathryn and Sebastian: two spoilt, bored rich kids toying with the naïve and virtuous Annette (Reese Witherspoon). John Ottman was originally enlisted to compose the score, but producers decided that wouldn’t sit well with the teenage demographic it was going for and instead plumped for a soundtrack of Placebo, Blur, Skunk Anansie, Aimee Mann and Counting Crows. This mix of credible and corny mirrors a typical experience we go through as adolescents, discovering iniduality via the music we listen to and trying to leave the theatrics behind. The cult status of both the featured music and the film itself suggests we can never let the drama go completely.Flashdance, the first collaboration between producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, is important because it actually changed how some of the most popular films of the Eighties were shot. For each song featured in the film there is a scene presented in the same way as a music video, like the use of “Maniac” as Alex (Jennifer Beals) trains for her dance audition, or the lead song of the film “What a Feeling”, which plays during the opening montage of the steel mill. The latter, written by Italian composer Giorgio Moroder, Keith Forsey and Irene Cara (who performed the track), became the singer’s first and only number one hit. It also won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, a Golden Globe, and a Grammy for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Michael Sembello’s “Maniac”, meanwhile, went on to become one of the highest-grossing songs ever written for a film.While Half Nelson isn’t as highly regarded as Lars and the Real Girl or Drive,  it’s the one that helped Ryan Gosling break away from his status as the heartthrob from The Notebook. It also has a phenomenal soundtrack steered by Broken Social Scene, whose brilliant collection of B-sides proved indispensable for this film about a drug-addicted middle-school teacher struggling to deal with the aftermath of a breakup. In between those tracks you’ve got gritty hip hop that shows Dan\u0027s crossover into the world of his pupil, the stoic Drey (Shareeka Epps) – from New York collective Dujeous, to Rhymefest.1740 24. Lost in Translation (2003)Sofia Coppola has a history of needle drops that encapsulate certain moods that can’t be expressed through dialogue, particularly if it involves a medley of shoegaze from Air and My Bloody Valentine, and the full-throttle debauchery of Peaches on “Fuck the Pain Away”. The soundtrack was so influential that several critics suggested it had something to do with the rebirth of shoegaze in the mid-Noughties. Either way, there a few better songs to close a film than Jesus and Mary Chain’s “Just Like Honey”, that plays just after the kiss goodbye between Bob (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) and that indecipherable whisper.Former Massive Attack producer Nellee Hooper is the brainchild behind one of the greatest film soundtracks of all time. Working with composers Craig Armstrong and Marius de Vries, he beta-tested many of the tracks that ended up on the album by playing them at 5am to afterparty guests at his house in London. Others took direct inspiration from Shakespeare’s original text, with Justin Warfield of One Inch Punch and Art Alexakis of Everclear both allowed to watch early edits of scenes from the film to inspire them. Like the soundtracks for Kill Bill, Trainspotting and Marie Antoinette, it’s the vast eclecticism of the songs featured in Romeo + Juliet that make you remember each one, and the scene where each is used, for years after first seeing the film.As well as making a star of reggae singer Jimmy Cliff, both the film and soundtrack for The Harder They Come exposed mainstream audiences to the emerging Kingston recording industry, helping bring the genre to the US and beyond. Only the title track was an original recorded by Cliff for the movie the rest were singles released in Jamaica between 1967 and 1972, including Cliff’s superb “You Can Get it if You Really Want”, plus songs from seminal artists like Toots and the Maytals and Desmond Dekker.A veritable masterpiece: The Beach soundtrack is what gives this film starring a fresh-faced Leonardo DiCaprio its vitality, capturing the essence of the trance music heard during Thai beach parties during the Nineties. It was supervised by Pete Tong, who said the songs, including Moby’s “Porcelain” and Dario G’s “Voices”, are what make the film “watchable time and time again”. The way the music progresses mirrors the grit and darkness that begin to emerge out of paradise.2140 20. Pretty in Pink (1986)John Hughes virtually pioneered the formula for teen movies soundtracked by angsty British post-punk rock. Echo \u0026amp the Bunnymen, The Smiths, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and New Order all appeared on what is essentially Hughes’s checklist of what cool kids were – or should have been – listening to in the Eighties.    Curated and co-executive produced by Kendrick Lamar, the Black Panther soundtrack brought on a select group of extraordinary talent that would understand the themes in the film, from Anderson .Paak to Earl Sweatshirt. Leading this group is Lamar himself, undoubtedly the best choice of artist for a film that explores responsibility, black power, family dynamics and loyalty. Where Jay-Z failed to step aside on the Great Gatsby soundtrack and let other artists do their thing, Lamar is more interested in highlighting the skills of his fellow artists, like South African singer Babes Wodumo, or Jorja Smith. It’s true that the Black Panther album pales in comparison to some of Lamar’s solo work, but it’s rare to see a soundtrack that so deeply considers the subject matter it has been presented with, and the responsibility of continuing the story through music.2340 18. Dazed and Confused (1993)Dazed and Confused was relatable even if you didn’t happen to spend your teenage years riding shotgun in a 1975 Chevy El Camino. This is largely due to director Richard Linklater highlighting an era of raucous butt-rock anthems and stoner jams, from Alice Cooper’s “School’s Out” to Ted Nugent’s “Stranglehold”.In a year that was saturated with serious historical and period dramas, from a remake of Jane Eyre to The Queen, Marie Antoinette stood out for its highly stylised and fun approach to a well-known figure. Director Sofia Coppola took a similar approach with the music as James Gunn did for s of the Galaxy, mixing new wave and post-punk – including The Strokes, New Order, Adam and the Ants and The Cure – with period music by Baroque composers Vivaldi and Couperin. By doing so, Coppola gave her audience something to relate to, and a soundtrack that suited Marie Antoinette’s rebellious teenage spirit. The best example of this is in the shopping scene – set to the song “I Want Candy” by Bow Wow Wow – that famously included a pair of purple Converse: one of the most defining fashion items of Nineties teen culture. It is a brilliant yet subtle alignment of modern Western consumerism and the outrageous decadence at Versailles during the 18th century.One of the most eclectic compilations to grace cinema-goers’ ears in recent years: the Call Me By Your Name soundtrack wins for those three songs by Sufjan Stevens alone. The American singer-songwriter remixed his 2010 track “Futile Devices” and also wrote two new songs specifically for the film: “Visions of Gideon” and “Mystery of Love”, the latter of which was nominated for the Best Original Song Oscar. Director Luca Guadagnino worked with film editor Walter Fasano and music supervisor Robin Urdang, all understanding that music would play a “vital role”. He wanted the music to give the film a “precise identity” that would act as a “voice” in the movie, he told Billboard. “That’s when I thought of Sufjan Stevens.” Other tracks, like the buoyant “Love My Way” by The Psychedelic Furs, captured the wistful, heady nature of hot, endless summers in Italy during the Eighties.Of course, any biopic about the rise and fall of gangsta rap collective NWA had to have a killer soundtrack – especially if its former members were involved in its production. Even so, the meticulous care with which the soundtrack for Straight Outta Compton was assembled is impressive, and provides backdrop for an origin story about some of the most influential and important records – and artists – of the Eighties and Nineties.2740 14. 500 Days of Summer (2009)This offbeat romantic comedy has developed cult status over the years and stood out at the time for its original take on the “boy meets girl” genre. Music is what first drew characters Summer (Zoe Deschanel) and Tom (Joseph Gordon Levitt) together (they start talking after Summer overhears The Smiths playing on Tom’s MP3 player). Each song mirrors the various highs and lows the characters go through, helped by director Marc Webb’s background making music videos for indie pop artists. Regina Spektor’s song “Hero” is the perfect backdrop for the scene where Tom realises his hopes of getting back with Summer are futile the track closes on the lyric “no one’s got it all”, as if to point out that not everyone gets the fairytale ending they hope for.A veritable smorgasbord for any self-respecting music nerd: Baby Driver took movie soundtracks to a whole other plane. The Fault in Our Stars actor Ansel Elgort stars as “Baby”, a skilled getaway driver who relies on a steady stream of music in order to counteract the effects of tinnitus.There are vintage cuts from The Beach Boys, Beck and Barry White, and Seventies rock gems by Queen and Golden Earring. Yet it was the slightly more unassuming song “Bellbottoms” from the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion album Orange that initially inspired the film. A then 21-year-old Edgar Wright was sitting in his bedroom, “completely broke”, when he began to visualise a car chase set to the songs on that album.George Lucas managed to amplify the already-nostalgic mood on his “summer of ‘62” film by choosing songs from the mid-to-late Fifties as the lead tracks on the American Graffiti soundtrack. Songs from Buddy Holly and Chuck Berry to The Beach Boys are all presented by legendary disc jockey Wolfman Jack.3040 11. 10 Things I Hate About YouIf Pretty in Pink captured teenage angst in the Eighties, 10 Things I Hate About You achieved it for the decade that followed. Unlike many films of the Nineties, which attempted to capitalise on the major rock stars of the day, 10 Things managed to select what is essentially a list of one-hit wonders, from Letters to Cleo and Semisonic to Save Ferris. When you watch the film today, it only serves to fuel that feeling of nostalgia and add to its ever-growing cult status.3140 10. Do the Right Thing (1989)Spike Lee’s Brooklyn-based masterpiece is set to a breathtaking jazz score conducted and composed by his father, Bill Lee. It’s also punctuated by summer jams and blissful ballads, or the urgent demands of Public Enemy’s “Fight the Power”, which is played from Radio Raheem’s boombox a number of times through the film.Until Eden, there was no film about club culture that took the scene seriously. French filmmaker Mia Hansen-Love’s character Paul (Felix de Givry) is based on the experiences of her brother Sven – a relatively popular DJ who had to look on as his peers, including Daft Punk, achieved global fame by pioneering the early EDM scene. Its soundtrack offers a comprehensive look at the house, jungle and garage music that was the lifeblood of Paris youth culture in the Nineties, but is also carefully chosen to match the situation of the film’s characters. Daft Punk’s “Veridis Quo” signals a mood-change at a celebratory dinner, while “Happy Song” by Charles Dockins conveys Paul’s euphoria as his hero Tony Humphries works the decks in a New York club.  This was one of the first films to be defined by its music Mike Nichols also helped pioneer the practice of curating pre-existing songs that would appeal to a pop radio audience. Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel’s music was the perfect fit when it came to music that would show Dustin Hoffman’s character’s intensifying feelings of isolation, particular whenever “The Sounds of Silence” was used.This was one of the first films to also be defined by its music Mike Nichols also helped pioneer the practice of curating pre-existing songs that would appeal to a pop radio audience. Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel’s music was the perfect fit when it came to music that would show Dustin Hoffman’s character’s intensifying feelings of isolation, particular whenever “The Sounds of Silence” was used.Curtis Mayfield’s third studio album was released as the soundtrack to the Blaxploitation film of the same name. It was groundbreaking for its themes of poverty and drug abuse which made the record stand out among the less socially aware music of its time. It would go on to influence everyone from TV score composers to soul singers in the decades that followed.3540 6. s of the Galaxy (2014)The soundtrack for Danny Boyle’s adaptation of Irvine Welsh’s novel was so popular it promoted a release of a second soundtrack a year later, in 1997. After two decades, it still holds up as one of the greatest and most lovingly curated collections of songs in music history. The use of “Lust for Life” in the opening scene triggered something of a career renaissance for Iggy Pop (one that many would argue didn’t do him many favours). There’s a romanticised overdose set to Lou Reed’s “Perfect Day”, and Heaven 17 soundtrack a club scene with “Temptation”. A particularly disgusting toilet scene is set to Brian Eno’s “Deep Blue Day” and French composer Georges Bizet’s “Carmen Suite No.2”.Quentin Tarantino didn’t commission a traditional film score for what is arguably his most adored film, 1994’s Pulp Fiction. Instead, he mixed American surf music and classic rock and roll, including the late Dick Dale’s “Misirlou” in the iconic opening scene. The track was suggested to Tarantino by musician Boyd Rice, via their mutual friend Allison Anders. The soundtrack had such an impact – reaching number 21 on the Billboard 200 and selling more than two million units by 1996 – that it was credited with “reinvigorating” surf rock and sparking a trend by advertisers to use it in their commercials, “to help sell everything from burritos to toothpaste”. Chuck Berry’s song “You Never Can Tell”, also known as “C’est la Vie”, also enjoyed a resurgence in popularity thanks to its use in the famous dance scene with Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta). Neither Cameron Crowe nor his music coordinator Danny Bramson wanted to pander to the charts for this story based on the director’s years as a teenage rock journalist. If anything, they avoided tracks that seemed like potential radio favourites, choosing lesser-known songs like “Sparks” from The Who’s album Tommy as the theme for Crowe’s alter-ego William Miller. The music is essentially a whole other character – a narrator who offers running commentary on the scenarios the others find themselves in. And there are few scenes more uplifting than the one in Almost Famous where, having retrieved guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) from a drugs and alcohol-fuelled party, the fictional band Stillwater and their crew take up a rowdy singalong to Elton John’s “Tiny Dancer”.Prince\u0027s acting debut took place in a film that also produced one of his greatest works. The concept for the plot, about a talented but tortured frontman of a band in Minneapolis, was developed by Prince during his 1999 tour. Purple Rain was one of the 10 highest-grossing films of 1984 and shows Prince as his best and most outrageous self. Yet the songs also provided a window through the Purple One\u0027s enigmatic facade, to reveal the soul beneath.The Wu-Tang Clan’s RZA worked with director Quentin Tarantino on the collection of music that would accompany Uma Thurman’s character The Bride on her bloody quest for revenge. What is particularly brilliant is the alternation between non-diegetic sound and the silence that precedes and lasts during some of the most tense action sequences. When it comes to the most crucial battle between O-Ren Ishii and The Bride at the end of the film, they first chose the disco flamenco intro from Santa Esmeralda\u0027s Latin arrangement of “Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood”. At the gory conclusion, where O-Ren falls, RZA and Tarantino used Meiko Kaji’s “The Flower of Carnage”. The song was first used in the 1973 martial arts film Lady Snowblood, in which Kaji starred. She sings: “I’m a woman who walks at the brink of life and death Who emptied my tears many moons ago” and then: “I’ve immersed my body in the river of vengeance.” It\u0027s as though the song was written with The Bride in mind.Before Garden State and 500 Days of Summer, the team behind the adaptation of Nick Hornby’s novel compiled 15 tracks like a mixtape. It was one its lead character would have approved of: as with many of the soundtracks on this list, High Fidelity’s success lies in a balance between old-school gems by the Velvet Underground, The Kinks and Elvis Costello to Noughties newcomers like Stereolab and Royal Trux.This may seem like sacrilege given that the first Dirty Dancing soundtrack is indisputably the more iconic of the two. And yes, the sequel (essentially a remake set in Cuba during the 1950s), starring Romola Garai and future Rogue One star Diego Luna, suffered from a plot loaded with clichés and lack of chemistry between its two lead actors. But the soundtrack – featuring the Grammy-nominated Latin fusion band Yerba Buena, Colombian rock band Aterciopelados, and the Cuban hip hop group Orishasis – is what draws me back to this guilty pleasure of a film. Dirty Dancing 2 didn’t really deserve such a soundtrack, but it adds some actual heat to a film that, asides from the superb dance routines, leaves you cold.Martin Scorsese had strict rules for the soundtrack to his film Goodfellas: each song had to have been around during the time in which the scene was set, and the tracks had to make some kind of comment on the scene or character in question “in an oblique way”. A staggering 48 songs are heard during the film, including classics by Dean Martin, Fred Astaire and The Drifters, Sid Vicious, The Who and The Rolling Stones. One of the most unforgettable moments is when Bobby Darin’s “Beyond the Sea” plays as the Wise Guys cook dinner, which was “always a big thing” in prison.When it comes to soundtracking your movie, it helps if the director is a massive music nerd. Of course, music was always going to play a huge part in a film about a boy in a band and his video game quest to win the girl of his dreams. But Edgar Wright, a former music video director, found a way to seamlessly integrate his soundtrack into Scott Pilgrim vs the World’s narrative. Beck, who wrote the music for Scott Pilgrim’s garage band Sex Bob-omb, was a perfect match for their chaotic, DIY approach, while Metric’s song “Black Sheep” was used for a performance by ex-girlfriend Envy Adams’s (Brie Larson) band The Clash at Demonhead.Drive wouldn’t have worked as well as it did without the soundtrack. Steven Soderbergh\u0027s go-to composer Cliff Martinez assembled the songs for Nicolas Winding Refn’s ambitious indie project, showing an understanding that the most effective soundtracks are often the ones that transport you into the movie without you realising. By using a set of mostly female vocalists, all of whom sing over dry electronic beats, Martinez achieved a sonic portrayal of Drive’s startling juxtaposition between beauty and violence.It’s the biggest movie soundtrack of all time and the 15th best-selling album in the US. Whitney Houston breathed new life into songs by Dolly Parton (“I Will Always Love You”) and Chaka Khan (“I’m Every Woman”). Five of the songs performed by Houston were hits: I Will Always Love You, I\u0027m Every Woman, I Have Nothing, Run to You (both Oscar-nominated), and Queen of the NightYes, it was the Fab Four\u0027s worst film, but the soundtrack is packed with some of their best songs: “I am the Walrus”, She Loves You and “Hello, Goodbye”. Where A Hard Day’s Night, Yellow Submarine and Help were undoubtedly more influential on popular culture, Magical Mystery Tour is the most fun to listen to – regardless of how much effort is required to watch.Few films offer as comprehensive a look at hip-hop stars during the heights of their creative powers – even though the movie itself was a clumsily written crime drama. Belly’s soundtrack captured the East Coast rap scene as it stepped towards a grittier sound and underwent one of the most important transitions for any genre in music history – with contributions from the likes of D’Angelo, members of the Wu-Tang Clan, Nas and Jay-Z.At the time, it felt like Richard Kelly’s dark and gloomy film starring a young Jake Gyllenhaal was one of the few to truly capture what it meant to be a confused, alienated teenager. With composer Michael Andrews, Kelly picked some the best songs from an era that dealt in existential angst via upbeat synth-pop: Echo and the Bunnymen, Duran Duran, Tears for Fears, The Pet Shop Boys and more. By choosing to close the film on Michael Andrews’ cover of Tears for Fears’ “Mad World”, Kelly underpins both the self-absorbed attitude of teenagers convinced that only the artists singing these songs truly understood them, and the nostalgia felt by their parents who were there in the moment.Midnight Cowboy – the first X-rated film to win the Oscar for Best Picture – took original material and pre-existing songs to complement the theme of a naïve cowboywannabe sex worker trying to survive in a big city, and the juxtaposition between Jon Voight’s character Joe Buck and dying con artist “Ratso” (Dustin Hoffman). Fred Neil\u0027s song “Everybody\u0027s Talkin\u0027”, which underscores the first act, won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Vocal Performance, Male (for Harry Nilsson).Trent Reznor’s work on David Lynch’s 1997 neo-noir movie is loaded with stark electronics and instrumentals by Angelo Badalamenti. In between, you have Smashing Pumpkins, Nine Inch Nails and, of course, This Mortal Coil’s “Song to the Siren” – a track that caught Lynch’s attention and inspired him to co-write two albums for Twin Peaks chanteuse Julee Cruise.1240 29.

Regina Spektor’s song “Hero” is the perfect backdrop for the scene where Tom realises his hopes of getting back with Summer are futile the track closes on the lyric “no one’s got it all”, as if to point out that not everyone gets the fairytale ending they hope for.A veritable smorgasbord for any self-respecting music nerd: Baby Driver took movie soundtracks to a whole other plane. The Fault in Our Stars actor Ansel Elgort stars as “Baby”, a skilled getaway driver who relies on a steady stream of music in order to counteract the effects of tinnitus.There are vintage cuts from The Beach Boys, Beck and Barry White, and Seventies rock gems by Queen and Golden Earring. Yet it was the slightly more unassuming song “Bellbottoms” from the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion album Orange that initially inspired the film. A then 21-year-old Edgar Wright was sitting in his bedroom, “completely broke”, when he began to visualise a car chase set to the songs on that album.George Lucas managed to amplify the already-nostalgic mood on his “summer of ‘62” film by choosing songs from the mid-to-late Fifties as the lead tracks on the American Graffiti soundtrack. Songs from Buddy Holly and Chuck Berry to The Beach Boys are all presented by legendary disc jockey Wolfman Jack.3040 11. 10 Things I Hate About YouIf Pretty in Pink captured teenage angst in the Eighties, 10 Things I Hate About You achieved it for the decade that followed. Unlike many films of the Nineties, which attempted to capitalise on the major rock stars of the day, 10 Things managed to select what is essentially a list of one-hit wonders, from Letters to Cleo and Semisonic to Save Ferris. When you watch the film today, it only serves to fuel that feeling of nostalgia and add to its ever-growing cult status.3140 10. Do the Right Thing (1989)Spike Lee’s Brooklyn-based masterpiece is set to a breathtaking jazz score conducted and composed by his father, Bill Lee. It’s also punctuated by summer jams and blissful ballads, or the urgent demands of Public Enemy’s “Fight the Power”, which is played from Radio Raheem’s boombox a number of times through the film.Until Eden, there was no film about club culture that took the scene seriously. French filmmaker Mia Hansen-Love’s character Paul (Felix de Givry) is based on the experiences of her brother Sven – a relatively popular DJ who had to look on as his peers, including Daft Punk, achieved global fame by pioneering the early EDM scene. Its soundtrack offers a comprehensive look at the house, jungle and garage music that was the lifeblood of Paris youth culture in the Nineties, but is also carefully chosen to match the situation of the film’s characters. Daft Punk’s “Veridis Quo” signals a mood-change at a celebratory dinner, while “Happy Song” by Charles Dockins conveys Paul’s euphoria as his hero Tony Humphries works the decks in a New York club.  This was one of the first films to be defined by its music Mike Nichols also helped pioneer the practice of curating pre-existing songs that would appeal to a pop radio audience. Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel’s music was the perfect fit when it came to music that would show Dustin Hoffman’s character’s intensifying feelings of isolation, particular whenever “The Sounds of Silence” was used.This was one of the first films to also be defined by its music Mike Nichols also helped pioneer the practice of curating pre-existing songs that would appeal to a pop radio audience. Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel’s music was the perfect fit when it came to music that would show Dustin Hoffman’s character’s intensifying feelings of isolation, particular whenever “The Sounds of Silence” was used.Curtis Mayfield’s third studio album was released as the soundtrack to the Blaxploitation film of the same name. It was groundbreaking for its themes of poverty and drug abuse which made the record stand out among the less socially aware music of its time. It would go on to influence everyone from TV score composers to soul singers in the decades that followed.3540 6. s of the Galaxy (2014)The soundtrack for Danny Boyle’s adaptation of Irvine Welsh’s novel was so popular it promoted a release of a second soundtrack a year later, in 1997. After two decades, it still holds up as one of the greatest and most lovingly curated collections of songs in music history. The use of “Lust for Life” in the opening scene triggered something of a career renaissance for Iggy Pop (one that many would argue didn’t do him many favours). There’s a romanticised overdose set to Lou Reed’s “Perfect Day”, and Heaven 17 soundtrack a club scene with “Temptation”. A particularly disgusting toilet scene is set to Brian Eno’s “Deep Blue Day” and French composer Georges Bizet’s “Carmen Suite No.2”.Quentin Tarantino didn’t commission a traditional film score for what is arguably his most adored film, 1994’s Pulp Fiction. Instead, he mixed American surf music and classic rock and roll, including the late Dick Dale’s “Misirlou” in the iconic opening scene. The track was suggested to Tarantino by musician Boyd Rice, via their mutual friend Allison Anders. The soundtrack had such an impact – reaching number 21 on the Billboard 200 and selling more than two million units by 1996 – that it was credited with “reinvigorating” surf rock and sparking a trend by advertisers to use it in their commercials, “to help sell everything from burritos to toothpaste”. Chuck Berry’s song “You Never Can Tell”, also known as “C’est la Vie”, also enjoyed a resurgence in popularity thanks to its use in the famous dance scene with Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta). Neither Cameron Crowe nor his music coordinator Danny Bramson wanted to pander to the charts for this story based on the director’s years as a teenage rock journalist. If anything, they avoided tracks that seemed like potential radio favourites, choosing lesser-known songs like “Sparks” from The Who’s album Tommy as the theme for Crowe’s alter-ego William Miller. The music is essentially a whole other character – a narrator who offers running commentary on the scenarios the others find themselves in. And there are few scenes more uplifting than the one in Almost Famous where, having retrieved guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) from a drugs and alcohol-fuelled party, the fictional band Stillwater and their crew take up a rowdy singalong to Elton John’s “Tiny Dancer”.Prince\u0027s acting debut took place in a film that also produced one of his greatest works. The concept for the plot, about a talented but tortured frontman of a band in Minneapolis, was developed by Prince during his 1999 tour. Purple Rain was one of the 10 highest-grossing films of 1984 and shows Prince as his best and most outrageous self. Yet the songs also provided a window through the Purple One\u0027s enigmatic facade, to reveal the soul beneath.The Wu-Tang Clan’s RZA worked with director Quentin Tarantino on the collection of music that would accompany Uma Thurman’s character The Bride on her bloody quest for revenge. What is particularly brilliant is the alternation between non-diegetic sound and the silence that precedes and lasts during some of the most tense action sequences. When it comes to the most crucial battle between O-Ren Ishii and The Bride at the end of the film, they first chose the disco flamenco intro from Santa Esmeralda\u0027s Latin arrangement of “Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood”. At the gory conclusion, where O-Ren falls, RZA and Tarantino used Meiko Kaji’s “The Flower of Carnage”. The song was first used in the 1973 martial arts film Lady Snowblood, in which Kaji starred. She sings: “I’m a woman who walks at the brink of life and death Who emptied my tears many moons ago” and then: “I’ve immersed my body in the river of vengeance.” It\u0027s as though the song was written with The Bride in mind.In the trailer, Dora is seen attending high school for the first time after spending most of her life in the jungle with her parents.The 40 greatest film soundtracks of all timeEvery Marvel Phase 4 film announced so farThe 65 best movie insults of all timeDespite being told to stay in the city while her parents search for the City of Gold, Dora finds herself leading her monkeybest friend Boots (voiced by Danny Trejo), Diego (Jeffrey Wahlberg) and a group of her schoolmates on an adventure to save her parents and solve the mystery of the lost city.The film is directed by James Bobin, with Julia Pistor, John G\u0026nbspScottiserving, and Derbez as executive producers.

And 28 per cent said educating the school community would help.The survey comes after a report from Public Health England (PHE) called for a raft of measures, including stopping cars idling near school gates, promoting car-pool lanes, and providing priority parking for electric cars.Cars should be banned near schools, says public health chiefIt is also calling for congestion charges to be imposed in cities across the UK.Published earlier this month, the report said air pollution is the biggest environmental threat to health in the UK, with between 28,000 and 36,000 deaths a year attributed to long-term exposure.Sophie Gallois, Unicef UK’s director of advocacy and communications, said: “Every day, one in three children in the UK is breathing in harmful levels of air pollution that could damage their health and impact their future.“Worryingly, children are most exposed to toxic air on the school run and while at school, so a ban on motor vehicles outside the schools gates has potential to make a real difference.“Reducing children’s exposure to air pollution is not just about the school street itself, but also taking quieter routes to school, away from busy main roads.“The government must take urgent action to tackle this growing health crisis by putting children’s health at the heart of its work on air pollution.”Air pollution responsible for more deaths than smoking, study saysLondon council accused of putting ‘lives at risk’ over air pollutionNo-deal Brexit could force schools into ‘lockdown’ due to air qualitySustrans CEO Xavier Brice said: “We need to radically change the way we travel.“Idling car engines and snarled up roads poison the air and our children’s bodies across the UK.“For too long now, dangerous levels of air pollution near schools have been ignored. Finally this is starting to change.“Our survey makes it clear that teachers want urgent action to clean up toxic fumes.“They see closing the roads outside their school as an effective solution but need support.”A government spokesperson\u0026nbspsaid: “We are committed to driving down emissions across all modes of transport, and recognise that greener travel options are a crucial way to clean up our air.“Just last week we announced a £23m investment to rejuvenate cycling and walking across the UK, on top of the £2bn we are investing over the course of this parliament.”Leaders of cities across the UK are also calling on the government to provide £1.5bn of funding to remove polluting vehicles from the streets.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, is proposing the fund alongside UK 100, a network of local government leaders,\u0026nbspin a bid to move the country towards 100 per cent clean energy by 2050.Additional reporting by PAWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Are you kidding me? Give me a break! Everyone, including Facebook, have tech debt and security debt that piles up. But that\u0027s not an excuse any longer, Sam Curry, chief security officer at security firm Cybereason, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.Facebook is starting to look like critical social infrastructure, where there responsibility is to the public.

How can we trust this platform to get bigger and get more connected under the hood if they can\u0027t do the basis blocking and tackling right?

Their deaths on Pakistan’s ‘Killer Mountain’\u0026nbspleave a sport reckoning with its own burgeoning popularity, writes Adam WithnallClick to followThe IndependentThe bodies of British climber Tom Ballard and Italian Daniele Nardi were found after a two-week searchTom Ballard will never climb Everest. Before his death on Pakistan’s Nanga Parbat was confirmed earlier this month, the prodigious British mountaineer would joke that he had been scaling peaks since before he was born –\u0026nbspin a way, it was what he was born to do.\u0026nbspAged just 30, Ballard already had some extraordinary feats on his climbing resume, foremost among them his record for scaling all six of Europe’s most challenging north faces in a single winter.Ballard’s mother was Alison Hargreaves, the first woman ever to climb Everest solo in 1995 and who, equally famously in the eyes of the press at the time, then died descending K2 the same year, leaving behind a husband, Jim, and two children, Tom and his sister Kate.\u0026nbspShe carried Tom up the north face of the Eiger in the Swiss Alps when she was six months pregnant, and after he was born the family moved to Scotland so Hargreaves could practice on the local crags.The story of how Ballard came to attempt this particular mountain –\u0026nbspthe mountain where his body will remain unless and until a recovery attempt is made –\u0026nbspis as much about his co-climber Daniele Nardi as it is about the way this extraordinary, exhilarating yet occasionally deadly sport has evolved since Ballard’s mother’s own demise.Ballard, 30, and Nardi, 42, were attempting to reach Nanga Parbat’s 8,126m peak via the most direct route, the Mummery Spur. It is an audacious approach, flanked on both sides by towering ice walls that make avalanches a regular occurrence and requiring “mixed climbing” across both ice and rock, a technique beyond even some of the most proficient mountaineers.Created with Sketch.Peaks of Europe Show all 35Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.‘Peaks of Europe’ is a photobook by Johan Lolos.

Then we have no choice:\u0026nbspjust hold on until we get better weather.”It was only three years ago, in early 2016, when an international team of climbers made the coveted first winter ascent of Nanga Parbat by any route, leaving K2 as the only mountain above 8,000m anywhere in the world that has yet to be conquered in winter.Muhammad says he understands the urge to conquer a mountain in a way that has never been done before. “Daniele and Tom were trying to make a new history in winter climbing,”\u0026nbsphe says.But the Mummery Spur, he says, is not just one of the hardest ways to summit Nanga Parbat\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspit is, in Muhammad’s view, the most difficult unconquered route anywhere in Pakistan, perhaps even the world.Nanga Parbat is seen as a far greater challenge for serious climbers than Everest\u0026nbsp(AP)Simone Mori, the star Italian climber among the group that completed the winter ascent in 2016, has described the Mummery Spur as “suicidal”. “It is ice, rocks, snow, and deep crevasses, and that’s just to reach Camp 2. After Camp 2 there are no crevasses. It is all vertical,” Muhammad says.Nardi and Ballard last made contact with base camp when they were at an altitude of about 6,300m. After a search of almost two weeks, their bodies were found using a high-power telescopic lens by Spanish climber Alex Txikon, another of the successful 2016 ascent team. The families consented to the release of the images, showing two figures and a tent lying close together on a small patch of snow at the bottom of a gully, surrounded by jagged rocks.What changed in the sport of mountaineering between Hargreaves’ generation and that of her son, Ballard, and Nardi? Everest is still Everest, the highest peak on the planet, its height unchanged,\u0026nbspmore or less,\u0026nbspfrom 1995 to 2019.Rather what has changed is our perception of what is humanly possible, argues Jake Meyer, a mountaineer who at the age of 21 years and four months became the youngest Briton to scale Everest in 2005.\u0026nbspHe says that the cultural allure of Everest comes from the fact that it wasn’t climbed at all, that we know of, until Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay as late as 1953.The number of climbers worldwideAfter that, the landmarks tumbled:\u0026nbspin 1975, the first woman to reach the summit. In 1978, the first successful climb without supplemental oxygen. In 1980, the first winter summit. All the way to Hargreaves’ own achievement in 1995. To elite climbers, Everest now has little left to offer.Like Ballard, Meyer started climbing when he was young, gaining a degree of competency quickly so that his youth alone was basis enough to set new benchmarks and, almost just as importantly, attract the interest of sponsors to make the expeditions possible.\u0026nbspHe describes a never-ending “arms race” among professional mountaineers to keep pushing the boundaries and achieve things that have never been done before, or at least do them in a way that is new –\u0026nbspplaying with the “semantics”, he calls it.Nanga Parbat is the ninth tallest mountain in the world (AFPGetty)Nardi was keenly aware of this competition, and indeed saw it as integral to the sport. Pakistani mountaineer Karim Shah Nizari quoted him in a tribute after his death by saying: “He always said, ‘A climber is someone who climbs new routes’.”In a modern world of social media and round-the-clock connectivity, that urge to open up new frontiers and explore the world’s last wildernesses may be appealing –\u0026nbspbut it is also one “that has always been there” as a driving force for the great historic mountaineers, Meyer says.The difference now is that with Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, hundreds of thousands of fans around the world can follow their favourite climbers’ expeditions in real time.Nardi’s official Facebook page had more than 100,000 followers at the time of his death. The latest updates in the search and rescue operation for the pair were distributed direct to supporters by Stefano Pontecorvo, the Italian ambassador to Pakistan. And Alex Txikon, who has more than 58,000 Facebook followers, shared dramatic photographs and video from the frontline of the search.Alex Honnold, the first solo climber to scale Yosemite’s El Capitan Could this new exposure, and the fact that sponsors pay a lot of attention to mountaineers’ status as modern influencers, be another factor leading them to take greater risks? It’s a question Meyer poses. “Everyone is so aware of what everyone else is doing,” he says. “You have\u0026nbspto be doing bigger, badder, more awesome and, as a result, slightly dangerous things to keep up? I think that if people are treating it like that, then it is a race to the bottom.”If mountaineering and climbing have taken an edgier and more extreme turn in the past 20 years, it isn’t just on new media formats that people are taking notice.\u0026nbspUp until the turn of the century, the sport was considered fodder for low-rent thrillers like Vertical Limit (2000, starring Chris O’Donnell), Cliff Hanger (1993, Sylvester Stallone) and The Eiger Sanction (1975).Something changed around the time of North Face (2008), a critically acclaimed German film about the competition to scale the most dangerous ascent of the Alps. In 2010, 127 Hours about mountaineer Aron Ralston’s fall down a canyon in Utah was runner-up for six Academy Awards.\u0026nbspFinally, this year the suspenseful Free Solo, about Alex Honnold’s successful climb up Yosemite’s El Capitan rock wall without a rope, won the Oscar for best documentary.I don’t go to the mountains because I have a death wish. On the contrary, I go there because that’s where I feel aliveClimbing is now officially cool –\u0026nbspand there are figures to back up the assumption that young people who might once have been inspired to take up skate- or snowboarding are now turning to their local bouldering gym instead.\u0026nbspIn North America, indoor climbing is set to be a billion-dollar industry by the year 2021, according to the Climbing Wall Association, with a record 43 new climbing gyms opening up across the US in 2017.The International Federation of Sport Climbing estimates 25 million people are climbing regularly worldwide, with the number of young competitors in the UK up 50 per cent in the past five years.\u0026nbspAnd in another landmark for the sport unthinkable a generation ago, sport climbing will feature at the summer Olympic Games for the first time in history next year at Tokyo 2020.Created with Sketch.Jake Meyer: youngest Briton to climb Mount Everest Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 Jake Meyer and K2210 Team climbing at 7400m on K2310 Ottalie and Poppy (with Daddy on the front page)410 Camp 4 on K2 - 7650m510 Jake on way to summit610 Climbing though the glacier710 Jake at summit of K2810 Ottalie, Jake and Saskia at Heathrow as Jake arrives home1010 Basecamp panorama K2 on left, Broad Peak on right110 Jake Meyer and K2210 Team climbing at 7400m on K2310 Ottalie and Poppy (with Daddy on the front page)410 Camp 4 on K2 - 7650m510 Jake on way to summit610 Climbing though the glacier710 Jake at summit of K2810 Ottalie, Jake and Saskia at Heathrow as Jake arrives home1010 Basecamp panorama K2 on left, Broad Peak on right“It’s amazing to see how much it’s changed over my career, and we’re talking 20 years since I watched the new millennium dawn over Kilimanjaro,” Meyer says.\u0026nbsp“It’s incredible, fantastic, and it’s an inspiration.”As the sport’s popularity continues to grow and its elite members keep pushing the limits of what’s possible, a point will be reached where mountaineering must pause and take stock of the element that makes it stand apart from other pursuits – the extraordinary risk to life involved.The Italian climber Mori has been the most outspoken in the community since Ballard and Nardi’s deaths, telling The Times newspaper that “if we continue to say they were just unlucky, the risk is someone will die there next year”.And if the trend continues for increasingly young climbers to seek out the road less travelled, in search of new and more impressive feats, the dangers posed are not just from the mountains themselves.\u0026nbspSearchight)Nowhere is this more evident than with Nanga Parbat. In 2013, a major terrorist attack was launched at the mountain’s base camp, itself a remote outcrop 4,200m above sea level that can only be reached on foot.\u0026nbspThe attack, claimed by the Pakistani Taliban, killed one local guide and 10 international climbers, among them an American-Chinese citizen who was believed to have been the prime target for the gunmen in a kidnapping gone wrong.In 2013 at Nanga\u0026nbspParbat\u0026nbspbasecamp a\u0026nbspterrorist attack by Pakistani Taliban claimed the lives of one guide and 1o international climbersAfter the massacre, the gunmen walked for five hours before eating breakfast at a village and dissipating in the small hours of the morning. An AFP report a year on from the attack suggested most, if not all of the perpetrators remained at large.\u0026nbspThe 2013 attack aside, the Gilgit Pakistan region where most of the country’s biggest mountains lie is generally very safe, far from the restive western border with Afghanistan.Trekkers and climbing enthusiasts are starting to return to the region in larger numbers and can expect encouragement from visa officials and a warm welcome from locals, says Karra Hadri, spokesman for the Alpine Club of Pakistan, the sport’s governing body in the country.\u0026nbspHadri, who remembers Ballard from the time when he visited Pakistan as a toddler with his mother and was carried up to K2 base camp on a porter’s back, says last year there were more than 40 major expeditions in Pakistan –\u0026nbspup from just one or two in the years after the 911 attack.The Bigger Red Nose Climb: Charity trek could do with less BallsStray dog follows climbers to become first to reach Himalayan summitWoman becomes first in India to climb ‘men only’ sacred mountainBut he is concerned that growing numbers of young people will come to the country seeking adventure and put their lives in danger. He is calling for a change to the regulations for permits, so that climbers must prove themselves on smaller peaks before attempting any of Pakistan’s five 8,000m-plus summits.“Mountaineering in Pakistan, especially above 8,000m, can be very difficult compared to the rest of the world,” he says. “We still have many mountains that have not been climbed, but youngsters need to know the risks. They should have a lot of skill, a lot of experience, and much budget. And they should go in a group,\u0026nbspnot just one or two alone.”Hadri was closely tracking the progress of the search operation over the past two weeks and was “very sorry to hear” about Nardi and Ballard’s fates. “Tom’s mother was a brave lady,”\u0026nbsphe adds.Ballard is survived by his sister, Kate, who posted a message on Facebook after he went missing thanking people across the world for their “love and thoughts”, and by his girlfriend Stefania Pederiva, who wrote: “I will find you in nature, in the rivers, in the trees, in the mountains, you will always be my most beautiful rock.”Nardi is survived by his wife Daniela and a son Mattia, who is just six months old.\u0026nbspAnd while the sport mourns two of its most promising sons, climbers as a whole are stoic about the risks they take in pursuit of their passion.\u0026nbspMeyer, who last year joined an elite group of only 10 Britons to have scaled K2, says he cannot imagine removing the element of danger from mountaineering,\u0026nbspdespite having, like Nardi, young children at home.“I don’t go to the mountains because I have a death wish. On the contrary, I go there because that’s where I feel alive,” he says.\u0026nbsp“If you remove the element of risk completely, then what you are left with is almost every other sport. Having children didn’t change my desire to want to go, but what it did was it gave me three times the reasons to come home safe.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Then on 25 October a cow fell ill on a farm near the market town of Oswestry in Shropshire.That was the beginning of an epidemic that only ended five months later, with the farming business on its knees and huge areas of the country covered by overlapping five-mile exclusion zones.A total of 442,000 animals had been slaughtered in 2,364 separate outbreaks. Roughly £150m\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspa huge amount at the time –\u0026nbspwas spent on slaughter costs and lost sales farmers received £27m in compensation.It became known as the Great Cattle Plague, and even today it is still the subject of angry discussion in rural circles.As outbreaks popped up around the country, triggered by the combination of the virus’s 14-day incubation period and its extreme infectiousness, the Ministry of Agriculture began imposing five-mile exclusion zones as new infections were identified animals could not be moved in or out.Created with Sketch.Looking back at Britain’s foot-and-mouth outbreaks: 1927-1967 Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Two farmworkers read a notice declaring a footpath closed because of foot-and-mouthA man hoses down a car at Cockernach Farm, Barkway,  Hertfordshire, in an attempt to contain the spread of foot-and-mouth.

Entrances to fields and farms were blocked with disinfected straw members of the public were not allowed to enter them.Humans are usually safe from the disease, but at least one person died from the epidemic some of the worst outbreaks were in Cheshire, Shropshire and Wales.The disease was later reckoned to have been virtually eradicated throughout the European Union after a campaign of vaccination and slaughter. That makes yesterday’s action, in which the EU banned all meat, milk and livestock exports from the UK, understandable.After slaughter, farms had to be scrubbed twice a day with special disinfectant and animals were not allowed on to the land for at least six months. Restricted entry signs stood over the entrance to farmland, bearing warnings including: “You are now entering an infected area.”Horse racing was suspended in Britain after the 1967 outbreak and the official Shrovetide football game in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, was cancelled in 1968 because of continuing restrictions.The outbreak was finally linked to frozen lamb carcasses imported from Argentina.Although Britain did suffer another foot-and-mouth outbreak in 1981 on the Isle of Wight, it was easily isolated. A total of 200 cattle and 369 pigs were destroyed.This article first appeared in The Independent on 22 February 2001We’ll tell you what’s true.

In nine days, Scottish farmers and dealers reach the more important deadline when they can apply for a resumption of overseas exports, because then they will have been free of the disease for 90 days.The auction at Kirkwall, capital of the Orkneys six miles off the mainland, was seen as a trial run for the resumption of trade in other unaffected areas of the United Kingdom.Though no more than two dozen buyers, many of them mainland farmers from Aberdeenshire, made the ferry trip for yesterday’s sale, only auction and government veterinary officials, and representatives from the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, were allowed close contact with the livestock. The buyers, dressed from head-to-toe in hats, clean boiler suits, rubber boots and white plastic raincoats, had to forgo the usual close inspections of the cattle before the sale began.For the Orcadians, the resumption of the weekly cattle mart was more than just a lifeline for business. The social effect of the closure has been devastating. Since the beginning of the crisis, movement on the island has been curtailed because friends and neighbours fearful of spreading the disease kept their distance from other farms.Created with Sketch.How the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak brought Britain to a standstill Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Around 150 dead cows that may have come in contact with foot-and-mouth disease are burnt on a funeral pyre at Great Warley Hall farm in Great Warley, Essex, 27 February 2001.

There’s much still to do to get out of the mess that foot-and-mouth has caused and get the farmers back to a kind of normality.”Steven Metcalf, chairman of Orkney Auction Mart, said: “The social effect of the mart reopening is good news. Early in the outbreak people were frightened to move around and weren’t visiting neighbours or friends. It is a good boost for the morale of agriculture and it is a step nearer to normal trading and normal life.”Although the slaughter of more than 800,000 animals north of the border has so far limited the number of confirmed cases to 187, Maria Limonci, spokeswoman for the NFUS, said Scottish farmers needed to see export bans lifted. “Around 40 per cent of the sheep produced in Scotland usually go out of the country and at present they have nowhere to go,” she said. “More farmers deal in sheep than cattle, and this was only one sale. It’s a huge step in the right direction but it doesn’t mean things are now OK.“We have to hope nothing goes wrong in next few days. Having 90 clear days would give Scotland grounds to put forward the proposal to Europe to allow exports to restart.”In England, continuing restrictions prompted 600 farmers yesterday to demand a public inquiry into the handling of the crisis.David Handley, head of the pressure group Farmers For Action who spearheaded last year’s fuel blockade, led a protest march from Hyde Park to Downing Street to hand in a petition condemning the government’s policy on dealing with the crisis and the failure to implement a vaccination strategy to prevent the spread of the disease.Although the turnout was lower than expected, protesters included farmers from foot-and-mouth hotspots in North Yorkshire, Cumbria and Devon and Cornwall.Up to 3,000 civil servants at the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs held a one-day strike on 20 August 2001 over pay inequalities that followed formation of the new departmentThis article first appeared in The Independent on 21 August 2001We’ll tell you what’s true.

The supermarkets described the CMA’s provisional findings into the merger, as “prohibition in all but name”.Sainsbury\u0027s boss Mike Coupe and Asda chief executive Roger Burnley added: “We have asked the CMA to correct significant errors in its provisional findings.Created with Sketch.

And it deserves to be considered along with the other proposals that you’ve got on the list.”That list included a softer Brexit, a crash-out no-deal Brexit and revoking Article 50 to scrap departure – only the last two of which Mr Hammond ruled out.A new referendum is likely to be among the options if MPs successfully seize control of the Commons agenda to stage “indicative votes” on Wednesday.Carnival of colour as a million people turn Brexit protest into party‘One million’ protesters say: ‘Give Brexit decision back to people’Get ready for a new PM, but it may be too late to save BrexitHowever, it’s best chance of success is if the prime minister’s deal is allowed to pass – subject to it being confirmed in a referendum, with the alternative of remaining in the EU.Ms May has hinted she will not allow the third “meaningful vote”, after the Democratic Unionist party read the last rites on it last Friday.On indicative votes, Mr Hammond said: “One way or another, parliament is going to have the opportunity this week to decide what it is in favour of, and I hope that it will take that opportunity – if it can\u0027t get behind the prime minister\u0027s deal – to say clearly and unambiguously what it can get behind.”Crucially, he said a decision had not yet been taken on whether Tories, including all ministers, would be given a free vote – the only way the Commons’ true preference could be revealed.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Others believe it would fail to make the difference anyway.The guest list for the emergency Chequers summit drew criticism that Ms May was still turning to an “an old boys club”, rather than listening to different voices on Brexit.Hammond urges MPs to ‘get together in a room’ to solve Brexit crisisIt included Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab, David Davis, Damian Green, Iain Duncan Smith, who arrived in an open-top convertible, and Jacob Rees-Mogg – with his young son, in suit and tie, in tow.Downing Street sources said the aim was still to win backing for a third “meaningful vote” on the Brexit deal this week, although Ms May herself has said it could be pulled.A spokesperson for the prime minister\u0026nbspsaid:\u0026nbsp“The PM and a number of government ministers met today at Chequers for lengthy talks with senior colleagues about delivering Brexit.“The meeting discussed a range of issues, including whether there is sufficient support in the Commons to bring back a meaningful vote this week.”Rees-Mogg and his eldest son Peter arrive at Chequers (LNP)Likewise\u0026nbspMr Gove, the environment secretary, said\u0026nbspbefore heading to Chequers: “This is a time for cool heads. It’s not the time to change the captain of the ship.”Many questioned how a caretaker could be imposed, given that – under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act – he or she would need the backing of the entire Tory party to win a no-confidence motion in the Commons.The next twist in the Brexit drama will be a cross-party attempt on Monday to grab the Commons floor on Wednesday, to stage so-called “indicative votes” on all options, to try to find a “winner”.Some ministers had suggested free votes for all Tory MPs, including ministers, to truly open up debate, but Mr Barclay stamped on the process in a BBC interview.He made clear a result would be rejected if it were to “collide with fundamental commitments the government has given in its manifesto” – which included leaving the EU customs union and single market.MPs trying to legislate for such a dramatic shift in UK policy would also be triggering a longer Brexit delay, requiring participation in the European parliament elections.Brexit hypocrisy highlighted by nationwide billboard campaignCarnival of colour as a million people turn Brexit protest into partyGet ready for a new PM, but it may be too late to save BrexitHeseltine says PM’s No 10 speech ‘affront to parliamentary democracy’“The risk of a general election increases, because you potentially have a situation where parliament is instructing the executive to do something that is counter to what it was elected to do,” Mr Barclay said.The threat was angrily dismissed as “nonsense” by Nick Boles, a pro-EU Tory behind the “Common Market 2.0”\u0026nbspplan for a softer Brexit, by retaining single market membership.“The PM cannot call a general election whenever she feels like it,” he tweeted. “She would need the backing of 23 of MPs. No way that most Tory MPs are voting for an early election.”Mr Boles condemned the refusal of European Research Group\u0026nbsphardliners to “compromise with reality”, adding: “They can’t impose hard Brexit because they don’t have the votes. They can’t force an election because they don’t have the votes.”On the Labour side, Keir Starmer strengthened the party’s backing for a Final Say referendum – despite, like Jeremy Corbyn, failing to attend Saturday’s march.“If a deal goes through, if the prime minister’s deal, if she tries it a third time, goes through, it ought to be subject to a lock or a check, which is it’s got to be confirmed by the public,” he said.The prime minister will host a cabinet meeting on Monday morning, ahead of a testing statement to the Commons on the EU’s imposition of a new Article 50 deadline at last week’s summit.A No 10 source was not ruling out a second cabinet gathering on Tuesday, as the crisis gathers pace, saying: “One day at a time.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

We’re here because we want to make today joyous. We want to show the world this movement is celebratory.”It was, perhaps, the perfect articulation of Saturday’s Put It To The People march.More than a million people – if organisers are to be believed – descended on London to request just one thing: to be asked again on Brexit.Created with Sketch.Best pictures from the Put It To The People protest Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Hundreds of thousands of people take part in the protest calling for a referendum on the final Brexit dealYoung marchers sit on the lions at Trafalgar Square in LondonA young marcher speaks into a megaphoneAnti-Brexit campaigners gather in Parliament Square800sqm banner of a David Davis quote1165 Norman Cook aka Fat Boy Slim with the Stop Brexit Sound System,Thousands of people flocked around the Stop Brexit Sound system as it wound it\u0027s way through crowds.

They came bearing balloons and banners, face paints and flags – and, above all else, smiles and good humour.“Have you ever seen a more polite crowd?” asked Silvia Angelotti, an Italian business analyst who has lived in London for 22 years. “Believe me, a march of a million people in Italy – it is not so calm, not so orderly, I think.”Heseltine says PM’s No10 speech ‘affront to parliamentary democracy’The best signs from the Put It To The People march in London‘Million’ protesters gather in London for march against Brexit Celebrities fund transport to Brexit protest for new EU referendumSurrounding Ms Angelotti as she walked down Whitehall – to where speakers included London mayor Sadiq Khan, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and The Independent’s editor Christian Broughton – was a sea of noise and a mile of colour. Or, rather, a mile of blue and yellow.The shades of the EU were everywhere, from teenagers resplendent in streaks of yellow eyeliner to mums (and dads) donning long blue wigs. Think cup final day on Wembley Way, and you have the right sort of vibe. Only here, supporters were asking – given the closeness of the first result, given the misinformation they say was spread, and given the ever-unfolding sense of calamity – for a chance to rethink and replay.“That’s not an unreasonable request,” said Sorcha Kirker, an archaeology student at University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI) in Scotland. “Theresa May has given parliament two votes on this – and she wants another – so why are the people being denied a second say? That isn’t democracy.”Ms Kirker herself\u0026nbspwas speaking after a 28-hour journey to be in London. The 27-year-old lives on Orkney. To get to the capital, she had to leave home at 4.30am on Friday, take a boat to the mainland town of Thurso, travel by train to Inverness, and then, at 9pm, catch the 12-hour overnight bus to London.If you’re reading this anytime between 8.30pm on Saturday and 10pm\u0026nbspon Sunday, she’s still on her way back home again.“Am I tired?” she asked. “Well, I got about two hours sleep on the bus so that’s something. You come to something like this and adrenalin takes over anyway. There are 24 of us here from the UHI, and we’ve all come because this is too important to miss because of something like geography. It’s our future. Brexit is a disaster. It takes away so many opportunities from young people that our parents had – that can’t be fair.”She and her group were carrying massive EU flags – but placards were largely the order of the day.Indeed, if national referendums could be initiated by the sheer originality of signs being waved alone, it’s probably fair to say, the Electoral Commission would, right now, already be organising a Final Say vote.They varied from pop cultural references (“Frankie Says Remain”) to the poetic (“Let’s stay among the stars”), to the somewhat crude: “If only Nigel’s dad had been so keen to pull out,” read one.Bright yellow stickers featuring the slogan “Bollocks to Brexit”, meanwhile, were everywhere. Including, by the end of the day, entirely covering the Cabinet Office front door in Whitehall. After one person\u0026nbspstuck their sticker there, hundreds more protestors followed suit – turning this historic door yellow.“If Theresa May really thinks she knows how we feel, she might want to look at her own Cabinet Office entrance next time she passes,” said Rob Hollinger, as he added another circular sticker to the mass. “She says she speaks for the British public. She doesn’t speak for anyone here.”It was a sentiment shared by 14-year-old Jacob Henry. “I got off my Xbox to be here,” his placard told the world.The youngster, from Milton Keynes,\u0026nbspwas there with his parents and 16-year-old sister Alice.“I don’t know if any of this will make a difference,” his dad Leroi, a 49-year-old academic, said. “But maybe the momentum is starting to move in favour of a second vote. I feel the country is starting to shift but I don’t know if it will be too late. But I just think, as a family, we felt we had to try to do something. We had to be able to say in future we gave this a shot.”Pursued by a toilet, Farage’s foot soldiers slog 270 miles for BrexitIt was a hopefulness and positivity that infused the spirit of the whole procession.With a petition asking for Article 50 to be revoked topping 4\u0026nbspmillion signatures even as the march started, many people felt, now more than ever, the tide of opportunity was turning towards them.Certainly Alice Joinel hoped so. She was the mother of possibly the youngest march participant of all. Carried in a papoose\u0026nbspwas nine-week-old Anouk.“How’s she found it?” said Alice, who works in publishing in London. “She’s actually slept through most of it. Woke up for the odd feed, then gone back to sleep again. She seems pretty unfazed.”The 32-year-old came because she felt it was important for the little one’s future.\u0026nbsp“Leaving the European Union is going to make her future so much harder and with so fewer opportunities,” she said. “And as a parent, that’s unbearable. So we had to come. Her dad – my partner –\u0026nbspis actually French, so you might say she wouldn’t even be here without the EU – that’s how important it is to us.”As the day came to a close – anti-Brexit chants still filling the twilight – a band could be heard finishing off in Trafalgar Square: Brass Against Brexit.How did march go for the group?“Brilliant,” said James again. “A few of us in this band play\u0026nbspGlastonbury every year and we’ve played the Rio carnival and, of course, it’s impossible to compare. But this was special: just people getting into it, waving their flags, giving us thumbs up. It felt like we were a part of\u0026nbsphistory.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

This includes London and\u0026nbspcities and towns with a relatively high student population such as\u0026nbspWarwick, Canterbury, Oxford and Cambridge.As the petition attracted attention, conspiracy theories arose suggesting that a small proportion of signatures from addresses listed as overseas meant that Remain campaigners had been adding fake signatures.Others suggested that the technical problems on the parliament website were a plot to prevent further signatures.But in a\u0026nbsptweet, the petitions committee clarified that 96 per cent of the signatures are listed as from the UK.Woman who started Revoke Article 50 petition receives death threatsRevoke Article 50 petition becomes most popular in website\u0027s historyNigel Farage accused of hypocrisy after anti-Brexit petition claimsWoman who started Revoke Article 50 petition receives death threatsThey added that overseas signatures were valid, since “anyone who is a UK resident or a British citizen can sign a petition.

A People’s Vote may not happen – so vote now.”Ms May ruled out halting the Brexit process when in Brussels on Thursday, telling reporters: “I do not believe that we should be revoking Article 50.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

It’s not going to be two white guys’Click to followThe IndependentJoe Biden might be about to do something unusual. So unusual, in fact, nobody can remember it ever happening before.Reports suggest the former vice president may announce he is entering the 2020 presidential contest with a named running mate beside him. The reports suggest he would like that person to be Stacey Abrams, a progressive 45-year-old rising star within the Democratic Party, who last year narrowly failed in her bid to win the governor’s race in Georgia.\u0026nbspLast month, in an event that underscored the shift in the party’s direction, she was asked to deliver the Democratic response to Donald Trump’s State of the Union address.Biden, 76, who for decades served as a senator from Delaware, has told supporters he is “95 per cent” committed to running. Even before any declaration, he heads the polls of potential Democratic candidates.One thing that may help him seal the deal with himself, is if he gets an agreement from Abrams to be his running mate, more than a year before he would hope to secure the presidential nomination.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Who could be running against Trump in 2020?

Abrams also had breakfast with another Democrat running for president, New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand, who tweeted a picture of the pair.On the face of it, Biden and Abrams would be an impressive ticket, as well\u0026nbspas a study in contrasts. He would bring experience of governance to the table, as well as an inside knowledge of the politics of Washington DC. He would also seek to appeal to white working class voters, some of whom voted for Donald Trump in 2016.\u0026nbspIn turn, Abrams would bring energy, dynamism and be a spearhead for the progressive ideas that are now ascendant within the party. She is a woman, and a person of colour. She is from the south, he from the north.“I think it would be a very attractive ticket,” Christina Greer, professor of politics at Fordham University in New York, told The Independent. “Some Democrats might prefer she be on the top half of the ticket, but I think even though she is a brilliant politician, it would be hard for her to go from the loss in Georgia to run for the presidency –\u0026nbspeven though we have white men doing that.”\u0026nbspBiden already has some standing among African Americans, especially older ones, as a result of his eight years of partnership with Barack Obama, Greer said. At the same time, during a career that included 36 years representing Delaware in the Senate, there are several incidents in his record that count against.\u0026nbspHis apparent bullying of Anita Hill, a witness during the 1991 Clarence Thomas confirmation hearing, who accused the man about to be made a Supreme Court of sexual harassment, was one. Another was his championing of a 1994 crime bill –\u0026nbsp“the toughest, most comprehensive crime bill in our history” according to him –\u0026nbspwhich disproportionately impacted minority offenders.Abrams has avoided commenting on the prospect of joining Biden, as he embarks on what would be his third run for the Oval Office. She told the AP she had not yet decided whether to challenge Republican David Perdue for the Senate seat from Georgia\u0026nbspthat will be contested in 2020.“There certainly is a connectivity between that and other 2020 opportunities,” she said. “My objective is to make sure I want to do that job. I’d not thought about the Senate before. The Senate is a different way to tackle the issues I see.”After Democrats last autumn regained control of the House of Representatives on the backs of women voters, and with four high profile women –\u0026nbspElizabeth Warren, Gillibrand, Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspalready running, Biden is not the only person who sees the value of having a woman VP.The New York Times\u0026nbspsaid New Jersey senator Cory Booker had claimed a woman would be on the Democratic ticket, whether alongside him or someone else.\u0026nbsp“No matter what –\u0026nbspI’m looking you in the eye and saying this –\u0026nbspthere will be a woman on the ticket,” he said. “I don’t know if it’s in the vice president’s position or the president’s position, but if I have my way, there will be a woman on the ticket.”Texas congressman\u0026nbspBeto\u0026nbspO’Rourke made a similar undertaking to an audience in Iowa.Joe Biden should run as VP with Stacey Abrams leading the ticketBernie and Biden tied for frontrunner in new pollJoe Biden is not a meme — this is the truth about his voting recordTrump lashes out at rivals in wild weekend of Twitter rantsTrump mocks Joe Biden for gaffe teasing 2020 presidential runJoe Biden\u0027s verbal slip fuels rumours of 2020 campaign against Trump“It would be very difficult not to select a woman, with so many extraordinary women who are running right now,” he said. “First, I would have to win, and this is as open as it’s ever been.”\u0026nbspMike Fraioli, a veteran Democratic strategist and fundraiser based in Washington DC, said if Biden declared with a named running mate he could think of no precedent.\u0026nbspThe only similar situation came in April 2016 –\u0026nbsplate in the Republican primary contest –\u0026nbspwhen senator Ted Cruz named businesswoman Carly Fiorina as his theoretical VP pick. He did so in a last ditch effort to inject energy into his flailing campaign. A week later, he pulled out, ceding the field to Trump.Fraioli said the strategising of Biden, Booker and O’Rourke marked an important inflection point.“It shows the country has changed,” he said. “For the Democrats, a woman or a person of colour will fill one of the top two spots. It’s not going to be two white guys. That’s not happening.

(AP PhotoGemunu Amarasinghe)Mr Thaksin was ousted as prime minister in a 2006 military coup and now lives in exile abroad to avoid a prison term, but parties allied with him have won every election since 2001.His sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, who led the Pheu Thai government that was ousted in 2014, also fled the country after what supporters said was a politically motivated prosecution.Thai voters prepare for return of democracy despite ‘rigged’ systemKatie Price fails to attend court and heads off to Thailand insteadCourt bans party that nominated princess for prime ministerMr Prayuth, the blunt-speaking army chief who led the 2014 coup, was hoping to extend his hold on power after engineering a new political system that aims to stifle the influence of big political parties not aligned with the military.About 51 million Thais were eligible to vote. Leaders of political parties opposed to military rule urged a high turnout as the only way to derail Mr Prayuth’s plans, but many voters stayed at home.Thailand’s powerful king, Maha Vajiralongkorn, issued a statement on the eve of the election saying the role of leaders is to stop “bad people” from gaining power and causing chaos. It was also broadcast on Thai television stations minutes before voting started.Invoking a speech by his father, the previous Thai king who died in 2016 after reigning for seven decades, King Vajiralongkorn said not all citizens can be transformed into good people, so leaders must be given support in ruling to create a peaceful nation.He urged government officials, soldiers and civil servants to look after national security.It was the monarch’s second notable intervention in politics recently. Last month, he demanded his sister Princess Ubolratana Mahidol withdraw as a prime ministerial candidate for a small Thaksin-allied party within 24 hours of her announcement.When it seized power in 2014, the military said it was to end political unrest that had periodically turned violent and disrupted daily life and the economy.The claim has been a selling point for Mr\u0026nbspPrayuth, who according to critics has overseen a period of growing inequality and economic hardship in Thailand.After the coup, political party gatherings were banned and pro-democracy activists and other dissenters were regularly arrested, interrogated and imprisoned. Just days before Sunday’s election, Pheu Thai said the houses of party officials and its campaign canvassers in some provinces had been searched by military personnel in an act of intimidation.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Thai voters went to the polls on Sunday in a long-delayed election following a 2014 coup, a race that pits a military junta chief seeking to retain power against a democratic front led by the populist party he ousted.Turnout was expected to be high among the 51.4 million Thais eligible to vote for the 500-seat House of Representatives, which will choose the next government along with a Senate that is appointed entirely by the ruling junta.Thailand has been under direct military rule since then-army chief Prayuth Chan-ocha overthrew an elected government linked to exiled former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who himself was thrown out by the army in 2006.Critics have said a new, junta-written electoral system gives a built-in advantage to pro-military parties and appears designed to prevent the Thaksin-linked Pheu Thai Party from returning to power.Pro-Thaksin parties have won every election since 2001, but the past 15 years have seen crippling street protests that destabilised the government and hamstrung business.Created with Sketch.

I want to see love and unity. Everybody has one vote, one voice. Everybody wants democracy.The anti-Thaksin Yellow Shirts, mostly middle class and urban royalists who accuse his parties of corruption, have repeatedly taken to the streets, prompting the military to launch two coups in a decade.Thaksin\u0027s supporters, known as the Red Shirts, also occupied much of Bangkok\u0027s main business and shopping districts for months in 2010 after a court dissolved a pro-Thaksin government, again paralysing commerce until a crackdown that left at least 90 people dead and saw landmark buildings burned.While the election results are due to be announced within a few hours of polls closing at 5pm (10am\u0026nbspGMT), the make-up of the next government may not be clear for weeks, since no one party is likely to have enough seats for an outright win.The country\u0027s king made an unexpected and cryptic statement hours before the vote, recalling a comment made by his late father in 1969 on the need to put good people in power and to prevent bad people from ... creating chaos.Although he did not refer to any of the sides in the race, there was speculation on social media that it was a coded reference to the country\u0027s political factions - broadly the middle class and urban establishment, who identify with the monarchy and the military, and their pro-Thaksin opponents.The king\u0027s intervention was a departure from the approach of his father, who in his latter years usually kept a distance between the monarchy and politics.It followed a startling turn of events last month when a party allied to Pheu Thai nominated Princess Ubolratana, the king\u0027s sister, as its prime ministerial candidate. It was then disqualified by a court after the king said it was inappropriate for members of the royal family to enter politics.Thai voters prepare for return of democracy despite \u0027rigged\u0027 systemKatie Price fails to attend court and heads off to Thailand insteadAustralians welcome refugee footballer after Thailand sets him freeWhat happened last month ... and then the announcement last night shows that, in contrast to the former reign, that the monarchy is actively interested in monitoring what\u0027s going on and it feels that it has some stake in the future direction of the country, said David Streckfuss, a Thailand-based independent scholar.The junta-written electoral rules ensure the military will continue to have a say in the next government, even if Mr\u0026nbspChan-ocha does not stay on as prime minister.Pro-Thaksin parties are expected to win the largest number of seats in the House of Representatives. However, the new system appears designed to prevent it from forming a government because it includes the junta-appointed 250-seat Senate in the vote for prime minister.The provision means Mr\u0026nbspChan-ocha\u0027s Palang Pracharat Party and allies have to win only 126 seats in the House, while Pheu Thai and its potential democratic front partners would need 376.Among the potential Pheu Thai allies is the new Future Forward Party, led by 40-year-old billionaire Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, whose criticism of the junta has been scathing and faces charges under the Computer Crimes Act for a critical Facebook speech. Prosecutors have said they will decide whether to put him on trial days after the election.Created with Sketch.

Old parties may end up fighting again, so I think the new party is better, said Somkiat Rattanawibun, a 42-year-old business owner told Reuters after casting his vote in Bangkok.Two officially non-aligned parties could be decisive in whether pro-military or democratic front factions make up the next government.Former Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, leader of the anti-Thaksin Democrats, has portrayed himself as a third way between the dictatorship of keeping Mr\u0026nbspChan-ocha and a return to the corruption on Thaksinism, but he would likely have to side with one or the other to form a government.The Bhumjaithai Party of Anutin Charnvirakul placed third in the last election of 2011 and has grabbed attention for populist campaign promises such as legalisation of recreational marijuana and a four-day work week. It\u0027s unclear which side he would choose.Regardless of the make-up of the government, the election result is likely to yield a shaky coalition that will do little to soothe Thailand\u0027s deep political ides and may not be able to accomplish much, said Paul Chambers, lecturer in political science at Naresuan University in northern Thailand.There could be a stable government coming out of it in the short term, he said. But that kind of coalition is not going to last that long.We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

Its a fantastic opportunity to build understanding across communities and educate ourselves about our erse communities. Lets build bridges not walls.The Muslim Welfare House in London released a statement after the incident, saying it the attacker had shouted and hurled verbal abuse to the utter shock and disgust of all present.Toufik Kacimi, CEO of the organisation, said: We condemn in the strongest terms this outrageous act which has left everyone shocked.This disgraceful act by this inidual is a sign of the hatred and Islamophobia that sadly abound in our community.We will not let this deter us from cooperating with all groups in building a more cohesive society.Other Labour figures who have been also hit with an egg include ex-Labour boss Ed Miliband, as well as John Prescott, who went on to punch the protester.Last week Mr Corbyn confirmed that his party would get behind a second Brexit referendum, much to the fury of his pro-Brexit voters.But MPs in Leave backing seats warned it could cost the party their seats - and the next election."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/TM-Graphics-Cash-for-Regions.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may brexit labour voters opinion","story":"With great passion, The Sun argued that - while the economy had worked well for some places – wealth was not always spread fairly across the country.I agreed with this analysis.

Leavers are doing the same to avoid delaying or cancelling Brexit.In the crossfire stands Theresa May who — for all her faults — insists she is determined to do right by the people, by our democracy and by the .million majority who voted Leave.The PM has made many errors. But, against mountainous odds and a Remainer-dominated Parliament and civil service, she has at least followed Brexit’s inescapable logic: that it must mean exiting the EU’s main institutions, the single market and customs union.The Sun will not pretend her deal is great. It is just the only one available. It gets Brexit done, as promised. And it does have merit for Leavers, whatever Tory backbenchers protest. Defeat it again and the Government could fall in a no-confidence vote.We do not believe the Tories will win an electionpanicked Remain MPs have halted Brexit, especially with Mrs May in office. They will be punished by Leavers they have failed and Remainers who have already jumped ship.Corbyn is one of Britain’s most reviled politicians, in a crowded field. But his party — cheerleaders for the same debunked ideology now starving Venezuelans to death — could win by default Tory voters don’t turn out.The consequences for our jobs and economy would make a No Deal Brexit look like a picnic. Tory MPs must wake up. This is not a parlour game. An election has never looked closer. Handing power to ­Corbyn will define your careers.But Labour moderates should wake up too before they oppose the deal again.They’ll be left campaigning to put an anti-Semitic Marxist extremist and terrorist sympathiser in Downing Street.CONSIDER the rancid dishonesty of ­Labour’s Brexit position.They claim to be aghast at our national crisis. Except they could resolve it instantly by backing Mrs May’s deal.Why not  They agree with almost every word, except that it does not lock us into a permanent, restrictive customs union. Oh, and it’s a “Tory Brexit”, that meaningless phrase designed to maintain the pretence that there’s dference between their positions.Labour’s sole motive is political gain. The same reason they farcically back leaving and remaining. And why they are for and against a second referendum.They don’t want this crisis to end, nor an orderly Brexit. They relish chaos. It is their best chance to seize power.Only a mug would believe Corbyn, McDonnell or the snakelike Keir Starmer have Britain’s interests at heart.Their priority is not our country.

But this country won’t know where things are going to end up until April .On Wednesday, No Deal ­suddenly seemed a likely option again. The EU were saying they would only grant Theresa May’s request for an extensionher Brexit deal passed before March , something that is highly unlikely.I am told that at the No Deal ministers’ meeting on Wednesday night, “the mood was totally dferent to previous meetings, as people thought it might actually happen”.It was agreed that a small group of ministers — Theresa May’s effective deputy David Lidington, Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Health ­Secretary Matt Hancock, Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley — would meet again on Friday morning to take the preparations to the next stage.But on Friday morning that meeting was cancelled.Why  Because after the EU agreed to halt the UK’s ­departure until at least April , No Deal is once again highly unlikely.This delay meansMay’s deal fails again, ­Parliament will have enough time to step in and take ­control of the process.The three options now are: May’s deal passes, a softer Brexit is agreed in the next few weeks, or there is a much longer extension to allow a General Election to be held, which could mean no Brexit at all. At the moment, the Brexit deal isn’t going to pass.Getting it through was always going to be hard, but the errors Mrs May made this week have made it even more ­dficult.As one Secretary of State puts it: “She would have been much better off spending three days in bed.”Her speech on Wednesday night, criticising MPs, was also ill-judged, given that they are who she needs to win over.It was particularly mistaken given May had turned down an invitation to address her own MPs that evening.One normally mild-mannered backbencher tells me: “It was offensive to us. You decline to come and talk to us — then insult us.”The Government’s domino strategy for winning the vote required getting the DUP to come on board.There is only one way to change this dynamic — for May to offer to goher deal passes.This would instantly change the debate. In the past few days, one Tory MP who wants No Deal and another who wants a second referendum told me they would vote for a ­withdrawal agreementthey had a guarantee she would go.“An increasing number of people are saying their vote is contingent on her going,” says a senior backbencher.As one Cabinet minister admits: “Even that may not be enough.” But without it, there’s no chance of the deal passing next week.James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator.AMID all this uncertainty, one thing is looking increasingly clear: Britain will have a new Prime Minister soon.Opinion has turned against Theresa May ­following her ill-judged speech on Wednesday.“She has managed to offend everybody,” one previously loyal minister tells me.And one Secretary of State fumes: “She’s alienated Parliament, the Cabinet and the EU.”There are no shortage of leadership candidates sounding people out.Jeremy Hunt, the Foreign Secretary, has the support of more ­Cabinet ministers than anybody . He is seen as a safe pair of hands and as having the ­emotional intelligence to hold the party together.Sajid Javid was the frontrunner. But as always happens in Tory leadership contests, that has put a target on his back. He has had a dficult few weeks and is losing support.Cabinet ministers are convinced that Andrea Leadsom is running. They point out how, at Cabinet this week, she spoke in a string of highly quotable lines about Leave voters being let down.Liz Truss, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, is also expected to go for it. But many think she is more interested in framing the debate and pushing her pro-growth agenda than anything .Michael Gove is being urged to stand, with Mel Stride, the well-connected Treasury minister, at the forefront of efforts to persuade Gove to run.Matt Hancock is another being encouraged to enter the race. He is the new toast of the party donor classes, who think he offers competence. One MP describes him as “a better version of Jeremy Hunt”.On the backbenches, Dominic Raab and Boris Johnson are competing to be the Brexiteer ­candidate. Raab’s campaign is better organised – he has ten MPs gathering support for him.But Johnson has the proven electoral record and greater experience. One thing to remember, though. Tory leadership races are like the Grand National: Messy, unpredictable and the favourite rarely wins. THE absurdity of Labour’s Brexit position is that it accepts the withdrawal agreement.What it takes issue with is the political ­declaration, which isn’t legally binding.Voting through the Brexit deal would not stop Labour from getting to any of the softer Brexit ­outcomes that it has been proposing in recent months.You could negotiate almost any kind of Brexit from the withdrawal agreement.But Jeremy Corbyn doesn’t want to vote for it because he doesn’t want to vote for a “Tory Brexit”.It would bring the withdrawal agreement, ­without the political declaration, to the Commons and dare Labour to vote it down.If Labour blinked and the withdrawal agreement passed, we would then be out of the EU and into the transition ­period.The EU would also be satisfied and consider us to have ratied the agreement.If Labour voted down the withdrawal agreement, then it would be clear what their motives were.IF there is no chance of the Brexit deal ­passing unless Theresa May promises to go, who can tell her that This is what ministers have been discussing with each other in the past  hours. They think her No aides won’t, so somebody  needs to.The obvious candidate is Sir ­Graham Brady, chairman of the  Committee of Tory MPs. Brady is discreet and respected. But it is now time for him to put on his grey suit and carry this message to May.May promising to go so long as the withdrawal ­agreement is passed would show that it really isn’t all about her.And history would view her in a much more sympathetic light.ONE reason why the UK might end up leaving the EU by April  is the Labour leadership don’t want the European elections to take place any more than ­Theresa May does.They know parties in favour of a second referendum would attack Labour for its equivocation on this point.Jeremy Corbyn, who walked out of a meeting this week because Chuka Umunna had been invited, wouldn’t want to give the breakaway ­Independent Group such a perfect launch pad.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The wind was like a tornado. I was afraid. Ive never experienced anything so scary.Water rushed into the cruise liner when the ships engines stopped.The crew were later able to restart one engine and the ship was at anchor about . miles from land.There were , passengers and crew on board the £m ship.Passengers were hoisted one-by-one from the deck of the vessel and airlted to a village just north of the town of Molde on Norways west coast.At :pm local time, a cargo ship trying to reach the liner through the storm also experienced engine problems and sent a distress signal.A rescue helicopter was quickly sent to airlt the nine-strong crew of the Hagland Captain to safety.Have you been affected  If so, please contact thomas.burrows@thesun or on   Alexus Sheppard, from Calornia, tweeted a video showing the ship rocking dramatically, with debris falling from the ceiling and furniture sliding across the floor as passengers sat waiting to be rescued.She told The Sun Online: The ship went dark for a few minutes and rolled dramatically.Its still rocking and rolling. Its still a very slow process and most people are waiting [to be evacuated].Were about two miles from land but much closer to the rocks.She said shed been on board the cruise ship for nine days.John Curry, an American passenger on board the ship, said: We were having lunch when it began to shake.Window panes were broken and water came in. It was just chaos. The trip on the helicopter, I would rather forget. It was not fun.Another passenger said: A wave smashed a door open right behind us and we were submerged under water.We thought that was it and my knee has been damaged. Ive been stretched off which was just as scary.Derek and Esther Browne, from Hampshire, said the whole boat was swaying, it was very rough before they were airlted to safety.Mr Browne told BBC Radio  Lives Stephen Nolan: We had a few people on stretchers, several with cuts, two with broken limbs, but fortunately we were alright. We were airlted onto the helicopter which was quite a frightening experience.He added: Id never been in a helicopter before, there were a lot of high winds, hovering overhead and the winchman came down and we were then collected up and so I shut my eyes as we arrived into the helicopter and there were  of us for about a -minute ride.Hans Vik, chief of the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre for southern Norway Police, told TV: It was very nearly a disaster.

The UK itself has been more successful in recent years in growing its trade with markets outside the EU than with those that are inside the single market and customs union.It baffles me that so many British politicians have so little faith in Britain that they think we would be sunkwe had to stand on our own two feet.The mistakes that have brought us to this point are well known: agreeing to decide the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement before settling the future trading relationship with the EU agreeing to a “backstop” to prevent a “hard border” in Ireland allowing the militant Remainers in Parliament to damage Britain’s negotiating position by taking “No Deal” off the table and allowing our exit date to be deferred.If only we had accepted the EU’s offer two years ago to have a big Canada-Plus free trade agreement, we could have locked in certainty for business and spent the last two years trying to improve upon it!The question now is what’s the best way to achieve the proper Brexit that the British people voted for nearly three years ago I understand why so many of my Tory and DUP friends have voted against the PM’s deal. I told her in November the “backstop” made it impossible for anyone who wanted to leave the EU to vote for it: it could lock the UK into the EU customs union for ever.That is why I voted against it the first time. It’s also why I tabled the “Brady amendment” — which was voted through at the end of January, telling the PM to go back and ensure the “backstop” couldn’t become a permanent trap.When the Government’s lawyer Geoffrey Cox said the changes agreed would allow a way out in most circumstanceswe were faced with a tough choice.To take a risk and support the deal or keep voting against, hoping something better would emerge. It was defeated a second time, with a big majority against.Those of us who really want Brexit to happen and British politics to be able to get on with other things are now faced with taking a massive political judgment.By voting for the pretty threadbare deal Theresa May brought back from Brussels, we can ensure some sort of Brexit and then a new negotiating team that believes in what it’s doing can work to get something worthwhile out of the future relationship after we have left.If we don’t vote the deal through this week, it no longer looks like Theresa’s promise that “no deal is better than a bad deal” will be honoured. Two years ago,  per cent of you voted for a political party — whether Tory or Labour — that promised to implement the referendum decision.Two years on Labour is angling for a second referendumand lots of other MPs are pushing for a Brexit that amounts to staying in. Some want endless delay, a few are at least honest enough to admit they really want to ignore the decision of . million voters altogether.Meanwhile, the EU is creaking. Just as the EU is set for crisis, this country is poised for success.British businesses are sitting on big cash balances but are crying out for the certainty that will allow them to invest.If we deliver on our promise to leave in the coming weeks, Britain will prosper. If we get stuck in the departure lounge, our country will suffer.For heaven’s sake, let’s settle this now.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If the deal fails again it seems Philip Hammond and David Lidington will be knocking on the PM’s door to tell her the time has come to make an exit.But in the midst of this paralysing crisis even that is not an easy option.There is no clear route to appointing a successor in the short term. And with the party at loggerheads even a swt transition to a caretaker PM is perilous.After this week’s turmoil we face being stuck for some time with a lame-duck Prime Minister, whoever it may be.Britain needs a miracle to avoid it.The crushing of IS in Syria is a massive achievement.Defeating this self-proclaimed caliphate is the beginning of the end for a reign of terror which has claimed , lives and spawned , attacks over four bloody years.The courage and sacrice of the ­Western-backed forces that fought so fiercely to drive the jihadis from their final stronghold has been rightly praised by Theresa May.But she was also wise to caution that the ousting of the religious fanatics from their territory will not end the risk they pose.Many hardened fighters will go to ground in the area so they can continue to wage guerrilla warfare.Other dangerous extremists will no doubt flee to Europe and even to this country, still fuelled by their murderous hatred of the West.Like the mythical hydra with its many heads, cutting off one risks generating others in its place.Our security forces must now be on alert for a fresh wave of Islamic-inspired terror closer to home.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But she has lost the backing of much of the country and now her party.Her deal has only one, slim chance of achieving a majority in the ­Commons.That isshe pledges ­immediately to resign and set in motion the election of her successor as Tory leader and PM after we leave the EU on the new deadline of May .If she does so, Tory Brexiteers and the DUP must back the deal. Becauseit fails again this week we are heading for a much softer Brexit — or none.That will be a catastrophe for the country, the Tories and Parliament.Mrs May deserves huge credit. She is a dedicated public servant with an unshakeable sense of duty, who in  took on the greatest challenge of any PM since World War Two.She has stuck to it through thick and thin, showing remarkable resilience in the face of repeated humiliations, rebellions and a relentless barrage of vitriol from almost all-comers.Unlike so many she has determinedly respected the will of the Leave majority. The very concept of democracy has been degraded in many other countries, yet she has ­resolutely defended ours.She must now take the next principled step — and show she is not just another craven politician determined to cling to power.Mrs May has insisted all along that not only must the referendum result be honoured, as promised by both main parties, but that it must mean leaving the EU’s central institutions — the Single Market and Customs Union — as well as the remit of its courts.She has maintained that the power to trade independently outside the Brussels club must be secured. It is the economic prize of Brexit.This was exactly the right course. Those arguing to soften those red lines are almost entirely those who regret Brexit and wish to neutralise it.Sadly, many mistakes were made. A Remainer, Mrs May appointed a weak Cabinet of Remainer friends, most of whom considered Brexit a disaster to be managed rather than a historic opportunity to exploit.The Brexiteers she did appoint — David Davis, Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and later Dominic Raab — were sidelined and ignored.The Government triggered Article  far too early without a plan for our departure. In hindsight it should have made rapid plans for No Deal from the outset, giving us a position of strength from which to negotiate.Mrs May said “No Deal is better than a bad deal”, only to have Treasury bureaucrats refuse to prepare for it.After her disastrous  election her sole focus became achieving Brexit while holding her party’s warring factions together and fending off Remainer rebellions in Parliament.While our economy, employment and wages have grown strongly there has been policy paralysis, with mediocre ministers left blundering along. We need not list here all Britain’s problems. They are many, and obvious.Her Brexit deal is not the worst imaginable. Those are the so-called Norway Plus option — which is not Brexit in any way — or the permanent Customs Union, brainlessly championed by Corbyn, which destroys the economic case for leaving.No one should pretend it is a great deal either. But it ensures that Brexit finally happens, ending the fractious Leave Remain debate and refocusing Britain on the far more crucial negotiations for a future trade agreement.The DUP and the Tory ERG will have to hold their noses and vote for it. And to win that unlikely support, Mrs May must set in place a truly dignied exit, culminating in a new leader.Theresa May will then go down in history as a great public servant, as the leader who delivered Brexit and proved to the British people that our democracy is robust and far, far more important than any inidual.PM, it’s time to move on.MAKE no mistake: the kne crime epidemic is now a national crisis.It’s tempting to think that it’s just gangs in London and our other biggest cities that are the cause of rising violence.But shocking figures demonstrating how far and wide this disease has spread must be a wake-up call for the police, the Home Office and the Cabinet.That we’ve now got young gangsters playing sick games in which points are awarded for stabbing certain parts of the body can lead to only one conclusion: we’ve completely lost control of our streets.Throughout the spike in violent crime, the Government has responded with a tin ear. They’ve allowed the Labour Party — under Jeremy Corbyn of all people — to become the party of law and order.At the last election, the Tories got a battering about police cuts and it was one signicant reason they lost their majority.With the very real possibility of another ballot coming soon, the Home Secretary Sajid Javid and the Chancellor must get a grip.It’s vital that they give police chiefs the cash and the powers that they need.OUR prisons are failing.The latest revelation, that drugs and phones are being smuggled in via the inside of dead rats, is just a symptom of the mess they’re in.Prisons should keep people who deserve it locked up and get them ready for a le on the straight and narrow.The Justice Secretary is considering scrapping short sentences because prisons are doing such a bad job of rehabbing people, leaving offenders on our streets who should be behind bars.And eventhey do end up inside, with violence on the up, it’s no surprise lags form rival gangs. That turns prisons into training centres for hardened criminals.Where is the Government  Promises of reform and a crackdown on violence seem to have produced precious little.The consequences of a busted prison system will be felt on our streets.SO-CALLED Islamic State might not have any physical presence left, but we can’t be complacent about the murderous ideology they spread across the world.Their promise of a reign of terror across the continent sends a chill down the spine.We must find and prosecute those IS fighters who have ed to the UK — believed to be as many as  — and spare us the inevitable leftie hand-wringing.There have already been far too many innocent victims of IS’s twisted dogma.We must do everything possible to ensure there are no more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That’s the last thing we want”.Meanwhile, a small handful of senior ministers who remain loyal to the PM have urged her to declare she will take the UK out of the EU on April  with no agreementthe third and final meaningful vote fails this week.The bid is being lead by Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson and party chairman Brandon Lewis.One senior minister told The Sun: “Pivoting to No Deal is the only way to keep the party on side.“If she agrees to do a customs union, she will lose half her MPs and be in Ramsay Macdonald territory.”Brexiteer backbenchers were bitterly ided on what to do yesterday, and fighting broke out on their WhatsApp group.Former London mayor candidate Zac Goldmsith lashed out at diehard Tory MP Anne Marie Morris: “When you are asked, as you will be, why you opted for years of paralysis, ision and the inevitable death of Brexit when you COULD have stopped the madness, what will you say “Yes, but my principles  ”Ms Morris replied: “My conscience is clear. I will vote against her deal and any extension”.Another Brexiteer MP switcher, Nadine Dorries, then chimed in to back Mr Goldsmith: “God, I want to cut my wrists. How many ways to leave the EU your way  Just one. The one Parliament votes for next week in the indicative votes.”Jacob Rees-Mogg arrived at Chequers with his  year-old son Peter.Boris wasn’t wearing a seatbelt as he turned down the mansion’s driveway, behind the wheel of his family people carrier.No remained tight-lipped about the Chequers meeting.A Downing Street spokesman would only say: “The PM and a number of Government Ministers met today at Chequers for y talks with senior colleagues about delivering Brexit.“The meeting discussed a range of issues, including whether there is sufficient support in the Commons to bring back a Meaningful Vote this week.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Now reports have emerged that Mrs May could launch that process herself, making this week another momentous one for Brexit. But she faces fresh calls, including from The Sun newspaper, to offer up her resignation in exchange for the deal going through. Here are  fast facts you need to know this Monday morning. . Theresa May will hold a do-or-die Cabinet meeting this morning  Theresa May will convene her Cabinet from am after a crunch Chequers summit yesterday that saw Brexiteers sit across the table from the government. Boris Johnson arrived dishevelled and without a seatbelt, Jacob Rees-Mogg arrived with his son and Iain Duncan Smith arrived in an open-top classic sports car at the country residence. According to reports, some of the more extreme Brexiteers present demanded she quit in the y talks. But she gave no ground. A Monday morning Cabinet meeting is very rare. It is expected to discuss indicative votesand whether thereaposs enough support to bring back a third vote by MPs on Theresa Mayaposs Brexit deal this week.    . Sheaposs facing fresh, brutal calls to quit The normally loyal Sun newspaper comes out today with an excoriating call for the PM to quit. It says she must offer up her resignation in exchange for MPs backing her Brexit deal, saying she is a great public servant but itaposs time to move on. Tory backbencher Nigel Evans, a joint executive secretary of the influential Conservative  Committee, added to the calls today. Clearly a number of people do not want the Prime Minister anywhere near the next phase of negotiations, he said. Yet talk of a coup to install an interim PM fizzled out at the weekend after both protagonists, Brexiteer Michael Gove and Remainer David Lidington, denied involvement. And donapost forget, thereaposs no clear successor and no legal way to remove the PM through a Tory leadership contest until December .  The Westminster knives may be out but the real story today - the one that will affect your le - is a dull process one. MPs are set to bring forward a plan for indicative votes, a multiple-choice vote by MPs to weed out the least unpopularway forward for Brexit. Thataposs because MPs have consistently said what they donapost want, but not what they do want.An amendment tabled by former ministers Sir Oliver Letwin and Dominic Grieve and Labour MP Hilary Benn had strong support.So crucially it looks as though the PM is taking plans for indicative votes into her own hands - with statements due from .pm and votes at pm. According to the , ministers are reading documents from am on  options - the PMaposs deal, No deal, a second EU referendum, revoking Article  to cancel Brexit, a Free Trade Agreement, Customs Union and Single Market. Both main parties have hinted there could be a free vote - allowing MPs to make a bold choice. Shadow Attorney General Shami Chakrabarti urged the PM to let the Commons have its say this week and listen to it, adding: There will have to be options put up that probably arenapost Labour Party policy. We have to find a way to allow people to coalesce. Not all will be happy with this. Labour MP Stephen Doughty tweeted: Any rigged Government-led process risks having little confidence in Parliament and even less with the public. Rushed. Loaded. Like comparing apples and pears. Peopleaposs Vote must be a bolt-on to ANY deal - not an either   or choice. . Revoking Article  is backed by a Tory minister  A Tory minister has become the first member of the government to back revoking Article  - which would cancel Brexit. Some , of the .million people backing a petition to revoke are in Foreign Office minister Mark Fieldaposs constituency. The Cities of London and Westminster MP came out for the dramatic position after organisers claimed one million people marched through London for a Peopleaposs Vote on Saturday. He told the BBCaposs Westminster Hour: My personal view is that I would be happy to revoke Article . I appreciate that is probably a minority view, butwe get to this utter paralysis and I sincerely hope that in the next ,  hours we do not, thenthat becomes an option, itaposs an option I personally would take.I accept it probably would not be a majority view in the House of Commons.”. And Boris Johnson is leading a Biblical Exodus  Boris Johnson has used possibly the most unfortunate metaphor ever to describe Brexit. The blundering Tory compared Theresa May to Moses from the Bible, calling on her to tell the EU: Let My People Go. It came in a blistering Dailycolumn where he accused the government of chickening out of delivering Brexit this week. We have blinked. We have balked. We have bottled it completely. We have now undergone the humiliation of allowing the EU to decide the date on which we may make our own departure, he wrote. He added: Extend the implementation period to the end of necessary use it to negotiate a free trade deal pay the fee but come out of the EU now - without the backstop. It is time for the PM to channel the spirit of Moses in Exodus, and say to Pharaoh in Brussels - let my people go. Heaposs forgotten one thing, of course. After Mosesapos people were let go, they spent  years wandering the desert.

The Prime Minister ploughed on with attempts to finally convince eurosceptic Tory MPs to back her deal. But she is facing intense pressure from her own party to set out a timetable for her departure first. The PM today summoned top Brexiteers including Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg to a showdown at her official country retreat.They told her that to get her deal through she had to set out a clear plan for leaving No  to make sure the next stage of Brexit negotiations took place under a dferent leader.But one source in the room at Chequers told the Mirror that Mrs May refused to be drawn and offered them “no concessions” to get behind her deal. Over the weekend there were dramatic reports of an imminent Cabinet coup with Remainer ministers set to tell her to go. But two senior ministers, David Lidington and Michael Gove, who were cited as potential caretaker leaders rejected the idea today.    Mrs May will face her mutinous Cabinet tomorrow morning to agree a path through the most perilous week of her leadership. And she is expected to then face further calls to quit as she updates MPs on last week’s humiliating Brussels summit. A senior No insider admitted to the Mirror that Mrs May’s situation was “very precarious”. They added: “There’s a lot of anger out there and we have a very narrow window to try to make progress”. At the Chequers talks, Mrs May instead threatened MPs, also including former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith and ex-Brexit Secretary David Davis, with a softer Brexit unless they fell into line. “It was back my deal or get a softer Brexit,” the source said. Downing Street has been warning Tory MPs they could even face Brexit not happening at all, in a bid to get them to fall into line. The EU has given the UK until  April to decide on a way forward out of the current deadlock. A cross-party group of MPs will today try to control of the Brexit process from the Government, with a series of “indicative votes” on the alternative options taking place on Wednesday. Tory MP Sir Oliver Letwin, who is spearheading the move, said he believed enough MPs would back their plans, although it was unclear whether the Government would give MPs a free vote.    But Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay warned that the country could face a general election as a result of the “constitutional collision”. He said: “The risk of a general election increases because you potentially have a situation where Parliament is instructing the executive to do something that is counter to what it was elected to do.” Downing Street has yet to decide whether it will bring back Mrs May’s vote for a third time, with party whips pouring over the numbers. A No  spokesman said: “The PM and a number of Government ministers met at Chequers for y talks with senior colleagues about delivering Brexit. “The meeting discussed a range of issues, including whether there is sufficient support in the Commons to bring back a meaningful vote this week.” Westminster was rocked by reports yesterday that  Cabinet ministers wanted the PM to make way for someone , with Mr Lidington lined up to temporarily take over. Other reports suggested ministers were plotting to install Mr Gove as caretaker leader. But Mr Lidington said: “I don’t think that I’ve any wish to take over... One thing that working closely with the Prime Minister does is cure you completely of any lingering shred of ambition to want to do that task”. Mr Gove added: “It’s not the time to change the captain of the ship, I think what we need to do is to chart the right course.” Philip Hammond admitted all was not well in the Tory party but accused MPs trying to topple Mrs May of being ”self-indulgent”. The Chancellor became the most senior minister yet to hint that the option of a second referendum was on the table, saying it was a “perfectly coherent proposition which deserves to be considered” alongside others. An online petition calling on the Government to cancel Brexit reached five million signatures just after hundreds of thousands of people marched through central London demanding a so-called People’s Vote.Jeremy Corbyn came under pressure from Remainers for failing to attend the march and instead campaigning in the local elections in Morecambe, Lancashire. Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said that Labour could fight a snap general election pledging to hold a public vote on any Brexit deal.He said the party was now clear that any deal should be subject to a confirmatory vote.

Flushing away a powerless Prime Minister — along with the Article  Europe exit clock — would give crucial space for a rethink and a general election. We are a humiliated nation, the laughing stock of the world. We must either pull ourselves together and change direction or future generations will condemn our foolishness. The worst option is allowing a Tory coup to install in Downing Street the Cabinet’s most untrustworthy Minister, expert-hating Michael Gove, or the most unknown, bland David Lidington.  Tory MPs are shutting out the public, playing pass the parcel with the keys to No  and concocting a bad Brexit deal to hold the party together. These are shenanigans worthy of a banana republic. Conned Brexit voters are entitled to be angry after the lies, deceit and illegality of a self-serving, corrupt Brextremist elite. One million people marched on Saturday opposing Article  and a petition calling for its revocation quickly topped five million — including more than , in May’s Maidenhead backyard. This shows the change in mood since the referendum, called by a previous Prime Minister in a past Parliament, was narrowly won through dishonesty and by demonising migrants. An election and a subsequent second referendum would be about jobs, living standards, prosperity, public services, security and the very essence of this country.    Whether we want to be fair or unequal, decent or indecent, tolerant or bigoted, insular or outward. Jeremy Corbyn up against whoever replaces May would put the nation in charge. We would have the option of radical hope with Labour or continued decline with the Tories. The outgoing PM was at Chequers yesterday. Begging serial liar Boris Johnson and Tory enemies to spare her while Chancellor Philip Hammond accuses Conservative colleagues of self-indulgence is a messy end. Labour PM Gordon Brown was a global giant as he led the world out of the banking collapse. Brexit’s shown May to be an inadequate national pygmy. We’re worth a new government, a Labour government, rather than a Tory shoddy Brexit fix under a Downing Street makeweight.

Taking on the old boys’ club, trying to keep calm and carry on, ­cleaning up David Cameron’s mess. I’m past that point now. Mrs May has had her dream job for nearly three years. She was desperate to be the first female PM – and was mfed when Maggie beat her to it when she was still at uni. But she got her leopard-print- shod foot in the door of No – where she’s shown herself to be a leader without backbone, negotiation skills, charm or a persuasive voice – or sometimes a voice at all.  Forget running through fields of wheat, Theresa. Leading your country into oblivion could top that in the naughty stakes. Still, she’s right when she said this week that we’re “tired of the infighting, tired of the political games… tired of MPs talking about nothing  but Brexit”. It’s true. I heard more sensible debate in Lord Sugar’s boardroom when I was on The Apprentice. Mostly, though, we’re tired of her. Tired of her inability to lead, show clear direction and convince her MPs, let alone anyone in Europe. Why would anyone believe it is her way or no way on Brexit, when she has built her leadership on a mountain of U-turns  We are living under a cloud of gloom and uncertainty and blaming other MPs, and ranting for the cameras does not prove she is “on our side”. It proves she is desperate. Perhaps she should look to ­ordinary folk like myself for some inspiration on how to get results.  In my world, as a busy working mum of two, I would relate this to my everyday le. And Brexit would become an egg. Say I’m boiling eggs for breakfast and my kids must choose how they want them. Of course they are never going to agree – Zac wants his hard- boiled and Amara wants her soft. I tell them they must pick one – their school bus is nearly here. But they won’t ­compromise. “Right,” I say through gritted teeth. “Last chance – hard or soft ” So they cut off their noses to spite their faces and have no eggs at all. I’m not a tyrant. I give them another option. “Have Nutella on toast!” I say. But still no deal. I refuse to call the head to say we will be late because we are still debating breakfast. I do not want to appear indecisive and open to exploitation. I want trust and respect. Plus, the head would give me a polite, “on your bike, love”. But I know the longer I drag it out, the weaker I look. My kids need boundaries. They need to know who is in charge. Andthey can’t come to a ­conclusion, tough. I don’t want them to walk all over me – I have to show strength. So they go to school hungry. Andyou have good friends they will slip you some crisps to keep you going anyway. OK, some intellectuals might laugh at my analogy. But right now, we are the laughing stock of Europe. So maybe you don’t need ­intellectuals running this country. You need real people with common sense. Truly fighting for our side. Not stumbling out of the EU with all kinds of egg on their faces.

And speculation that she might be moving out of Downing Street sooner than expected has reached fever pitch after another turbulent week in Westminster. The Prime Minister told colleagues at the end of last year that she would step down before the next scheduled general election in  but the pace of politics means she could be gone before then. Hereaposs a look at key names currently being floated to take the helmMrs May steps down. Michael Gove  The Environment Secretary had a bruising experience in the last Tory leadership race but he is now seen as the favourite at - - according to Ladbrokes - to replace Mrs May, largely due to his Brexiteer credentials. In June , Mr Gove, who was campaign manager for Boris Johnsonaposs drive to succeed David Cameron, withdrew his support on the morning Mr Johnson was due to declare and threw his own hat in the ring instead.He came third in the first round of voting, trailing behind ultimate winner Theresa May and Andrea Leadsom.Mr Gove, , was born in Edinburgh, studied English at Oxford and was a journalist before becoming an MP. He is married to Daily Mail columnist Sarah Vine. Despite speculation he could take the job, he told reporters on Sunday it was not the time to change the captain of the ship.  Mrs Mayaposs de facto deputy is seen by some as the natural caretaker prime minister but he has been clear he does not want the job. One thing that working closely with the Prime Minister does is cure you completely of any lingering shred of ambition to want to do that task, he said on Sunday. Ladbrokes are offering odds of - for him to become Number aposs next occupant. The -year-old has been the MP for Aylesbury since  and was Minister of State for Europe from  to . He is married with four children. Boris Johnson Prominent Brexiteer and former foreign secretary Mr Johnson has been a leading voice of opposition to Mrs Mayaposs Brexit plan.The colourful Old Etonian was one of the key players in the  Leave campaign and resigned from the Cabinet following the Chequers summit in July. He was heavily tipped as a successor to David Cameron but ruled himself out of the  leadership contest after Michael Gove made a last-minute bid for the top job. Odds of him taking the helm have slipped in recent months to -, according to Ladbrokes, but he is likely to have the backing of many pro-Leave members of the party.  Foreign Secretary Jeremy Huntwas a prominent Remainer in the  referendum. As Health Secretary, Mr Hunt fought a long battle with doctors over a new contract. The -year-old, who was first elected as MP for South West Surrey in , was appointed Foreign Secretary in July following the resignation of Boris Johnson. He chose not to run in the  leadership contest and instead gave his full support to Mrs May, saying it was not the right time to put his hat in the ring. Mr Hunt made a public sht towards Euroscepticism after the referendum, which could win him allies in the Leave camphe ran for the top job. Dominic Raab  With odds at -, Mr Raab is an outlier to take over from the Prime Minister but is thought to harbour ambitions for the role. Mr Raab, a prominent Brexiteer in the referendum campaign, was appointed as Brexit Secretary in July but resigned from the role in November, saying he could not support Mrs Mayaposs eventual deal. In his resignation letter on November , he wrote: Ultimately, you deserve a Brexit Secretary who can make the case for the deal you are pursuing with conviction. I am only sorry, in good conscience, that I cannot. Mr Raab, , has been the MP for Esher and Walton since he was elected in .  An outsider until today, there have been whispers about the former Education Secretary being up for the challenge of replacing Mrs May, at least temporarily. Senior Brexiteers suggest sheaposs well placed to be a unity candidate to soothe tensions between Leave and Remain factions. It comes after she played a key role in drawing up the so-called Malthouse Compromise.

The shipaposs engines had failed, leaving it at the mercy of conditions off the coast of Norway, with the , people onboard fearful the boat would completely topple. A ceiling would collapse and in the moments that ensued  people were injured, three of them seriously.Are you onboard the Viking Sky or have you been rescued  Email webnews@mirror For Janet Jacob, who was one of the first to be taken to safety, it felt like a tornado. She told Norwegian broadcaster NRK: I was afraid. Iaposve never experienced anything so scary. Shocking pictures of the aftermath reveal how fittings came loose and debris was scattered everywhere as holidaymakers huddled together trying not to get hurt. Large  and doors were ripped off the outside of the ship, while inside objects were thrown everywhere leaving scenes of chaos.    American Jan Terbruegn said there was little time for panic after the order came to abandon ship. He told Norwegian news outlet Dagbladet: We could see that we were getting blown in towards some rocks. That was the most frightening thing I think. But luckily that wasnapost our destiny.  Many were not so lucky, and had to endure a miserable wait for hours as rescuers were hampered by limited means of helping people escape. It was only possible to lt  people to safety at a time, which meant many scared passengers faced an anxious wait to be taken ashore.  And with water seeping into indoors of the ship after a massive wave battered down a door to the deck, it was miserable for those caught up in the drama.Many took to Twitter to share their experiences, among them Ryan Flynn who wrote: It’s about .am local Norway time and many of us are still stranded on the Viking Sky.It’s miserable as the seas are still very high with strong winds. The ship continues to pitch and roll. Captain is hoping the winds and seas calm enough to bring ship into port. He later shared a video of his -year-old father being airlted from the cruise liner.  And Alexus Sheppard posted pictures of people sleeping everywhere, with many taking up spots on the floor to try and get some rest. Derek and Esther Browne, from Hampshire, said the whole boat was swaying, it was very rough before they were airlted to safety. Mr Browne told BBC Radio  Liveaposs Stephen Nolan: We had a few people on stretchers, several with cuts, two with broken limbs, but fortunately we were alright. We were airlted onto the helicopter which was quite a frightening experience.  He added: Iaposd never been in a helicopter before, there were a lot of high winds, hovering overhead and the winchman came down and we were then collected up and so I shut my eyes as we arrived into the helicopter and there were  of us for about a -minute ride. Police in Moere og Romsdal said the shipaposs crew had managed to anchor in Hustadvika Bay, amid fears the vessel would run aground. Rescue services airlted  people to safety from the luxury cruise liner and began towing the vessel to a nearby port. The Viking Sky, with , passengers and crew on board, sent out a mayday signal on Saturday as it drted towards land in the Norwegian Sea. The airlt of passengers, many of them elderly, from the Viking Cruises ship by helicopter was halted on Sunday morning as two tugboats started steering the vessel towards the nearest port.  Founder and chairman of Viking Cruises, Norwegian billionaire Torstein Hagen, told Norwegian TV: Theyaposve had a bit of a shocking experience. Most of our passengers are senior citizens... imagine what itaposs like to hang there on that wire. It must be a terrible experience but they seem to have handled it very well. The  passengers were mainly from the United States and Britain, the rescue services said. There were also Canadians and Australians on board, among others, the cruise company said. Some  injured passengers had been taken to hospital, Viking Cruises said, while others had only minor injuries. One was taken to St. Olavaposs Hospital in Trondheim and others were taken to local hospitals. Many have also been traumatised by the experience and need care when they arrive on shore, the Norwegian Red Cross said.

The -year-old was found dead in the Humber Estuary on Wednesday afternoon and police have confirmed they are treating her death as a potential homicide. She had been missing since the early hours of Friday, February  following an evening out in Hull, and her disappearance sparked an intensive search. On Saturday, Miss Squireaposs mother described her familyaposs heartache at the loss of her darling daughter. In an emotional tribute, Lisa Squire affectionately referred to her daughter as Pie and said she had lost one of the four most precious things in my le.  Writing on Facebook, she said: I cannot thank you enough my darling Pie for making me a mummy. For choosing me to be your mummy. Itaposs an honour, a privilege and a joy. I kept you safe for as long as I could and I am so sorry I could not keep you safe on that night. Iaposm sorry. Iaposm so so sorry. Mrs Squire said her lowest point was having to inform her daughteraposs boyfriend of her death. In a statement issued on Friday, Detective Superintendent Martin Smalley, of Humberside Police, said: While we have considered throughout the missing person inquiry that Libby may have come to some harm, Libbyaposs death and the recovery of her body now leads us to solely investigate as a potential homicide. The detective said a post-mortem examination had taken place but officers would not be releasing any results for investigative and operational reasons. He said: We have to protect the integrity of the investigation, which is live and very much active and ongoing, with one man who remains under investigation.

She said she feared for her le, her body began shaking and her leg turned aposfloppyapos. Natalie had to undergo a series of operations, blood transfusions and skin grafts - and had metal bars inserted into her calf which was left with a gaping hole. After battling an infection, Natalie - now a mum-of-two - has recovered from the traumatic ordeal which left her unable to work for two years. Natalie, , married her partner, Paul, , in an intimate beach ceremony in Koh Chang.The couple then went island-hopping and were watching a firework display on the beach when firework careered into the crowd. It hit a coconut drinks display, setting one alight, before it smashed into Natalieaposs leg - breaking her tibia and fibula. Her husband and fellow tourists extinguished the flames and bundled the health care assistant on to a nearby sunbed and carried her to the road. Helpers unsuccessfully tried to load her into a tuk tuk, before she was put on the back of a pick-up truck and rushed to the nearest hospital.  Natalie, from Torquay, Devon, said: What was supposed to be the happiest time of our lives ended up turning into the most horric. When the firework went off, it careered into the crowd and hit the coconut drink display which set alight and fired straight into my leg. It all happened so fast. The next thing I know, people are trying to pat out flames as my dress caught alight and my leg is in agony. I really thought I was going to die or that Iaposd lose my leg. I feel so lucky to have survived and Iaposm relieved it wasnapost my daughter that the coconut hit - otherwise she certainly wouldnapost be here today. Natalie and Paul got married on Boxing Day in , and with their four-year-old daughter Ezme in tow celebrated New Yearaposs Eve with a party on Kata beach in Phuket. They said an unofficial fireworks display began on the beach - and they felt unsafe.  Natalie added: People were selling them on the beach and it wasnapost just the small ones you get in Sainsburyaposs - it was the big ones you get at displays at the seafront. Anyone could buy one and let it off and it was a bit scary. Natalie and her family felt uneasy and they were thinking about heading back to the hotel when disaster struck. She said: Someone bought one and let it off and instead of going up into the air it headed straight for me. It darted into the crowd. I didnapost even see it coming. As I went to stand up, I just fell down. The firework had hit a coconut drinks display - which was filled with alcohol - and placed on top of a table.  It had caught fire and shot off the table and into my lower leg. The power of the firework had fired the coconut in my direction. It flew straight into my leg - breaking my tibia and fibula and catching my dress alight. My husband was patting my dress, thinking I was on fire. He went to move my leg and it was all weird and floppy. I just went into shock - my whole body started shaking. Thankfully there was a male doctor from Belgium there and a female doctor from Australia on the beach. She was talking to me and saying: aposI work in ICU, Iaposll look after you, donapost worryapos.  She said it took an hour to get to AE, before she was transferred to a hospital in Phuket - a journey that took another two hours. I wasnapost able to have any pain relief either as they wanted to see our passport and travel insurance documents first, she said. It was am in the morning so Paul had to get in a taxi with Ezme and travel to our hotel - more than an hour away - and come back with the papers. I was begging for pain relief the whole time - I was in absolute agony. When they got all of our paperwork, they gave me some pain relief and rushed me straight into theatre and they put pins in both of my bones - the tibia and fibula - to fix it. Where the coconut had hit my leg, the impact had caused the skin to corrode and die. It was just getting blacker and blacker. Every other day I had to go to theatre and they put me to sleep while they cut away at the skin - it was called debriding. Unfortunately, their interpreter was on holiday for the two weeks whilst I was there so I also had to try and translate what they were saying on my phone. When I woke up in recovery, my arms had been strapped to the bed like a crucix. I got bed sores and my heels turned black as I wasnapost moved properly - as I should have been. I couldnapost get out of bed. I was in hospital for just over a fortnight. I had to have a blood transfusion and a unit of blood while I was there as I lost so much. I was on a morphine drip.  Natalieaposs family wanted to travel to be with her, but due to the busy time of year, they were unable to book flights. She said: My mum and dad were trying to get flights to see us - but they couldnapost book them as they were all full. I just had to grin and bear it. Our insurance company flew a nurse out from the UK because I was on so much medication. She was so lovely. Although the bones were mending, I had a hole in my leg where they had cut away the skin. You could see right to the metal work in my leg. Luckily weaposd taken out insurance and they paid for everything. They put the nurse and I in business class on an Emirates flight and flew us back to Birmingham in mid-January. An ambulance met me at the airport and took me to Exeter Hospital. Once back in the UK, Natalie saw a consultant, and surgeons had to remove some of the metal work in her leg to help it heal properly. They also took some muscle out of my right leg at the top, inside of my leg and put it in the hole in my lower leg and attached it to my main artery in my heel, she said. I was warnedit didnapost take, they might have to amputate below the knee and I was told that was likely to be the case at three dferent stages.  Doctors also found she had contracted an infection. They couldnapost work out why the bone wasnapost healing, she said. They found a bug in my leg - called shewenella alegia - which is a foreign bacteria, you donapost get in the UK. Normally fishermen get it or itaposs found in places by the sea, which makes sense as the accident happened on a beach. I was off work for two years in total as my leg just wasnapost healing. Natalie fell pregnant with her second child during the healing process, and had to go to Torbay Hospital to have IV antibiotics every day. She said: They said theyaposd never given anyone IV antibiotics for thatof time whilst being pregnant. They said I could have ended up having an amputation. I had to worry of not only being pregnant, but also potentially having my leg chopped off. A week before I had Orla, my second child, now four, in March , I had my the bars and cage removed from my leg.  Natalie is still recovering from the ordeal - six years on. She said: I get the odd pain now and again. Iaposve only got half the lymph nodes in my leg and have to wear a special stocking to stop the swelling. But I think anything is better than not having a leg at all. Iaposve changed in myself - Iaposve got bigger because I canapost move around as much as I used to. But Iaposm just thankful Iaposm still here and that it wasnapost my head, or it wasnapost Ezme, now  - she wouldnapost be hereit had hit her. If the coconut had hit my head, I wouldnapost be here either. Itaposs not all doom and gloom, Iaposve come out of it stronger. It couldnapost drive or get out and about. I couldnapost work. I was a prisoner in my own home for two years. When I took my little girl to the museum there was a big bang that sounded like a firework being let off and I just burst into tears. Whenever firework night comes up, I panic. When a loud noise sounds and Iaposm not ready for it orI donapost know itaposs going to happen I jump out of my skin. I feel like Iaposve got PTSD as I suffer from flashbacks too.

Vice-president of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid al-Maktoum, had faced opposition - including from the church and local community council - to some of his plans for a massive development at his Highland bolthole, which was likened to a Travel Inn. The sheikh had initially sought planning permission for another  bedrooms at his Wester Ross retreat, but in December withdrew plans for one of the proposed two lodges. The withdrawn lodge, Ptarmigan, which had caused the most concern from objectors, was for nine bedrooms.  It has now been re-submitted to Highland Council with the sheikh altering its location to be a good neighbour. The sheikhaposs architects say the familyaposs trips to Inverinate have been limited by lack of accommodation - despite already having  bedrooms there - and another  approved last month. A supporting statement accompanying the latest application from agents Farningham Planning Ltd says the proposed new lodge is sympathetic to the existing pattern of development that prevails in the area, and compatible with landscape character and capacity within both the immediate and wider surrounding area. Given the close proximity of a residential property to the west, the proposed lodge has now been carefully sited a signicant distance away from this property in order to minimise any perceived adverse neighbour amenity issues. The -year-old sheikh, who founded the Godolphin racehorse stud, has made all his applications to Highland Council through his company Smech Properties Ltd.  Approved last month - subject to conditions - is a lodge for  bedrooms as well as a nine-bedroom house. With multiple wives,  children, numerous relatives and a large entourage of bodyguards and servants, Transport Scotland was concerned over the wear and tear to the local road caused by the sheikhaposs future trips to his Scottish Highland hideaway. It wanted the sheikh to detail how often he and his regal retinue are planning to head north and what the cumulative traffic impact will be. In response, the sheikhaposs company wrote back: The proposed lodges are for the sole, exclusive use of the current land owner and guests. They will not be rented out for tourist use. As with the current lodges, occupation is infrequent. They are not occupied for large periods of the year. It is anticipated that there will be no signicant increase in car movements above the existing traffic flow following completion of the construction phases. As with the current lodges, the majority of visits to the property are by either coach or helicopter, supported by a fleet of six x cars for shooting parties visits. There is no recorded data available on frequency of visits orof duration. Architectural designer Jonathan Mennie was among those who wrote to the council previously about the developments to register my strong objection.  What is currently proposed looks like a Travel Inn - indeed, all five buildings taken together transforms what was a picturesque estate with one sympathetic lodge house, into what looks like a hotel development under the guise of a aposprivate residence,apos he wrote. The first plans for Ptarmigan Lodge also drew protests including from Miss Tina MacLeod, who wrote:The sheer size of this colossal building would dwarf the existing church building at least twice over, according to the location plan. The expected light pollution from such a large hotel-sized building would be obscene, along with the possibility of excessive noise that would accompany such a large structure, during building and once occupied, this would make my familyaposs existence a living nightmare. The visual impact of the apospalaceapos is utterly hideous in an area such as this and I have no faith in the tedious design of the proposed developmentcarried through, being appropriate to this area. One must ask why Smech ltd are planning to fill the grounds of Inverinate Lodge with so many large, separate buildings for accommodation. Is this traditional Highland estate set to become yet another playground resort for the rich with little or no benefit to the local community  It is the latest scheme on the estate, which has a triple helipad site and a  bedroom holiday home, next door to a -bedroom luxury hunting lodge, with pool and gym. The sheikh, who is believed to have a fortune in excess of £ billion, bought the ,-acre estate more than  years ago for a reported £million.  His family visit every summer to escape the C Dubai heat. In an accompanying design statement for the new lodge, Inverness-based Colin Armstrong Architects reveal:The owners of Inverinate Estate typically travel in large groups of immediate and extended family and friends. In recent years their travel to Inverinate has been limited by lack of accommodation. Additional staff accommodation was completed in  to create infrastructure that would support greater use of the estate by the owner and this new application seeks to create residential accommodation for the use of the owners, their family and their guests in order they may enjoy more frequent and extended visits to Inverinate. Around Inverinate the sheikh is well-liked, employing several local people. He built a community centre, gted land for a day care centre and sheltered housing and gives venison to the elderly. Local councillor Biz Campbell said last year: Itaposs only when the family come that the helipads are used. Itaposs dead quiet otherwise.

Emma, from Moray in Scotland, recalled the incident that her son had been jumping on the soft mattress before she heard a aposvery clear snapapos when he landed in a pile of pillows. She said: They [doctors] for this type of fracture the most common thing was high impact car accidents, trampoline accidents, and the third thing was abuse. At first doctors feared he may be suffering from brittle bone disease, but this was ruled out by specialists who said it was just apossheer bad luckapos.    Emma still couldnapost get a clue of how her son could break the bone like that. I have no idea how it happened, it’s so bizarre. He was just being silly, throwing himself into the pillows [on the bed], she explained. But just when he landed I knew…. his body went one way and his leg went another and I heard a very clear snap. He cried initially and screamed and then he just went silent. It was almost ashe wanted to go to sleep. He curled himself up into a ball. I think it was his body going into shock with the pain. It was just sheer panic.    Itaposs said the fracture was caused by the bone being torn in half as a result of a twisting force or impact, and specialist had to discuss how to fix it. Due to Harrisaposs young age, doctors decided to put his leg in traction for three weeks, where by they stretched the leg and kept it in the same position to allow the bone to heal. Emma, a therapy radiographer, said: It was a long time but the hospital was just fantastic. The play leaders came round every day to keep him occupied. “He’s not the kind of boy who will sit and watch TV, that doesn’t interest him at all. So I did think, aposhow are we going to manage’. But he did amazing. When they were putting in traction, the big thing was to make sure it was set the sameas the other leg otherwise he would be left with a permanent limp.    She was told it could take at least six months for an adult to recover for the same type of injury.

Research carried out among , adults revealed the top  typically British traits, which also includes always having a stf upper lip, being tolerant and being culturally aware.Other classic British activities include dunking biscuits in tea, always talking about the weather and saying sorry too frequently.More serious character traits, such as respecting LGBT culture, sharing your feelings and being supportive of immigration only just made it into the top , below more trivial things such as loving a trip to the pub and having a fry-up for breakfast.    The study was commissioned by Sky Arts to launch Art , where  artists have created pieces to show what it means to be British. The results also identied dferences between the generations. More than half of over s see putting the kettle on in a crisis as typically British compared to just  per cent of millennials. And while  per cent of pensioners consider it British to be proud of where you are from, just  per cent of younger adults agree. Instead, millennials are more likely to consider a respect of LGBT culture as Britishalong with loving to hate the Royal Family . Phil Edgar-Jones, director of Sky Arts said: “As a nation, there are ious traits and activities which people believe define Britishness.   “But many people think this definition is changing over time, especially thanks to the Brexit referendum and our exit from the EU.“There is so much which is great about Great Britain, but the country is constantly evolving, leading to a dferent meaning to the phrase ‘being British’.” The study found talking about the weather is considered the most British trait, followed by queueing for things, always having a roast dinner on Sundays and putting the kettle on in a crisis. A love of fish and chips, going to pub and having a dry sense of humour are also thought of as typically British, along with good manners and not complaining about bad food in a restaurant.  But while  per cent of Brits would describe themselves as being typically British, the poll revealed that half think what it means to be British has changed over time. Almost one in three think the definition of ‘typically British’ has changed since the Brexit referendum and another  per cent think it will evolve again following our departure from the EU. And  per cent of Brits don’t feel they are able to show how proud they are of being British as much as they did before the referendum. Despite this,  per cent are proud to be British, with another four in  saying they feel this way ‘a little bit’. Just  per cent aren’t at all proud to be British. But according to the research, carried out via OnePoll, while  per cent of the nation would describe themselves as British,  per cent would say they are English instead. Just  per cent of Scots would describe themselves as being British, along with just a third Welsh folk and  per cent of those from Northern Ireland.  In comparison, half of those in Yorkshire would describe themselves as British rather than any other nationality along with  per cent of Londoners. Researchers also found that the Brexit negotiations have left more than one in  wishing they had voted dferently in the referendum after seeing how everything has played out so far.

The Met Office is predicting glorious weather for the three months until June starting with potentially record-breaking spring warmth this week.By Thursday most of the UK will experience temperatures in the high teens, and they could even hit C in places with prolonged periods of sunshine, say forecasters. Spring temperatures could hit C in April thanks to plumes of warm air from Africa, and the extended forecasts suggests summer could be hot and settled.    Monday got off to a crisp start which will lead to a fine and bright day across much of England and Wales, the Met Office said. Isolated showers are expected in western Scotland and Northern Ireland. In the evening, showers will be confined to the far northwest and an overnight frost is likely under clearer skies in the south. Tuesday will be a fine day with sunny spells except in the north where it will be cloudier with rain in the far northwest.  Dry weather is likely from Wednesday with the best of the sunshine in the south and east of the UK. The northwest will continue to see wetter and breezier weather. The Met Office said a much warmer-than-usual March to May is five times more likely than much cooler conditions. aposWell above averageapos UK temperatures over spring - a category which includes  and aposs hottest springs since records began - is a  per cent probability, compared to  per cent for aposwell below averageapos temperatures. Bookmakers Coral cut odds on spring being the hottest on record from   to  .      Coral spokesman Harry Aitkenhead said: Punters believe a sizzling spring is ahead. Scotland could see C next month. April saw -C highs in Scotland in three of the past four years, Met Office records show. The warm forecast is a boost for Scots planning for Easter holidays and May Bank Holidays. Hot air from Africa is set to raise temperatures, pulled north by high pressure south of UK, forecasters said. A roasting summer is also on the cards this year, The Weather Outlook said.  The Met Office three-month forecast said: For March-May, above-average temperatures are more likely than below-average. The probability UK average temperatures will fall into the warmest of our five categories is  per cent. The coldest category is  per cent. Some long-range prediction systems indicate an increased chance of high pressure to the south of the UK. The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: With computer models strongly favouring a warm spring, there is potential for the record for the hottest spring to be challenged. In April, C highs are likely in Scotland. Plumes of warm air from Africa are expected. And there is an increased chance of a hot and settled summer due to the trend for more high pressure, which brings hot conditions in summer.

Special Counsel Robert Muelleraposs verdict that Trump did not work with Russia to win the presidency in  gives him a powerful weapon to use against his Democratic opponents, Reuters analysts say. It takes away a central charge that opponents have flung at Trump for two years - that he did not win the presidency fairly or cleanly. And the Trump campaign has already turned the decision into a fundraising opportunity, asking supporters to donate shortly after the announcement yesterday.Attorney General William Barr sent a summary of conclusions from the report to congressional leaders and the media on Sunday afternoon.Barraposs summary said Mueller found no evidence the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia, despite multiple offers from iniduals associated with Putinaposs country.    Democrats have vowed to continue congressional investigations into the  election campaign and Trumpaposs business practices. But without the solid foundation of a Mueller report that found evidence of any crimes by the president, this may be seen as overplaying their hand. This is a gold star day for Donald Trump, said presidential historian Douglas Brinkley. Now the shackles are off. Heaposs able to demonize the news media and Democrats as perpetuating what he calls a hoax. And heaposll be able to use his innocence as fodder for the campaign trail. This was an illegal takedown that failed, Trump said on Sunday, even though Mueller left open the question of whether the former real estate magnate had attempted to obstruct the Russia probe, which did find extensive evidence that Russia meddled in the  election. Now is the time to get back on the offense on the economy and growth, said Republican strategist Scott Reed. This is a good time to get back to a real healthy dose of message discipline for the entire administration, department-wide and the White House. Thataposs what you do when something like this happens.    Trump, on a golfing weekend in Palm Beach, Florida, got the news in his private quarters at his Mar-a-Lago retreat from White House counsel Emmett Flood, and watched TV coverage of the Mueller report in his cabin on Air Force One. The presidentaposs initial comments in reacting to the Mueller conclusion suggests he is not inclined to move past the investigation. Speaking to reporters before boarding Air Force One for the flight back to Washington, Trump called for Democrats to be investigated, expanding on his often repeated assertion that the Mueller probe was Democrat-inspired. Mueller was appointed by Trumpaposs Department of Justice in  after he fired FBI director James Comey. Itaposs a shame that our country had to go through this. To be honest itaposs a shame that your president has had to go through this, Trump said. Before I even got elected it began, and it began illegally.  Trumpaposs comments could foreshadow an effort by his supporters to seek payback for the cloud that has hung over his time in the White House. Iaposm interested in moving on and trying to get this behind us, but people have to pay for what theyaposve done for the past two years, said former Trump campaign aide David Bossie. We must investigate the investigators.aposaposWhite House spokesman Hogan Gidley said Trump had no plans to request that his attorney general open an investigation into the presidentaposs political opponents. Still, Trumpaposs path to re-election remains challenging, despite this apparent victory. Analysts say he will probably need to win the Midwestern states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, just as he did in his  victory, and Democrats are already pouring resources into those states. Trump will foreshadow his campaign message on Thursday night when he headlines a Make America Great Again rally in Michigan. Trump supporters viewed the Mueller report as a blow to the more than a dozen Democrats who are campaigning for their partyaposs  presidential nomination.This is very problematic for any Democrat whoaposs running for president in  that was hoping they would face a weakened orbeaten-down President Trump, former Trump campaign adviser Jason Miller said.

The swells were hitting us broadside, just leaning the ship back and forth, almost to the point we thought it was going to tip.People were getting tipped over in their chairs, amid breaking dishes and glasses. Judy said a six-foot-tall wall of water barreled toward her through the restaurant window. The force of the water was so strong that ended up sending her flying.    There was a chair coming at me with the legs, and I thought it was going to take my eyes out. Then Rod grabbed me, she added. Another clip showed the ship tilted to an angle of nearly  degrees and water coming through the communal areas inside the ship. The couple was one of the first passengers to be evacuated by helicopter but they said it was dficult for them to accept being rescued before others.  They were on the eighth day of their -day cruise ship when the incident happened. The operating company has now paid for the coupleaposs stay at a hotel in Molde, Norway.

When you play an instrument or sing and are part of a group, it’s almost like a spiritual experience.“It’s an emotional outlet as well soyou can’t express that you are angry or sad through words, you can do that through playing an instrument and it’s really good for kids.“The kids don’t have to be musical. If you can breathe, you can sing. It’s not all just going to be learning the songs, we will be learning singing games that actually subconsciously plant musical theory in the children’s heads.“They won’t realise but they are actually starting to understand the fundamentals of how music works.”The choir will start on Tuesday, April  and will run from .pm to .pm. A block of nine sessions costs £ and children are encouraged to get sponsored as well.All of the money raised will go to Help For Kids, which supports disadvantaged children in Dundee and Perth.All choir volunteers helping will be PVG-checked.Charity manager Stacey Wallace said: “Lianne has created this amazing idea.

We must try to increase harmony for better understanding.“Because we are all living longer, five generations are living and working alongside each other for the first time in human history.“Never has mutual understanding been so vital – to break down unnecessary barriers, live harmoniously and learn from dferent perspectives.”Ms Burke said younger people work dferently to those in older generations. Post-millenials and Generation Z apparently have an eight-second attention span, whereas baby boomers are less technologically minded.Barriers can also arise from the dferences in how the generations communicate with each other.After launching the initiative at Dundee Women’s Festival, the first issue Ms Burke highlighted is the dference in language used by each of the generations.She is now

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes. A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal.

The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder.

Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"what a week of music","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowMid Argyll Music Festival drew to a close in fine style at Lochgilphead Joint Campus after a stunning week of performances and entertainment.The th anniversary festival has to go down as one of the most successful, featuring a record entry of competitors.The sun, at long last, shone on the closing day of the event on Saturday March  after a wet, dreich week.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"bob shields public need say","story":"NewsBob Shields: Public need say on Prime Ministers Brexit dealReal democracy is having a second voteShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsBlundering Theresa May heads the most incompetent Government weve had in living memory \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHow many Members of Parliament does it take to change a light bulb  The answer – of course - is just one. But it takes the other  of them over two and a half years to decide exactly what kind of light bulb they want in its place! In last week’s episode of Commons Comedy Capers, we had the Brexit secretary proposing the Government’s motion . . . then voting against it. Similarly, we had the Chief Whip – whose job is make sure MPs toe the party line – voting against his party line! Last Tuesday MPs rejected Theresa May’s deal, on Wednesday the rejected ‘No Deal’ and on Thursday they rejected sticking to the March  deadline. I watched the creaking, croaking Theresa at Prime Minister’s Questions and it looked like the only thing you could guarantee to be behind May . . . was June! When it comes to Brexit, the House of Commons has now had more votes than most Eurovision Song Contests. And as I write this on a dreary Monday afternoon – it seems certain that another vote is on the way. Theresa May is going to put her ‘deal’ to the Commons for a THIRD time . . . but onlyshe’s confident that she’ll win it! Yes folks – a vote ONLYshe knows she’ll win in advance. How’s that for democracy at work  So - we have a vote . . . another vote . . . and then another vote  Mmm – now where have I heard that before  Ah yes – now I remember - it’s been the Conservative party’s official ‘put down’ of every single request for a second “people’s referendum” on Brexit. It’s a line you can even trace it back to the lips of our very own Member of Parliament, Mr Bill Grant. “We have already had a ‘people’s vote”, he said. “Another vote, assuming it indicated a dferent outcome, would be presumably followed by another vote and another vote, and so on”. What Bill, and the Conservatives, have been telling us for months is that you can’t keep on having a vote until you get the result you want. But meanwhile, the leader of the Conservative party is doing exactly that! And it’s not asthe Prime Minister needs a five per cent swing – the dference in the Euro referendum – to get her own way. It beggars belief that she can take the biggest parliamentary hiding in history . . .and go back for a second and even a third bite at the cherry! It begs the obvious question –our MPs can get three chances to vote on the biggest political issue of our generation – why can’t the ‘people’ get at least a second vote  I’m also getting fed up with Brexiteers telling us “the public just want this pushed over theline so they can move on”.Er . . . no. The public I speak to want the right deal to leave Europe. Andit’s not on the table, theywant the right to reject it and stay in Europe. Is it too late to ask Bill Grant to stop puckering in the direction of Theresa May and start pointing his ears in the direction of his constituency, which not only voted to “remain” but voted him to Parliament to represent them  I hope not. Bill’s qualities might include loyalty . . . but he’s always open minded. My solution  Well, it might be a bit simplistic – but then most solutions are.  Parliament instructs the PM to ask to delay Article  for one year.  Parliament instructs the PM to form a cross-party Brexit Committee to begin new talks – and come back with the best deal that the combined parties have negotiated and will have support in Parliament.  Give the public an unbiased and detailed explanation of what the deal means. Put it to a referendum – accept the deal and leave – or reject the deal and remain. This way, the people of Britain - and Europe - will know exactly where they stand.By March   – we’re in or we’re out. And everyone, on every side, will have had their say. Bill, that’s real democracy at work.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnConservative PartyAyrBrexit"},{"url":null,"title":"gran who hurled bleach over","story":"Picture by contracted freelance Steve McKendrick\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA gran who hurled bleach over a child has been granted a personal licence to sell alcohol by East Ayrshire council. Mary McLelland was convicted of throwing the cleaning agent over a -year-old boy’s head and body in Auchinleck. Police objected to McLelland getting a personal licence at the council’s licensing board meeting heard last week, McLelland, , of Main Street, Auchinleck carried out the crime in November . Police Sergeant David Dougan told councillors McLelland was sentenced to a community payback order at Ayr Sherf Court last year as punishment. But McLelland said she was plagued by anti-social behaviour outside at her home in Main Street. She told the board: “I love kids. I regret it.” She claims she has had problems with people “chapping her door” and urinating in her garden. She rushed out to the nearby bus shelter during one incident, she told the meeting.. McLelland said: “I went out. It wasn’t even raw bleach. It is not an excuse. I shouldn’t have done it.” She claimed the bottle was kicked out of her hand and spilled over the victim. But the meeting heard McLelland pled guilty in court. The shop worker said: “I am not in the habit of going out and fighting with kids. “I am a -year-old woman.” She added: “Everybody in this le makes mistakes. Nobody in this world is perfect.” She told the meeting she had phoned the police numerous times to report anti-social behaviour at her property. Councillors adjourned the meeting to discuss whether she should be handed a licence. Ontheir opinion was split with three councillors voting to grant her application and the same number against. Board Chair Councillor Tom Cook had the ruling say and decided to grant McLelland’s licence. He said giving her the licence would not increase her chances of committing a similar offence in the future. Councillors George Mair, John Campbell and Fiona Campbell voted to refuse the licence. Councilors Drew Filson, Lillian Jones supported Councillor Cook’s view to grant it. Councillor Cook said he would grant the licence “albeit with reservations.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEast Ayrshire CouncilCourtsJusticeAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"people say future high rise","story":"NewsPeople to have their say on the future of high-rise flats in AyrTenants asked for their preferred optionShareByGary Fanning:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTenants in the Riverside Place multi-storey flats in Ayr are getting the chance to have their say on the future of the high-rise properties as South Ayrshire Council’s consultation on ‘Your place, your future’ gets underway. The consultation and engagement exercise – approved by Councillors last year – gives tenants the chance to choose their preferred option for the long-term future of the flats: Refurbish  – this means the Council would keep the flats, decant tenants, carry out identied refurbishment works, and thentenants to their refurbished flats. Rehouse  – this means tenants would be rehoused permanently in suitable alternative accommodation and the flats would be demolished. Rebuild  – this means tenants would be decanted to temporary accommodation and the flats would be demolished before some tenantsto a new-build housing development on the Riverside Place site. The detailed consultation, which is based around inidual one-to-one meetings with more than  tenants, has been planned in conjunction with the River Ayr Tenants Association, which represents tenants in the three blocks. The Council has communicated regularly with tenants in the lead-up to the consultation to ensure they have all the information they need to take part. A further letter has now been distributed to homes in Riverside Place following queries and concerns raised by tenants regarding a letter sent to them by Fort, Seafield  Wallacetown Community Council. The community council’s letter appears to query the three consultation options being discussed with tenants and questions South Ayrshire Council’s interpretation of the expert report approved last year regarding the “essential and advisable” works required to the flats. Councillor Philip Saxton, South Ayrshire Council’s Portfolio Holder for Housing and Community Wellbeing, said: “We are committed to ensuring that our tenants are fully involved in the discussions about the future of their flats, which is why we’re taking such a detailed approach to this consultation. “It’s vital that tenants understand all the facts so they can form their own views about the option that is best for them. That is why we have gone back out to them to respond to the queries and confusion that have been generated by the community council’s letter. “We fully appreciate that the community council may have a view on the consultation, which is why colleagues are meeting with them next week and we’re happy to keep them informed about the consultation and engagement process. “However, our focus – which was clearly expressed by tenants at the recent River Ayr Tenants Association meeting – has to be on hearing the views of those who will be directly affected by Councillors’ decisions later this year: the tenants of Riverside Place. “We thank them for their participation in the consultation and I can reassure them that their views will be taken into account before any decisions are taken about the future of Riverside Place.” Joe Lafferty, Chair of the River Ayr Tenants Association, said: “We have worked closely with the Council over the last couple of years as discussions around the future of the flats have moved forward – and we very much appreciate the approach the Council has taken. “It is for every tenant to consider what is the best option for them and to ensure their voice is heard by those who will be making the decisions about what happens next. Clear facts, easy to understand information and answers to the questions tenants have is what’s needed and that’s exactly what we have got from the Council.”   Feedback from the consultation will be considered by Councillors in June this year.Full details of the Riverside Place consultation are available at  www.south-ayrshire.gov.uk riverside-place .

The Post can exclusively reveal that the developers McCarthy  Stone have thrown in the towel and withdrawn their multi-million pound proposals. Major question marks hang over the building’s future following the bombshell announcement. The news prompted an angry backlash from Derek Hart, chair of Prestwick North Community Council. In an extraordinary outburst he claimed the building has been “plundered and left to rot.” The building provided a retreat for children battling cancer for more than  years. It was opened by Princess Diana in . In  it was sold by owners Clic Sargent after claims of a “challenging fundraising environment”. They sold it to McCarthy  Stone and trousered £.m from the deal. However, since McCarthy  Stone took ownership and unveiled their luxury flat plans they have been embroiled in a bitter fight with neighbours Prestwick Golf Club. The club was opposed to the development on the basis of its scale and design. Other objections included the potential impact it would have had on their historic course and the surrounding conservation area. In addition, there were fears that errant balls could smash into residents’ properties. Plans involved building  flats for people aged over , spread out in a T-shape over four floors. Many would have had sea views and balconies. The proposals were approved by South Ayrshire Council but last year Prestwick Golf Club successfully petitioned for a judicial review, meaning demolition work on the former retreat had to stop. It was estimated that  jobs would be created between the construction phase and posts at the new development. Despite a PR charm offensive from McCarthy  Stone throughout the process and a public exhibition of plans at the  Club in Prestwick’s Main Street, the developers pulled the plug on the project. A spokesperson said: “Following a strategic review last year we are no longer pursuing any new developments within Scotland and have withdrawn our plans for Prestwick.” Derek Hart reckons the decision is a kick in the teeth for all the campaigners who fought to retain the presence of a sick children’s home in Prestwick. He told the Post: “I find this action taken by McCarthy  Stone not only deplorable but a slap in the face to the Save Malcolm Sargent House team who fought bravely to try to purchase it. “Is it not time for South Ayrshire Council to stop and listen to the community  “The community stated that the development would only feather the nests of McCarthy  Stone – and perhaps chemists –as the age group targeted by them were over  years. “There’s been very little input to Prestwick and we are now left with a building that has been plundered and left to rot. “Will we find the same response to the other end of the beach, at the old Gym, I wonder ”He added: “Time after time SAC have allowed developers to build as they wish with barely a challenge to the character ofthe town and how it should look.”The news will be viewed as a major victory for Prestwick Golf Club, who fought long and hard against the development. A statement by the club said: “While we welcome this news we hope that, should a new development proposal for the site be put forward in the future, the design and scale will be more sympathetic to the surrounding area.” The statement said the club was not against the principle of redeveloping the site but was “disappointed” at the scale and design of the proposed development. It added: “We believed that McCarthy  Stone hadn’t listened to the concerns raised by the club.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnPrincess DianaSouth Ayrshire CouncilRoyal FamilyPrestwickAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"shopper yelled get back your","story":"NewsShopper yelled \"Get back to your own country, you Iraqi b******\" to Ayr Lidl workerManus McGhee avoided jail after his foul mouth outburst at the store.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR NewsThe outburst took place at Lidl in Ayr \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man who was asked to leave Ayr’s Lidl store went back in to racially abuse a staff member, writes Edwin Lawrence.

Super-fit Fiona McBlane was , practised yoga and cycled and was in London lapping up a glamorous working le in the music industry for companies such as EMI and Smash Hits. But during a Christmas visit home to Ayrshire she fell unwell with leg, arm and head pain. Such was her distress she admitted herself to hospital. First the minor stroke hit - on January ,  - and then the searing biggie nine days later. It left her semi-paralysed in hospital for  months, unable to speak, hardly walking and retaining very limited brain capacity. That was when Clan McBlane rallied round to give her the best future they could. They had been advised the best place for her was an old folks home but they stood firm. Once Fiona was fit enough to leave hospital she was brought into the bosom of the family in Prestwick. Twelve years on at the age of , Fiona is battling away and has got to the stage where she has joined the gym at Prestwick Tennis Club. Her loving older sisters Gillian McBlane, , and -year-old Gaenor Hardy have just pounded round the Stroke Association’s Resolution Run with Gillian’s -year-old son Graham to continue raising money for the charity. That added £ to a total now of about £. Gillian, a top civil lawyer in Ayr, and Gaenor, headmistress at Heathfield Primary, assist their parents Jean and Ian who are Fiona’s full-time carers. And Gillian is helped by the other legal eagle in the family, Ayr criminal defence agent Steven Maxwell. Gillian said: “She loved her work and was a real high flier. “People were drawn to Fiona’s fun-loving nature and her great big heart. “Never for a minute did we think she would have a stroke. “At  years old she had lost everything she loved.” Fiona is prone to falling and choking, often passing out. Sometimes the enormity of what has happened becomes too much for her and she struggles emotionally. But Gillian said: “Our parents taught us to look for the positive things in le and not to feel sorry for ourselves. We spend time together and Fiona enjoys the company. “Despite the extent of her disability, she does brilliantly. “Doctors told us that her friends would eventually tail off but Fiona’s haven’t . They keep in contact with her and visit when they can. “People have shown us great kindness over the years in so many ways and this means a lot, helping us immensely. We don’t know what the future will hold for Fiona but we do know that whatever it is we will face it together.” There are , strokes in Scotland every year. Angela Macleod at the Stroke Association said: “Our latest research shows that by training and taking part in a Resolution Run you are helping to lower your stroke risk. “The funds raised by each runner means we can reach out to more stroke survivors and their families to offer the support that they may need to rebuild their lives.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnstrokeAyrAyr NewsPrestwickRunningCharity"},{"url":null,"title":"who-done-it-marks-lauder-amateur-dramatic-societys-70th-anniversary","story":"LAUDER Amateur Dramatic Society will perform lsquoA Tomb With A Viewrsquo for its production this week.The group is celebrating its th anniversary this year and it has picked the Norman Robbins comedy thriller to mark the occasion.Established in , the society performed its first play lsquoThe Wee Comicrsquo by Donald Kelly, a year later in Selkirk.And it has gone from strength to strength.A spokesperson said: ldquoThis years who-done-it mystery has as many twists as a corkscrew, and will keep the audience guessing until the last minute.ldquoBe prepared to sit on the edge of your seats and to feel shivers down your spine, coupled of course with some hilarity from the sinister Tomb Family and their associates.The show will take place at the Lauder Public Hall from March - at .pm.

Our children must feel safe and be treated with dignity.ldquoAs one of the most progressive nations in the world when it comes to promoting childrenrsquos rights, I am proud this Welsh Government is legislating to bring an end to the physical punishment of children in Wales, further protecting childrenrsquos rights.The bill will now be scrutinised by AMs, with Welsh Government sources confident it will be passed by the National Assembly and brought into law after achieving Royal Assent by Spring .The Government says the legislation will be accompanied by an awareness-raising campaign and support for parents.Research published last year found % of parents of young children in Wales disagreed that ldquoit is sometimes necessary to smack a naughty child, while the Parental Attitudes Towards Managing Young Childrenrsquos Behaviour  survey found only % of parents with young children reported they had smacked their children in the last six months.The legal defence of ldquoreasonable chastisement has been used in law since  and is currently available in England and Wales for parents or adults acting in loco parentis against charges of common assault.The most recent figures available show between  and  there were  cases where the use of the defence resulted in an acquittal of a defendant or a discontinuation of proceedings against them in England and Wales.Wales would join the  countries around the world which have already banned the physical punishment of children, including Greece, Latvia, Albania, DR Congo, Kenya, with Sweden being the first to do so back in .Viv Laing, head of policy at NSPCC Cymru, said: ldquoItrsquos wrong that children in Wales have less protection from assault and that a legal defence which does not exist when an adult is hit can be used to justy striking a child.ldquoWe have long campaigned for equal protection for children and we strongly believe a change in the law is a common-sense move. Closing this loophole brings Wales in line with dozens of countries across the world and is simply about fairness and equality for our children.Professor Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: ldquoWhen a parent raises a hand to a defenceless child, whether thatrsquos a smack, slap or another physically harmful behaviour, they have lost control.ldquoResearch tells us that children who are physically punished are more likely to have poorer mental health and physical well-being and when they grow up, are more likely to engage in self-destructive or antisocial behaviour.

With  minutes left, a tremendous fingertip save, by Neil McMillan, pushed the ball over the bar.With four minutes left the away side put the game beyond #Dale#s reach when Matthew Lamont tried to clear a corner shot but unforunately scored an own goal.In high winds and driving rain the game fizzled out.Both sides had played well in the conditions and kept the ball on the deck in addition, referee, Archie Mitchell said it was an easy game to ref with no bad tackles.The match ball was sponsored by Wee Toon Sports and a Carradale spokesperson thanked Food for Thought for the post match hospitality.Tomorrow Carradale travels to Helensburgh for an early kick off at noon."},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane march 15 2019","story":"Peter Docherty, born and brought up in the Wee Toon, lives in a first floor flat, in Tangy Place tenement, at the end of the High Street, with a #marvellous# view of all the comings and goings on Campbeltown Loch.Back in , aged , he was an apprentice painter and decorator for a town firm, which he thinks might have been Galbraith and Cochrane.Mr Docherty#s son, also Peter, , talked to the Courier on Monday and said: #Dad told me that the young apprentices were always given the awkward, high up places to paint.#Back then this wall must have been under a ceiling as now the graffiti chipped into the plaster is at waist height.#Painters always used to leave their mark on a building, many will be painted over in people#s houses.#They often wonderedtheir #marks# would be uncovered in the future.#On this wall they could see the names of people who had painted it in the past.#When he saw Down Memory Lane last week dad said he was the only P Docherty in the town at the time.#Peter junior, who visits two to three times a year, said: #I was born in Craigard.

Lauder, it is said, was the first place he stopped after fleeing from the Battle of Prestonpans.ldquoI suppose we kind of followed in his footsteps, said my friend, ldquoalthough in a very dferent way and totally dferent circumstances of course. Folk round here donrsquot really know the story, but coming from the Pans it gave us an immediate connection.The actual house on Lauder High Street that Johnnie Cope arrived at is now gone, replaced over  years ago. But Lauder must look much as it did on that fateful day when Cope arrived, with his horse close to collapse with exhaustion.Johnnie Cope was the general commanding the British Army at Prestonpans on that fateful day, September , . The battle was a major victory for the Jacobites. Cope fled the scene of battle, but only when it was clearly lost. He eventually arrived at Berwick-upon-Tweed to give news of his own defeat. Ever since, popular tradition has mocked Cope for running away and not standing his ground and dying lsquohonourablyrsquo, as Colonel Gardiner of Bankton House did.This ridicule was encapsulated in a traditional popular song, and the chorus remains well-known:Hey, Johnnie Cope, are ye wauking yet Or are your drums a-beating yet If ye were wauking I wad waitTae gang to the coals irsquo the morning.The song pokes fun at Cope and concludes with a harsh indictment:Now Johnnie, troth, ye were na blateTae come wirsquo news orsquo your ain defeat,And leave your men in sic a straitSae early in the morning.There are earlier versions with slightly dferent words, but the sentiment remains the same: Johnnie Cope ran away and should be ashamed of himself for leaving his men. However, he was later found to have done his duty, and this reputation deemed unfair. But mud sticks, especially when a catchy tune is added to it.This popular song is believed to have been written by Adam Skirving, a farmer at Garleton in East Lothian. There is a story that he visited the battle site a few hours after the fighting. Perhaps he spoke to some eyewitnesses who saw Cope flee up the road to Birsley Brae, and therefore got the idea for the song. The road Cope took as he fled from the battle has ever after been called Johnnie Copersquos Road.Lauder is a short journey from Prestonpansgoing by car. It had been a while since I had last ventured over Soutra Hill and into the border country and I enjoyed the drive despite the wild weather, or perhaps partly because of it.But what was Copersquos journey like as he galloped over Soutra Hill with some of his dragoons  He must have paused at the summit and cast a glance at the view over East Lothian and screwed his eyes to find Prestonpans. The panic and terror by this time would have given way to dferent feelings, I suspect.He rode more or less the same way I took to Lauder but it would have taken him much longer with very dferent emotions. His arrival in the town would have been a bewildering spectacle for the locals. He later continued his flight to Coldstream, which he reached by nightfall.All this was in my head as we headed home to Prestonpans from Lauder the next day. I could almost see the ghosts of Cope and his dragoons gallop past us as we ventured over Soutra.As we drove, I re-told the story to my kids and we sang the song in the car. They know the story and the chorus well, as we have many times ventured along Johnnie Cope Road on the way to the rail station.By the road is Bankton House, once the home of Colonel Gardiner, who did not run but stood his ground, and paid the ultimate price with brutal death.There is a small doorsquocot by the house, and inside you will find a free but almost secret visitor centre created with the support of the Battle of Prestonpans Heritage Trust.The doorsquocot can only be reached via a walkway through the wood from the rail station during the day, and inside lsquoAuld Archiersquo tells the tale of the battle, and the le and death of Colonel Gardiner. On the wall is a model map of how the area looked at the time of the battle, with the route taken by Johnnie Cope clearly marked.Itrsquos all fascinating stuff which had been unexpectedly brought to my mind by the visit to Lauder to see old friends.But it was the emotions rather than the events that I reflected on most. The hatred caused by this civil war , the loss, suffering and misery of conflict which is so often hidden by a cloak of romanticism.Adam Watters, a Panner who lives and breathes local history, and re-enacts it for children and visitors alike, is clear on this. It is a fascinating period to study, and to have the history on our doorstep brings it alive. But as Adam has said, letrsquos enjoy that sense of history on our doorstep and have fun with it, but let us not glory battle, rather learn from it.I think Johnnie Cope, even though he was a military man, may well have agreed with Adam."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-council-cockenzie-revised-plan","story":"Inch Cape Offshore Ltd has been given approval to site the building ndash which will bring energy ashore from an offshore wind farm ndash on land at the former Cockenzie Power Station by Scottish Ministers.A planning application was initially lodged with East Lothian Council but was called in by the Scottish Government before a decision was made.That decision sparked anger after it was announced as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on an official visit to China, where she met representatives of Chinese state owned Red Rock, which owns Inch Cape.Now the company has presented a revised plan of the space it intends to use to Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council.The community council posted the new design on social media and revealed plans were under way for Inch Cape to host workshops in the local communities in the coming months.The image shows the substation on about a third of the original .-hectare footprint applied for.One of the biggest concerns raised by communities and the local authority, which owns the land, was that a substation dominating the old power station site would make it a no-go area for other developments.The new plans were welcomed by many on the community councilrsquos Facebook page, with one person saying: ldquoGood news, less sterilisation of the site.Ian Johnson, Inch Capersquos project manager, said: ldquoWe are continuing to engage with East Lothian Council and local community councils on options to signicantly reduce the footprint of the onshore transmission works and moving this to the west of the site.ldquoWhile this detailed design plan is subject to further technical assessments, consultation and approval from the council, we are taking steps to ensure remaining land is available for other developments."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-school-pupils-to-take-part-in-strike-against-climate-change","story":"The NBHS Eco Committee have encouraged students to travel by public transport to attend the rally campaigning for stronger government action to combat climate change.The Edinburgh protest is one of many around the world that are happening tomorrow morning, where school children are walking out of classes to protest climate change.The protest starts at am outside the Scottish Parliament.An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: ldquoWe want to support our young people as global citizens to have their voice and to be able to express their views on important matters such as climate change.\"The safety and wellbeing of our young people is of paramount importance to us.

The wood surrounds a lake of the same name, which is actually a reservoir created  years ago.Pressmennan Lake is nearly km long and meanders through the wood, giving the appearance of a river rather than a loch. In summer, the lush canopy of trees which surround the lake can engulf the senses, and for a moment you can be fooled into thinking you are in the middle of an ancient forest.And in a sense, you are. The wood is a fragmentary remnant of the ancient oak wood which once covered most of our county. Records show it existed in medieval times, and Irsquom sure well before that.Much of it was felled, so tradition tells us, when the warship The Great Michael was built on the order of James IV around . This ship was famously constructed using the oak woods of Fe, but such was the size of the vessel that wood from where was also needed, including Pressmennan.Yet the wood seems to have survived, and in  the felling of trees here is said to have been stopped due to its importance as a habitat for the kingrsquos deer.It remains a place rich in wildle. Roe deer still roam free amidst the trees here. They are creatures of woodland magic, and native to these isles. They are small and nimble-footed, and will dart into the undergrowth at the sight or sound of approaching danger. They have short antlers and a tailless rear, which usually has a white patch. This is the part of the animal you most likely see, as it quickly bounds away from you.The wood is full of other wildle: owls and bats, hares and foxes, stoats and weasels, and, according to the Woodland Trust Scotland, who own and care for the wood, otters have also been seen in the lake. The birdle here is likewise rich, and there is a crescendo of song in the spring. The trust acquired the wood in  and is slowly restoring it to its natural character, planting oak and other native trees.We arrived at the wood last weekend, on a day of changeable weather, but laden with the promise of spring. There is a childrenrsquos map provided by the Woodland Trust and it proved a great hit for my kids, who followed the loch-side path looking for the features identied.These are wood carvings and sculptures made by artist Robin Wood. Part of the trail includes doors and windows in the trees which are said to be the homes of magical creatures called the Tootflits and Glingbobs.My children, well-versed in the folklore traditions of our county, know all about faeries, brownies, selkies, kelpies, witches and wizards. But Tootflits and Glingbobs were new to them, and to be honest myself as well.They are mythical creatures created by the artist and trust to provide a sense of wonder and adventure for children as they explore the wood. You can search for their homes and the wood sculptures along the way.And so we set off on our adventure of discovery. The path by the riverbank needs care with wee ones when wet, but it whispers magic. Ancient oak trees line the banks of the lake, their branches dipping into the water.These old trees were still leafless, biding their time for the arrival of spring proper. But they were a spine-tingling sight, a reminder of what once was here in abundance. But then, as we ventured deeper into the wood, we made a less pleasant discovery.Some people had decided it was a good idea to hammer coins into the sculptures, and even into the living trees. We found the homes of the Tootflits, and at their door was a pile of rusting coins which had clearly been left as a gt or good luck charm. Rusting coins also lay all around the base of the tree.I understand the desire to leave a gt or charm for a magical creature, but polluting and damaging nature with the ultimate symbol of materialism was, for me, horribly ironic.We removed what we could, and my daughter Skye searched for a more suitable gt. She found a small lsquofaerie cuprsquo, which was the cupule of an acorn, and placed it on the doorstep.ldquoThere, she said, with a sense of satisfaction.We continued our search but we found every sculpture defaced in the same way. One had actually collapsed due to the splintering and rot caused by the coins being hammered into it.The final sculpture was a frog on a log. It too was peppered with coins hammered into its body. In the universal measure of things, this damage was insignicant and perhaps even well-meaning, for I assume it was done by people who came to enjoy the wood and merely wanted to leave their charm here.But eventhere was no malice, it was a desecration. Then my heart tore as I watched my children scrape their fingers as they tried to pull the coins from the poor creature. But they were mostly rusted and too well-embedded.As we left the wood, I was reminded of a famous quote, attributed to the Native American chief Seattle: ldquoTake only memories and leave only footprints.The word lsquophotosrsquo is often used instead of memories but the message is the same, and now more powerful than ever. Itrsquos a worldwide issue ndash the desecration of natural sites by people who unthinkingly want to leave their mark. The coins that werenrsquot rusted we put in a charity box.The experience affected my daughter.ldquoCan you write about what we found, dad, and ask people not to do that  said Skye at bedtime. ldquoAsk them to find presents in nature, like faerie cups or stones or fallen branches or pine cones or berries, or even make a love heart shape in the ground. Faeries donrsquot like metal anyway or need money.And I promised her I would. As she slept, I kept my promise."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/9390259.jpg?htype=105\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"prince-of-wales-honours-cubas-national-hero","story":"Charles stood in silent contemplation as a large wreath of roses was laid at the open-air monument to the famous essayist and poet in Havanarsquos Revolution Square.Fidel Castro, Cubarsquos former Communist ruler, would address the people close to where the prince stood before the ceremony began, giving speeches at important moments.Surrounded by imposing ministry buildings, the heir to the throne, whose we Camilla was nearby, walked behind two soldiers who held aloft the large floral tribute made of roses and then laid it at the stone monument.The heir to the throne touched it briefly before taking a few steps back and pausing to look at the wreath.The British Embassy in Havana has described the royal visit to Cuba as ldquoa historic moment.It tweeted: ldquoEverything is ready for today when TRHs The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall arrive in #Cuba for the first official #RoyalVisitCuba.ldquoA historic moment for both countries.Charlesrsquos visit offers an opportunity for the UK and Cuban governments to forge closer ties in the wake of the soft diplomacy employed by members of the monarchy, who use it to make friends and build bridges during foreign tours.A spokesman for the couple, who arrived in the ministerial jet RAF Voyager, said: ldquoTheir Royal Highnesses are looking forward to experiencing the culture and meeting the people of Cuba.There was another milestone as it is believed to be the first time an RAF plane has landed in Communist Cuba, which had very close ties with Russia during the Cold War.Later Charles and Camilla were given a tour of the museum dedicated to Marti inside the monument which stands over  metres tall and dominates Havanarsquos skyline.The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall tour the Joseacute Martiacute exhibition, learning more about his le. #RoyalVisitCuba pic MqtTtAMdmdash Clarence HouseMarch , Curator Eva Maria Diaz told him about the writerrsquos le and the history of Havana, which prompted Charles to point out that Britain had once occupied the city during the th century ndash ldquobriefly.As they left he told her: ldquoIrsquove learnt a great deal about Jose Marti.Saying that he would like to spend more time in Cuba, he joked: ldquoYou might get fed up with us very quickly.The Joseacute Martiacute Memorial in Havana pays tribute to the essayist, poet and national hero of Cuba.Their Royal Highnesses attend a wreath laying ceremony at the memorial. #RoyalVisitCuba pic CsTrXpbmdash Clarence HouseMarch , He added: ldquoI am sorry to have dragged you in on a Sunday.

On an otherwise somnolent Tuesday lunch time its really welcoming: chilled, but not dead.

Staff behave like people who are happy at work.: Pasha, North Frederick Street, Glasgow. Restaurant review by Ron MackennaNominally a ldquoside dish at a mere pound., this intelligently composed winter salad of bitter chicory, peppery rocket, and walnuts that taste freshly toasted, all tossed in a Stilton vinaigrette, is just what I fancy. We marvel at the ldquosmall plate of mussels. Its pound. tag is deceptive. Itrsquos enough for lunch, an ample bowlful of bivalves, plump, fleshy specimens, in a thick Asian soup thatrsquos not for wimps, a thicker version of Indian rasam, aromatic with lime leaf, cinnamon bark, cloves, star anise, and just a hint of sweetness to round it off. Therersquos also a blisteringly hot flatbread to dunk into it. It tears away in circular strands, a bit like a Malaysian roti cenai. Heaps of effort is packed into this dish, yet itrsquos inexpensive.Hake, a special on todayrsquos menu, is a pleasure to behold, a steak cut from the centre of a well-proportioned specimen impeccably grilled under its cape of green herbs. Wild garlic scent wafts up from the plate. It twines around roasted slices of purple potato, which have that rewarding, elusive flavour and floury texture thatrsquos now such a rarity because these characteristics have been bred out of modern ldquomultipurpose commercial potato ieties. Squash pureacutee adds a brightening dash of orange to the opalescence of the fish, setting off the emerald garlic leaves, and the muted imperial purple of the potatoes.The fishcake is also made with hake, and once again, we taste Stravaiginrsquos very evident proficiency with the use of spice. Its innards have the hue of brown crab meat, I guess from a fresh-made curry paste, which lends sharp backbone, perhaps from tomato, with the earthy undertow of turmeric. The necessary oiliness of its breadcrumb jacket is offset by juicy ribs of crunchy, refreshing pak choi that have had a fleeting visit to a searingly hot wok. A runny-yolked poached egg, and satiny, coriander-speckled Hollandaise layer, add wanton enrichment to the already satisfying fish.We catch up with the plum frangipane tart in a just-out-the-oven state. Its thick, yet barely cooked centre, rather like liquid marzipan with opulent dark plums bleeding into it, is only just bound by a taut corset of gloriously buttery, almost butterscotch pastry. This paragon of patisserie perfection is partnered beautully by a scoop of toasted almond ice cream, which tastes like essence of the very best Spanish nougat. Apple and olive oil cake from the daily menu hits that bliss point between too hot to eat and freshly baked. Moist within from the oil, and subtly conveying all the grassy, green flavours in it, it really does taste ine. The exterior is an up hill and down dale landscape of biscuity crust and apple chunks. Translucent pools of sharp, punchy green apple compote, and amber caramel, accentuate the winning sweet-sourness of the cake, while lemony cregraveme fraiche ice cream decisively nudges this dessert away from excessive cloyingness.In its own words, Stravaigin has been ldquowandering since  and ldquoshowcasing Scottish produce that isnrsquot tethered to its roots.

Wersquove had enough of that from Theresa May. The can has been kicked down the road so often that you just want to jump on it and flatten the damned thing.This week we go back to the bargaining stage, but we may not even get that. Parliament has been given an extra fortnight for May to preicate, and for the Commons to avoid coming to a consensus.At least the prospect of no deal on Friday might have concentrated minds, like an execution, and forced MPs to seize the reins of power from this battered and friendless Prime Minister.Instead, we have another fortnight to learn what we already know: that MV seems as remote as ever, and Theresa May wonrsquot give up on it.The European Unionrsquos political leaders were, of course, acting in their own best interests on Thursday. Having listened to May ramble on incoherently for  minutes, the  concluded that, yes, she really is daft enough to let a no-deal Brexit happen.Well, they can live with thatthey have to. But what they werenrsquot prepared to do is allow her to blame the European Union for the breakdown so, to coin a phrase, they took back control.The heads of government offered to delay the Brexit deadline until May ,she gets her deal through Parliament, or April she doesnrsquot. They will go the extra mile, explore all options, and then even offer a longer extensionall  fails. Itrsquos jaw-jaw not war-war, and they are the virtuosos of jaw-jaw.Though in truth, Brussels doesnrsquot really know what happens when the talking finally ends.The problem with the European Union is that they expect political leaders to behave as rational agents, who seek the most advantageous outcome. They donrsquot have protocols to deal with mad-as-a-hatter prime ministers and a parliament that has lost the plot.The UK has decided to have a collective mental breakdown, in full technicolour, and will not be talked out of it by boring bureaucrats with their seemingly sensible solutions.After , days, the simple fact is that UK still doesnrsquot know what Brexit means. That image of the cat manically scratching at the door, and then refusing to leave when itrsquos opened, is only too apt.Everyone knows that the obvious destination for a country like Britain, which has vital trading links with Europe but doesnrsquot want to be part of the political union, is to join the European Economic Area, now dubbed ldquoCommon Market ..That alone allows friction-free trade, avoids an Irish border and halts these daft, wartime preparations for no deal. .There has always been a majority in Parliament for soft Brexit, everyone says so. But as I pointed out last week, our system seems incapable of distilling compromise from the mash of party interests.MPs say they want to reach across party boundaries, but as last weekrsquos walkouts and tetchy letters confirmed, they donrsquot really. No-one wants to take any responsibility, no one wants to blink first, no-one wants to make the first step.Yet to halt Theresa Mayrsquos Thelma and Louise-style drive to the clf edge, ministers and MPs will have to remove her from office, probably through a confidence motion, and set up a kind of provisional government.They need to force the long delay she refuses to contemplate. This weekrsquos indicative votes on their own wonrsquot cut it. The nightmare, indeed, is that nothing gets a majority.The Westminster system requires a semi-dictatorial Prime Minister, with an unassailable majority, to . But May is a dictator without an army. She has no majority, yet perversely behaves asshe still has one.What residue of authority she possessed evaporated after her petulant outburst against MPs on Wednesday. Even Labour MPs who were tempted to vote for her deal, like Lisa Nandy, were so outraged that they resolved to vote against her come what may.What can you do with a Prime Minister who wilfully alienates her potential allies Theresa May actually had a point about Parliament only being able to agree on what it doesnrsquot want. We all thought that the problem was the Withdrawal Agreement, the -page legal document signed off by May last year, which contained the infamous Irish backstop. But we now know that this is not the case.Last week, Labour declared that they did not have any problems with the Withdrawal Agreement or the backstop, despite Jeremy Corbyn having condemned it in November. He said then that Mayrsquos Withdrawal Agreement was ldquoa half-baked deal which Britain cannot leave, and the backstop would deny Britain ldquothe sovereign right of any UK parliament to unilaterally withdraw from any backstop.All Labour now wants is a tweak to the Political Declaration ndash that non-binding, non-legal compendium of cliches, aspiration and wishful thinking that accompanied the Withdrawal Agreement. I seem to remember writing that to say this was woolly would be an insult to sheep. So why has it become a deal-breaker The blame obviously lies principally with the Prime Minister ndash a woman so bereft of vision and leadership ability that she shouldnrsquot be left in charge of a milk float, let alone a country.She could have offered Labour anything they wanted: full consultation, customs union, workers rights, environmental standards, regulatory alignment. It would have meant little because the Political Declaration is non-binding. Instead, she has made a fetish of inflexibility which is the worst failing in a political leader. She is in love with her idea of herself as a ldquobloody dficult woman, and thinks that backing down, resiling, is a betrayal of her sex.That is why I ended up voting for the petition to Revoke Article . To my horror, I found myself agreeing with Nigel Farage and Michael Portillo that the only real choice,Parliament cannot act, is between no deal and no Brexit.The only certain way to end this horror show is to pull the plug, halt the madness and pretend the last three years never happened. EvenParliament does end up backing Mayrsquos deal, which of course is still possible, it wonrsquot put an end to this nightmare.The Withdrawal Agreement is only the start. It deals with citizenship, the orce bill and the Irish backstop. Negotiations over Britainrsquos future trading relations with the EU have yet to begin, and will take two to four years. Four more years of this would be beyond endurance.And it wonrsquot be Theresa May who is doing the negotiating, but perhaps Boris Johnson, or some other Tory leader. If voters were fully aware of this fact, Irsquom sure that the parliamentary petition calling for Article  to be revoked would top  million within the week."},{"url":null,"title":"how-orkney-reinvented-the-future-with-hydrogen","story":"ldquoIn , it said, ldquoOrkney was the first to generate hydrogen from tidal power, using electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. Actor, environmentalist and hydrogen-advocate Leonardo DiCaprio shared that video on Instagram. It has been viewed , times. The world had its eyes on little Orkney as a possible beacon of low-carbon hope.It is not the first time Orkney has been there first or best. Back in , the first grid-connected wind turbine was erected in buffeting gales at Costa Head. In , a giant experimental concrete turbine, the largest of its kind, was inaugurated on Burgar Hill. Orkney was where, in , the European Marine Energy Centreinstalled Scotlandrsquos first grid-connected tidal device, and last year, a flagship tidal energy turbine generated more electricity in its first year than the whole of Scotlandrsquos wave and tidal sector produced before it.The carbon intensity of the electricity that Orkney generates and feeds into the main grid is almost the lowest anywhere in the world, at just g CO kWh. Only El Hierro, in the Canary Islands, beats it.Hydrogen is Orkneyrsquos latest possible game-changer. New projects on the islands are fitting ferries to run on the gas, which is produced from local renewables.Hydrogen boiler heating systems are being fitted into a primary school. Orkney Islands Council, a signicant force in the developments, is running a fleet of hydrogen-fuelled vans.A key player in these changes is the wave and tidal test and research centre, EMEC. Its hydrogen manager Jon Clipsham says that a favourite phrase at the centre is ldquothe art of the possible.ldquoWith these projects wersquove proved itrsquos possible, he says. ldquoIt also has to happen. If it doesnrsquot wersquove got nothing to hand over to the next generations, because Irsquom more than of the opinion that the climate is changing, and quite rapidly now.What is it about these islands  Partly, of course, itrsquos the climate and location itself ndash the rapid tidal currents that run through its sounds, the constant winds. Itrsquos also that for decades it struggled with the fact that it is an island, connected to the mainland electricity by an undersea cable, and suffers the worst fuel poverty in the UK ndash partially caused by being off the gas grid and stuck with one of the highest rates for grid electricity.Hydrogen technology has developed in Orkney, in part, because the islands had a problem.This archipelago with its now more than  wind turbines and developing tidal renewables was generating too much electricity for its own needs ndash it now produces the equivalent of % of its electricity demand ndash and wasnrsquot able to send more down the line to the grid.The cable connecting to the mainland could only carry a small fraction of what it was generating.Communities had erected wind turbines but were not seeing the expected revenue s, and were having their generation curtailed, some to just % of what they could generate. So great is the problem that currently there is a moratorium on further wind development.Clipsham says: ldquoThe huge expansion in renewable energy led to a point where there was more energy being produced than we could feed back through the cable to the mainland. That meant those who had invested in wind technologies were unable to get the revenue they were looking for.This was particularly frustrating, says Clipsham, because the sheer abundance of natural wind and tide resource on the islands meant ldquoyou could deploy  times, possibly more, of it than what wersquove currently deployed.Community groups had bought in to the idea of using the feed-in tarfs as a means of generating revenue for projects and services but werenrsquot seeing the expected payback. A further issue is that while Orkney is host to incredible renewables potential, the communities also suffer the worst fuel poverty in the UK. A factor in this is that there is no gas grid on Orkney and the electrical supply can cost as much as p per kWh, making it among the highest in the UK.The Orkney community was looking to find answers to these problems and, around seven years ago, EMEC began to look at using the renewables technology to make hydrogen by electrolysis. ldquoEMEC has always been very future-focused, says Jon Clipsham, ldquoand hydrogen is not new. Itrsquos been around for a long, long time. Iceland had a boom-and-bust cycle. But we began to look at it.ldquoThoughts of how we need to decarbonise the world were very present. By  , things had really some momentum and we decided to go for hydrogen.The first project was Surf rsquonrsquo Turf, a wind and tidal energy project that was all about grid balancing, in which energy was harvested when it couldnrsquot be put into the grid, stored, and regenerated as electricity when there was the opportunity to export it.However, it was quickly recognised that the hydrogen could also be used as a fuel. ldquoThe premise, says Clipsham, ldquoshted from grid balancing to setting us off on the journey which we are now well advanced with, towards having a fledged hydrogen economy.As part of EMECrsquos European Union and Scottish Government-funded Big Hit project, hydrogen heating boilers are being fitted in a school on the Orkney island of Shapinsay. Meanwhile, a car ferry is under construction which will run on hydrogen, and this year will see the installation of a hydrogen system into one of the ferries currently running between Shapinsay and Kirkwall.Such technological development seems timely. In December last year, Maersk, the worldrsquos largest container shipping company, announced it aimed to be carbon neutral by  ndash currently it is looking at biofuels.Clipsham is interested in how these hydrogen and renewables technologies might scale up or be adapted in dferent locations. ldquoCan the learnings we got here be transitioned  Yes. Energy systems are becoming increasingly decentralised, so yoursquore breaking things down into smaller chunks, so you might see some of the knowledge wersquove gained on Orkney rolled out and used on a block of flats, or a housing estate or a leisure centre.There is a sense on the island right now that what they are doing is being watched. Steven Bews, a builder who grew up on Shapinsay where the Big Hit project is based, is, as chair of Shapinsay Development Trust, involved in his community turbinersquos integration in the project. ldquoWe do feel a wee bit like the whole world is looking at us, he says. ldquoI keep seeing it on social media. Orkney and the Big Hit project is being highlighted and itrsquos good to see that the wider world is aware of us.For Bews, the idea that he is getting to be part of a greener future is as important as the local benefits. ldquoTherersquos a feeling that you are being environmentally friendly in what yoursquore doing. Yoursquore trying to lever the whole industry away from carbon and on to renewable green energy ndash and while it is in its infancy, I believe hydrogen has the potential to eventually replace a diesel and hydrocarbon-thirsty transport infrastructure.The awareness of climate change is strong on the islands. Almost everyone has some story to tell of its impact. Adele Lidderdale, hydrogen project officer at Orkney Islands Council, observes: ldquoYou see crop failure. We had flooding over the past  years that we didnrsquot previously see. We know the impact that the environment can have on day-to-day le.Lidderdale, whose great grandfather came from Orkney, grew up on the islands. Her husband grew up on Shapinsay, where one of the key hydrogen projects is based. ldquoWhen yoursquore in such a small community you see the impact first hand. You have to answer to the community. I think thatrsquos part of the unique mixture of why wersquore able to get these things done. You know that yoursquore going to have to answer to the people who are going to be affected by any decisions you make.Part of the appeal of the Orkney hydrogen project is that it shows on a small, very human scale, how hydrogen could become part of the answer in a low-carbon future. Nigel Holmes, chief executive of the Scottish Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Association, sees great promise in what is happening on the islands.ldquoOrkney is almost like a microcosm of some of the things we are trying to tackle. We can show how we make the hydrogen from renewables, we can move it around, we can store it. We can show how it can be used in transport. We can show it can be used for making power, also for heating. The project helps people to appreciate the interconnected nature of some of these networks ndash because itrsquos all there in one place.Clipsham has watched the project develop and believes that one of the key things about the Orkney Islands is the people. ldquoPeople are starting to ask, lsquoWhy is all this going on in the Orkney Islands  Yoursquove got , people, but theyrsquove now got a portfolio of about  million euros of hydrogen related projects happening.rsquo And thatrsquos a very good question.ldquoBut when you go to the Orkney Islands and you talk to some of them, you realise why. Because there is such a positive can-do attitude. If you give them a problem they will work out what they can do to find a solution. Andit isnrsquot obvious theyrsquoll go out and look for it. There is an absolutely amazing attitude up there."},{"url":null,"title":"si-ferry-talks-football-in-our-latest-cool-conversations","story":"A le less ordinary: Partick Thistle director Jacqui Low talks politics, bereavement and smashing the glass ceilingIt helps that Ferry is a former footballer and that some of the people he interviews are just his mates, people he might chat with anyway.

In some cases they have their own bathrooms, while in others they have to share a communal one in the corridor. In one BB, residents were forbidden from talking to each other or going to each otherrsquos rooms, while in another the doors were locked at midnight and anyone not back by then would be out for the night.Cooking facilities were rare, and in most cases residents lived on non-perishables such as instant noodles, biscuits and junk food.For the money costs to be accommodate in these places ndash pound a month ndash an \"impressive drawing room conversion\" is advertised for rent in the heart of Glasgows west end.The flat in an \"elegant sandstone townhouse\" comes with a modern kitchen, mezzanine, \"stylish\" two-piece bathroom and separate toilet, and is \"exceptionally well-placed for local amenities and excellent transport links\".And for less than that, pound a month, a two-bedroom semi-detached mews is available for rent, including council tax bills.The \"elegant\" property is also in the west end of Glasgow, and boasts two large bedrooms, a kitchen, bathroom and access to a garden.In Bearsden, a three-bedroom refurbished villa is on the market for just pound a month.This, they say, is only adding to or creating more problems in terms of mental health issues, addiction, isolation and unemployment.Lorna Walker, a partner at Govan Law Centre, said: ldquoThis isnt the best use of taxpayers money, when they could be putting it in to accommodation that is of a decent standard and putting it in to helping people get their lives back on track the way they want it.\"It is not a good way for taxpayersrsquo money to be spent at all and the authorities need to open their eyes and see that.ldquoThe law in Scotland on this issue is some of the best ndash it is very clearly written, and it is clear how it should be applied.

So itrsquos a vicious cycle.ldquoThose who have no means to rebuild will be left outside with no house, more at risk of disease and worse off.Aid organisations are of one voice in stressing that itrsquos now a race against the clock to prevent an even worse catastrophe emerging through the spread of disease.ldquoWe are running out of time, it is at a critical point here, warned the United Nations childrenrsquos agencychief Henrietta Fore on Friday.ldquoTherersquos stagnant water, itrsquos not draining, decomposing bodies, lack of good hygiene and sanitation, Fore said. ldquoWe are worried about cholera, about malaria, because of the stagnant water.As ever, humanitarians will have their work cut out harnessing the collective concern of a world that has so far been disproportionately low.As ever too, those cynics will chant their now familiar mantra about it being far away in Africa and how ldquocharity begins at home.To those among such people I would simply ask this. Imagine, just imagine, waking up tomorrow and the sense of desperation you would feel were your own children confronted with the same horrors so many in Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi face right now How dferent the callous attitudes of such cynics might be were they, even momentarily, to eyewitness such suffering for themselves up close.The chaos, pain, helplessness, hunger and disease of such disasters are not an easy thing to confront face on and forget. The juxtaposition with the comparative safety and luxury so many of us take for granted here would also be a real shock to the sensibility of many.I well recall many years ago when the impact of climate change was dismissed more readily than it is now, ing from Ethiopia where millions were caught in the grip of drought and impending famine.It was just days before Christmas when I set foot back in Glasgow. The conspicuous consumption of that time of year stood in grotesque marked contrast to a village where I had been just a few days before, watching vultures circling above a community where people were already badly malnourished and some had died of hunger.ldquoWe call them the undertaker birds, one elderly local man told me, bringing home the terrible resignation so many people feel towards their fate when faced with such helplessness.Idairsquos angry arrival in Africa was yet another ominous sign for a continent already bearing the brunt of climate change. How tragically ironic it was that the cyclone made landfall on precisely the same day that the One Planet Summit, called by French president Emmanuel Macron, opened in the Kenyan capital Nairobi. In the same week too as Idai caused unimaginable levels of devastation, the Africa Climate Week conference got under way in Accra, Ghana.No doubt delegates at both conferences were again reminded that while Africa is responsible for only % of global greenhouse-gas emissions, climate change is considered to directly impact % of the African population.Those in any doubt that Africa is the continent that pays the highest price for this need only have tuned into breaking news reports of Idairsquos arrival to be reminded of what this means for millions of people.As environmental journalist Landry Ninteretse who leads the campaigning organisation Africa  has pointed out, for Africans ldquoclimate change is not a future risk, itrsquos already a reality evident in wrecked families, lands and livelihoods, and hopeless children and young people who have no choice but to seek a future by migrating.Perhaps those same cynics who complain about foreign aid and the ldquodeluge of migrants Europe faces should pause and consider this unrelenting impact of climate change. This, after all, is one of the prime reasons why so many of those plucked out of the seas or who drown trying to reach Europe are from the African subcontinent.Somewhere down the line you can be sure that Cyclone Idai and other disasters will send more on such perilous journeys.As Ninteretse says, Idai is just the latest reminder that everywhere on the African continent communities fear losing their land as each season hits one country after another with exceptional floods, unexpected storms and increasingly long droughts.It goes without saying thata tragedy of such gargantuan proportions as Idai occurred in the Western or ldquodeveloped world, then the response would be very dferent. Two vast cyclones named Trevor and Veronica are currently bearing down on the north coast of Australia and thousands have evacuated their homes in preparation for these two potentially devastating storms.Not for a moment to dismiss the suffering, destruction and potential loss of le these cyclones will bring to Australians, but itrsquos almost a certainty we will hear much more about their impact there than what has occurred in Africa this past week.Some will argue that it has always be thus, that there has been a huge disparity between how we handle humanitarian crises close to home or those that affect ldquorecognisable locations and how we process disasters that occur where.Butthere is one thing that the cycle of climate change and migration has shown us itrsquos that such humanitarian concerns are inextricably connected and transnational in nature affecting us all in one way or another wherever we might be.There are those who will argue that we cannot be sure that the likes of Idai was caused by climate change. But global experts agree that climate change certainly made it worse and point to three factors.First, warmer air temperatures mean more rain is held and then released. Idai produced nearly a yearrsquos worth of rain in just a few days, more than two feet in parts of the region.Second, the region has been suffering from sustained drought in recent years, itself a problem associated with climate change.As Unicef chief Henrietta Fore has pointed out, the water that has arrived has not drained. The hard, parched earth was unable to absorb water quickly, which has also increased the risk of flash flooding.Third, rising sea levels mean that storm surges such as those that engulfed the port city of Beira creating that ldquoinland sea are about a foot higher than a century ago having been fed by melting ice at the poles.ldquoCyclone Idai is a clear demonstration of the exposure and vulnerability of many low-lying cities and towns to sea-level rise as the impact of climate change continues to influence and disrupt normal weather patterns, said Mami Mizutori, the UNrsquos special representative for disaster risk reduction.For the moment though, on the ground, current relief efforts in coping with Idai ldquoare nowhere near the scale and magnitude of the problem, according to Elhadj As Sy, secretary-general of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.ldquoThe situation is simply horrendous. There is no other way to describe it, As Sy said after touring camps in Mozambique.ldquoThree thousand people who are living in a school that has  classrooms and six, only six, toilets. You can imagine how much we are sitting on a water and sanitation ticking bomb, he added, expressing the fear of many aid workers that disease is now the biggest threat.In neighbouring Zimbabwe and Malawi, meanwhile, the situation is also dire. In Zimbabwe, floods have affected an estimated , people, while in Malawi, , people are estimated displaced and , have been affected, according to the government.Across all three countries, many regions remain inaccessible and the death toll has now topped more than , but is almost certain to soar in the coming days.For aid agencies, access to potable drinking water, shelter, food, and healthcare are the priorities, they say, with water, sanitation and hygiene needs particularly urgent as the risk of waterborne diseases is the major concern across the board.ldquoIn Beira, we fear a huge cholera outbreak soon, said Caroline Rose of Medecins Sans Frontieres.ldquoThe main challenges will be getting treatment for people who donrsquot understand they have cholera, and that itrsquos urgent, or people who are not reachable, or people who cannot reach health centres, Rose confirmed.The arrival of Idai has once again brought home with devastating force issues and questions that affect us all.It has reminded us of the prevailing view among some that distant disasters are not our concern.Here in the UK, wersquove barely engaged with what has happened in Mozambique and its neighbours. As for those charity begins at home cynics, I know from long experience that their voices are those of the minority and by contrast the vast majority of ordinary people dig deep in their pockets and hearts when confronted by the suffering of their fellow human beings.Above all, Cyclone Idai has brought home again why we can no longer ignore the impact of climate change.In October , the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction released a report that highlighted the staggering financial impact of climate-related disasters.In the period  , disaster-hit countries reported direct economic losses of , billion of which climate-related disasters accounted for ,bn or  % of the total.Itrsquos a staggering figure and no, itrsquos not just in Africa and where that such an impact will be felt. As those among our younger generation have admirably been highlighting for weeks now in their school protests across the world, climate change is something that affects every one of us. Itrsquos time we all paid attention and followed their lead."},{"url":null,"title":"plan-to-make-scotland-a-green-energy-superpower-thanks-to-hydrogen","story":"The study lays the ground for Scotland to take full advantage of the hydrogen revolution. Renewable hydrogen would not only satisfy all our domestic energy needs, but it could also be exported. Until now itrsquos been impossible to properly store and export green energy.The Scottish economist and scientist who head up the new HIAlba-Idea think tank say Scotland could effectively fuel the proposed European supergrid, and generate so much money for the economy that the nation could establish a Sovereign Wealth Fund, as Norway did with North Sea oil. The UK failed to set up such a fund.HIAlba-Idea, the first think tank based in the Highlands, is run by the economist Professor Ronald MacDonald, and the mathematician, scientist and engineer Dr Donald MacRae. MacDonald is professor of macroeconomics at Glasgow Universityrsquos Adam Smith Business School. He has been a consultant adviser to the European Central Bank, the European Commission, the World Bank, the IMF and the UK National Audit Office. MacRae has held under-secretary positions in the Australian government and was a director with Australiarsquos Commonwealth Scientic and Industrial Research Organisation .MacRaersquos work with CSIRO is key to the blueprints which the think tank is releasing tomorrow ndash called Hydrogen Scotland: A Route to Export Powerhouse and Maximising Scotlandrsquos Wellbeing While Bravely Innovating. Australia has started to use solar power to develop renewable hydrogen.Hydrogen can be produced using solar, wave or wind power, and can then be used as a cheap, clean, plentul energy source, and exported for the first time. Some have described the process as bottling sunshine and wind.The new technology is being hailed as the solution to many of the Westrsquos environmental, economic and social problems. MacDonald says the energy revolution would solve the ldquotail-off in productivity of the Scottish and UK economy, which came about with the sht from manufacturing to services.Renewable hydrogen is ldquothe big transformative idea, he says, which would ldquotake us back to being a manufacturing economy and an export power house. He added: ldquoThe revolution is having this cheap, storable and transportable energy. MacRae called it ldquoa game-changer.MacDonald believes renewable hydrogen could lead to a ldquoHighland renaissance as many of the wind farms needed to create the new energy source would be located in the most rural parts of the country.Renewable hydrogen ldquocould easily equal the whole production of North Sea oil in terms of its potential benefits to the UK and Scotland, said MacDonald. ldquoWe could set up a Sovereign Wealth Fund as the Norwegians have done.While Scotland ndash and Orkney in particular ndash are making good progress with the technology, Australia has already created a ldquoroadmap for commercial use of renewable hydrogen. South Korea plans to convert its ,-strong fleet of buses to hydrogen, and Australia is eyeing the market for exports. Japan is also moving toward the use of more hydrogen vehicles.HIAlba-Idea is calling on the Holyrood Government and the big players in the oil industry, who want to move away from carbons to green energy, to work with them to create a Scottish roadmap. Norway is also starting to explore the exploitation of renewable hydrogen.With Europe ldquodesperate for energy independence, says MacRae, Scotland would be well placed to export renewable hydrogen to the continent.MacDonald said: ldquoClearly, a Europe self-sufficient in green energy would have implications that go beyond decarbonisation, including that of its security, since it would no longer need to be reliant on potentially hostile countries for its energy supplies.MacRae added: ldquoYou can imagine an energy-independent Europe, through power generated by Scotland going into a supergrid.He proposes storing green energy ndash it would be kept as ammonia, from which the hydrogen is extracted ndash on decommissioned North Sea oil rigs among forests of floating wind farms.MacDonald and MacRae say thatthe new industry is handled properly by the Government, Scotland could also become a centre for manufacturing and exporting the equipment and technology associated with renewable hydrogen, as well as a global hub for the financial services needed to fund it.ldquoFor Scotland, said MacRae, ldquoit has the potential to be a very signicant game-changer. In fact, there are so many innovations that spin off it that we are actually looking at it as a whole portfolio of opportunities. For Scotland, we are talking about something of immense signicance.MacDonald added: ldquoThe exciting part is the transformative effect on society and the economy. This is a breakthrough which could transcend anything  we are doing, thatrsquos how important it is.He added that the impact on global warming would be ldquoenormous. ldquoScotland on its own being completely carbon-free would probably make some impact, but it would be quite small. Butthe supergrid became a reality then that in itself could be revolutionary. This could be the pathway to making the whole of Europe green. He feels it would not be long before green supergrids spread across the globe.If Scotland took a lead in renewable hydrogen, the global clout that came with that would be ldquophenomenal.The HIAlba-Idea vision is that Scotland becomes one of the largest global energy exporters in the world ... through the low-cost extraction of hydrogen from renewably generated ammonia used as a storage medium and carrier of hydrogen.The think tank says: ldquoOffshore ammonia production on disused oil rigs serving offshore wind farms could be stored for periods of low wind. In this way, the continuous production of renewable electricity is guaranteed.In its ldquo vision for energy, the Scottish Government did look at the role of hydrogen in the national energy mix. ldquoHowever, it neither envisions it as a major export industry nor considers the role of renewable ammonia in achieving this outcome, it notes.The renewable energy entrepreneur Eddie OrsquoConnor is advocating a single European energy market connected by a supergrid. ldquoAn interconnected energy market based on renewable energy linked by a supergrid will deliver cheap power to consumers and enable us all to meet our climate goals, he said.KELP, HEMP AND PLASTIC-EATING SHIPS: THE OTHER BIG IDEASFOR THE SCOTTISH ECONOMY IN THE ST CENTURYA GREEN energy revolution is just the biggest idea on the table when it comes to the future of the Scottish economy.Professor Ronald MacDonald and his colleague Dr Donald MacRae have some other revolutionary plans, including autonomous self-fuelled ships. These would clean up plastic in the oceans and turn the waste into a biofuel produced onboard. This would power the ships - and be pollution free.Seaweed could also be the crop of the future, with a growing market in the world for kelp, including vegan foods, beer, healthcare products, eco-friendly packaging and cosmetics.The use of off-shore rigs for the production of renewable hydrogen could also stimulate the seaweed industry. HIAlba-Idea suggests lsquooperating large-scale seaweed harvesting operations in conjunction with disused oil rigs and associated offshore wind farms established for offshore ammonia productionrsquo.lsquoSteel cables strung between wind turbine mountings and disused oil rigs [could] provide an ideal seaweed growing and harvesting zone.rsquoWith crofts working to run wind farms and the renewable hydrogen sector, farms would have the money to use lsquodrones and robotised farming practicesrsquo. Hemp - now seen as a superfood - could be grown on crofts and sold globally as hemp oil, hemp chocolate and hemp milk.If rural areas are able to grow in wealth, the University of the Highlands and Islands could establish mini-campuses in burgeoning communities - increasing the population and economy."},{"url":null,"title":"school-league-tables-comment-this-is-not-the-true-measure-of-our-schools","story":"Each year I get upset about them on behalf of all the headteachers and teachers across the city who work so hard to ensure that Glasgowrsquos young people achieve regardless of their background.As a maths teacher and former HM Inspector, I understand fully the limitations of drawing conclusions from just one statistic.

This is a time for cool heads. But we absolutely do need to focus on the task at hand and thats making sure that we get the maximum possible support for the Prime Minister and her deal.\"Read more:Brexit too heavy for devolution to bear and new constitutional settlement neededMr Lidington, Mrs Mayrsquos de facto deputy, who said he had no time for plotters, told reporters in his Aylesbury constituency: ldquoI dont think Ive any wish to take over from the PM, [who] is doing a fantastic job.The two senior ministers were among a number, past and present, who were summoned by Mrs May to her country retreat of Chequers to thrash out a possible last-gasp way forward as her twice-rejected deal looks odds-on to be defeated by MPs for a third and terminal time this week.Among those present were several senior Brexiteers: Boris Johnson, the former Foreign Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Chairman of the Conservative Eurosceptic faction of the European Research Group Dominic Raab, the former Brexit Secretary David Davis, his predecessor in the role and Iain Duncan Smith, the former party leader.Also in attendance were Brandon Lewis, the Tory Chairman, Julian Smith, the Chief Whip, and Stephen Barclay, the Brexit Secretary.Read more:Devolution  years on and Scottish Government ministers still feel ignored by Whitehall, says reportAfterwards, a No  spokesman issued a short statement, saying: ldquoThe PM and a number of Government ministers met today at Chequers for y talks with senior colleagues about delivering Brexit. The meeting discussed a range of issues, including whether there is sufficient support in the Commons to bring back a meaningful vote this week.The continuing Tory turmoil followed a march for a Peoplersquos Vote in London on Saturday, which organisers estimated had involved around one million people, and as the online petition to scrap Brexit altogether topped five million signatures.This morning Mrs May is expected to have a showdown with her critics when she chairs what will be a fiery emergency Cabinet meeting in Downing St to seeshe can save her deal.Later, she will give a Commons statement on last weekrsquos European Council when the EU seized control of the Brexit timetable, giving Britain a delayed exit day of May MPs passed the PMrsquos plan this week or April they did not.Read more:Analysis: Mays deal is dead, time for Westminster to seize spirit of compromise - quicklyFollowing the statement, MPs will take part in another ldquonext steps debate and are expected to vote on an amendment tabled by Labourrsquos Hilary Benn and the Conservativesrsquo Oliver Letwin to enable so-called ldquoindicative votes on ious Brexit alternatives to take place on Wednesday such a move was defeated by just two votes last week but seems almost certain to get through this time round.The alternative options will include a Norway-style deal, a Canada-style trade deal, a Peoplersquos Vote, a no-deal and revocation.However, Mr Barclay cast doubt that the Government would accept any option that received a majority, stressing it ldquowould not be binding legally and that potentially it could cause a ldquoconstitutional collision with the Tory manesto.He explained such a scenario could risk sparking a general electionParliament instructed the Government to ldquodo something it was not elected to do.Last weekrsquos politically turbulent week appears for some to have shted the landscape dramatically and yet the PM faces a potentially even more fraught one this week given the backdrop now of MPs openly calling for her to resign. The financial markets could see sterling take a tumble.One Cabinet minister said: ldquoThe end is nigh. She wonrsquot be PM in  daysrsquo time while another noted how her judgement had ldquostarted to go haywire.In one remarkable development, a senior whip was said to have told Mrs May to her face that she should go because she was ldquobetraying Brexit and ldquodestroying our party.Nicky Morgan, the pro-EU former Education Secretary, urged ministers to tell the PM \"its time to go\" while leading Brexiteer Steve Baker said potential leadership contenders in the Government should \"act now\".George Freeman, Mrs Mays former policy adviser claimed it was \"all over for the PM\", tweeting: \"Shes done her best. But across country you can see anger. Everyone feels betrayed. Governments gridlocked. Trust in democracy collapsing. This cant go on. We need new PM who can reach out [and] build some sort of coalition for Plan B.\"Philip Hammond hit back. The Chancellor decried colleagues for their disloyalty, telling Sky Newsrsquos Sophy Ridge on Sunday: \"We have just over two weeks to complete this process before we get to April , the new deadline the Council has set last week. To be talking about changing the players on the board frankly is self-indulgent at this time.\"He went on: \"Changing prime minister wouldnt help us, changing the party in Government wouldnt help us: weve got to address the question of what type of Brexit is acceptable to Parliament, what type of way forward Parliament can agree on so that we can avoid what would be an economic catastrophe of a no-deal exit and also what would be a very big challenge to confidence in our political systemwe didnt exit at all.\"While he stressed he continued to support the PMrsquos deal, Mr Hammond also said that MPs had to look to compromise on the way forward and, interestingly, described a second EU poll as a ldquoperfectly coherent proposition.Mr Duncan Smith possibly gave Mrs May a reason to hope her deal might sneak through when the Scot, who has twice voted against it, said he was ldquokeeping my options open.The former party leader also decried those Cabinet ministers briefing against the PM, saying it was ldquoappalling and ldquodisgusting and suggested they should be sacked.Lord Howard, another ex-Tory leader, who has opposed Mrs Mayrsquos deal, said he had now reluctantly concluded that, on an assessment of risk, he was supporting it becauseit did not go through, then the country would be faced with a withdrawal ldquomuch further away from the kind of Brexit I wanthellipand possibly even no Brexit at all.One Scottish Tory MP stressed that the Chequers meeting was crucial as getting Mrs Mayrsquos deal through at the third attempt would only happen with the support of Brexiteers and Northern Irelandrsquos Democratic Unionists.ldquoShe may have to state very clearly what her timetable is for stepping down before they will even begin to consider voting for the agreement. She can still be PM and get the Withdrawal Agreement and Bill away but itrsquos pretty clear to me that she is going to have to step down from the leadership so that the Government can be reset for the next phase of the negotiations.He added: ldquoIrsquod like her to be allowed the respect of leaving office with dignity she deserves that."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-parliament-should-have-role-in-developing-post-eu-laws","story":"MSPs have called for the opportunity to scrutinise and agree on all policy areas, rather than having them ldquoimposed on devolved governments.Holyroodrsquos Finance  Constitution Committee has been examining the issue of ldquocommon frameworks ndash establishing policy and regulatory approaches which are currently controlled by the European Union.:Mike Russell: Brexit should lead to independence for ScotlandThe committee has identied  areas of EU law as falling within the devolved competence of the Scottish Parliament in addition to  reserved areas subject to ongoing discussions between the UK and devolved governments.Finance and Constitution Committee convener Bruce Crawford MSP said: ldquoIf the UK exits from the EU, under whatever terms, common frameworks will be required to deliver common policy and regulatory approaches in some areas currently governed by the EU.ldquoThe parliaments and assemblies of the UK are key to providing transparency, scrutiny and accountability, so wersquore firmly of the view that the Scottish Parliament should have a formal role in relation to the process for developing, agreeing and implementing legislative and non-legislative common frameworks.ldquoWe strongly believe that common frameworks must be arrived at through agreement and not imposed.Scottish Greens constitution spokesman Patrick Harvie MSP said: ldquoIt beggars belief, in the week we were supposed to be leaving the EU, that wersquore still missing vital detail on how things will work between dferent parts of the UKBrexit does go ahead.ldquoOnce again, it shows how the devolved nations have been ignored throughout.ldquoThe report also shines a light on the risks which will comethe Brexiteersrsquo deregulation agenda is inflicted on our social and environmental protections.

In the s, his predecessors in the conservative government then regarded our fishermen as expendable. It is beginning to look like this government has taken the same attitude towards our farmers.”Responding on behalf of the government parliamentary under-secretary of state for exiting the European Union, Chris Heaton-Harris MP, replied: “I disagree entirely. The tarf schedule is designed to protect every sector of the economy including agriculture. He then went on to talk about standards, and we are not dropping standards of what we expect in agricultural goods.”Speaking after the exchange, Mr Carmichael added: “The minister can disagree with me all he wants, but he can’t dismiss the views of our farmers and crofters. They know what they are talking about and have genuine concerns about whether food standards will be eroded as a result of cheaper imports. The government must start listening to the experts in this area, and the unions who work on their behalf otherwise we risk undermining an important part of our rural economy.“With only nine days left before we could find ourselves falling into a no deal scenario, the government have got to fix these tarf schedules before they do irreparable damage to our agriculture industry.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However, Prospect has indicated that this would not be its members’ preferred option and it does not believe it would address their underlying pay issues.“As it stands the claim from the trade union remains a minimum of a double-digit increase effective from April , . A report compiled jointly between HIAL and Prospect on air traffic controller pay at non-HIAL airports found no evidence of a signicant pay dferential with other comparable airports.“At this point, it has not been possible to reach an agreement with the trade union on their pay dispute. Therefore, HIAL and Prospect have agreed to refer the matter to ACAS in a bid to resolve the matter.”However, David Avery, Prospect negotiations officer replied: #Members demands are reasonable and they need to be addressed. They are not seeking parity with Heathrow or Gatwick but other smaller airports.#“They have received a decade of below inflation pay rises while the rest of the industry, in response to a global shortage of controllers, has moved ahead. The company already struggles to recruit controllers and this is having an impact on services at some airports.“By asking for support from ACAS we hope to find a way forward in these talks. However ministers’ instructions to HIAL severely limit the companies negotiating position, so we also need to see these revoked.”As it stands, controllers at seven of HIAL’s eleven sites, including Kirkwall Airport, are due to take strike action on Friday, April .Industrial action short of a strike was also likely to start in April and continue through until August, and include instruction to work to rosters, refusal of non-medical extensions, an overtime ban, and withdrawal of goodwill.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Representatives from the commission are due to come to Orkney next month to discuss the proposals.Speaking yesterday, Ronnie Hinds, chairman of the commission, said: “We are pleased to begin our consultation on electoral arrangements with the three councils today and I look forward to engaging with them on our proposals.#It is important that electoral arrangements for Scottish councils are effective and that our proposals deliver on requirements for electoral parity and, as far as possible, take account of local ties and special geographical considerations.“We also welcome the flexibility offered by the IslandsAct to use one or two member wards and have used this flexibility as appropriate in our proposals. After completion of our consultation with councils we will be seeking public views on our proposals over the summer.”The  Review of Electoral Arrangements will make proposals for the six council areas specied in the IslandsAct  – Argyll and Bute, Highland, North Ayrshire, Na h-Eileanan an Iar, Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands.The commission is conducting the review in two phases, focusing firstly on Na h-Eileanan an Iar, Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands, with the reviews of  Argyll and Bute, Highland and North Ayrshire to take place after the public consultation in the islands groups takes place.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Those behind the charity said it is well-known that men find it harder to admit to problems and seek help at an early stage, but the camaraderie of the Men’s Shed is helping to overcome this resistance.Despite the success of Orkney Men’s Shed and the growing popularity of the movement across Scotland, Mr McArthur suggested that they remain a “largely unsung success story”.  The MSP described the work the organisation does as “le-changing” for its members, providing a sense of purpose and an opportunity to make friends and share company.Speaking after the debate, Mr McArthur said: “The Men’s Shed movement has been a tremendous success over recent years with the number of Sheds and ‘Shedders’ across the country continuing to grow. This is illustrated perfectly in Orkney, where the local Men’s Shed is going from strength to strength, with membership up to  and plans for expansion of the shed in Finstown.“Every Men’s Sheds is dferent, of course, but all provide a place to work and relax, pursue hobbies, share skills, have a cuppa and a chat and get practical help with projects. This should not disguise, however, the real impact Men’s Sheds can and do have. Increasingly it is recognised that these facilities make a tangible dference in efforts to tackle loneliness, social isolation and mental ill health.“Last month, I urged the government to look at the case for allowing Men’s Sheds to bid in for health and wider social care funding. This is the approach in Australia, where the movement started, and there are strong arguments for assessingthe same might be done in this country. This could help sustain and expand Men’s Sheds, providing more people in Scotland with the chance to access the many benefits they deliver”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Coagulants such as alumare used to trap impurities in raw water by binding them together to form particles before they are filtered out. Fluoride occurs naturally and is not added to the water supply in Scotland. Researchers say there is some evidence that it increases the human absorption of aluminium. Study author, Dr Tom Russ from the Alzheimer Scotland Dementia Research Centre at the University of Edinburgh, stressed that the low levels of aluminium and fluoride found in the water in Scotland were “very good” in relation to World Health Organisation guidelines. “Everybody included in the study was alive in  and they were all born in ,” he said. “Everybody who subsequently died with dementia was compared with those who died without, and the people who lived in areas of higher levels of aluminium in drinking water were more likely to die than those in areas where the aluminium levels were lower. “We still see this well accepted finding that higher levels of aluminium in particular are associated with an increased risk of dementia. It’s confirmatory rather than anything .”The study published in the British Journal Of Psychiatry, obtained water quality data from the Drinking Water Quality Regulator for Scotland for the years -. The DWQR is responsible for regulating public water supplied by Scottish Water, which was established in . Prior to this water quality was the responsibility of separate local authorities.

Mr Cole-Hamilton said: “The police were worried the abuse I was receiving was getting increasingly dark and aggressive.“They agreed with parliament they would beef up security, so my staff and I have been given personal attack alarms. They are more than just noise-makers - they connect directly to a control room andI activate it, it immediately starts transmitting audio to the control room so they can hear what’s going on andneeds be they will summon the police. It also detects a sudden drop, likeyou’re knocked down, and they ring to check everything’s okay andyou don’t pick up they will send the police.”He said he did not make complaints to the police about the abuse he received. “I think the police have far better things to be doing with their time.“But I think there is a responsibility on Twitter to police more effectively the abusive political stuff that comes through.”The increased security followed the abuse Mr Cole-Hamilton received after responding to a tweet by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in December . She had compared the “open, inclusive, internationalist Scottish independence movement” with “insular, inward-looking blue passport-obsessed nonsense”.He replied: “This is the same civic, inclusive independence movement which repeatedly castigates my English origins, flips out about flags on strawberry boxes, and smashes up tea cakes with a hammer, yes ”He was sent messages calling him a “c***” and “Judas rat”, threatening his parents, and accusing him of bending “both legs to the English Crown”.He said anti-English abuse directed at him was “relatively rare”. But he said abusive posts often followed criticism he made of the Scottish Government.“If I land a blow metaphorically particularly against the case for independence, that usually brings several days of abuse. I don’t really see very much of it any more because I’ve muted all these people. but my staff will say ‘You got a real torrent’.”But he insisted: “They are not going to frighten me. I’m not going to stop saying the things I’m saying I’m an opposition MSP - it’s my role to challenge government, to scrutinise government policy and point out its flaws and inadequacies, including independence.“And when I get that kind of abuse it actually makes me all the more determined.

That would be preferable to crashing out with no deal.”Speaking to the BBC’s Andrew Marr show shortly before joining a m-strong march through London for a second EU referendum on Saturday, Ms Sturgeon also backed a so-called People’s Vote.“The government has absolutely failed to deliver on the result of the  referendum.“They have no credible way forward now and when parliament and government fails, it seems to me that the only sensible thing to do is put the people back in charge.”Reports suggest the Prime Minister could be ousted by her cabinet as soon as Monday with Conservative MPs in open revolt over plans for indicative votes and a deal to delay Brexit by at least two weeks.“I’m telling her to go,” Ms Sturgeon said. “I think she’s been part of the problem for some considerable time.“I thinkwe were in any normal period in British politics, she would be long gone.”The First Minister added: “I think she is effectively out of power right now, and I think debating her position is becoming more and more incidental by the day.“What’s important now is that the House of Commons seizes control, and does so next week.”Ms Sturgeon did not clary when she would set out plans for a second Scottish independence referendum, which have been promised for the past six months.“I think another Scottish independence referendum is going to happen,” she said.: Nicola Sturgeon to reveal independence referendum plan after Brexit talks“Nothing in this le is absolutely inevitable, but I think it’s as inevitable as its possible to be.“Before I set out a path forward for Scotland I think it’s reasonable for me know what the starting point for that journey is going to be, and the context in which were going to be embarking on it.“We need to know, and hopefully we’re going to know this in the next few days, and the next three weeks: is the UK leaving the EU, is it leaving with a deal, is it leaving with no deal or is it not leaving at all, perhaps looking at another [EU] referendum.“But the experience of the last three years, Scotland’s vote ignored, the voice of the Scottish Parliament ignored, all of the consequences that flow from Brexit completely outwith our control, that really does make the case for independence very, very powerfully.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon calls on mps to seize control of brexit from beleaguered theresa may","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Nicola Sturgeon has called on MPs in Parliament to seize control of Brexit from a beleaguered Theresa May, as she joined an estimated one million campaigners in London demanding a second referendum.It came as it emerged that opposition MPs working to secure a second EU referendum are now in talks with Conservatives who are prepared to clear the way for a People’s Vote as the pressure grows on the Prime Minister.The Scottish First Minister joined London mayor Sadiq Khan, Labour deputy leader Tom Watson and former Tory Cabinet ministers as she addressed supporters of a second vote on Brexit in a rally outside Parliament yesterday after a march through the streets of London. Organisers claim up to one million took part. The EU has agreed to extend the UK’s originally scheduled departure this Friday, but with May’s deal poised to be rejected again, the situation remains mired in uncertainty.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s absence from the People’s Vote march yesterday was widely criticised and underlined the lack of consensus on a way forward on the constitutional impasse.Sturgeon received widespread cheers as she addressed the campaigners in Parliament Square yesterday afternoon. “Parliament should take back control,” she said.“Scotland – the land where more than  per cent of people voted to remain in the European Union – our voice has been ignored.”Sturgeon added: “Today we make our voices heard. And what our voices are saying loudly and clearly is this: Put it back to the people.”Watson was the only senior Labour figure at the rally and pledged to back a People’s Vote, amid concerns that Corbyn remains unconvinced. “We are one million strong,” Watson said.“Prime Minister, you’ve lost control of this process, you’re plunging the country into chaos, let the people take control.”Khan said it was “time to withdraw Article ”.He added: “it’s time to give us, the British people, a final say on Brexit.”Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson joined protesters, along with senior Tories Dominic Grieve and Justine Greening, as well as Anna Soubry of the recently founded Independent Group at Westminster and Green MP Caroline Lucas.The House of Commons may get the opportunity to vote on a second referendum this week, despite a recent Commons vote which saw the proposalheavily defeated by  votes to , when Labour abstained.However, even with every Labour MP voting in favour, the bid for a new referendum would have failed, meaning Conservative opponents of a People’s Vote must be convinced to change their minds, or at least abstain, for it to have any hope of being approved by Parliament.Senior figures in the SNP and Labour said they have spoken to Tories who previously rejected a People’s Vote, but are now willing to allow it to pass the Commons.SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said a number of Conservative MPs had privately told him they supported a second EU referendum, but would only vote in favour once Labour is committed and a People’s Vote is likely to win Commons approval.“It is the right thing to do to go back to the people, and I actually believe thatwe had that unity across the opposition benches, that would put pressure on a number of Conservatives,” Blackford said.“A number of Conservatives say they want that to happen as well, but they do that privately, but they won’t break publicly.”Opposition leaders met with Corbyn this week and emerged disappointed, saying he insisted that a public vote could only be calledLabour’s proposed Brexit deal was on the ballot.A senior Labour MP told Scotland on Sunday that the internal battle over a second referendum was being won by shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer and shadow chancellor John McDonnell, who back a People’s Vote, over Corbyn and his official spokesman, Seumas Milne – both of whom hold Eurosceptic views.“When it comes to a People’s Vote, it’s Starmer and McDonnell vs Milne and Corbyn. Bit by bit, we’re shting things slowly inside the party so that their views are irrelevant and their position becomes untenable,” said the frontbench MP.They added: “There are Conservative MPs I’ve spoken to who will abstain when it comes to another vote.

It’s compulsive. Punters may struggle with the latest twists and turns of the actual Brexit process, but we know where we are with plots, conspiracies, egos, competitors and rivals. So this weekend, that’s what we got.The London-based, Brexit-supporting Sunday press portrayed the Prime Ministerial wrestling match as Game of Thrones minus the hair extensions. Sure, the replacement line-up was underwhelming and the “personalities” either self-indulgent loons or zipped-up bureaucrats. But ramped-up talk of daggers at dawn sells papers and serves to distract from the dangerous vacuum of leadership and national purpose at the centre of British politics. It’s a bit like the vacuous speculation of football punditry. Or sitting at the back of the classroom watching someone  get into trouble. Who doesn’t get caught up in this newspaper-induced frenzy of distraction Yet to be honest, who really cares  Or perhaps more accurately, who thinks the political demise of Theresa May or speculation about her replacements are the most important stories in Britain now  Would a new hand on the tiller change the doomy vibe  True -a Brexiteer captured the top job, Theresa May’s unloved deal might suddenly look palatable to the DUP and ERG, and -- wrappedin some strong-man words about tough negotiating stances on future trade deals - might just stumble through the Commons on a third meaningful vote.Hooray. All that gets us to is the first, small landing on a vertiginous flight of stairs laden with a fudged deal, that’s worse in every respect than full EU membership, except for the fig leaf of political sovereignty it hands to whatever broken Tory leader is around to collect.Still, that prospect remains a long way off. So was talk of succession really the hottest Brexit news of the weekend Or was talk of coups, successors and men in grey suits deliberately spun and timed to obscure the really big stories of the weekend.One – the People’s Vote march with a whopping one to two million participants. Two – the Revoke Article  petition with a very whopping five million plus signatures. Just as Theresa May’s meltdown and car-crash TV address became a real turning point in public, Tory party and EU opinion last week, so the size and energy of the People’s Vote campaign and wider Remain movement this weekend prove the  per cent are back on the front foot – even without support from the leader of the Opposition. That’s quite a feat, and could yet change the dynamics of the remaining Brexit saga. A series of un-whipped indicative votes may be held in the Commons today or tomorrow – a laudable opening up of options. Although Theresa May regularly asserts that Norway Plus and a People’s Vote have already been voted on and rejected by the House, neither were free votes. If Tory MPs had supported a second referendum, the whip would have been withdrawn, effectively expelling them from the party and forcing them to sit meantime as independent MPs. Very few Tory MPs have been brave enough to contemplate that – so far.A free vote could change all that, but is still fraught with dficulty. Since the plodding old House of Commons finds it impossible to use transferable votes even in a crisis situation, the order of voting will be all-important. It’s entirely possible MPs will vote against their second and third preferred options, hoping their favourite outcome wins the backing of the House, only to discover that it fails but there’s no going back to rearrange voting preferences. If such a shambolic but predictable failure to capture real voting intent occurs, MPs could soon be back with the same limited choice that faced them last week – Theresa May’s deal or no deal. Except that now, courtesy of six Scots parliamentarians who’ve demonstrated the capacity to crowd-fund, think ahead, act together and ignore intimidation from all sides, the Commons has another option -- to revoke article , halt the Brexit process, decide what to do politically thereafter and, in all probability, save lives.According to one Scottish MP, a nurse in central Scotland wrote last week “We use so many specialised drugs in paediatrics and we’re breaking our budget hoarding what we can. But drugs have such short shelf lives it’s utterly pointless. We also worry about our incredible specialists and surgeons leaving the country. My job is hard enough, but I might as well become an undertaker at this rate.”If MPs are running out of road to avoid such a crisis by April th, pressing the Revoke button could make a lot of sense. Of course, no-one will ever give due credit to the politicians who made that escape route possible. As Joanna Cherry MPobserved last week “Theresa May has sought to marginalise Scotland throughout the Brexit process, so it’s a rich irony that Scottish Parliamentarians and the Scottish courts have offered the UK the leline it needs to escape the mess she has created.”It’s an irony that won’t be lost on Scots. A Revoke petition signatory said this weekend “Signing was the first time I’ve felt I have a say in what happens since June .” As those who remember the late momentum behind Yes in  can testy, that’s a heady feeling. And once it becomes clear that Revoke doesn’t lessen the chances of a second indyref, numbers signing up are likely to grow. And that’s the real story of the weekend – not blethers about the dissolving grip of Theresa May.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"theresa may faces her cabinet amid speculation of coup plot","story":"Theresa May will face an emergency Cabinet meeting today amid talk of a coup plot to oust her from Downing Street and install a caretaker Prime Minister to shepherd a Brexit deal through Parliament.Mrs May’s de-facto deputy David Lidington was forced to deny reports that he was being lined up to succeed her, with ministers Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt also named as possible interim Tory leaders.With MPs set to mount a bid to take control of the House of Commons order paper today and force votes on alternative Brexit plans, Chancellor Philip Hammond cast doubt on the Government’s ability to ever pass its own agreement with Brussels.Mr Hammond also became the first Cabinet minister to suggest a second EU referendum could take place, saying it was a “perfectly coherent position” for MPs to consider.As speculation about a leadership coup reached fever pitch, Mr Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, said: “I don’t think that I’ve any wish to take over from the PM, who I think is doing a fantastic job.“I tell you this: one thing that working closely with the Prime Minister does is cure you completely of any lingering shred of ambition to want to do that task.I have absolute admiration for the way she is going about it.”The Sunday Times reported that  Cabinet ministers want Mrs May to make way for someone  and that Mr Lidington was in line to take over.But the Mail on Sunday said Brexiteer ministers were plotting to install Mr Gove, the Environment Secretary, as a caretaker leader.Mrs May’s former policy adviser, MP George Freeman, said it was “all over for the PM”, tweeting: “She’s done her best. But across the country you can see the anger.“Everyone feels betrayed. Government’s gridlocked. Trust in democracy collapsing. This can’t go on.”Tory backbencher Anne-Marie Trevelyan wrote in the Sunday : “We now need a leader who believes in our country and wants to take her on the next stage of her journey.”As she tries to cling on to her job at the start of a decisive week for both her deal and for opponents seeking to stop Brexit, the Prime Minister met backbench Brexiteers at her country retreat. Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab, Jacob Rees-Mogg, David Davis, Iain Duncan Smith and Steve Baker were all invited for talks at Chequers yesterday.Mr Hammond accused MPs allegedly trying to oust the Prime Minister of being “self-indulgent”. He told Sky’s Ridge on Sunday programme that replacing Mrs May would not “solve the problem”.But he risked adding fuel to the isions among the Conservatives by saying a second EU referendum “deserves to be considered along with the other proposals” put to a vote this week.“One way or another, Parliament is going to have the opportunity this week to decide what it is in favour of, and I hope that it will take that opportunity –it can’t get behind the Prime Minister’s deal – to say clearly and unambiguously what it can get behind,” he said.And with Downing Street still refusing to commit to bringing its own Brexit deal back to the Commons, Mr Hammond was downbeat about securing enough votes to pass it, saying: “I’m realistic that we may not be able to get a majority for the Prime Minister’s deal andthat is the case then Parliament will have to decide not just what it’s against, but what it is for.”Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay raised the prospect of a general electionMPs take control of parliamentary proceedings and try to force through a Brexit that is at odds with government policy.Mr Barclay said a “constitutional collision” in a series of “indicative votes” on alternative Brexit plans could result in a snap vote.A series of votes on up to seven Brexit outcomes – including revoking Article  and holding a second EU referendum – are expected by Wednesday, with backbenchers and government ministers proposing them as a solution to the deadlock.But Mr Barclay told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show: “If an amendment goes through where Parliament takes control of the order paper, then that leaves open the door to Parliament then legislating to take no-deal off the table.“And that is something that Brexiteers like me would see as a massive risk to Brexit becauseBrexiteers and Parliament votes against the deal and also votes to take no-deal off the table then the only option is to then have European parliamentary elections.”Mr Barclay saidthe Commons takes control of the order paper and votes for a dferent outcome, it would “potentially collide with fundamental commitments the Government has given in their manesto”, though he said the vote itself would not be binding.He said: “What Parliament has done is vote for a number of contradictory things so we would need to untangle that but ultimately, at its logical conclusion, the risk of a general election increases because you potentially have a situation where Parliament is instructing the executive to do something that is counter to what it was elected to do.”Meanwhile a parliamentary petition calling for Article  to be revoked reached five million signatures.The SNP’s leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, said his party would back attempts to impose indicative votes on the Government.“It would be an assault on democracyTheresa May chooses to ignore the will of Parliament on this week’s Brexit votes,” he said. “The Prime Minister has completely lost control of the Government, her own MPs and this Brexit process. It’s time for Parliament to take charge and put an end to this shambles.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"royal mile treasure trove of mary queen of scots documents found","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...A treasure trove of documents signed by Mary Queen of Scots and revealing the #everyday reality of ruling the country# in the th century has been unearthed in a council storage facility on the Royal Mile.A haul of handwritten papers is said to show the doomed monarch “carefully managing the busy commercial le of Edinburgh”, as well as authorising the building of new defences for the city in Leith.The documents, which are set to be the centrepiece of a new exhibition in Edinburgh on Mary’s short-lived rule, have already been conserved and digitised to allow them to be viewed publicly on the council’s online archive. They were discovered by staff in a store at the Museum of Edinburgh, just a few hundred yards away from the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where Mary ruled for six years after ing from France in . The  documents, which are inidually dated, numbered and signed, relate to the rights of deacons and tradesmen in the city, the selling of meat at the Tolbooth and the making of salt in Newhaven.Early conservation work on the documents, which were recently discovered in the Museum of Edinburgh’s own storage facility off the Canongate, has revealed watermarks – one of a goat and another of a flower – which can only been seen when held up to light.It is thought the papers entered the archives of the local authority in the s, but were then “lost” before being rediscovered nearly a century later during conservation work. Intriguingly, some of the documents signed by Mary date from when she was still in France.Experts in the council’s museums and galleries service, which is responsible for the official archives of the city, said the recently unearthed documents revealed an “often overlooked “ aspect of her le.History curator Vicky Garrington said: “Together, the documents shed light on a key part of Scotland’s past. We all know the tragic story of Mary Queen of Scots, her eventful le and eventual execution in , but in these documents we see a dferent side to Mary.“Here, she can be seen carefully managing the everyday affairs of Edinburgh, both from France and Scotland. It’s fascinating to think of her reading through these official papers before carefully applying her signature.“They are staying in storage at the museum for now. But we hope to have them assessed by a conservator and for further research to be done on them by experts on Mary, after which we hope to exhibit them, which will be hugely exciting.”Museums and galleries manager Frank Little said: “We’re constantly reviewing, caring for and researching our collections, and look forward to sharing more of the city’s rich heritage with residents and visitors through our programme of exhibitions and online activities.” Council culture convener Donald Wilson said: “Our museums and galleries hold thousands of historic treasures, many of which are on display in our venues.

They then went on to highlight some of the key tenets underpinning the debate such as trade agreements, law and immigration, before making their concluding statements.In the opening gambit for the pro-Brexit team, S pupil Abbi Morgan argued that leaving the EU #would be a hugely positive thing for the UK# and would allow the country to #take control of borders and create worldwide trade agreements#.She went on to add that it would put the UK in a position to #take back its sovereignty# and make its own decisions on important matters.

They also felt the pupils were cohesive as a team and said that they saw some future MSPs and MPs.In the end, the judges awarded the team speaking against Brexit  points while the side advocating Brexit received  to claim victory.Skye, Lochaber, and Badenoch MSP Kate Forbes and Highland and Islands MSP Edward Mountain both fielded questions on Brexit after the debate and were quick to praise the pupils for their efforts.Ms Forbes said: #I certainly think they could have resolved Brexit faster than some of the politicians today # an absolutely fantastic debate based on fact, evidence, respect for each other, lots of confidence.

From pizza to pasta, Italian food is right up there with so many people’s tastebuds.As a lover of all things Italian, I was hugely excited when the Balmoral Hotel recently started their ‘Italian Night’, available every Tuesday night from -pm. I am no stranger to the thriving Black’s Road establishment and given the quality of food available in the Lady Anne Bistro and the conjoining Stix # Stones, the special-themed night attracted me to pay a visit once again to the Balmoral last Tuesday night.As ever, we were greeted by a polite and accommodating member of staff on arrival and shown to our table. I was immediately drawn by the décor – a number of Italian flags scattered around the restaurant and a huge blazing fire which was the perfect welcoming as Storm Gareth continued to rage outside.The themed-menu consists of a range of dishes sought to bring out the authentic taste of Italy and I couldn’t wait to peruse my choices. From pizzas to lasagne and pasta, there looked to be something for everyone, with gluten-free options also available.Before we had made our choice, we were presented with a large plate of Italian antipasti – basically a mixture of famous Italian nibbles. Much to my surprise, this is a complimentary touch from the Balmoral on the Italian night, designed to delve you into the full authentic Italian experience straight away.I gazed excitedly at my partner across the table. Where would we start  There were sticks of garlic bread, doughballs, pepperoni, olives and a pasta salad. Add in some jalapenos, peppers with a mouth-watering vinaigrette and mozzarella, it was a sublime clash of flavours which made me feel right in… well Italy! It reminded me much like a version of Spanish Tapas or Chinese Dim Sum which allows for iety and quantity of dferent options. With quality too, the night was off to a flyer with this beautul antipasti starter.On to the main course and after the wonderful starter, me and my partner could not wait for it to arrive. We both went for pizza, and to be honest it would be hard not to given the mouth-watering choices on the menu. A superb handcrafted gourmet pizza range, inidually designed with the finest ingredients for your own authentic taste of Italy – it was simply a no-brainer.After much deliberation, I opted for the BBQ Pizza, which consisted of a BBQ sauce base, mozzarella, chorizo, peri-peri chicken, jalapenos, onions and sweetcorn. Drizzled with just amount the peri-peri sauce, it was a concoction of flavours. A thin-base is always a must for me in order to properly enjoy what is actually on the pizza, instead of having to chew excessive amounts of pizza dough and again this pizza ticked all the right boxes. A BBQ-base and chicken on a pizza is nothing out of the ordinary on a pizza menu but this one was unique, given the intense flavour from the peri-peri sauce. This pizza would put some “Italian” pizza takeaways to shame, quite frankly. It was that good.Across the table, my partner, who is a vegetarian is no stranger to a good old pizza, after all it is entirely possible to enjoy the classic Italian dish without any meat at all. The menu includes a fantastic make-your-own option from an ingredient list with everything you can think of on it, allowing you to be as adventurous as you like. She went for a classic tomato base complete with mozzarella and a generous helping of sweetcorn, peppers and jalapenos. The pizza looked like a veggie’s delight and again it could not be faulted. Not too heavy on the stomach and full of flavour, it was little surprise she deliberately wanted to keep a few slices to take home.The pizzas also allow for additional sides, and it wouldn’t be an Italian night without some Garlic Bread. I simply adore anything garlic and this was what garlic bread should be like – oozing with garlic butter as it was torn apart, you could tell it was handcrafted and homemade to perfection. Our additional side of garlic potatoes also trumped the other side options of skinny fries or a tossed salad. It was a carbs heaven evening overall but worth it for the quality and taste of the food we enjoyed.A packed Tuesday night in the Lady Anne Bistro could only mean other diners, like ourselves, were enjoying the authentic Italian-themed menu on offer. It was something very unique and to their credit, the wonderful team of chefs and staff at the Balmoral are pulling it off to perfection. Most of the pizzas are priced around the £ mark which is more than worth it, just think how expensive it can be to order a takeaway from some well-known establishments. The Balmoral Hotel is excelling and the Italian-themed night is just the latest incentive to what is a fantastic establishment. Warm and friendly staff, quality food and best of all, it’s right on your doorstep. I could not recommend the Italian night anymore. Go and check it out for yourself and tell me you don’t feel like you have been to Italy for the night. I cannot wait to plan my next Tuesday nightvisit.Balmoral Hotel,Blacks Road, Dunmurry, Belfast BT NFTel:    balmoralhotelbelfast.co.u"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"butsy was larger than life and loved by many","story":"BORN on September   the late Pat ‘Butsy’ Butler has been described as a “larger than le figure” and“someone who was known and loved by many”.Pat, who passed away on December  , was educated at St Teresa’s Primary School on the Glen Road, before moving to St Malachy’s College where he completed his secondary education. The Glen Road man’s first job was as a compositor printer with Pitman’s University Press. However, during these early working days, he undertook voluntary youth work within the greater West Belfast area and soon realised that this was where his future lay. Eventually Pat left Belfast for Leicester University where he achieved his degree in youth and social care, following this up with a Master’s degree from the Ulster University. Pat eventually became a youth worker in charge at St Michael’s Youth Club, Finaghy Road North, where he spent many happy years. During this time, Pat managed a number of the youth football teams, with home games being played at Woodlands playing fields. Pat’s brothers commented that to say he was “vocerous” in his coaching would be an “understatement”. “In fact the story goes that at this time, house prices in Orchardville depreciated by  per cent!”At a time when West Belfast was often in turmoil, the youth club was a haven for young people a place where parents knew their children would be safe. Pat took this onboard and enabled the young people in his care to reach their full potential. Pat developed an insatiable love for sport from a very early age. He joined Davitt’s GAC for a short time before transferring to St Agnes’ where he spent many happy years as both a player and manager. In the course of his time with the ‘Aggies’ Pat, along with many of the players, made those never to be forgotten trips to the continent and of course Shannon events that proved to be hugely enjoyable and deeply spitural ventures. A serious arm break when he was  curtailed Pat’s playing career but he had much success in his managerial roles. Pat, affectionately known as Butsy, also loved soccer and had a long and enjoyable time playing for and supporting Dominic Savio. During the ’s, Pat embraced the basketball scene and in particular St Gall’s basketball club. Pat was committed totally to this new undertaking. In fact, his brother Gerard remembers ing back to Denewood one day and discovering a very large American making himself a cup of tea. Of course Pat had not told Gerard that ‘Soupy’ Campbell would be staying for a few days – a bit of a shock. As a commentator and administrator Pat gave  per cent to this new venture. His famous commentary during lives games in the Andersonstown Leisure Centre is still talked about.On the sporting front, Pat finally finished up as a member of Falls Bowling Club where he spent many happy years as a player, administrator and advisor to the long suffering groundsman. Pat eventually became the club president, something of which he was particular proud of. He also became president of the private greens – a role which again Pat embraced with diligence and total commitment. A spokesperson for Falls Bowling Club described Pat, their th President, as someone with a personality that “could fill the Waterfront Hall”. “His passing has left a gap that we will not attempt to fill.”Married to Shelia since August  , Pat lived le to the full, had a hugely positive influence on many and ultimately made a dference. He will be sorely missed by all who knew him."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"history man joes lifetime in community","story":"HAVING been involved in community development for the best part of three decades, Joe Baker is a familiar face to many in North Belfast, but he is probably most recognised as one of the city’s leading resident historians.Joe has been involved with the Ashton Community Trust virtually since its inception in the early-s and now sits on its board. It was also during that time that he became involved in the Belfast History Project.Throughout his career, Joe has written, and published, books, magazines and newspaper articles for a range of media outlets during his career but, unlike some historians, his expertise grew outside the confines of traditional academia.By his own admission, he didn’t do too well at school, often “forgetting” to get off the bus at the gate. However, after ing to education at the Belfast College of Business Studies in the late s, he enrolled in history classes, which he would go on to utilise with the fledgling Belfast History Project.“I came back from college and started to get people involved in learning about the history of the area,” he explained.“From that, we discussed a number of dferent ideas. One idea we had worked on before that was cleaning up Clton Street Cemetery – which was where we used to drink our cider. It was all overgrown and wrecked at the time, but we all got together to fix it up. We tied in with people like Enterprise Ulster, and then Belfast City Council took it over and a number of volunteers came on board. Through that we developed this interest in local history.“Once the ball started rolling that was it. We started doing dferent educational projects. One of the things we started to discuss was putting a magazine together, which sounds very easy, but at that time there was this new thing coming out called a computer that you had to learn to use. Then you had to learn the computer programmes, which in those days was Pagemaker. Then you had to learn about printing and all the rest of it. Once we go up and running everything just fell into place.”The Belfast History Project has been exemplary in its endeavours, setting up groundbreaking publications and establishing history tours in long-unexplored areas of the city.“One of the good things is that when you look in Belfast city centre now and you see all the tours done here and there – blue badge this, white badge that – we get to look at it and say we did it first,” said Joe with a smile.“We did a walking tour in the Half Bap area and one of the very first tours was cancelled because of a bomb scare – not many tour operators can claim that.”The end of the conflict has ushered in a new age of competition as ious operators compete to sell tours of the ever-developing city of Belfast. While Joe believes the growing interest in local history is “brilliant” he insists branding and profits have often got in the way of fact.“People are trying to put these brands on things,” he said.“At my last count Belfast has nine-quarters. When I was at school,I was asked how many quarters there were andI had said nine I know what would’ve happened.“There is a lot of  stuff like this Tribeca development, which is a lot of nonsense.“They should do the names to reflect the history of the area. It annoys me when people try to put a  history on an area or say things that just aren’t true. We’ve always argued thatyou’re going to do history you should tell the truth. I love to see the tourism industry grow and change, but as long as they stick to a principle of truth.”Having started as a small local initiative, the Belfast History Project has flourished over the years, and now provides tours all over Europe, with their Russian tours booked up for nearly two years in advance. However, with all of its wider triumphs, the Belfast History Project remains a social enterprise, whose key aim is to give back to the community. Local tours and events still run regularly, such as the highly successful historical photographic exhibiton, which recently appeared in the New Lodge – and, as Joe explained, “It’s all about education”.“If we get people into history we can get them into education and guide them along their own path,” he said.“For example, we had a group of kids studying the history of the New Lodge, which grew to Belfast, Ireland and then Europe. They might be kids at the time, and they’ll mess about, but about tenyears later they’ll come back to us and say ‘That was the best project I was ever part of’ and that gives us a buzz.”Joe continued: “I remember years ago that the Barrack area in the New Lodge was just called the Barrack, but younger people didn’t know why it was called that. If you ask them now they’ll tell you it’s because there used to be an army barracks there.“Whenever you do a photographic exhibition and people are learning about their own area, then that’s the start of an educational journey.“As we always say, there is no more fruitful form of education than to raise the interest of people in their own surroundings.“Once you do that it can open up countless other opportunities.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"priceless 1916 artefacts to go on show at opening of new james","story":"AN ORIGINAL  Proclamation along with the printing blocks used to create the document are among the historically invaluable artacts to go on display for the first time ever together when Áras Uí Chonghaile opens its doors next month.

The fourth element of the centre will be an event and conference space, with all the first class facilities you would expect.”Harry told the Andersonstown News that a year-long events programme has also been planned with folk sessions, film club meetings held once a month in conjunction with Sean Murray’s Respect film company, and a series of seminars and lectures.“We are also delighted to announce that Hatch Café will take up residence in the centre as our hospitality partners and will be open to the public,” he said. Áras Uí Chonghaile centre manger Séanna Walsh spoke of how the centre will host a programme of events that will try to emphasise that “It’s not just about Connolly the Irish rebel, it’s as much about Connolly the trade unionist, the guy who organised the mill workers in Conway Street, the guy who went to the States and organised several trade unions there, who all take their lineage right back that far.” Séanna continued: “There will be a major educational element to the centre, we want schools, colleges, universities coming to see the project.“It’s ground-breaking the things we will have on display for the first time: an original Proclamation and also a half Proclamation which was actually produced by the British to use in evidence during the court martial.“Having the seven signatories at the bottom was all they needed, those along with the original printing blocks will be displayed for the first time ever together. “At the end of the day, the centre has to be Connolly in the round. Not the one-dimensional Connolly – the Irish rebel. It’s important to the legacy of the man this centre is seen as a resource by the trade unions right across the island.”Harry said that there is no doubt Áras Uí Chonghaile will become a key part of the city’s tourism trail. “We want to thank our funders Belfast City Council and the wide range of sponsoring trade unions from the States that have pledged and delivered key financial resources which haveallowed the centre to become a reality.” "},{"url":null,"title":"alevel northern ireland school league table","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The airport is to increase the number of security lanes from six to eight by Easter.Belfast International Airport has been approached for comment on the ranking of its lounge.A Which  Inspector was less than impressed with what the airports lounge had to offer.\"We were particularly looking forward to the sumptuous buffet, imagining all sorts of treats that might be available,\" the Inspector said. \"What we found was that the buffets ‘hot selection’ was just a single soup: sweet potato and butternut that was bland. This was accompanied by a pair of poor quality wraps.

We believe the culprits used a trailer to remove the ATM from the scene.\"We also believe the digger was stolen from ground under development nearby. The digger was set alight at the scene immediately after the theft.\"Mr Reid said that police are investigating whether the attacks are linked.Ulster Unionist MLA Rosemary Barton described the theft as \"despicable\". She added: \"It is frustrating to see yet another ATM ripped from the wall of a local business. The ATM is a crucial service in this local area and this latest incident has now deprived the community of yet another facility.\"\"These despicable actions have become all too prevalent over the past few months across Fermanagh and South Tyrone. It must be made a priority now for the PSNI to put more resources into trying to prevent such deeds.\" Adding her condemnation in a tweet, DUP leader Arlene Foster said: \"Another rural community robbed of an ATM. Thoughts are with the shop owners who have to rebuild. Huge inconvenience for the wider community too. \"ATMs are being moved indoors and only available during office hours. Will be speaking to PSNI Fermanagh and Omagh about cracking down on the thieves.\"This is another disgraceful attack on the local community in the county.

The tiny track-suited youngsters formed a guard of honour.Ruth MaguireOther members of the club were attending the funerals on Saturday of two other young men who were associated with the Bryansford club and who, by a tragic twist of fate, died in a single-car road accident near Carlingford last Monday. Shane McAnallen and Martin Patterson, who were in their s, had been juvenile members of the Bryansford club which expressed shock and sorrow at the triple tragedy that devastated them and the entire community.Ruth and her partner Jim lived in Newcastle and she worked in Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry. Father Mac Giolla Caihain paid a moving tribute to Ruth, saying she had dedicated her le to others through her caring job and as a trainer in sport and Irish dancing.He also revealed that Ruth had run part of a marathon to raise money in honour of her grandmother. The priest said Ruth was the baby of her family but she was the boss who kept her siblings on their toes.He added: \"Ruth was slow to take offence and quick to forgive, she realised that le is too short.\"Describing her as a devoted mother, he said family was at the heart of her le. Talking about the couples wedding plans, the priest told Jim Grfin, who had earlier posted a social media message saying Ruth wasnt just his partner but also his soul mate: \"My prayer is that the grace you were due to receive will come to you today Jim, and sustain you and the children in the future. May she meet you, Jim, in Gods kingdom, dressed in dazzling white.\"Much of the priests homily was directed at Ruths children and he told them: \"Today, remember very carefully that your mummy loved you so much. She was so proud of you, and youll have so many people around you to help you and comfort you.\"Remember there is always hope, always faith, always love.\"Ruth was buried later in Carnmoney cemetery."},{"url":null,"title":"republic rejoin commonwealth not on our agenda says varadkar","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He added: \"Fine Gael is a generous party and we want him to feel welcome.\"Yesterday, Mr Varadkar was also asked for his opinion. \"Its not something thats on the agenda at the moment anyway,\" he said.The Republic was a member of the Commonwealth until April , when The Republic of Ireland Act , came into force, severing all formal ties with the British Crown.The idea of Ireland rejoining the Commonwealth has been prominently supported by Fine Gael Senator Frank Feighan, who Sir Jeffrey referenced a number of times.Mr Feighan argues membership would promote Irelands values on a global stage and strengthen economic relations internationally.Last August, Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald said she is open to discussions on Ireland rejoining the Commonwealth. She told TheJournal.ie: \"I think those that hold that view need to put that view forward, and I think it needs to be looked at, and debated, and it needs to be discussed.\"It is not a proposition I would be advancing - but I am me. This is not all about Sinn Fein. This is much bigger than us. The debate has to have the capacity to put everything on the table and then the business of debate and discussion in a reflective way, not a isive way.\"Sir Jeffrey spoke atabout his partys wish to be good neighbours to the Republic, despite tense Brexit negotiations.\"There is no ulterior motive in unionism that says we can use Brexit to prevent this or prevent that, in terms of increased, enhanced co-operation in our common good,\" he said.\"We need to ensure that people are comfortable where they are, we need to address the issues around the backstop in particular, but its about developing the new relationship.\"Sir Jeffrey was also pressed on his partys use of the petition of concern in the Assembly to block a vote on marriage equality.He pointed out that the DUP no longer has enough members to have the majority for a petition of concern and that it may no longer be a problemthere is a Stormont Executive."},{"url":null,"title":"varadkar well work with britain on brexit no matter who is pm","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Whoever is prime minister we will work with them.“It didn’t have to be this bad, I think what’s happened is the UK is now consumed with Brexit.“Even after they leave, assuming they leave with a Withdrawal Agreement, they will spend two or three years consumed about what the future relationship is going to be like.“We have to make sure we’re not consumed and defined by it, and my job as Taoiseach is to sure we limit any damage so we can get on with our ambitious plan for the future.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Leo Varadkar and Theresa May during a bilateral meeting in Brussels The Taoiseach also responded to reports that German leader Angela Merkel had pushed for a task force to deal with the border issue, which had put Ireland under pressure.“I’m not under any pressure from Chancellor Merkel or anyone  on this issue,” he said.“What Chancellor Merkel or President Macron would do is ask reasonable questions.“I’m not sure what people think happens at European Council meetings.

For its part, Debenhams has put in motion plans to secure £ million in new funding from its lenders and pursue a restructuring plan which would wipe out existing shareholders, including the Sports Direct founder.Sports Direct said this is “not a workable solution”.But Debenhams has dismissed Mr Ashley’s alternative proposals, arguing that they do not address the company’s funding and restructuring requirements, and adding that the tycoon’s appointment as chief executive would be a conflict of interest given his ownership of House of Fraser.Responding to those claims, Sports Direct said it does not consider House of Fraser to be a competitor of Debenhams.“In any event, were Mr Ashley to become CEO of Debenhams, he would, as previously announced, step down from his roles at Sports Direct. He would also be subject to fiduciary duties to Debenhams,” it said.“Sports Direct would strongly recommend that the Debenhams board reconsiders the offers made by Sports Direct to date and their own duties as directors of Debenhams.”Mr Ashley also lashed out at a “lack of engagement” and the “limited access to information” provided to him by Debenhams."},{"url":null,"title":"uk relations with ireland at worst since hunger strike years claims academic","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The border backstop has so far prevented the UK agreeing a formal withdrawal agreement with the EU.\"The Irish government feared thatsimultaneous negotiations occurred, the British government would use the Northern Irish issue as a bargaining chip to gain trade concession from the EU and, in that bargaining game, a soft border could be sacriced in the final outcome,\" she wrote.Dr Tannam reported that proposals by Theresa May to remove the backstop had been followed by a resurgence of hardline rhetoric from Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tanaiste Simon Coveney.Her paper also expressed concern about the future of Anglo-Irish relations after Brexit. With less regular contact between British and Irish officials expected after Brexit, Dr Tannam urged the two governments to set out a legally binding schedule of meetings under the auspices of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. Although the Conference was part of the Good Friday Agreement, it has rarely met in recent years.She also looked forward to smoother relations once the Brexit processcompleted. \"While the halcyon days of the s will not , the relationship is likely to be relatively co-operative in the decades ahead,\" the academic wrote."},{"url":null,"title":"owners bring their pet bull shopping with them","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

an alternative to those seeking an environmentally-friendly approach to burial.They argue there are no designations that would preclude a development of this nature and that the proposal will enhance the location by creating and enhancing shared space, supporting good design and improving the built and natural environment.Supporters of the project also contend that the project will ldquopreserve restore and enhance ecosystems, turning an arable field into a nature reserve.In papers submitted ahead of last weekrsquos meeting, planners confirmed they had representations in support and opposition to the proposal, with the planned burial site having no headstones, with all burials recorded on a map.Signicantly, planners confirmed that while there can be no objections in principle to the proposal, those behind the project had not provided the requested additional information.They revealed that while extra time was allowed to comply with the request, no further extension was being afforded with the recommendation to refuse the application now being made.Planners added: ldquoWhile it is considered that the proposal will not create any unacceptable visual or residential impact due to its nature, it is considered further information is required for the consultees which also encompasses a number of concerns raised from interested parties.Planners confirmed Environment and Rivers Agencies are among those who still require further information to enable them to fully assess the planning application and provide detailed comment.Planners had described the information they required as ldquocrucial and pertinent to the application and that it was most unfortunate that it has not been provided.They said while there may be no objection in principle to the proposal ldquoit

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth. There were also celebrations on the Penarth Pier on Tuesday night following a Pancake Day event, while wandering bands of musicians like Wonderbrass kept spirits high.The festival culminated in a grand Mardis Gras party on Tuesday, which saw crowds of costumed residents dance the night away.Richard Parry, one of the carnival organisers, said: ldquoToday is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time. But now itrsquos established, wersquoll be back next year and ready for even more people to join in the fun! article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Wersquore creating work which is not really necessary.If we want to improve the gateway there are other ways of doing it.ldquoIt really doesnrsquot begin to tackle the active travel . I do feel this is about spending the money before next February.Councillors were told the widened roundabout was one part of a wider strategy for transport improvements in Penarth.Charlotte Pugh, senior planner for the council, said the new scheme would transform the area.She said: ldquoThis whole are is going to be completely transformed. At the moment it is not very welcoming to pedestrians.ldquoI think it will go some way to transforming this gateway into Penarth and make it a safer environment.Previous plans to make part of Plassey Street one-way to incoming traffic, and removing the roundabout altogether, were dropped following opposition from the public.The committee agreed to endorse the transport scheme but requested regular updates on the wider transport plans for Penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This fantastic choir is run by The Aloud Charity, which is based here in the constituency, and is doing incredible work all around Wales, involving young people in music and teamwork and giving them the confidence to not only succeed in music but in their lives more generally.It was a real honour to host them in Parliament, where they sang for the Speaker, for MPs, and during the St Davidrsquos Day Service in the Chapel, before heading to the Public Gallery of the Commons to watch the St Davidrsquos Day debate.This annual debate is an important one for Wales, allowing MPs to talk about all sorts of issues. I spoke about transport and train services ndash a long running campaign of mine as you will know.I then spoke in the crucial debate on climate change. Believe it or not, itrsquos been far too long since wersquove had a debate on this issue in Parliament, and I spoke about the importance of our investments and pensions going into renewable sources, not into fossil fuels.I also pointed out my support for the young people across the UK who went on a climate strike the week before. Itrsquos their futures that wersquore concerned about here and they were absolutely right to do what they did.And then of course the Brexit shambles continues ndash we cannot escape it ndash but we were debating it again last week, with hugely important votes to come next week.But last week was a signicant one. The PM was forced into a corner, forced to concede that she might have to rule out No Deal and extend Article , and the Labour Party came out decisively for putting this issue back to the people.And this week we saw the Government attempt to win over MPs with a fund it claims will boost less well-off towns after Brexit ndash but in another shambolic aspect to this hapless attempt to bribe MPs into voting for Theresa Mayrsquos so-called deal, there is no cash for Welsh towns.Another example of the Tories letting Wales down, and yet further reason to support the push for a final say on Brexit for the public through a Peoplersquos Vote. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Last month I met with constituents over disruption to local rail services. I know that many of you will have experienced delays and cancellations to services in the weeks following the handover of the Wales Rail Franchise. I understand and share the frustration that these delays have caused. There has been a shortage of rolling stock as a result of a large maintenance backlog following the handover of the franchise together with planned changes to rail services. This has led to a signicant reduction in services and replacement bus services. I have been in contact with the Minister for Transport and Transport for Wales to raise the concerns of constituents. I have been assured that service levels are now back to normal and they do not anticipate any restrictions to services in the coming year. I will of course maintain my interest to see that those assurances are kept. I will update residents again on future plans to deliver improved station facilities, trains and more regular services.As many of you are aware Cardf Bus has recently announced changes to bus services across Cardf and the Vale. A number of bus routes are at risk as part of these changes. The removal of bus links for work, social links and public services, including hospital routes, would have a signicant impact on my constituents.Cardf Bus are not acting to deliberately hurt our communities. Far from being an uncaring organisation Cardf Bus are stuck with a legal framework that stops them from operating on the same basis as commercial competitors. Competitors can cherry pick and target single profitable routes that undermine the wider social propose that most of us want from local bus services. Cardf Councilrsquos Labour leadership has committed to supporting at risk bus services for  years. Unless the Conservative leadership of the Vale Council agrees to Labour councillors amendments to the budget and protects local bus services in the Vale then bus routes will go. The Vale Council leadership could and should act. If they donrsquot then my constituents will suffer.In future, the regulation of buses is the answer. London was the only part of the UK that was allowed to keep a regulated bus service. It is no mistake that it has the best and most coherent service. We now have the legislative powers to regulate bus services here in Wales. The Welsh Government is currently consulting on proposals to reform bus and taxi services in Wales. More information on the consultation can be found at: https:beta.gov.wales improving-public-transport. The consultation closes on th March ndash please do get in touch and take part. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The seniors school can be found on Hickman Road, the juniors and nursery a short distance on in Victoria Road.School facilities include a full gym, a library, an IT suite, a sports hall, science laboratories, and nearby access to local sports facilities including athletics track, Penarth RFCrsquos rugby pitch and the International Sports Village in Cardf Bay.Traditionally the school was strictly boys only. However, in the mid s the decision was taken to also accept girls and become a coeducational school.Westbourne was first established in Penarth in  as Westbourne House Preparatory School for Boys, and has kept the choice for children to board.A number of international students attend the school, and they often board with families from the area ndash usually Westbourne alumni themselves. More than  dferent nationalities take the opportunity to board in the area.Westbourne are rightly proud of this international aspect.ldquoEveryone here mixes in together, said Marie de Tito Mount, the schoolrsquos director of marketing. ldquoWe have children studying from Russia, China, the US, Poland, India, and theyrsquore all friends.ldquoTherersquos no cliques or groups, and wersquore proud of the international aspect this is giving our children.ldquoWe feel like wersquore making them citizens of the world.Ranked st in Wales by The Sunday Times Schools Guide and st in the UK by The DailyLeague Tables,  per cent of Westbourne graduates go to Russell Group universities or equivalently elite international institutions.The school points to two factors for this ndash the small number of pupils, and the highly trained staff.With a class size of just eight students per teacher on average, every student gets full and unided attention.The children clearly thrive from this, building confidence and passion for their work.In reception, there was a palpable excitement to show off their handmade vegetable dolls.A Year Five jumped at the chance to read out her ndash impressively well-written ndash poem.In the senior school, a young man attacked a maths problem on a board with gusto. He was animated and passionate, and had clearly forged a close bond with his teacher.The head of Westbourne Prep School, Joanne Chinnock, said: ldquoOur school is a happy place, and wersquove long held the philosophy happy children learn well.       ,params: .pushldquoOur lsquosecretrsquo is the very close bond between the children, from Nursery and Reception classes all the way to the top of the school and the staff, who know each child very well indeed.There are a huge number of after school clubs on offer. Children have the opportunity to learn a wide range of instruments, including the harp, trumpet, piano, violin, drums, guitar and organ.A large set of sports clubs stake full advantage of the the Welsh coast, with frequent use of Penarth Pier, the beach and natural beauty spot Cosmeston Lakes. Sports on offer include swimming, yoga, basketball, touch rugby, dodge ball, gymnastics, cross country, and football.There are even more opportunities to excel in other areas, with offerings including Young Journalists, Nature Club, Art Club, Chess and ldquoMad Science.Westbourne offers the InternationalDiploma Programme in sixth form and GCSEs and IGCSEs for its secondary pupils.Their IB average is - points, high enough to qualy for Oxford University, with two-thirds of all Higher Level grades being s and s, and two-thirds of students receiving a Bilingual Diploma.The GCSE results are equally impressive with  per cent of all grades being s and s per cent the new, harder, grade  and a further  per cent grade s. This is up to five times the UK average.The academic rigour extends to the staff too. More than  per cent of teachers at Westbourne have a PhD or masters and more than  per cent have taught internationally.Westbourne School has cultivated a warm and highly supportive culture one in which students and teachers truly support each other.For more information, visit:https:www.westbourneschool Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

He would also be subject to fiduciary duties to Debenhams, it said.ldquoSports Direct would strongly recommend that the Debenhams board reconsiders the offers made by Sports Direct to date and their own duties as directors of Debenhams.Mr Ashley also lashed out at a ldquolack of engagement and the ldquolimited access to information provided to him by Debenhams..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Sports Direct says its Debenhams proposals are better than  uinsolvency u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Our children must feel safe and be treated with dignity.ldquoAs one of the most progressive nations in the world when it comes to promoting childrenrsquos rights, I am proud this Welsh Government is legislating to bring an end to the physical punishment of children in Wales, further protecting childrenrsquos rights.The bill will now be scrutinised by AMs, with Welsh Government sources confident it will be passed by the National Assembly and brought into law after achieving Royal Assent by Spring .The Government says the legislation will be accompanied by an awareness-raising campaign and support for parents.Research published last year found % of parents of young children in Wales disagreed that ldquoit is sometimes necessary to smack a naughty child, while the Parental Attitudes Towards Managing Young Childrenrsquos Behaviour  survey found only % of parents with young children reported they had smacked their children in the last six months.The legal defence of ldquoreasonable chastisement has been used in law since  and is currently available in England and Wales for parents or adults acting in loco parentis against charges of common assault.The most recent figures available show between  and  there were  cases where the use of the defence resulted in an acquittal of a defendant or a discontinuation of proceedings against them in England and Wales.Wales would join the  countries around the world which have already banned the physical punishment of children, including Greece, Latvia, Albania, DR Congo, Kenya, with Sweden being the first to do so back in .Viv Laing, head of policy at NSPCC Cymru, said: ldquoItrsquos wrong that children in Wales have less protection from assault and that a legal defence which does not exist when an adult is hit can be used to justy striking a child.ldquoWe have long campaigned for equal protection for children and we strongly believe a change in the law is a common-sense move. Closing this loophole brings Wales in line with dozens of countries across the world and is simply about fairness and equality for our children.Professor Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: ldquoWhen a parent raises a hand to a defenceless child, whether thatrsquos a smack, slap or another physically harmful behaviour, they have lost control.ldquoResearch tells us that children who are physically punished are more likely to have poorer mental health and physical well-being and when they grow up, are more likely to engage in self-destructive or antisocial behaviour. Hurting a child isnrsquot acceptable and it is a form of child abuse.But the plans have been criticised by the campaign group Be Reasonablendash backed by The Christian Institute and The Family Education Trust ndash which said the legislation would criminalise parents.Spokeswoman Lowri Turner said: ldquoIt is disappointing that the Welsh Government has decided to press on with this unnecessary piece of legislation that will do nothing to protect children, but will criminalise loving parents.ldquoAs we have seen from a slew of Freedom of Information requests, parents suspected of smacking face suspension, investigation by the police and social services, and prosecution..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Smacking ban legislation announced in Wales article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.

Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Instead Paul built on the legacy of his predecessors and accelerated growth in new, technology solutions, while retaining the traditional accounting, tax and consulting services. Today PwC remains the leading provider of advisory services to the region’s family-owned and owner-managed businesses and multinationals, but has also built an impressive portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, opened the door to signicant export markets and is tackling some of society’s most challenging issues. “We’ve grown in many new areas – blockchain, cyber, cloud-based accounting services – but the single biggest impact has come from developing our distinctive ‘Operate’ ision,” Paul says. ”Operate is our service delivery business, which supports and delivers technology and people solutions to large, often regulated organisations. So instead of just advising clients how to solve their problems, we now do the heavy lting for them.”Run by Ian McConnell, a partner who’s been with the firm for  years, Operate is already attracting global attention. “Clients increasingly don’t want a consulting firm just to tell them what to do: they want a problem-solving partnership.” he says. “In its first year of operation, Operate earned over £m, now has , people and is still growing.”Reinforcing Paul’s confidence to invest in Northern Ireland as a strategic location is a  forecast from TheCityUK that it could become the second fastest-growing financial services region outside London by , helping deliver £bn of additional gross value-addedto the UK economy. But that depends on the ability to recruit the right talent, and he says the challenge now is finding and retaining the skills.That’s an issue that particularly concerns Paul as he looks ahead at the economic picture with Brexit and lack of an Assembly to the fore.“The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.“However I do worry about the impact of political stalemate on our long term future. Failure to invest, particularly in education and skills, will impair our competitiveness and make this a less attractive place for business.The decreasing effectiveness of health, environment and infrastructure will mean that talented people will opt to make choices to live their lives where.“In my national role, I see other parts of the country fusing partnerships in innovative and exciting ways between business,education and government. Compared to that, we are already getting left behind. We should be moving forward.”Which brings us to Merchant Square, the £m, , sq ft office development which PwC takes over in . “We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.“That makes it important for Belfast too and not just because it’s the city’s biggest-ever private sector office deal. As we were making our decision, the whole Bank Buildings issue was at its height, and we wanted to show our support for the city and its future.” The Merchant Square relocation project is led by Kieragh Nelson, a director who joined the firm in . “We’ve got serious ambitions for Merchant Square,” she says. ”There’s a sense of ‘OK, we’ve just opened flagship offices in London, and Manchester – what more can we do in Belfast how can we make it even better ’ And the vast majority of decisions on how it will look, feel and work are made by the team here. Our goal is to create the most technologically-advanced, innovative and collaborative space for ourselves, our clients, and also for the communities around us.”Doing the right thing is a maxim often repeated in PwC, but it gets backed up. On the morning of our interview, a large group of people from the firm, including Paul, took part in one of their regular ‘Darkness Into Light’ walks to raise awareness of mental health. The firm’s commitment to social mobility has seen a number of employment programmes launched, notably the UK’s first technology degree apprenticeships, with Queen’s University one of five universities selected to run the programme. And it’s expanding its Hive Academy programme, which delivers free technology education to primary and secondary schools, to the Channel Islands.This year the firm challenged itself and created a unique charity partnership – the PwC Challenge – to create innovative suicide prevention programmes.“Our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems, and it really does feature in how we look at what we do. We strive to celebrate and share our knowledge widely and unselfishly with our people and communities and not be afraid to take a stand and do the right thing. And we put it at the heart of what we do every day. “Take the PwC Challenge: more people in Northern Ireland have died by suicide since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement than from the violence in the years before. This is a crisis, and it’s one which affects our people, and our communities. So we asked local charities in north and west Belfast, the worst affected areas in the UK, to collaborate and devise really innovative approaches programmes to give opportunities to young people and their families through education, technology, sports, and mental health coaching.“As well as the clubs in PwC which fundraise every year for the challenge, our own people are volunteering every week in ious projects – particularly with our Hive Academy. We want to ensure that people, who are high achievers in many dferent fields, are supported to play their fullest part in society.” For Paul, it’s all about the people. Last year PwC invested around £m on staff development here, and this year, a number of people have begun the first Masters in Operation service delivery, run by Ulster University. “It’s important to support people to develop their careers in ways they mightn’t have considered when they joined. That’s a key building block of our purpose – it drives social mobility, equality and ersity.“It’s true thatsomeone decides they want to head off and join PwC Australia or New York, they can. That’s the beauty of working for a global firm – those opportunities are there. But what I really want to make sure is that you don’t have to leave:you want to live and work in Belfast, and have global clients, work with cutting-edge technology and be part of a firm that’s engaged in society, you can do that too.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/eopen_1.jpg","title":"the open its the biggest thing since sliced bread","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business With just  weeks until Northern Ireland hosts the biggest sporting event in its history, John Mulgrew speaks to the bosses tasked with organising the legendary Open Championship We’ve come a long way in just a short few years. Despite its huge golfing credentials, especially in the modern game, it had been more than  years since Northern Ireland played host to the Irish Open.That all changed in , when it ed north to Royal Portrush. And that, buoyed on a refreshed and renewed interest in both the tournament, and the sport itself.Now, in  weeks, that same links course will see more than , people flock to arguably the world’s greatest golf tournament and the largest sporting event ever hosted on these shores – The Open – transforming a small Co Antrim town for a handful of summer days.“There is a buzz with everyone at the RA,” Johnnie Cole-Hamilton tells Ulster Business. He’s executive director of championships at the RA – the ruling authority of golf throughout the world, aside from areas such as the US, and organisation responsible for organising The Open.“This will be my th Open Championship, and one reason I continue to be involved is that it’s a challenge every time.”It will see Irish golfing greats, including Open winners Rory McIlroy and Darren Clarke, Graeme McDowelland Padraig Harrington – among others – join the biggest name in sport, Tiger Woods.“One of big drivers to ing to Royal Portrush was the success of the Northern Irish and Irish golfers. They have raised the profile of golf immeasurably. “We are absolutely delighted with the response so far – % of tickets sold in  hours, and sold out within a record-breaking eight weeks.”Johnnie says the decision to choose Portrush, bringing it back to the course after a  year hiatus, was the correct one – buoyed by the support from the community, agencies and organisations. The th Open will be held at Royal Portrush from July -.“In my career, we had a similar scenario, ing to Liverpool for the first time in  years, and we had a very similar response. It ed in , and now Royal Liverpool is firmly on the rota, and I hope that Royal Portrush is similar.”Of course, aside from the golf, both the short-term and long-term economic benefits will trickle down and benefit, not on the surrounding areas, but prop Northern Ireland up on yet another global .According to Tourism NI chief executive John McGrillen that longer-term benefit could be worth up to £m for the wider economy.“There will be , tickets sold for championship days, and % of those sold to people out of state, outside Northern Ireland,” he tells Ulster Business.“It allows us to present an extremely positive image for Northern Ireland, and into key markets across the globe. We will never have experienced the opportunity to provide such a positive image of Northern Ireland. Despite what we might think, there are perception issues.“Northern Ireland has a normalised society and some of the most dramatic golf courses, scenery and landscape to see.“More specically, the fact that the Open will have been here, as one of the world’s top golf courses, will drive up the amount of spend, especially from golf tourism.”That alone makes up around % of Northern Ireland’s tourism intake. John says he wants that to grow to £m by . He says golfing visitors spend around four times that of an average tourist.Johnnie says all signs so far suggest that the Open in Portrush is “going to be an enormous” success. But the process hasn’t come without its challenges – namely theIrish Sea.“This is the first Open Championship we have hosted in my time, in which we have a body of water between our base and our contractor base. There’s getting things across water, and an enormous amount of work on the golf course – new holes, a new road system around the course and a tunnel for the players from one of the new greens to tee. You can’t do that without support from the golf club“The members have been hugely supportive, turning the course upside down, but maintaining integrity and enhancing .”He said, along with the blue light services, local authorities, council and tourism groups, the community in and around Portrush “understands that this will bring great benefits” to the area and Northern Ireland as a whole. “You can overcome dficulties with support,” he says.“Royal Portrush has never had more than , people drive to it, or get the train to it, at the same time. It’s a challenge to make sure we deliver a wonderful Open Championship and a spectator experience.”John McGrillen says the triumph in landing the Open itself was down to the success of the Irish Open in the last few years. “You had more than , people turning out at Portrush… visitor numbers had been dwindling.“That allows us to demonstrate that the course can deal with that many people. Everyoneworked very well, collectively, and that gave confidence to the RA that we would have the capacity to deliver it. The risk factors they had were eliminated because of the success of the Irish Open, and that was very critical.”As for boosting many of the hundreds of businesses in and around the area, John said: “It will do, as it’s showing off Northern Ireland… we have seen a big boost in the number of Americans playing golf. We don’t have to wait until after the event. “The visibility the Irish Open has given us. We have Royal County Down, Royal Portrush and Portstewart – that’s increased signicantly. It’s not just those courses which are benefiting – it’s being spread. People will typically stay in Belfast and travel around.”For John, the best outcome is, of course, an Irish winner. Oh, and clear skies. “A local winner would be phenomenal. It would be fantastic to see Rory win, or Tiger Woods.“If Tiger Woods won the Open in Portrush, that would remain in peoples’ memories forever. While we would love Rory or other locals to win, I would not be disappointed in Tiger winning it.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/west.jpg","title":"major ni firms in eleventh hour westminster plea to avoid no deal brexit","story":"Posted on Friday March  by John Mulgrew More than  of Northern Ireland’s biggest businesses – employing tens of thousands of workers here – have written to MPs in an eleventh hour plea to avoid a ‘no deal’ Brexit.  As Theresa May is due to bring her withdrawal deal back to Parliament next week, with less than a month to go before the March  deadline, a letter from the CBI, signed by  firms, calls on MPs to unite behind a way forward that avoids a hard border and protects peace and economic progress in Northern Ireland.  It says that “local businesses believe that the failure to approve a deal with Europe on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU will have signicant repercussions for the local economy\". “Such a scenario will both hinder indigenous and foreign direct investment, it would result in signicant job losses and will stle opportunities for the next generation across Northern Ireland.  “We therefore urge MPs across the UK to consider the damaging impact on Northern Ireland’s economy and political stability in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  “The peace and economic progress that flowed from the Belfast  Good Friday Agreement cannot be overlooked at this critical time in the UK’s history. All Members of Parliament must consider the burden of responsibility that they now carry for this region’s future.” Those putting their names to the open letter include aerospace giant Bombardier, which employs around , staff here, Danske Bank and First Trust, along with agribusinesses such as Devenish Nutrition, Fane Valley and Linden Foods.

For some there will be little or no change to their daily lives after the UK leaves the EU. But for others, Brexit may have an impact on some aspects of their day-to-day lives. To provide as much practical information for people across Northern Ireland that is currently available, a Brexit section has been created on the nidirect website. Useful public information is being published on www.nidirect.gov.uk brexit on a regular basis. You may have also seen some of the digital advertisements across Northern Ireland or on your social media channels asking you to visit the nidirect website for the most up to date information. The nidirect Brexit section also points to information being published by the UK Government to give people as much information as possible. At this stage, it won’t answer every question that people will have. But it serves as a useful tool to get people to start thinking about what they may need to do dferently once the UK leaves the EU. Included in the www.nidirect.gov.uk brexit is a section on travelling, which includes the most up to date information for motorists. Depending on how the UK leaves the EU, motorists in Northern Ireland may need a Green Card to drive across the border. A Green Card is an international certicate of insurance issued by insurance providers in the UK, guaranteeing that the driver has the necessary third-party motor insurance cover for driving in the country being travelled to. In the event of a no deal Brexit, motorists in Northern Ireland travelling to the Republic of Ireland will need a Green Card as proof of insurance. There’s also the most up-to-date information from the Department of Health on prescriptions, medicines and medical supplies. The Department of Health has already said that there is enough medicines and medical products to meet current needs. Therefore people should not ask for longer prescriptions and should continue to follow their GP’s advice. Likewise, arrangements for the provision of specic cross border healthcare services made between the Department of Health in Northern Ireland and the Department of Health in Dublinshould not be affected by EU Exit as they are not based on EU legislation. There is also information at www.nidirect.gov.uk brexit along with links to further information for businesses, employers and EU citizens, while information on the Common Travel Areacan be found at https:www.gov.uk government publications common-travel-area-guidance You might not have heard about the CTA before, but it gives British and Irish citizens agreed rights and privileges in both jurisdictions. The CTA is not based on EU membership and is a long standing arrangements based on domestic legislation and agreements between the UK and Irish governments and deals with a range of issues. www.nidirect.gov.uk brexit will be updated as and when new information becomes clear and available.
