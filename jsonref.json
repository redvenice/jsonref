However, imports into Germany from the UK rose slightly in March compared with a year ago. The owner of British Airways, International Airlines Group, has reported a €1.2bn pre-tax loss for the first quarter and reiterated the need for the rollout of digital vaccine passports to enable the beleaguered aviation industry to get passengers back in the skies. The airline group, which made a €1.8bn (£1.6bn) pre-tax loss in the first quarter last year, said its forecast on passenger numbers remains “uncertain and subject to review”. Luis Gallego, the chief executive of IAG, said:  Later today the UK government is due to announce which countries will be classed as low-risk for travel, meaning people can travel without needing to quarantine. The FTSE 100 jumped 37 points to 7113 points, as it continues to rally on hopes of an economic rebound this year. The FTSE 100 is now at its highest since 25th February 2020 (when the first lockdowns in Italy had triggered a global market crash). But it has yet to recover all its pandemic losses (unlike the US and European markets, which have hit new peaks) Both iron ore and copper prices have hit record levels today, extending a rally in commodities. The strong trade data from China overnight, and the prospect of a very strong US jobs report later today, are boosting demand. The benchmark S\u0026ampP Global Platts IODEX, which tracks the spot price of ‘iron fines’ delivered to China, hit a record high of $202.65 per dry metric ton. Iron ore futures in Asia have hit a peak this morning, with strong demand for the steelmaking industry and fears of supply shortages.  Copper - seen as a bellwether of the health of the global economy - is also surging. London copper prices hit a record high on Friday, over $10,200 per tonne, and again, tight supplies and expectations of strong demand. Here’s the details: These year-on-year figures are distorted by the impact of the pandemic - a year ago, many economies were in lockdown to tackle the first wave of Covid-19.  Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics reckons that “Demand is probably close to a cyclical peak.” But other economists are more optimistic, as Reuters flags: After the Bank of England hiked its growth forecasts yesterday, investors are looking to the latest US jobs report for confirmation that the economic recovery is gathering pace. And today’s Non-Farm Payroll is expected to be strong, with perhaps one million Americans finding work in April. That would be the strongest jobs growth since last August, up from the 916,000 hired in March. Analyst Alvin Tan of RBC Capital Markets says US companies are scrambling to find workers as they reopen. Other economists are also expecting a very strong jobs report, with NFP forecasts ranging from around 700,000 new jobs to over two million. However... economists have estimated that US economy was still roughly eight million jobs short of its pre-pandemic levels, so the recovery isn’t complete. Economic optimism pushed the UK’s FTSE 100 to its highest level since February 2020 yesterday. We’re expecting further gains today, with European stock markets called higher.

With the global secondhand clothing market set to grow from $28bn (£20bn) to $64bn (£46bn) by 2024, wardrobes could be largely made up of secondhand items – rented or bought. Natalie-Anne Hasseck, co-founder of the fashion rental subscription service Onloan, credits the change in consumer behaviour to a move away from status to “pleasure” dressing. During lockdown, demand for knitwear rocketed, but so did the loaning of flamboyant pieces. “The bigger the collar, the better,” she says. “We had a Mother of Pearl pie-crust collar shirt that barely touched ground in our warehouse as it just kept being rented out on repeat. Our customers care less about trends and more about identity and personalisation.” Better communication from brands is needed, as is a more unified industry approach to what constitutes a “sustainable” brand. “In our marketing materials, we promote to our customers how to live more sustainably,” says Lucy Macnamara, founder of ethical womenswear brand Aspiga. “We hosted a series of Instagram Lives with celebrities and influencers about changes we can make in our daily lives to live more eco-friendly.” Fast fashion brands are now facing a new challenge: being less wasteful is on trend. Couttigane says she has seen an increase in the willingness to shop secondhand, largely because platforms such as Depop – a community-led marketplace, renowned for good-quality secondhand and original vintage clothes – make the experience accessible, inclusive and desirable. “We want to use our reach to influence the way we consume fashion, encouraging people to consider secondhand first,” says Justine Porterie, Depop’s head of sustainability. An important factor in extending the life of clothes is how we care for them. The ecological cleaning brand Ecover has relaunched its laundry detergents made with biodegradable and plant-based ingredients. “Every 30 seconds, 1,000 items of clothing are thrown away in the UK,” says Ecover’s senior brand manager Charlotte Snelgrove. “We want to challenge the nation to wash right, wear more and waste less.” Find out more at ecoverdepop"},{"url":null,"title":"you dont know what story an item tells why im buying and selling secondhand clothes","story":"Bennett is the founder of online vintage shop Soul and Flare, which joined Depop – a community-led marketplace, renowned for good-quality secondhand and original vintage clothes – in 2016. Standing out and making sure her offering was of the highest quality was even more important for Bennett once she had started her Depop shop. And one of the biggest aims and values of her company is to eliminate fashion waste by encouraging others to shop vintage and look after the clothes they already own. She doesn’t see her job as “just” buying and selling vintage, though. For Bennett, the process is a full circle of discovery and care – from the items she chooses, to the way she washes and mends them. Before any repairs begin, the clothes need to be washed and cleaned delicately. “I’m an avid repair seamstress, but the process is about not over-washing clothes, as well,” she explains. The wrong detergent with too many harsh chemicals can spell the end for delicate vintage fabrics. Bennett believes that treating vintage clothes correctly is the only way to preserve them for future owners. Some of the vintage clothes that Bennett sells have been worn on and off for up to 70 years – something of a miracle and testament to their quality as well as how they’re looked after, she says. The last thing you’d want to do is just throw them in the washing machine with any old detergent. That’s why she has a clear system – first up is checking the label and material to see if it’s washable, and whether it should be hand washed. Then it’s about using the right cleaning products. Bennett is committed to using products that are eco-friendly – she’s stopped using bleach at home completely, and only uses Ecover detergent, made with plant-based, biodegradable ingredients as it’s gentle on the vintage fabrics as well as kinder to the environment. Bennett is based in Nottingham, where her love of vintage began with visits to car boot sales and charity shops with her mum, before she worked in a vintage shop. Nowadays, wearing secondhand or pre-loved can be quite a badge of honour, but in decades past it was often seen as something to hide. For some, buying vintage from a company such as Soul and Flare is a new experience, but Bennett has been learning her trade for a long time, meaning she really knows what she’s talking about. “I’ve been running Soul and Flare for around five years solidly but have been in the vintage trade for more than a decade. I fell into it in many ways but, growing up, my mum would drag us around charity shops and car boot sales. In her own way, she was sustainable even if she didn’t know what the word meant then. When I left college, I was making items for friends and family, and eventually got a job at a vintage clothing shop as their rework seamstress, and that’s where it stemmed from. That’s when I started witnessing the vast amounts of clothing that we waste in the UK, and my passion for reviving, repairing and making clothing last began. It’s not just something I do as a job, I do it at home, too – it’s my lifestyle. I look after my possessions – whether that’s furniture or clothing – and everything I wear is secondhand, so it’s deep-rooted in me. Ecover has teamed up with Depop, the marketplace app where you can buy and sell unique fashion, to challenge the nation to extend the life of their clothing and help fight fashion waste.

How we clean also has an impact. The process of doing laundry can impact the environment from the moment you turn the machine on. Higher temperatures create a higher carbon footprint, while the wrong wash setting can damage clothes, meaning you need to discard or replace them sooner. And the more clothes we buy, the more we wash. Throwaway culture is turning our planet into a giant fabric landfill. According to charity Wrap, 1,000 items of clothing are thrown away every 30 seconds in the UK. Leslie Reichert, from Massachusetts, who made herself a name as a green cleaning coach, says that altering the way you wash your clothes might not seem a big eco move, but for some it could be the perfect place to start. “Changes in the way you do your laundry are easy to implement and make a difference. By using an eco-friendly laundry soap, you can reduce the impact on the environment from the wash and you don’t need fabric softener.” Charlotte Snelgrove, senior brand manager at Ecover UK, says: “We’re never resting on our laurels, as a business we realise we can always improve on our products and push ourselves to go further in reducing our impact and finding new innovative ways to do this. We see our role in the cleaning category as highlighting environmental issues and trying to lead change by pioneering eco innovation and showing what is possible and hope bigger brands follow.” The world has taken notice, and eco influencers are getting on board. Georgina Wilson-Powell, founder and editor of the sustainable living magazine Pebble, says the brand has been leading the way for many years. “I’ve always been impressed with Ecover’s investment in innovation, both in packaging and detergents, as both can have such a negative impact on our environment. As more and more consumers look for brands that match their growing environmental credentials, it’s great to see Ecover build on its years of experience in this area,” she says. With the launch of its laundry detergent range, Ecover has gone back to basics, looking at its core value of cleaning, and how it impacts the environment. As well as continuing to use biodegradable, plant-based ingredients, Ecover’s fabric softeners contain a palm oil-free softening active derived from rapeseed oil and are vegan-friendly. The new Ecover bio detergent includes powerful enzymes that help your clothes last longer by fighting stains and removing bobbling from cotton fibres after multiple washes. There are active steps consumers can take, too – for instance, shorter wash cycles have been proved to help clothes last longer and shed fewer fibres. It’s a lot to think about when you’re just washing your clothes, but it’s something the world is waking up to, says Reichert. “Years ago, I was considered an ‘outlier’ due to my ideas about green cleaning – today, most manufacturers have eco-friendly options for consumers. Even the huge corporations have seen that there is a demand for green products. It’s not a movement, it’s a tsunami.” Ecover is on a mission to liberate the value of our clothing by challenging the nation to wash wisely, wear longer and waste less.

In an interview earlier this week Starmer claimed that he did want to be like Biden in offering bold, transformational policies, although the examples he cited were very generalised and devoid of specifics.Asked if Labour needed a new leader, McDonnell said: The council previously had an even split of Labour and Conservative councillors, but the Tories have already taken nine seats from Labour in a dramatic swing in their favour. The Conservatives are eyeing up gains across the West Midlands today, in Walsall, Wolverhampton and perhaps even in Sandwell, where Labour previously held 65 of the 72 council seats. And this is Owen’s conclusion. This is from Newsnight’s Lewis Goodall. Don’t read too much into their victory. Stockport used to be a Liberal Democrat stronghold — two of the four MPs there were Lib Dem until 2015 — and they still have an army of dedicated supporters in the borough. Still, it will make life that little bit more difficult for Andy Burnham, or whoever is declared mayor of Greater Manchester tomorrow. In order to get things done, the mayor often needs the approval of the ten local council leaders, and having one more off-side (the Tories have been running Bolton in a minority administration since 2019 as the sole non-Labour council) makes life a bit tougher.  That said, it was Stockport’s Labour leader who caused Burnham the biggest headache earlier in December when she withdrew the borough from the Greater Manchester spatial framework, a controversial plan to build tens of thousands of new houses. These local rows so often come down to the green belt. One other Stockport nugget: the Greens have won their first seat there, taking Reddish South, an urban seat on the Manchester border, from Labour. The Green party look to have had a good night in the north of England, taking seats in Northumberland and South Tyneside too. Elsewhere in Greater Manchester, Labour has held Rochdale and Oldham, though the latter’s dynamic young leader, Sean Fielding, lost his seat to a hyperlocal party, the Failsworth Independents. As explained in an article last month, hyperlocal parties are now a growing force in local politics.Reed argued that the party was still recovering from a historic defeat at the general election. He said people thought the party was “inward-looking” and not focused on aspiration. He said the pandemic meant that, as leader, Sir Keir Starmer had never been able to deliver a speech to a live audience. When Robinson put it to him that he was blaming Jeremy Corbyn, Reed replied: “I haven’t specifically said that.” But Reed repeated the argument that the 2019 result meant Labour had a “mountain to climb”. Robinson then said that, when Labour said it had to change, people did not know what that meant. All they got was “waffle”, Robinson said. What did change mean? Robinson then put it to Reed that, by choosing an anti-Brexit candidate in a pro-Brexit seat like Hartlepool, Labour was acting like the stereotypical Englishman abroad who, when he failed to make himself understood, just shouted more loudly. Robinson asked if Labour needed to do something different. Robinson finally asked Reed to clarify that, in Starmer’s mind, ‘change’ did not mean moving back to the left. Reed said: On the second round of voting Jones got 31,232 votes, beating the Conservative James Hart who was on 21,019 votes."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Revenue in any EU-wide permit scheme ought to accrue to national governmentsEnvironmentalist warns scale-up of Ireland\u0026rsquos offshore wind resources could be undone by lack of public engagementReport highlights benefits to public health and food production from cutting emissions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout.

It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top five cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high risk (cohort 4) and those aged 60 to 69 (cohort 5).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be\u0026nbsppeople\u0026nbspaged 16 to 64 who are at high risk (cohort 7).

Photograph: Nick Bradshaw for The Ireland’s Covid-19 lockdown has been the most stringent in the European Union this year, an analysis by two University College Dublin academics finds.Since the start of the pandemic, Ireland has had the third most stringent restrictions of 42 countries whose public health measures were compared as part of their research.Only Italy and the UK have put in place tougher rules since March of last year, say Prof Stephan Köppe and Robert Cazaciuc, of the college’s social and public policy departments.Ireland closed workplaces and businesses “much longer and tougher” than any other European country, their analysis states. Public transport restrictions in Ireland were in the top five and stay-at-home requirements and school closures were in the top 10.However, Ireland’s rules on international travel were “very lax” throughout last year and were only tightened after the Christmas travel “debacle”, the two academics state.Despite having the toughest restrictions in Europe between January and March, Ireland suffered the highest incidence of Covid-19 and, they say, the health system was “on the brink of collapse”.Death rateIt is too early to say whether tight restrictions contributed to the low overall death rate, they said.“It has been argued that the relative young age profile of the Irish population might have kept the mortality rate down, despite the virus circulating relatively freely in December.“On the other hand, the returning Irish diaspora, desperate to visit loved ones over Christmas, might have fuelled the surge of the virus back then, more than in other countries.“Despite the overall tight restrictions, lax international travel rules might have been the weak link in our Covid defences.”Ireland has a “very poor record” in enforcing “permissive” quarantine and travel restrictions, they also argue.The researchers, who have built an online dashboard to illustrate stringency of restrictions internationally, contrast the Government’s emphasis on reopening schools this spring with the “relatively late” reopening in the first wave.WeaklyIreland scores relatively weakly on travel restrictions, testing policies and contact tracing during the third lockdown, they say.“These apparent flaws in health service-related indicators may contribute to the stubbornly high case rate across the country, despite shutting down the country with relative blunt containment instruments.”The “Golfgate” controversy involving former EU commissioner Phil Hogan was “the exception rather than the norm”.“Such public outcries highlighted the lack of enforcement across the country and everyone driving through check points played along with the charade associated with tough rules and weak enforcement,” they argue.“We also do not know yet if the tighter restrictions were more effective in keeping the population safe or the economy rolling.”As to whether stringent lockdown has paid off, the academics say this will be known only when most of the population has been vaccinated and “this is all over”.“Regardless of whether we cheer the Irish success regarding managing the pandemic or drink down the poor Government record with sorrow in a pub, at least we know then that it is over.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"new online portal to open for self referral covid 19 tests","story":"The HSE mobile walk-in Covid-19 test centre in Balbriggan: the pop-up walk-in test centres, which started in March, show that  easy availability of testing eases people’s concerns. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe HSE is planning to allow the public in some areas to refer themselves for Covid-19 tests online to make it easier for younger people in infection hotspots to get tested for the virus. As part of continuing efforts to catch more cases, an online portal will be trialled over the coming weeks allowing people to seek tests without having to visit a doctor.The areas will be chosen by public health doctors based on incidence levels of the disease, though, if successful, the portal could be opened up nationally if testing capacity allows. Parts of Dublin will be among the first areas chosen for a test-run of the online portal. “It is all part of a strategy to make testing access easier for people and to meet the needs of people,” said Niamh O’Beirne, the HSE’s national lead for testing and tracing.“Over time we have realised that for certain communities we need to get closer to them and be closer to them. People need easier access to the testing centres. This will bring them closer.”Those who register on the portal will receive a text message directing them to attend a nearby HSE Covid-19 test centre to be swabbed.Ms O’Beirne said the pop-up walk-in test centres, which started in March, had shown that the easy availability of testing had eased concerns of people where they had been involved in risky activities and wanted to get tested or alleviate the concerns of an employer. The portal is being introduced to encourage more younger people to get tested as the median age of new cases has fallen with vaccinations protecting older people from infection.The median age of new cases reported this week ranged from 25 to 30 years of age. Close to 80 per cent of new cases are among under-45s, compared with 50-60 per cent in January. In Donegal, the county with the highest infection rates, test results from the walk-in centre in Letterkenny has shown a positivity rate of 4.9 per cent, above the national average of 3 per cent. A second walk-in centre opened in Milford on Wednesday. Other walk-in test centres will open in Convoy, from Saturday to Monday, and in Carndonagh, from Tuesday to Thursday, as the HSE tries to reduce the spread of the disease in Donegal.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"eoghan harris confirms sunday independent contract terminated","story":"Columnist Eoghan Harris has confirmed that his contract with the Sunday Independent has been terminated.

The accuracy of the forecasts is constrained by available computing power.Processor speeds have not increased much in recent years and speed-ups are achieved by running many processes in parallel. Energy costs have risen rapidly: there is a multimillion-euro annual power bill to run a supercomputer, which may consume something like 10 megawatts of power.Early computer programs for weather prediction, written in the Fortran language, stored numbers in single precision. Each number had 32 binary digits or bits corresponding to a decimal number with about seven significant digits. Later models moved to double precision, each number having 64 bits and about 15 accurate decimal digits. This is now common practice.It seems self-evident that higher numerical precision would result in greater forecast accuracy, but this is not necessarily the case. Observations, which provide starting data, have only a few digits precision. We may know the temperature to one-tenth of a degree or the wind speed within one metre per second. Representing these values with several digits beyond the decimal point may be futile. It could be likened to giving somebody’s height to the nearest millimetre or, in double precision, the nearest micron, which is meaningless.Computational resourcesOf course, higher precision does reduce errors during the millions of computations needed for a forecast. But higher precision also implies greater storage requirements, larger data transmission volumes and longer processing times. Are these costs justified or can limited computational resources be used in more efficient ways?At the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, researchers have been seeking ways to reduce computing power. They have found that 64-bit accuracy is not necessary and that, with 32-bit numbers, forecasts of the same quality are obtained much faster. The 40 per cent saving can be used in other ways, like enhancing spatial resolution or increasing ensemble size. Thus, a reduction in numerical precision can result in improved forecast accuracy.Chaotic flowAtmospheric flow is chaotic: this means that a small change in the starting values can lead to a wildly different forecast. Chaos was well-described by meteorologist Ed Lorenz, who asked if a tiny disturbance could cause a storm in a far-away continent. The idea is encapsulated in a Limerick:Lorenz demonstrated, with skill,The chaos of heatwave and chill:Tornadoes in TexasAre formed by the flexesOf butterflies’ wings in BrazilTo allow for chaos, meteorologists run their models multiple times with slightly different starting values. The spread of these “ensembles” gives a measure of the confidence that can be placed in a forecast, and probabilities of different scenarios can be given. Researchers at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts were surprised that reducing numerical precision of the computations had little influence on the quality of the ensemble forecasts.For climate simulations, which run over decades or centuries, it is expected that, by using reduced number lengths, substantial savings will be possible. Some sensitive operations like matrix inversion may require double precision but the bulk of the calculations can be done with 32 bits. Current work is also testing half-precision (16-bit numbers) for non-sensitive components of the models.Peter Lynch is emeritus professor at UCD school of mathematics and statistics, University College Dublin.

Photograph: Ahmad YusniEPAGermany will allow AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine to be administered to adults of all ages and aims to offer 12-18 year olds a vaccine by the end of August as it seeks to speed up its rollout, health minister Jens Spahn said on Thursday.The country’s 16 regional health ministers have agreed with Mr Spahn to reverse a previous decision to restrict the AstraZeneca shot to people over the age of 60. He also said that the 12-week gap between first and second doses of AstraZeneca vaccinations could be shortened.“Both these measures serve to further accelerate our vaccination campaign overall,” said Mr Spahn. Initial supply shortages and bureaucratic hurdles meant Germany, which has Europe’s biggest economy, got off to a slow start with its inoculation strategy.The move, already adopted in several German states, would be on a voluntary basis and family doctors would decide how best to administer the vaccine, Mr Spahn said.Dozens of countries paused the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine in March or restricted them to older adults after reports of very rare, but serious, blood clots. Several of them have now resumed use either fully or with restrictions after health regulators said the benefits of the shot outweigh any risks.Mr Spahn also said Germany aimed to offer 12-18 year olds a vaccine by the end of August, provided European regulators give approval for the BioNTechPfizer shot for that age group.So far, 30.6 per cent of Germany’s population of about 83 million has received a first dose and 8.6 per cent are fully vaccinated, Robert Koch Institute data shows.Germany is due to ease restrictions this weekend on people who are fully vaccinated or who have recovered from Covid-19. They will be exempt from a night-time curfew and will no longer need to provide a negative test to go shopping.Germany has been hit by a third wave of the pandemic but the number of new cases is easing off. The 7-day incidence fell to 129 per 100,000 on Thursday, Robert Koch Institute data showed.State of emergencyMeanwhile, Japan’s government is set to extend on Friday a state of emergency in Tokyo and three other areas by about three weeks until the end of May to curb a surge in novel coronavirus cases just months before the start of the Tokyo Olympics.The government had hoped a “short and powerful” state of emergency would contain a fourth wave of infection, but new cases in Tokyo and Osaka prefecture are still at high levels, said economy minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, who is also in charge of pandemic measures.Extending the state of emergency to May 31st from May 11th will leave a margin of fewer than two months before the July 23rd start of the Games, which were postponed by a year due to the pandemic.“Osaka particularly is in quite a dangerous situation with its medical system,” Mr Nishimura said on Friday at the start of a meeting with a panel of medical and economic experts, noting that variant strains are spreading rapidly.“We have a strong sense of danger that Tokyo could soon be turning into the same situation as Osaka.”The panel later approved the extension plan, Mr Nishimura said. Formal government approval is set for later in the day, with prime minister Yoshihide Suga giving a news conference at 7pm (11am Irish time).All hospital beds for critical patients in Osaka prefecture are occupied, public broadcaster NHK reported on Friday, and Nishimura said the medical situation in neighbouring Hyogo prefecture, where the city of Kobe is located, was also poor.In Tokyo, there were 907 new cases of novel coronavirus infection on Friday.Nationwide, Japan has recorded 618,197 cases of infection and about 10,585 deaths from Covid-19, government figures showed. – ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"michel barnier details bewilderment with british approach to brexit talks","story":"Michel Barnier  describes former Taoiseach Leo Varadkar as “courageous”, while  Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney is “always shrewd, methodical and well-informed”. Photograph:  John ThysAFP via Getty ImagesOn Christmas Eve last year, as the Brexit negotiations were entering their final minutes, Michel Barnier sought out his British counterpart in a room in the European Commission’s Berlaymont headquarters.“After nine months of negotiations, it is the last time I would see David Frost and our final exchange is professional and cold,” Barnier, who was chief Brexit negotiator, writes in The Great Illusion: a secret Brexit diary (2016-2020)“He knows I know that until the last moment he has been trying to circumvent me by opening a parallel negotiating track with Ursula von der Leyen’s cabinet. And he knows it has not been successful.”Although he describes Frost as courteous, Barnier makes clear that he neither trusted the British negotiator nor admired his negotiating style. A few weeks earlier, when the British team were refusing to engage with issues of concern to the European side, Barnier told them their negotiating technique was a farce.Throughout his 500-page diary, which is published in French on Thursday and will appear in an English translation in October, Barnier is bewildered by the British approach to the talks. He never wavers from his conviction that Britain made a mistake in leaving the European Union but he is surprised again and again by the incompetence and self-delusion that informed London’s negotiating strategy.When Theresa May declared in Lancaster House that Britain wanted to leave the single market and the customs union but hoped to maintain many of their benefits, he could scarcely believe what he was hearing.“Have the consequences of these decisions been thought through, measured, discussed? Does she realise this rules out almost all forms of cooperation we have with our partners?” he writes.“I am amazed at the way the prime minister has shown her hand.”He is generous towards May, describing her as a courageous woman surrounded by a lot of men putting their personal interests ahead of those of their country. Boris Johnson was one of those men but Barnier is careful not to underestimate him and finds him to be an appealing, if “baroque”, personality.He enjoyed a warm relationship with David Davis but has little complimentary to say about the next Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, whom he describes as having a messianic glint in his eye.When Raab demanded that the Irish Border issue should be resolved as part of an overall agreement, he warned that the EU would otherwise be responsible for the impact of a no-deal Brexit in the North.‘The fault of the UK’“We are searching for solutions together. And Dominic, if this threat is the new line of your government, then the negotiations can end immediately. And I will prepare myself in the coming days to inform the European Parliament and member states. We will regard the failure as being the fault of the UK,” Barnier told him.From the start, the issue of the Border was central to the talks and Barnier is at his most passionate when he describes his personal commitment to the peace process and his feelings when he met people in Northern Ireland.“I promised myself in this negotiation not to fuel the polemics and attacks from the British tabloids, to pay attention to the words I use, to stick to the facts, the figures, the legal fundamentals, in short, to leave little room for emotion and feelings, for the sake of objectivity. But here in Ireland . . . it is difficult not tobe touched by the sensitivity, the emotion of those who express themselves, the memories that remind me of this tragedy,” he writes.Barnier describes former Taoiseach Leo Varadkar as “courageous”, praising his role in the abortion rights referendum. Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney is “always shrewd, methodical and well-informed” and Barnier singles out John Callinan from the Taoiseach’s office and Ireland’s former EU ambassador Declan Kelleher for praise.While May was hamstrung by the need to negotiate every step in the Brexit talks with her own party, Barnier maintained unity among the EU’s member-states by frequent visits to capitals and open channels of communication to the leaders.Johnson’s indifference to the truth and his pursuit of “dead cat” strategies and staged crises complicated the negotiations and when Frost opened the second phase of negotiations he told Barnier that the prime minister did not feel bound by the political declaration he agreed alongside the withdrawal agreement.The Internal Market Act, which included clauses that would have allowed the British government to unilaterally suspend the Northern Ireland protocol, was the trigger for Barnier’s final loss of trust in his negotiating partners. He suggests that Johnson waited until Donald Trump’s election defeat before withdrawing the offending clauses, fearful of their impact on his relationship with Joe Biden.La Grande Illusion – Journal secret du Brexit (2016-2020) is published by Gallimard.

Photograph: Gary GrimshawBailiwick ExpressPA WireThe maritime drama off Jersey kept Britain entertained on Thursday as each of the actors played the parts and recited the lines that have been crowd-pleasers down the ages. 200 years after the death of Napoleon, the British audience saw France slipping easily into its centuries-old character of the eternal adversary while for the French, Britain was performing the only role it knows by heart, that of la perfide Albion.Claude La Vaullée, a French fisherman who has been fishing off Jersey for 40 years, fluffed his lines when he told Ouest France that the flotilla of fishing boats advancing on Jersey was ready to “re-stage the Battle of Trafalgar”, apparently forgetting how it turned out.\u0026nbspJonathan Ruff, a property developer who hopes to open a casino and a strip club in Jersey, sailed out in his pleasure boat to confront what he called “the invaders”. But as he approached the flotilla one of the French trawlers decided to head straight towards him.“I couldn’t believe what he was doing. He deliberately sped up and went straight for me, clipping my bow. If he had hit my engine I would have been in big, big trouble, I could have lost the boat and anything could have happened. “They were out of order, and if it wasn’t for some quick evasive action my boat could have been at the bottom of the channel. He must have known that I would have come off worse if he had hit me – he’s a steel trawler and my boat is only a little pleasure craft. It was totally reckless of him,” he told the Sun“I was just sticking up for the island and doing my patriotic duty. The French shouldn’t be blockading the harbour.\u0026nbspIf the freight ferry doesn’t leave then we will be running low on supplies within a few days.” Former partnersDowning Street, which has been running through spokesmen at a hectic pace in recent weeks, might consider employing Ruff next time there’s a vacancy so perfectly does he channel the government’s attitude to the EU after Brexit. Like Ruff, Britain repeatedly embarks on reckless assaults against its former partners in Europe, only to retreat complaining about the unfairness of it all when the Europeans strike back.Although Britain has actually breached the agreement Boris Johnson signed with the EU last Christmas, even the threat of retaliatory action from Europe is enough to set off a carnival of self-pity in London. French maritime minister Annick Girardin lit the latest fuse on Tuesday when she pointed out that Jersey’s energy is supplied by underwater cables from France, and that the trade agreement allowed for retaliation.“We are ready to use these retaliatory measures. Europe,\u0026nbspFrance has the means, it is written into the agreement. So as far as Jersey is concerned, I would remind you, for example, of the transport of electricity by submarine cables. So we have the means, and sorry it has come to this, we will do so if we have to.”The agreement does not in fact allow for the kind of retaliation Girardin was suggesting, but she gave the British an opportunity to condemn her for making “unacceptable and disproportionate” threats. Johnson’s idea of an proportionate response was to send HMS Severn and HMS Tamar, royal navy patrol ships more than 90m long, each with two large guns, including a short-range anti-aircraft weapon, and usually crewed by 45 sailors and up to 50 marines.It does not take the most jaded cynic to notice that the deployment came on the eve of local elections in England and parliamentary elections in Scotland and Wales, and that it may have done Johnson no harm with part of his electoral base. And as the French fishermen went home on Thursday afternoon, there were signs of compromise as Jersey’s government said all sides were seeking a solution. SkirmishesBut this is unlikely to be the last or the most dangerous of Johnson’s skirmishes with Europe as he seeks to escape the more inconvenient commitments he entered into last Christmas. His problem is that although a belligerent attitude to Europe plays well with many of his voters and most of his MPs, it is at odds with the rest of his foreign policy agenda.This week Britain chaired a G7 foreign ministers’ meeting that produced a strong statement of unity in criticising Russia and China, and Johnson is banking on a successful leaders’ summit in June to launch Global Britain on the world stage. Sending a couple of gunboats to confront your closest military ally in Europe is not an ideal first step to ensuring a triumphant debut.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"uk election blow for labour as conservatives make gains","story":"Conservative’s Jill Mortimer is declared winner in the Hartlepool parliamentary by-election at Mill House Leisure Centre in Hartlepool. Photograph: Owen HumphreysPA WireThe Labour Party has been dealt a crushing blow as the Conservatives continue to make gains in elections across England. The Conservative Party has won the Hartlepool byelection, taking the constituency for the first time since it was created almost 50 years ago.Jill Mortimer defeated Labour candidate Dr Paul Williams by 6,940 votes in what is being seen a blow to Sir Keir Starmer’s leadership.Giving a victory speech after the result, Ms Mortimer said she is “immensely proud to be the first Conservative MP in Hartlepool for 57 years”.She said: “Not only that, I am the first woman ever to be elected as MP for this town. It is a truly historic result and a momentous day.“Labour have taken people in Hartlepool for granted for too long. I heard this time and time again on the doorstep and people have had enough and now, through this result, the people have spoken and have made it clear it is time for change.”The Conservatives have also taken control of Dudley, a council where Labour previously had the highest number of seats. With 22 seats declared of the 26 being contested, the Conservatives have taken 21 and Labour just one.A Labour source said: “These were always going to be tough elections for Labour.“Keir has always been honest about the mountain we must climb to rebuild trust to win the next general election.“Labour is listening and we will continue to change in order to win back the trust of working people in Britain and their communities.”In a sign of the discontent on the Labour left, MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle appeared to mock the party’s attempts to change its image. He said: “Good to see valueless flag waving and suit wearing working so well . . . or not?”Hartlepool was held by Labour with a majority of 3,595 in 2019, even as other bricks in the “red wall” crumbled — in part due to the Brexit Party splitting the Tory vote.Both Mr Johnson and Sir Keir made three visits during the campaign in a sign of the importance the byelection represents to their parties.Meanwhile, counts in more than half of Scotland’s parliamentary constituencies are to begin on Friday as the country awaits the outcome of its most important election since devolution, one that could speed up an independence referendum.Ballots were cast across England, Scotland and Wales on Super Thursday in the largest test of political opinion outside a general election.Votes in some 46 of the 73 constituency seats in Scotland will be counted from about 9am, with the first results expected from noon.It is anticipated all 46 should be declared by Friday evening.Then, from about 9am on Saturday, the remaining 27 constituency seats will be counted, after which the regional seats will be allocated.Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, there is a staggered tallying up of ballots for the 2021 Holyrood election, with all results expected to be declared by Saturday evening.This year’s election is considered to be one of the most important since the Scottish Parliament opened in 1999.With the Scottish National Party (SNP) set for another five years in government, first minister Nicola Sturgeon will no doubt ramp up the pressure on Westminster to grant the powers for another vote on Scottish independence.Her opponents in the Tory, Labour and Liberal Democrat parties have stressed the importance of focusing on Scotland’s recovery from coronavirus instead. But the SNP leader and her party have said no referendum will be held until after the immediate health crisis is over, and they insist powers gained through independence would improve the recovery in Scotland.Ms Sturgeon has said another pro-independence majority in the Scottish Parliament, including the Greens and Alba Party seats, should be enough to let Scots vote again on whether they want to leave the UK.Results of the elections – which also include the Welsh Parliament, police and crime commissioners and English local authorities and mayors – are expected to continue filtering through until Monday as counting will take longer than normal due to coronavirus restrictions.In Wales, Mark Drakeford hopes to maintain Labour’s grip on the Senedd, but he may find himself forced to forge a new coalition to stay as first minister.That could mean talks with Plaid Cymru, whose leader Adam Price has committed to an independence referendum within five years if his party wins a majority.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons may 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Local elections 2021: Tories\u0026#39 new Hartlepool MP says Labour has taken town \u0026#39for granted\u0026#39 after party suffers huge defeat - latest newsScottish election results 2021: counts are underway in critical vote for the UnionCoronavirus latest news: Under-40s vaccine hesitancy behind JCVI advice change on AstraZeneca, GP saysVE Day 2021: The history behind Victory in Europe Day and how to celebrate during Covid-19Idaho school shooting: \u0026#39Absolute blessing\u0026#39 no one dead after pre-teen schoolgirl opens fire on classmatesMay 2021 election results: the maps, charts and data of how your area voted across the UKLondon mayoral election results 2021: the charts and maps that show how the capital votedLocal election results 2021: how your council voted and how the numbers map across EnglandLabour\u0026#39s Hartlepool citadel finally toppled by election \u0026#39aftershock\u0026#39Covid lockdown roadmap: the rules that could change from May 17Keir Starmer running out of time to prove Labour has any point at allComment: After Hartlepool, Keir Starmer must ask himself some difficult questionsTories take Hartlepool in historic Red Wall by-election victoryFriday morning UK news briefing: Another hole in the Red Wall\u0026#39An embarrassment for France\u0026#39 -  Readers on this week\u0026#39s biggest stories Father of four mounts legal bid to enforce age ban to protect children from pornFears over spread of Indian Covid variants in UKThe  weekly news quiz: Which social media platform has upheld its ban on Donald Trump?Online platforms exposing users to \u0026#39avalanche of scams\u0026#39Two sugary drinks a day can double young women’s risk of bowel cancerDouglas Ross: Rebuilding of Scotland must start now, regardless of election resultBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"anyone can see no ones obeying covid rules anymore","story":"You can see it all around you: people disappearing into other people’s houses, without even a furtive glance to see if anyone is watching large groups gathering in defiance of the ‘rule of six’, or perhaps ignorance that it is still in place. People who earlier in the year were studiously following the rules are now breaking them in all kinds of little ways. The public has decided that the Covid emergency is over – at least for now – and are regaining their lives by stealth.By refusing to open up sooner, the government is losing its control of the population. But then was it ever really in control anyway? No doubt Matt Hancock, along with some of the Cabinet’s other native authoritarians, takes personal credit for tackling the Covid crisis by forcing people to socially-distance. Yet evidence points elsewhere: to the public leading the government in efforts to combat the pandemic, not the other way around. Some government advisers have taken to claiming that thousands of lives could have been saved had lockdown been imposed a week earlier than 23 March last year, the day a solemn Boris Johnson told us all to stay at home. But it is a pretty irrelevant argument given that the public had already largely placed itself in self-imposed lockdown.By the following Monday, when the government’s tone changed after the publication of the famous Imperial paper predicting up to 500,000 deaths form Covid, tube usage had already plunged to 60 per cent. By that Friday it had fallen to just 24 per cent as employers and employees between them made voluntary arrangements to work at home, and by the following Monday, ahead of Johnson’s evening address to the nation, it had plummeted to only 15 per cent. By the time lockdown was imposed, in other words, there wasn’t much left to lock down.Just as the public led the government into lockdown, so it is leading the government out of lockdown. Last weekend, car traffic was back up to 96 per cent of pre-pandemic levels – in spite of messages which still flicker, pointlessly, from motorway gantries telling us to “minimise travel”. Light commercial traffic is 14 per cent higher than it was before the pandemic.Those of us who have stood against endless lockdowns, and the petty laws and eyewatering fines used to try to enforce them, have been accused in some quarters of irresponsibility. Yet all we have been doing is appealing for the government to trust our own sense of responsibility rather than try to steamroller us into compliance. With some exceptions, people have shown themselves perfectly able to make their own, reasoned assessment of the risks posed by Covid, and of acting accordingly.The government’s input has been to tie up that process in regulatory knots, ending with bizarre legal debates as to whether a Scotch egg counts as a substantial meal and so on.There are serious dangers from trying to command the public into how to behave. As well as creating the bad feeling which surrounds any illiberal regime, living under endless orders blunts our sense of personal responsibility. Just look how some people rushed out to the pub in the few days before the second lockdown came into effect in November. The last chance to do something legally had encouraged them to take risks they wouldn’t have taken had they been left to themselves to decide what was and what wasn’t safe.There is little purpose to the remaining restrictions on our day to day lives. People can see that the vaccination programme has been a brilliant success and that their risk of coming to serious harm from Covid is now no higher than of succumbing to other diseases. They no longer see why their lives should be put on hold. It is about time the government caught up.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"roars approval footballs three lions get woke makeover","story":"It is a symbol of national pride that has endured for eight centuries, as well as 55 years of hurt. But a decision to change England’s Three Lions crest to promote ersity in football has failed to rouse roars of approval from fans.Bosses at the Football Association announced on Thursday that the traditional Three Lions would be replaced on a brand new logo by a lion cub, a lion and a lioness.The FA said the move would give the medieval crest a “fresh purpose” that would symbolise “inclusivity at all levels of football”.“A cub, lion and lioness unite to form the new England Football crest with no boundaries representing everyone at every level of football across the country,” a spokesman explained.“It symbolises progression, greater inclusivity and accessibility in all levels of the beautiful game from grassroots to elite.”England’s senior football teams would continue to wear the traditional Three Lions badge worn since the first international match in 1872, the FA added. The new crest will be used to promote England Football, a new part of the FA overseeing grassroots football.However, the announcement was met with bemusement and dismay from traditionalist England supporters on social media, with some suggesting that the branding was “PC nonsense”, and others asking: “Who’s offended by a lion?”Many fans suggested that the famous Baddiel and Skinner anthem Three Lions, written for the Euro 96 tournament, would need a hasty rewrite. “A cub, a lion and a lioness on a shirt, Jules Rimet still gleaming,” was a common, if less-than-catchy, suggestion.Another supporter, with tongue possibly in cheek, questioned whether the new logo was in fact erse enough. “Why can’t it be two lions with a cub, or two lionesses? This is not inclusive of alternative wildlife lifestyles. Do better,” the fan wrote.Another fan asked: “If the new crest ‘symbolises progression, greater inclusivity and accessibility in all levels’, then why are the Lions all the same colour?”Some fans responded positively to the new look, however. “Absolutely love it. Beautiful piece of design and a great idea,” one wrote.The FA is understood to have paid Matta, a London design agency, to come up with the new design, which took around 18 months. The cost of the rebrand is unclear.Football chiefs asked the agency to re-imagine the Three Lions in order to promote ersity and capture the “hearts and minds” of supporters across the country.In an interview last month, Kathryn Swarbrick, the FA’s marketing director, said the new logo had gone through several iterations during a difficult redesign process.“We made it a bit more accessible, a bit more informal, and took the inclusivity idea and pushed it along a bit,” she said. “It’ll give you goosebumps.”The new England Football logo will be used for popular grassroots programmes – including McDonald’s SuperKicks, Snickers Just Play, and Weetabix Wildcats. It will appear on the FA’s England Football website as well as literature and branding associated with children’s football and coaching classes.Leading players Harry Kane, Lucy Bronze and Marcus Rashford feature in a new film promoting the England Football project, alongside portraits of grassroots heroes nationwide to “demonstrate the true ersity and fabric of football in England”.Mark Bullingham, chief executive of The FA, said before the launch: “This is a significant change as we unite all our grassroots initiatives and programmes under one banner. England Football will harness the unique ability of the England teams to inspire future generations and positively impact participation at all levels of the game.“Kids want to be the next Steph Houghton, Harry Kane, Nikita Parris or Raheem Sterling. As well as inspiring future generations, England Football’s digital tools will help us to create more opportunities to play, coach and support the game, nationwide.”More from NewsMore from The Back to

independence,  analysis shows. Over the past month, an average of the polls show that 46 per cent of Scots are against independence whilst 45 per cent are in favour. The most recent ten polls conducted widen that gap to 47 per cent opposed and 44 per cent in favour. The proportion of undecided voters has remained steady at around 9 per cent of the population.The results come as a significant change in people\u0027s views on independence. Since early-2020, support for Scottish independence had overtaken opposition, with the Yes vote securing a 8 per lead in average polling numbers in October last year. This resurgence in Scottish nationalism came as the devolved government took a markedly different approach to its handling of the Covid-19 pandemic from Westminster and Brexit. But in recent months, the success of the UK-government\u0027s vaccination rollout and splits within the Scottish nationalist movement appear to have dampened support for independence. Before the resurgence last year, polls has shown clear opposition to independence, even after the EU referendum which saw England and Wales vote in favour of Brexit, whilst Northern Ireland and Scotland voted to remain. In 2014 Scotland voted by a clear majority to stay in the UK, with 55.3 per cent of ballots cast against independence leaving and 44.7 per cent cast in favour, but the most recent polling average now shows the situation reversed. Despite the decline in support for Scottish independence, the Scottish National Party has sustained a considerable gap in the polls ahead of Thursday\u0027s Scottish Parliament elections. An average of the most recent polls show 48.5 per cent of Scots plan to vote for the SNP in their constituencies.This is ahead of the Conservative\u0027s 21.5 per cent, Labour\u0027s 20.3 per cent and the Liberal Democrat\u0027s 7.5 per cent . But similar to independence, the support for the SNP has decreased in the polls in recent months. Read more: \u0027Nicola Sturgeon to plan for Scottish independence on day one if elected\u0027In October last year, their polling numbers averaged at around 54 per cent. Labour have benefited most from this slump in the polls, having increased their polling numbers by 5 per cent over the period. Scottish voters will also vote for regional members of the Scottish Parliament with polls similarly showing a significant gap between the SNP and the second-place Conservatives. During the last election in 2016, the SNP fells two seats short of an overall majority in the Scottish Parliament. The fall in the polls could hamper hopes of claiming a majority in the elections which would have been used as justification for seeking a second referendum vote. In January, the SNP proposed an 11-point roadmap for holding a second referendum if they secure a majority in the Parliament. Since then, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been engaged in a bitter conflict with former SNP leader Alex Salmond over sexual harassment claims against the latter. Ms Sturgeon was cleared of breaking rules over her handling of the allegations but was heavily criticised by some members of the Scottish Parliament. In the aftermath, Mr Salmond went on to form his own independence party, Alba, which is also contesting in today\u0027s Scottish election.   More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and

Iran in order to bring home jailed dual nationals including Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori, the US Secretary of State said. Anthony Blinken has said the choice to pay the £400 million debt was a “sovereign decision for the United Kingdom”,  in remarks that apparently lift a key barrier to any agreement to bring the prisoners home.Speaking on Radio Four’s Today programme, Mr Blinken said he would not comment on the details of that case, but emphasised that the US was seeking to revive the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran that Donald Trump quit in 2018.“We’ve been engaged in Vienna for some weeks with our European partners, Russia and China, and indirectly with Iran,” he said.British Iranian-dual nationals currently jailed in Iran including Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a charity worker from north London Mr Ashoori, a London-based businessman and Morad Tahbaz, the co-founder of the Persian Wildlife Heritage foundation, who also holds US citizenship.All have faced opaque charges of espionage or contact with foreign governments, which they deny.The families of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Mr Ashoori say they are innocent and being held as political hostages to force the UK to pay the debt, which dates back to an unfulfilled 1970s arms deal and which Britain has acknowledged in court that it owes.Mr Blinken’s remarks will be seen as encouraging because one stumbling block to settling the debt is believed to be US sanctions against Iran, which have deterred many international banks from facilitating trade with the country.On Sunday, Iranian state media cited an anonymous official source saying a deal to release the prisoners in exchange for payment of the debt, alongside a similar deal with the US to release Americans in exchange for unfreezing of Iranian assets, was close to being agreed.The report was later denied by the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Iranian foreign ministry.Iran and Britain have never officially admitted a direct link between the debt and the charges against the British dual nationals, although relatives say it has been made clear to the prisoners themselves.Mr Blinken was speaking after a three-day summit with fellow G7 leaders in London, and shortly before he flew on to Ukraine for talks with president Volodymyr Zelenskiy.Speaking in Kyiv, he warned that the United States may ramp up security assistance to this country in the aftermath of Russia’s worrying military build-up.In April Moscow amassed some 80,000 troops and military equipment along the Ukrainian border and in occupied Crimea in the strongest show of force since the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine broke out in 2014, killing more than 13,000 people.Ukrainian officials have since been pushing for Washington to expand its military aid in the face of possible Russian aggression.“We’ll continue to strengthen our security partnership and in-flux collaboration with you to make sure Ukraine can defend itself against aggression,” he said, urging Russia to “cease reckless and aggressive actions,” Mr Blinken said at the meeting.He also said that although Russia had withdrawn some troops from the border, “significant forces remain there and Russia appeared to be signalling that “it has the capacity on a fairly short notice to take aggressive action if it so chooses.”President Zelenskiy told Mr Blinken of a persisting threat from Russia, adding that Ukraine has intelligence of about 3,500 Russian troops being pulled back while an estimated 75,000 are still stationed not far from the border.Mr Blinken, the first top US official to travel to Ukraine since President Biden’s election, on Thursday morning visited Kyiv’s memorial to fallen Ukrainian soldiers who died in the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine between Ukrainian government troops and Russia-backed separatists.President Zelenskiy tweeted ahead of the visit that Ukraine needs a clear commitment about Ukraine’s future membership in Nato and the EU.“Postponing these issues for ‘later’, ‘some day, ‘in ten years’, has to end,” he said.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off

map","story":"Thousands of seats are up for grabs across local councils in England in what is being dubbed Super Thursday. More than 4,500 seats in 143 council areas will be contested, a larger than usual number due to last year\u0027s elections being delayed by the coronavirus pandemic. The elections are part of a plethora of polls occurring across the UK, including for the Welsh Senedd, Scottish Parliament and the London Assembly. Results for councils will start coming in throughout Friday and into the weekend, so make sure you check in to see how your area has voted. Not every local authority is contested in the election but almost two-thirds of the English population are living somewhere with some form of an election. The results will determine which party leads on important local issues such as planning permission, parks and economic development. In areas voting for county and metropolitan councils, it will decide who leads on schools, social care and public health. Politically, these elections represent the first major challenge for Prime Minister Boris Johnson since the start of the coronavirus pandemic and the UK\u0027s exit from the EU. For Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, it will mark his first round of elections since he took on the role a year ago. Currently, Labour has the most to lose, with 53 contested councils under their control, compared to 47 held by the Conservatives and six by the Liberal Democrats.All eyes will be on the results from the Red Wall – Labour heartlands that swung to the Conservatives at the 2019 general election. Key marginals in the region include Dudley, Northumberland and Derby, which a YouGov poll on May 1 found were likely Conservative wins. Other prominent red bricks in the wall, including Bury, Hyndburn and Lincoln, are also likely to fall, including threatened majorities in Wolverhampton, Sheffield, and Warrington.Further south, Labour will hope to fare better in places such as Nottinghamshire. All of the county council\u0027s seats were contested on Thursday, with Labour hoping to take it back from the Conservatives. The Liberal Democrats – who are fielding the third largest amount of candidates – will also hope to make gains after their support collapsed following their participation in the coalition government between 2010 and 2015. Also competing for the first time is Nigel Farage\u0027s Reform UK – the re-branded Brexit Party – which is fielding around 250 candidates across England. Here are the estimated times expected for declarations across the UK: Our results data are provided by the Press Association. Changes are calculated against a council\u0027s or parliament\u0027s composition at the time of the election, rather than against the composition resulting from the previous election.

Here in Britain, we’ve not had anywhere near the same level of debate on this question as the US, where extraordinary levels of fiscal and monetary stimulus – broadly similar to those seen during major wars – are being deliberately applied to the challenge of boosting endemically low levels of investment, this in the hope of transitioning workers away from dead end, low paid jobs into higher value forms of employment. In this sense, Joe Biden’s grand “build back better” plan is not so different, at least in its intentions, from Boris Johnson’s “levelling up” agenda. Only it is better defined, and as is the American way, a good sight more welly is being put behind it.As it happens, running the economy hot is not as much of a departure from prevailing monetary and fiscal orthodoxy as it might seem. The precedent has already been set by Donald Trump, who thought nothing of juicing an economy that didn’t obviously need it with a bumper package of tax cuts. It wasn’t the disaster many predicted defying the textbooks, inflation remained tame in the face of strongly rising employment.Biden is betting on something similar. Not until the economy reaches melting point does he intend to take his foot off the accelerator.There was good news yesterday from the Bank of England, which forecast that the UK economy would be back to pre-Covid levels of output by the end of the year, much faster than anyone dared hope even a few months back. After a record collapse in GDP, we are about to see record strong levels of growth. But cheering though that thought might be, we merely end up back where we started. In the meantime, we have still missed out on two years of growth.Nor would anyone think that the pre-pandemic economy was in any way the sort of model you would want to aspire to. Ten years of fiscal belt-tightening and rigorously pursued inflation targeting had brought us back close to full employment by the time the pandemic hit, but productivity and wage growth had stalled, regional and wealth inequalities had widened, work had become increasingly insecure and part time, and chronic deprivation had become the defining feature of many left behind communities.Unless such failings are answered, levelling up will never amount to any more than a cynical political slogan. So once again, might running the economy hot be part of the solution? By this is meant not just borrowing to spend – the UK is for the moment already doing herculean levels of that – but also turning a blind eye to inflationary risks, or even at least temporarily tolerating somewhat higher levels of inflation in the hope of kickstarting wage growth and therefore tech driven investment in higher productivity output.This is the attitude that seems to have taken hold in the US, whose central bank, the Federal Reserve, in any case has a less rigid approach to inflation targeting. By taking the view that a prolonged overshoot is fine if making up for a previous undershoot, the Fed has already quite significantly shifted the goal posts. A certain amount of inflation is no bad thing. Too little, and spending decisions are delayed, causing the economy to stall. Too much, on the other hand, and money becomes increasingly worthless. Savings are destroyed, and the wheels of commerce progressively struggle to turn. But who is to say that 2 per cent, the level targeted by most central banks, is the right one? Why not 3 per cent, or even 4 or 5?For the moment, the Bank of England appears willing to give growth a go. There is no overt tightening in policy flagged in its latest forward projections, despite the much improved outlook. But that’s only because the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee sees inflationary pressures as temporary, with both growth and inflation returning to pre-pandemic normal sometime next year. Definitely lacking is any notion of deliberately running the economy hot, or indeed any pressure from the Government for the Bank to do so.In some respects, their caution is understandable the Treasury still cannot quite believe what it has already got away with – more than £400 billion of pandemic related spending, virtually all of it financed by Bank of England money printing. Is that not risky enough? Perhaps best not to stretch the boundaries of currency and bond market tolerance any further by also seeming to ignore the inflation target.Whether narrow inflation targeting remains entirely relevant to the fast changing economic, political and social demands of our post-Covid world is nonetheless an ever more pressing question. Economic orthodoxies never rule for ever, and indeed tend to become positively damaging if obstinately resistant to new thinking and reform. Sudden change would be unwise, but the Bank must play its part along with everyone else in supporting post-pandemic growth.

Boris Johnson is expected to unveil the first green list of holiday hotspots as the Government prepares to reopen foreign travel after months of lockdown.Sun-seekers will get the first confirmation of where they can go for a foreign break, with the ban on international travel expected to lt in England after May . There has been a lot of speculation about when - and how - people will be allowed to go on holiday safely. Covid outbreaks abroad and lower vaccination rates in some popular holiday destinations have worried ministers as they consider when to reopen the borders. But the success of the UKaposs jabs rollout has raised hopes that travel can begin to reopen with some strict rules in place. Here we sort the facts from the fiction ahead of the official announcement. When will the green list be announced  The UK Governmentaposs green, amber and red lists for foreign travel are currently expected to be published this Friday, with a possible No press conference. The three lists will decide whether people have to quarantine in a hotel, self-isolate at home, or not quarantine at all when ing to the UK from dferent countries. This is a big change to the current system, which bans foreign travel from the UK unless it’s for an essential reason. For those essential travellers, countries are effectively red or amber at the moment - there’s no green list. The new system is currently due to take effect on May  in England, however some dferences may apply across the devolved administrations. Nicola Sturgeon has said she backs a four-nations approach but she would only support the “right” system for Scotland. How does the green list system work for travellers  Countries will be ranked using a traffic light-style system, based on the risks from each destination. People visiting a green list country will not have to quarantine when theyhome - making these places a much simpler and safer choice for a holiday. You will still have to take a test before travelling, as well as a gold-standard PCR test on or before day  of your arrival back at home. These lab-based tests are more accurate - but more expensive - than the free lateral flow tests that are now widely available. For amber countries, ing travellers will have to quarantine at home for up to  days. You can halve your isolation time by paying for a PCR test on day . You still have to take a test before travelling home and tests on day  and you are doing the full -day quarantine.  People coming back from red list countries must book a -night stay in a Government approved quarantine hotel. The cost starts at £, for solo travellers. You must still get tested on day  and  but you cannot leave quarantine early evenyou test negative. The Government advises everyone to book their tests before travel from one of its approved private providers, with a list available on gov.uk. What countries will be on the green list on May   We don’t know yet - but we do know the green list published this Friday will include only a handful of the safest countries from May . A government source said the initial list for May  will “play it safe”, adding: “It is a very cautious, initial list that will develop. It will be fairly underwhelming at first.” There has been a lot of speculation about what countries could make it onto the green list in recent days, based mostly on the state of the virus in these places. Reports have suggested that places like Portugal, Israel, Malta and Gibraltar could be on the green list for May . Meanwhile, Spain, Greece and France could be added by the end of June, according to the . Separate Foreign Office advice published on Tuesday gave a hint of the direction of travel. It is not advising against non-essential travel to Portugal , Spainaposs Canary Islands or the Greek islands of Rhodes, Kos, Zante, Corfu and Crete. Tourists visiting these popular hotspots do not face a level of risk for coronavirus that is unacceptably high, according to the latest updates from the Foreign Office.How will things change in June  Reviews of the green, amber and red lists are being pencilled in roughly every three weeks. That means more countries look set to be added near the beginning - and then again near the end - of June. This is being described as a “big bang” that could open up travel much more widely as the summer ticks on. While there is a green ‘watchlist’ for nations at risk of turning amber, it’s likely to have no countries on it on May . How will the the list be decided  Officials are poring over the data to decide which countries are safest to visit. They will base their decision on a number of factors, including infection rates, the percentage of the population that has been vaccinated and whether there are iants of concern. The countryaposs access to reliable scientic data will also play a role, the Government has said. Ministers including Grant Shapps and Matt Hancock are due to sign off the green, amber and red lists on Thursday. As of Tuesday, it is understood that a draft list had not yet been given to ministers by the Joint Biosecurity Centre. Somy destination is on the green list, am I totally clear to travel  No. That’s not enough on its own. Your travel plans will also depend on Covid rules in the country you want to visit. Some of those countries could make you quarantine on arrival at your destination - rendering any kind of holiday pretty much pointless. Fortunately, the EU has unveiled plans to let in anyone who’s had both doses of a vaccine for at least  days. In addition to this, Britain is being tipped to join an EU list of ‘safe’ countries whose residents will be allowed to go on holiday in the EU, even without a vaccine. This could prove crucial for under-s in the UK, who are only expected to get their second doses towards the end of the summer. Could countries go down the lists as well as up  Yes. Ministers will try to put a wobbly green country on a fourth list - the ‘green watchlist’ - before turning it amber, to give families time to change their plans. But sources warned they would not hesitate to plunge a safe country straight into amber or redneeded. And there is no guarantee that countries on the green list on May  will still be on it later in the summer.

With a dozen councils declared, Labour lost seats across the board as the Tories seized control of key marginal councils in Harlow and Nuneaton. And the partyaposs , majority in Westminster seat Hartlepool was smashed to pieces as Boris Johnsonaposs party took the seat - turning blue for the first time in its history.But Labour now faces a battle with its left after sources said the answer was to accelerate the change away from the days of Jeremy Corbyn.Shadow Cabinet minister Steve Reed told ITVaposs Good Morning Britain: Now weaposve started to make change, it clearly hasnapost gone fast enough or far enough and thataposs what weaposll need to do next. We have an electoral mountain to climb - it feels to me like weaposre still in the foothills. Weaposre going in the right direction but we have to now, at pace, go much, much, much faster. Only a tiny fraction of results have been counted so far, with more than  councils yet to even start thumbing through ballots - and counts running right up until Sunday night. The Welsh and Scottish Parliaments have not yet started counting their votes either. Nor have the key mayoral elections in West Midlands and Tees Valley.So what has happened so far and why is it being characterised as such a bad night for Labour  Hereaposs what you need to know.. Humiliated Keir Starmer is promising to aposaccelerateapos the break from Corbyn Keir Starmer risks a new split with the Labour left after vowing to accelerate the change away from the days of Jeremy Corbyn.A Labour source said: Weaposve said all along the North East and the Midlands would be dficult. But, the message from voters is clear and we have heard it - Labour has not yet changed nearly enough for voters to place their trust in us. We understand that. We are listening. And we will now redouble our efforts. “Labour must now accelerate the programme of change in our party, to win back the trust and faith of working people across Britain. “People don’t want to hear excuses. Keir has said he will take responsibility for these results – and he will take responsibility for fixing it and changing the Labour Party for the better.”  In a sign of the discontent on the Labour left, MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle appeared to mock the partyaposs attempts to change its image. He said: Good to see valueless flag waving and suit wearing working so well ... or not  Andrew Scattergood of Momentum, the group set up to support Jeremy Corbyn, said: This result is a disaster. In , we won over % of the vote in Hartlepool. A transformative socialist message has won in Hartlepool before, and it would have won again. Starmeraposs strategy of isolating the left and replacing meaningful policy with empty buzzwords has comprehensively failed. If he doesn’t change direction, not only will he be out of a job - but the Labour Party may be out of Government forever. . Hartlepool has gone blue for the first time in its history Now onto the actual results.Keir Starmer has suffered a brutal defeat in the Hartlepool by-election, following a grim night of results for Labour. Tory candidate Jill Mortimer easily overturned Labour’s , from the  general election - extending it to a , majority of her own and increasing the Tory vote by %. It represents as % swing from Labour to the Tories. Ms Mortimer secured , votes, defeating Labour candidate Dr Paul Williams - an ardent Remain campaigner standing in the heavily Brexit-backing seat. He got , - on a strong turnout of .%Polls and pundits had long predicted the defeat - which came after Labour only held on to the seat in  because the Brexit Party split the right-wing vote.But the massive scale of the defeat shocked party insiders. In her victory speech, Ms Mortimer said: Labour have taken the people of Hartlepool for granted for too long. I heard it on the doorstep time and time again. And theyaposve had enough.  . Labour lost seats across the first English councils to declare Labour lost seats on seven of the first dozen councils to declare - and gained on just two.This included losing a whopping  seats in traditional bellwether Nuneaton and Bedworth - which the Tories won from No Overall Control, gaining  seats.

The Tories are having a great night, gaining three councils out of  Harlow was solidly Labour-controlled and was tipped to go into no overall control on a good night for the Tories. Instead it swung all the way to blue control after seven seats changed hands.Nuneaton and Bedworth was once a bellwether in general elections but the Tories snatched it out of no overall control.And Northumberland was taken by the Tories out of no overall control too.The Tories seized Redditch from Labour in , so on a good night Keir Starmer’s party would want to make in-roads there.

The ‘Super Thursday’ elections were far bigger than normal - because they included thousands of contests which were postponed from May  due to Covid.The bumper results will be the first ballot box test of Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer since the pandemic - and both leaders have been out heavily on the trail, especially in Hartlepool. The results are set to take up to four days to all be declared.The sheer complexity of this yearaposs elections means dreaming any kind of tactical voting guide is almost impossible. Not only are some people filling in several ballot papers at once, the votes for each one get counted under dferent systems. While ultimately youaposll decide who to vote for, your decision could be swayed by knowing how that vote is tallied up. So to make things easier, hereaposs a guide to what those ballot papers mean, where they will end up - and what battles lie ahead for the Tories and Labour.  English councils More than , seats are up for grabs on  county,  unitary,  metropolitan and  district councils in England. Some are electing the whole council, some half their councillors and some only a third.At first glance Tories and Labour have similar amounts at stake - Conservatives are defending slightly more seats while Labour are defending slightly more councils in control.But the Tories made big gains in , the last time many of these same seats were up for grabs - so Labour should be regaining ground this time.  Key battles will be over the  councils in “no overall control” as the main parties try to seize a majority. More than half the seats up for grabswere meant to be elected in  but delayed due to Covid. Likewise, seats in play include  council by-elections that were delayed by the pandemic. WHERE  Almost everywhere in England.HOW TO VOTE  Councillors are elected for each “ward” using first-past-the-post. Mark one or more Xsnext to the people you want to win in your ward. Usually the big parties put up as many candidates in each ward as there are seats. But some might fall short this year due to Covid.Scottish Parliament All  seats in the Scottish Parliament are up for grabs and Nicola Sturgeon will be hoping to win an overall majority - which she’s just short of now.Polls leave little doubt the SNP will be the largest party. Butthe nationalists up their seat tally from  to , they will have the authority to push for a new independence referendum - seven years after last losing their fight to break away from the UK.However, they’re also facing a fight with Alex Salmond who wants his new Alba party to win seats for a “super-majority” for independence. Labour, with new leaders Keir Starmer and Anas Sarwar, must improve its current third-place standingbehind the Tories it has any hope of a revival in Scotland.  WHERE  Everywhere in Scotland.HOW TO VOTE  Voters get two ballot papers. The purple ballot paper is for your constituency - mark an X for your favoured candidate.  MSPs are elected in this way under winner-takes-all, first-past-the-post. The orange ballot paper is for your region - mark an X for your favoured party. The other  MSPs are elected in this way under a proportional formula. Parties decide who gets to take their regional seats.Welsh Parliament All  seats are up for grabs and polls suggest Labour - while the biggest party - has an uphill struggle to win an overall majority. First Minister Mark Drakeford has ruled out an independence referendum as the price of any pact, but could need a deal with Plaid Cymru or the Lib Demshe’s to form a minority government. This is one of UKIP’s last outposts, where ex-Tory Neil Hamilton clings on for Nigel Farage’s old party even after he abandoned it.  WHERE  Everywhere in Wales.HOW TO VOTE  The system is roughly the same as for the Scottish Parliament - every voter gets two votes, one for a candidate in their constituency and another for the party in their region. Voters first choose their constituency memberthen the party they want on a regional list .London Assembly All  seats are up for election and Labour will be straining for an overall majority - the party’s currently one seat short on . Polling has suggested Labour is at least  points ahead of the Tories which should lead to a comfortable victory. But the ‘list’ system introduces unknowns and allows voters to give a leg up to smaller parties.The Greens and ‘ Brexit Alliance’ each have two seats on the Assembly. WHERE  Everywhere in Greater London.HOW TO VOTE  The system is similar to the Scottish and Welsh Parliaments. Voters get two ballot papers - yellow for a named candidate in their constituencyand orange for a party on the London-wide list . Mark one X on each ballot paper. Again, constituency candidates are chosen by first-past-the-post and the parties choose their “list” members. Seats on the list are dished out using a complex algorithm called the ‘Modied d’Hondt Formula’. mayors in EnglandLondonaposs mayoral election leads the field, where Labour’s Sadiq Khan is on course for the biggest personal mandate of any UK politician.Voters are also electing four metro mayors in Labour-held Greater Manchester and Liverpool City Region, and Tory-held Tees Valley and West Midlands. Labour hopes for a Red Wall upset to seize West Midlands. There are three combined authority mayoral elections - Tory-held West of England and Cambridgeshire  Peterborough, along with new mayoralty West Yorkshire.  And finally five single-authority mayors - all currently held by Labour - are up for election in Bristol, Liverpool, Salford, Doncaster and North Tyneside. This means some people, like in Liverpool and Salford, will be asked to vote for two mayors at the same time. WHERE  Everywhere in the huge regions of Greater London, Greater Manchester, West Midlands Combined Authority, Tees Valley Combined Authority, Liverpool City Region, West Yorkshire, and Cambridgeshire  Peterborough. Plus Bristol, North Tyneside and Doncaster.HOW TO VOTE  For each mayor, voters get one ballot paper with two columns under the supplementary voting system. Mark an X in the first column for your first-choice candidate and -you want to - an X in the second column for your second preference. If no candidate gets % of votes straight away, all candidates except the top two will be eliminated. If your first preference has been knocked out, but your second preference is still in the top two, then your vote will be “moved” to your backup choice. Whoever has the most votes after this wins the mayoralty. police commissioners Everywhere in England and Wales votes for one - except London where the mayor is also the Commissioner. The oft-forgotten jobs are up for election for the third time since they were created in . When they first emerged  were Independents but that shrank to just three in . Labour won  of the posts last time while the Tories won . But given their role as one single person overseeing police, these jobs will end up as a sideshow to the main political news of election night. WHERE  Everywhere in England and Wales except London.HOW TO VOTE  The same way as for the  mayors. Voters get one ballot paper with two columns under the supplementary voting system. Mark an X in the first column for your first-choice candidate and -you want to - an X in the second column for your second preference. If no candidate gets % of votes straight away, all candidates except the top two will be eliminated. If your first preference has been knocked out, but your second preference is still in the top two, then your vote will be “moved” to your backup choice. Whoever has the most votes after this becomes police commissioner.Hartlepool by-election "},{"url":null,"title":"local election results full summary","story":"NewsLocal election results in full: Summary of all polls in England, Scotland and Wales so farThe first results are in and its been a brutal night for Labour and Keir Starmer so far.

While only a handful of English councils were declaring overnight - fewer than  out of  - none of them so far have held any kind of breakthrough for Labour, despite the party hoping to regain seats it lost in .Labour lost seats on six of the first  councils to declare - and gained on just two. This included losing a whopping  seats in traditional bellwether Nuneaton and Bedworth - which the Tories won from No Overall Control, gaining  seats. The Tories snatched Harlow in Essex from Labour after seven seats changed hands and took Northumberland from no overall control. And Dudley - where Labour and the Tories were practically neck and neck before today - went to the Tories with a massive cull of red seats. Conservatives now have  seats, almost double Labouraposs . Labouraposs vote share plunged % and the Tories rose % in the Doncaster mayor election while Labour lost nine seats in its heartland of Sunderland. Itaposs now retains control of the council by under a dozen seats. Labour today vowed to press on with Keir Starmeraposs project of taking the party away from where it was left by Jeremy Corbyn.A Labour source said: We’ve said all along the North East and the Midlands would be dficult. We also said the places declaring Thursday would be particularly dficult. “But, the message from voters is clear and we have heard it. Labour has not yet changed nearly enough for voters to place their trust in us. “We understand that. We are listening. And we will now redouble our efforts.  “Labour must now accelerate the programme of change in our party, to win back the trust and faith of working people across Britain. People don’t want to hear excuses. Keir has said he will take responsibility for these results – and he will take responsibility for fixing it and changing the Labour Party for the better.

Most important perhaps are the thousands of power struggles at local council level that will never make national headline news. Results will start appearing in the early hours of Friday, but counting is slower than usual due to Covid restrictions and the number of dferent elections - up to four or five in some areas. It’s thought the full picture may not be known until late in the weekend or Monday. So with this labyrinth of results, how on earth are you supposed to keep up and interpret it all  Hereaposs our hour-by-hour guide breaking things down into manageable chunks. With thanks to PA Media and the Local Government Information Unit for parts of the information. Timings are only approximate estimates and could y wildly!  ENGLISH COUNCILS: More than , seats are up for grabs on  county,  unitary,  metropolitan and  district councils in England. Some are electing the whole council, some half their councillors and some only a third. Conservatives are defending slightly more seats while Labour are defending slightly more councils in control. But the Tories made big gains in , the last time many of these same seats were up for grabs - so Labour should be regaining this time. Boris Johnson has told Tory activists to brace for a tough night. Key battles will be over  councils in “no overall control”. More than half the seats up for grabswere meant to be elected in  but delayed due to Covid. Likewise, seats include  by-elections that were delayed by the pandemic. WHERE  Almost everywhere in England.SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT: All  seats are being chosen and Nicola Sturgeon will be hoping to win an overall majority - which she’s just short of now. Polls leave little doubt the SNP will be the largest party but Opinium say an overall majority is too close to call. If the nationalists up their seat tally from  to , they will push for a new independence referendum - seven years after last losing their fight. However, they’re also facing a fight with Alex Salmondaposs Alba party which wants a “super-majority” for independence. Labour, with new leader Anas Sarwar, is trailing in third place on  seats but isnapost expecting to leapfrog the Tories after hitting rock bottom last year - instead the party wants a  to rebuild. WHERE  Everywhere in Scotland.WELSH PARLIAMENT: All  seats are up for grabs and polls suggest Labour - while the biggest party - has an uphill struggle to win an overall majority. First Minister Mark Drakeford has ruled out an independence referendum as the price of any pact, but could need a deal with Plaid Cymru or the Lib Demshe’s to form a minority government. This is one of UKIP’s last outposts, where ex-Tory Neil Hamilton clings on for Nigel Farage’s old party even after he abandoned it. WHERE  Everywhere in Wales. ENGLISH MAYORS: Londonaposs mayoral election is the biggest but Labour’s Sadiq Khan is on course for an easy victory. The biggest battles are over Tory-held Tees Valley and West Midlands. Labour wants a Red Wall upset to seize West Midlands but hopes appear slim in Tees Valley. Voters are also electing two other metro mayors in Labour-held Greater Manchester and Liverpool City Region. There are three combined authority mayoral elections - Tory-held West of England and Cambridgeshire  Peterborough, along with new mayoralty West Yorkshire., where Labour MP an ex-soap star Tracy Brabin wants a win. And finally five single-authority mayors - all currently held by Labour - are up for election in Bristol, Liverpool, Salford, Doncaster and North Tyneside. WHERE  Everywhere in the regions of Greater London, Greater Manchester, West Midlands, Tees Valley, Liverpool City Region, West Yorkshire, and Cambridgeshire  Peterborough. Plus Bristol, North Tyneside and Doncaster.HARTLEPOOL BY-ELECTION: The blockbuster Westminster ballot. Eyebrow-raising polls are tipping the Tories want to wipe out Labour’s , majority in the Brexit-backing northern seat - which has been red since its creation in  - with as much as a -point lead. If Labour candidate, the former MP Dr Paul Williams, fails Boris Johnson will hail it as a coup. Pollsters though point out the vote was split by the Brexit Party in , so the seat might otherwise have fallen to the Tories back then. WHERE  Only the Hartlepool Westminster constituency. LONDON ASSEMBLY: All  seats are up for election and Labour will be straining for an overall majority - the party’s currently one seat short on . Polling has suggested Labour is at least  points ahead of the Tories but the ‘list’ system introduces unknowns and allows voters to give a leg up to smaller parties. The Greens and ‘ Brexit Alliance’ each have two seats on the Assembly. WHERE  Everywhere in Greater London. POLICE COMMISSIONERS: The oft-forgotten jobs are up for election for the third time since they were created in . When they first emerged  were Independents but that shrank to just three in . Labour won  of the posts last time while the Tories won . But given their role as one single person overseeing police - and the fact many are being declared last - these jobs will end up as a sideshow to the main political news of election weekend. WHERE  Everywhere in England and Wales except Greater London and Greater Manchester, where the mayor is also the commissioner. Thursday  May: From pm Put the kettle on and keep it near for  hours. Polls closed at pm across Great Britain and counting starts for the Hartlepool by-election, Doncaster mayor and  of  English councils. Unlike in normal years, most results will only start being counted on Friday morning - and in some cases much later. This is because there are more elections than usualand counting is much slower .Friday  May: From amResults start trickling in from the  overnight councils in England.They include Derby which has swung from Labour to Tory-run no overall controlin recent years. And Southend has been run by a Labour, Lib Dem and Green ‘rainbow coalition’ since the Tory leader was voted out in . Likewise the Tories only need a few gains to take back Colchester from a Labour-Lib Dem coalition.Harlow is solidly Labour-controlled but has backed Conservatives in the past - could it slip into NOC on a good night for Tories  Labour meanwhile will be eyeing Thurrock , run by Tories but which has swung back and forth into NOC over the years. And the Tories seized Redditch from Labour in , so on a good night Keir Starmer’s party would want to make in-roads there. Labour strongholds Gateshead , Newcastle, Knowsley, Sunderland, Oldham, South Tyneside and Rochdale all declare early. Friday  May: From am The Hartlepool by-election result is due around am. If the Tories overturn Labour’s , majority and claim the Westminster seat for the first time in its history, it will likely lead the day’s news and be a big political headache for Keir Starmer. We should get our first mayor result in the Doncaster mayoral election, currently held by Labour. And we could get some of the most interesting of the overnight council results, including Dudley where Labour and the Tories are almost neck-and-neck. Also declaring at sunrise are Stockport , a Labour-Lib Dem split in NOC, and Nuneaton  Bedworth which could go red, blue or NOC. On a good night the Tories will want to seize control of Northumberland where they rule in a minority. Friday  May: From amIf you’ve stayed up overnight, go to bed. No more results are likely during the morning. But from am, counting begins for an avalanche of races - all  seats for the Welsh Parliament, half the London Assembly,  of the  constituencies for the Scottish Parliament, and  councils in England. Counting also starts for three of the  elections for police and crime commissioners, and the Liverpool mayor. Friday  May: From Noon Lunchtime council results start rolling in, including Burnley where Labour only needs one more seat to take control. Tories only need small gains to take control of Bolton but it won’t be an easy fight. Red fortress Manchester declares in the early afternoon as do less strongly Labour-held Rossendale and Tory Devon .Castle Point is a straight fight between Tories and the powerful Canvey Island independents who want their own council. Meanwhile we’ll get the mayor of Liverpool, a Labour stronghold but home to a furious row over the party’s selection of their candidate.Many of the most important Scottish Parliament results will roll in at some point on Friday afternoon.They include Dumbarton where Labour’s deputy leader Jackie Baillie clung on by whisker against the SNP in . Labour are likewise fighting hard to defend Edinburgh Southern and East Lothian against an SNP challenge. Despite speculation of a three-way fight, they believe either the SNP or Tories will take Edinburgh Central .Eastwood was a three-way fight in , won by the Scottish Tories. The big name race is in Glasgow Southside where new leader Anas Sarwar is challenging First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. He’ll lose, but get in on the regional list system instead and Labour are hoping to dent the SNP majority.Friday  May: From pmWe’re due the first results from Wales, including the Parliament’s most marginal seat Llanelli where Plaid Cymru are challenging Labour. Welsh Labour will also be fighting off the Tories in Wrexham , a key brick in a so-called red wall.Elsewhere, we’ll start getting the first seven results for the London Assembly and the first police commissioners in Avon and Somerset and Staffordshire. And an avalanche of English council results begins as the afternoon wears on. Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire turned blue recently and a strong Labour performance should at least kick them into NOC. Ex-minister Edwina Currie - yes her! - is standing against Labour ex-MP Ruth George to become a Derbyshire councillor. Seizing back Trafford from the Tories was Labour’s big victory in  so the party must hold on now to avoid a reverse humiliation.Cornwall is run by a Lib Dem-Independent coalition but the Tories have the most seats and will be hoping to gain. Ex-UKIP territory Basildon will be a hard Labour-Tory fight but could stay in NOC. On a bad night for Labour the party could lose Bury , Sheffield or West Lancashire to NOC, while Tories could gain Maidstone in a tussle with Lib Dems. Tories have no seats in Sheffield or Sandwell - will they up their count to one Friday  May: From pm The Tees Valley metro mayor result is due, with Tory Ben Houchen tipped to hang on against his Labour challenger in the former ‘red wall’. And in Wales we’ll get the Labour marginals of Caerphilly and Vale of Clwyd where Plaid and Tories respectively are putting up a fight. Lib Dems are also defending their only seat in Brecon and Radnorshire - and will Rhondda stay Plaid in the Valleys Over in England, about  councils are due to declare in the space of just  minutes.The biggest races include Norfolk , Cambridgeshire , Essex, counties up for all-out election that are Tory-run but could give Labour inroads.Cambridge also has all its seats up for election in a battle between Labour and the Lib Dems. On good nights for the main parties, Labour could win Wirral and Crawley or the Tories could win Pendle and Elmbridge from NOC. Labour’s first county, Durham , should stay red - as should Doncaster but the Tories might look for small in-roads asall its seats are up. Labour only need to lose a few seats in Plymouth to lose to NOC but the Tories wouldn’t be able to form a majority. Likewise Tory-run Walsall could fall to NOC on a bad night for Boris Johnson.Solihull is unusual - it’s Tory-run but with a Green opposition and the Conservatives will lose controlthey’re docked one seat.Friday  May: From pmMore than a dozen final results flood in for the Welsh Parliament, making clear whether Labour will need to form a coalition.Key declarations include Tory target Vale of Glamorgan and First Minister Mark Drakeford’s seat Cardf West. Likewise by the end of the night we’ll have results for  of the  Scottish Parliament seats, giving some early indication of whether Nicola Sturgeon’s on course for an outright majority.About a dozen more English council results should come in during the evening including Hull, where Labour want to keep Lib Dems at bay.Mole Valley has slim Lib Dem control with a Tory and Independent challenge while Worcester could go Tory or Labour.No results are expected overnight on Friday unless a particular council chooses to push things late into the night.Saturday  May: From amNormally elections would be over by Saturday - but counting will resume in earnest this year. But go out for brunch or something - the results shouldn’t roll in until noon or so. There will be all remaining constituency seats and all regional seats in Scotland,  councils in England, the rest of the London Assembly and at least  police commissioners. Counts will also begin in the mayoral elections for London, Bristol, Greater Manchester, Liverpool City Region, North Tyneside, Salford, the West of England and the West Midlands.Saturday  May: From Noon The first results from the  English councils counting on Saturday, including Lancashire which the Tories took from NOC in . Aside from this there may be few surprises in England until later in the afternoon. Oxford and North Tyneside are both Labour while Shropshire, Worcester, Broxbourne and Hertfordshire are all Tory . Eastleigh is solidly Lib Dem. We could get the Liverpool City mayor and the North Tyneside mayor , both likely Labour, and the West of England mayor , which the Tories won by a slim margin in . In Scotland we should get results in Aberdeenshire West, which the Tories took from the SNP by a slim margin in , and key target seat Perthshire South which the Tories want to take from the SNP this time. Saturday  May: From pm The key result for the West Midlands mayor - which Labour ex-minister Liam Byrne wants to seize from Tory incumbent Andy Street. If he can pull it off it’d be a key symbolic victory for Keir Starmer in territory where the Tories gained much ground under Corbyn.We should get results from mid-afternoon for the rest of the London Assembly constituencies, but the mayor will only be later in the evening.We should however get confirmation ‘king of the north’ Andy Burnham has been re-elected as Greater Manchester mayor . And results for  police and crime commissioners are likely. The results for the Salford mayor are also due. About  more English council results should flood in mid to late afternoon including Hartlepool, where the Tories are part of a complex coalition and turnout should be high due to the by-election. Labour need just three seats to take control of Kirklees but the Tories have previously gained ground in the area. Meanwhile the Lib Dems would only need a few seats to seize Gosport from the Conservatives.Milton Keynes is a three-way fight between Labour and the Lib Dems, currently in coalition under NOC, and the Tories. The Lib Dems and Tories will both be vying to retake NOC Portsmouth while the Lib Dems and Labour will want to regain seats they lost in Tory Wiltshire. Stroud is interesting - NOC with a rainbow coalition of Labour, Greens and Lib Dems but Tories are the largest party. And Rotherham doesn’t have a single Tory, will it stay that way "},{"url":null,"title":"local elections 2021 live hartlepool","story":"\"liveBlogUpdate\": [,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news politics local-elections--live-hartlepool-\",Keir Starmer.

Some  organisations - including Which , MoneySavingExpert and Age UK - wrote to the Home Secretary and Digital Minister Caroline Dineage, urging them to use next weekaposs Queenaposs Speech to better protect the public from the devastating financial and emotional harm caused by these crimes. Some £. billion is thought to have been lost to scams in the last year, according to figures from Action Fraud. And research suggests vulnerable people, including those experiencing mental health problems, are more at risk of falling victim to these crimes online. Anabel Hoult, CEO of Which , said: “The time for self-regulation is over, as clearly it has not worked. ”The case for including scams in the Online Safety Bill is overwhelming and the government must take the opportunity to act now. “Online s must be given a legal responsibility to prevent, identy and remove fake and fraudulent content on their sites so that their users are better protected.” And Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert, said: “I plead on bended knee for the government to take that opportunity, by putting scams in the Online Safety Bill. “Failing to do so will betray its promise to create world-leading online protection and will leave vulnerable people defenceless against online crime in the midst of a global pandemic.” Maria Teresa Jackson, a -year-old teacher, was a victim of one of many online scams. Ms Jackson was tricked by an advert she saw on a social media site, featuring a fake news story with fake quotes from celebrity adventurer Bear Grylls, who supposedly told how he had become a millionaire by trading in Bitcoin. She clicked the button and put in her details and soon received a phone call from a “financial advisor” who showed her around a professional looking website, and was very knowledgeable about trading. Over time she was persuaded to transfer increasing amounts of money to the scammer. It later became clear that the Bitcoin did not exist.

Speaking on BBC Breakfast, he said: I congratulate Jill Mortimer on her victory, but it was for me, as a Labour Party member, absolutely shattering to see a Conservative MP elected in a place like Hartlepool after nearly  years.I think what this shows is that, although we have started to change since the cataclysm of the last general election, that change has clearly not gone far enough in order to win back the trust of the voters, and weaposve just seen that in spades in Hartlepool.Labour MP Diane Abbott, who was shadow home secretary during Jeremy Corbynaposs leadership, branded it a crushing defeat for Labour and urged Sir Keir to rethink his strategy. She tweeted: Not possible to blame Jeremy Corbyn for this result. Labour won the seat twice under his leadership.

Tech giant Fujitsu has been handed a deal of up to £million for its Horizon accounting software.

It was blamed for innocent postmasters being jailed or made bankrupt by creating shortfalls in branch accounts. Between  and , the Post Office prosecuted  postmasters. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section Following an historic day at the Appeal Court last month, some  postmasters have had their names cleared, and dozens more are lining up to ­challenge their convictions. Horizon – which the Post Office introduced in  and spent  years insisting was ­incapable of errors – was found to be riven with glitches by the High Court. In an out-of-court settlement in , the Post Office agreed to pay £m to  ­claimants. But after legal costs, they had to share £m, getting only £, each on average. Earlier that year Paula Vennells stepped down as chief executive of the Post Office, a position she held since . The deal with Fujitsu is endorsed by the Government which owns the Post Office.

We will all be affected by grief at some point – something that has proved all too true for many people as a result of the pandemic. There is of course no “right” or “normal” way to grieve – everyone will experience their own emotional journey following a bereavement. We shouldn’t be putting pressure on ourselves to experience a certain sensation – like anger or acceptance – at a certain time, says Andy Langford, clinical director at Cruse Bereavement Care. Instead, we should be giving ourselves time and space.But it can be particularly hard when you live alone. The following advice from Co-op Funeralcare might help:Keep talking One thing that can give comfort is talking about your feelings with friends or family, so it’s important not to become isolated. Stay connected Use video and phone calls and social media to stay in touch. Arrange times to chat with people – having this in your diary can add something to look forward to and purpose to your day.  Stick to a routine As much as possible, try to get up at the same time each day, and prepare and eat meals when you normally would. If you can, get outside to exercise. Don’t be too ambitious Set yourself manageable tasks. Sometimes that will simply be getting out for a walk. Getting the balance right between being busy as a distraction and taking the time to focus on your grief is key. Look after your health Maintaining healthy habits for your physical wellbeing can help with your emotional welfare. As you focus on looking after yourself and practise self-care, remember that your GP will be able to offer advice on coping with bereavement "},{"url":null,"title":"kate middleton promises wear pink","story":"NewsKate Middleton promises to wear pink when she meets cancer patient, , in touching callIn a video of the touching chat posted on the Cambridges new YouTube channel, the Duchess of Cambridge told brave little Mila Sneddon it must have been so challenging for all of you during lockdownmirrorShareCommentsByLaura Elston:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video kate-middleton-calls-four-year-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:leQQmC,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

The Duchess of Cambridge chatted on the phone with four-year-old Mila Sneddon, who was unable to see her dad during the restrictions as she underwent chemotherapy for leukaemia. The youngster became a symbol of the importance of isolation in Kateaposs lockdown photography project after she was pictured kissing the kitchen window as her father, Scott, stood outside.Mila, who was pictured for the Hold Still initiative, was separated from her father in the first lockdown for seven weeks, after he had to go to work and could not risk bringing coronavirus into the family home in Falkirk.In a conversation posted on the Cambridgesapos new YouTube channel on Thursday, the duchess admitted she was not wearing a princess costume right now when she was quizzed by the youngster on her outfit. But she pledged to wear Milaaposs favourite colour when they eventually meet in person. Mila asked Kate: Do you have a costume  The duchess replied: Iaposm not wearing a princess costume right now, Iaposm afraid Mila. Do you have lots of dressing-up outfits yourself  Mila said: Yeah and told the duchess her favourite colour was pink. Kate added: OK, well I have to make sure I go and try and find myself a pink dress so that hopefully, when one day hopefully, Mila weaposll get to meet, and then Iaposll remember to wear my pink dress for you.

The call, recorded last autumn, was released to mark the publication of Kateaposs new Hold Still photography book on Friday. Kate asked Mila about being apart from her father: How come you couldnapost see him for so long  Mila replied: Because he had to look after me because I went for a treatment. The duchess asked: Was it really hard not seeing him   Mila replied it was and told of the poignant moment they were reunited, saying: When he came into the house I was like, so surprised. The duchess told Mila: Itaposs a very small age to have a big operation. Were you very brave  You were a very strong girl, werenapost you  Mila proudly said to Kate: I know all your kidsapos names. The duchess asked hershe could remember them, with the youngster listing Charlotte, then George and finally Louis.

Sophie Bugg, , was  weeks pregnant when she popped to the loo in the middle of the night - only to leave the bathroom with a baby less than a minute later. Her partner Chris, , had to act fast as Sophie appeared outside the bathroom door with the babyaposs head between her legs. With just one big push, baby Millie was born into her astonished dadaposs arms. Despite her extremely quick arrival, she is doing well with her family at their home in Basingstoke, Hampshire. Full time mum-of-three Sophie said: She was ridiculously fast! One moment Iaposm texting my friend on the toilet about needing a poo and seconds later, Iaposve got a baby in my arms. Actually pushing her out from when the lady on the phone told me to push only lasted  seconds, it was so fast. I had no pains and my waters hadnapost broken, there was no realisation I was having her at all. It sounds really crude but it just felt like I needed to go for a poo.Have you got a birth story  Email webnews@mirrorI had messaged my friend saying I donapost feel great, then put the phone down from where I was sat on the loo and went to get up from the toilet. As I went to lt myself up, my body just got that feeling like I needed to push for a poo. So I sat back down, pushed, and as soon as I did that push, I knew it was not from behind! I put my hand between my legs and her head was completely out. I shouted to my partner for help, went from the toilet to outside my toilet door on the top of the stairs, did one push and she was out! This isnapost the first time that Sophie has been taken by surprise by her speedy deliveries.  Back in , the mum went to the toilet in the middle of the night and ended up delivering her first baby, Paige, now eight, just  minutes later. Little Paige was born still in her sac, which is why Sophieaposs waters didnapost break, and a paramedic was able to pop the sac safely. Sophie was then booked in for an induction for her second child Lexie, now two, to ensure she was in hospital this time around. She gave birth to Lexie just  minutes after being induced.  She said: My first baby was quite an experience - you donapost expect anything like that with your first labour, to just be at home and then all of a sudden youaposve got a baby. You donapost know what to expect. You get told all these dferent things from people like youaposre going to have a show, youaposll have waters go, so youaposre waiting for these things to happen and they didnapost for me so I didnapost think I was giving birth until her head was out. My second baby, the doctors were so worried with the fact of how quickly I had my first that they had me induced so I was in hospital with my second, which was a relief. But then my third baby had the exact same plans as my first, but came even quicker! I couldnapost believe how quickly she arrived.  My body doesnapost give me the signs of labour. My midwe and my consultant told me that I go from zero to baby, I donapost dilate like every normal person does. Sophie had been booked in to be induced a whole week before Millie was born but the cheeky little girl decided she was ready to come even earlier. Two days before her planned induction, Sophie woke up in the early hours of the morning on March  with the urge to go to the toilet. She texted her friend to say she didnapost feel well and that she was going to go into the garden for some fresh air but her pal quickly warned her not to in case she gave birth.  But by the time her friendaposs advice came through on her phone, Sophie had already given birth to her newborn after pushing out her head instead of a aposnumber twoapos. She did one more big push outside the toilet door with her panicked partner Chris, who works as a storeman, in front of her - and baby Millie was born. Sophie said: I sat on the toilet, literally did a push and had the feeling that I should feel between my legs because it didnapost feel like a poo. I put my hand down and I just felt her head! It was four in the morning, it was just so unexpected. I was calling Chrisapos name as her head came out but so much energy was going into me giving birth, I felt like the lady off of Titanic, shouting aposhelpapos but it wasnapost coming out loud enough! I thought heaposs not going to wake up but then when I got off the toilet, he was stood there in the doorway so he must have heard me. I just looked at him and said aposyouaposve got to do the rest!apos His face dropped but then the phone came out, he was talking to the paramedics, it all happened so fast.  My two other kids both woke up in the commotion as well so I had my eight year old poking her head round her bedroom door asking aposMummy, are you ok apos Iaposm like aposyeah, Iaposm ok darling, just stay in your room for a minute!apos I went from sat on the toilet to outside my toilet door on the top of the stairs, did one push and she was out! I asked Chris afterwardshe was alright and he was like aposyeah, that was mad!apos Sophie remained on top of her stairs cradling her new born with the placenta still inside her for  minutes before a paramedic arrived. The umbilical cord was cut and Sophie and Millie were taken to hospital to be checked over but were released after a couple of hours in perfect health. Sophie said: I was shocked when I gave birth to my first so quickly but Iaposm just in disbelief that I ended up giving birth at home once again and even quicker! I had no pain relief with two of my kids and the after-pain with my third was terrible from where I was straining so much because I thought she was a poo. I was left so sore for weeks - I literally felt like a baboon!  I hear peopleaposs stories and I know several people who have been in labour for  hours and I canapost possibly imagine that! Iaposve never experienced that - my longest labour was  minutes and Iaposve had three children. I do feel sorry for these people who have to go through it!

Jade Lockhart has found the slimy creatures slithering over her two-year-old son’s bottle and even in her kettle during their four-year hell. The -year-old mum also claims doctors believe the slug problem in the familyaposs home is making her asthmatic son’s condition worse. Jade is pleading with council bosses to find her a new home for her and her three kids, saying she cleans the house every day and salts her skirting boards - but the creepy little critters just keep coming back. East Ayrshire Council said this week theyaposve carried out a range of remedial works in the past three years but pinpointing the source of the slug lair can be dficult. The mum of three in Kilmarnock, Scotland, told the Daily Record: Theyaposve been coming into the house non-stop for the last four years. Have you got a story  Email webnews@mirror Could you imagine getting up in the morning to make your wean a bit of toast and pulling it out the toaster and thereaposs a slug on it  Or you put your hand on the fridge handle and the first thing youaposre touching is a slug or you come downstairs to get your wean a bottle and your standing in about  of them  Itaposs no way for anyone to live. The situation has become so bad that the family has been put in temporary accommodation while council workers try to resolve the matter.  But Jade says local authority workers ripped up the flooring and re-sheeted the surface at the Broomhill Quadrant home in Shortlees and it did not fix the issue. Environmental health came out and said that the slugs arenapost coming from the back door, theyaposre coming from underneath the house in the foundations and they can fit through the smallest of gaps, she added. My son Alfie has really bad asthma. My doctor says that heaposs not well because of all of this. I got told from a social worker and another two health professionals we shouldnapost be living here because heaposs been unwell because of this. He has a really bad cough. Theyaposve been on his bottle, his dummy and toys through the night and heaposs getting up in the morning and playing with them all and obviously putting them to his mouth. And the infestation has taken its toll on Jade too. The mum says sheaposs cleaning the house every day and the situation is making her ill. Jade said: Iaposve lost about three stone in weight. Iaposve not been able to eat. It makes me physically sick. Theyaposve been in my kettle and everything.  My house isnapost black, Iaposm quite a clean person and iaposve got a lot of family help too. I have to hoover and wash the floors every night. The first Iaposve been able to eat has been in the temporary housing but this is only going to be for a couple of weeks. I donapost want back in that house. Jade says sheaposs thrown out three sofas and other household items ruined by roaming slugs. She said: They come up through the floorboards and Iaposve even found them in my washing machine.  Theyaposve ruined my furniture. Iaposve lost three couches through this Iaposve had to chuck out them out. I clean the couches but slugs eat dog poo and things like that so thereaposs only so many times you can clean them. Itaposs mentally draining me. Jade says sheaposs been on the councilaposs housing list for a year but sheaposs still at the slug-infested property. In a desperate bid to get rid of the creatures, Jadeaposs resorted to dousing her skirting boards with salt but it hasnapost deterred them.  And despite her best efforts, the slimy beasts still slither out from under her house in the dead of night and wreak havoc in the home. Jade continued: Iaposd say thereaposs easily hundreds of slugs coming into the house each week. Iaposve been told to put salt round my skirting boards and they still come every night. I canapost take much more. Blair Millar, strategic lead for housing, East Ayrshire Council said: We have been working with Miss Lockhart since October  following reports of slugs within her property.

The woman worked for a multi­national accounting firm and owned a four-bedroom house but made the mistake of giving her bank details to Verner, who took control of her account. He bought tickets for two Manilow concerts and, to impress her, pretended to take a call during the shows, telling her he had been invited backstage by the Copacabana singer, . Instead he went off and hid. Richard Holland, prosecuting, told Durham crown court the victim “hit it off” with Verner, sharing a passion for travel and music. During a -month relationship he lied that he owned a four-bed home and earned £, a year running Stage Light­­ing Solutions, with international clients and “long-standing” ties to veteran singer Manilow.

The blind boxes have become a popular trend in the country, with people buying packages without knowing which animal they will receive through the post. But on Monday, animal welfare activists made a distressing discovery when they found  small dogs and cats inside a truck in Chengdu in southwestern Chinaaposs Sichuan province. They found that the packages - which were disguised as regular express deliveries - contained a distressed puppy or kitten. Chengdu Aizhijia Animal Rescue Centre said the vehicle they discovered was carrying  animals, all under three months old, in terrible conditions - and a number of them had died. Disturbing footage posted on social media by the animal rescue group shows boxes piled up to the ceiling of the truck. They wrote: The cargo box is full of screams from cats and puppies. The rescue organisation added: We could hear them crying in discomfort. If the back door of the vehicle had been completely shut and no air was circulating, they would have suffocated to death.Volunteers tried to help the animals during the night, feeding them glucose water with syringes through holes in the boxes, a member of the group surnamed Zhou told Sixth Tone.Sadly, they could not save all of the animals and by Tuesday four of them had died.  The organisation said: The dead bodies of several pets were tossed on the streets by ZTO Express [delivery company] workers. Today, the rescue centre said they managed to bring the animals to their base and  were still receiving medical treatment. The courier company involved in the shipment of the animals, ZTO Express, apologised and said the person in charge of delivery safety in the region has been suspended. The company added it has launched further training regarding postal safety and national animal protection. In China it is illegal to transport live animals, but blind boxes have become increasingly popular, according to state media. There have been reports of similar boxes containing animals such as tortoises, lizards, hamsters and rats being sold on shopping websites Taobao and Pinduoduo. In most cases, customers cannot choose a specic breed northe animals.  The animals found this week were ready to be dispatched to locations throughout China, travelling up to , miles, according to reports. The illegal practice caused outrage in China, with numerous people criticising it on social media app Weibo. A person posted: Reject live animal transportation! The stench of corpses produces all sorts of germs that contaminate surrounding parcels... This is clearly an illegal act that is being done for personal monetary gain. Another Weibo user wrote: Buyers, sellers, the retail , and the couriers are all guilty. I canapost imagine how anyone can do this. China has come under harsh scrutiny because of its treatment of animals, with campaigners calling for an end to animal abuse.

Six-year-old Anela Rezentes was swimming near the shore when she felt something flapping about behind her. The youngster turned to see fins and the sharp nose of a shark’s face shoot up from the water. It then bumped her from behind and, realising what the creature was, she screamed and ran back to shore. Her mum Sheri Gouveia, who had been filming her daughter swimming, had no idea at first what had startled the youngster until she watched the video back on her phone.Ms Gouveia told Good Morning America : “When I watched the video back I saw the fins flapping around and I was like, ‘Oh my goodness, she wasn’t lying. It was a shark.”Anela had been enjoying an afternoon at Kalama Beach, Hawaii, with her mum when she felt something push into her and lt her slightly from the water. As soon as she saw the fish she yelled ‘shark’ and ran as fast as she could towards the shore, with the shark flapping around behind her and another swimmer nearby. Video obtained by KHON  shows the moment Anela ran in a complete panic. She was so petried she told the TV station: “My soul left my body,” adding, “I was very scared.” Ms Gouveia said her daughter was “hysterical” when she got out of the water and had only realised later what had happened after she’d caught the animal flailing behind Anela in the phone footage.  “She just started freaking out, saying ‘Mum, there was a shark in the water!’” Ms Gouveia recalled. “I kind of dropped everything as I thought, ‘no way’. There was no way – this would not have happened to us. “I’m just so glad that she got there that day with all ten fingers and two hands.” Luckily Anela, and her fellow swimmers at the beach, were unharmed. The brave girl also said it hadn’t put her off going swimming again. Experts who have reviewed the footage said it’s believed the species of shark which bumped into the six-year-old is a blacktip - which mostly feeds on fish and isn’t harmful to humans.

end of the tunnel after being in “a dark place” during his injury nightmare.The former Watford striker has only managed five Dundee appearances since arriving last summer thanks to a succession of dferent injuries.An ankle problem delayed the start to his Dens Park career before he went down with a seemingly-innocuous thigh issue at Inverness in December.“It was the tendon in my right quad,” Jakubiak said.“I completely tore it, about an cm tear. It came from nothing, just a little clip pass out wide.“I’d never had an injury like this before and, at the time, it didn’t feel too bad.“I wasn’t sure what I had done. It felt almost like a cramp but I thought I was fitter than that!“It was only when we scanned it a few days later and found out how bad it was. Finding out I needed surgery was a shock.“It was only when I woke up from the surgery that it all hit me, how serious it was.“But I feel a lot stronger now and I just want to get back out there.”Almost four-and-a-half months passed between his injury in the Highlands to a substitute appearance in the - win over Raith Rovers.During that time Dundee have gone from revival to no hopers and then back to revival in their quest toto the Premiership.Now, though, they have found their groove and powered up the table to finish second after eight matches unbeaten.Jakubiak may only have been able to feature in four minutes of that run – and is critical of his own showing that day, too – but is delighted to be ing to fitness with Dundee in good fettle.mdash Alex JakubiakApril , He even credits the confidence around the camp as reason for making him work even harder to get back in.The Dark Blues are now four matches away from their goal of top-flight football.They await the winner of the Raith-Dunfermline play-off quarter-final this week.And Jakubiak says there will be no letting up from the Dark Blues, eventhey have a week off ahead of the semi-final.He added: “I was speaking to some of the lads and they said they couldn’t believe how quickly the season had gone but for me it’s the complete opposite.“Just being in the gym working, watching the games and seeing the guys train, as frustrating as it is, has helped me come through stronger.“I’ve got a more positive mindset coming back to training and the way the guys have been, it’s made me work that bit harder to get up to the fitness levels needed to match the rest of the lads.“It’s been a tough season physically but mentally as well. I do feel I’ve come out of what you might say is a dark place but can now see the light at the end of the tunnel.“The mood around the club has been very positive. We know the situation we’re in.#All season we’ve been going into games believing we can win because we are a big club and need to have that mindset.“We feel we shouldn’t be in this league but that’s the situation we find ourselves in.#Now we have got into this situation we don’t want to waste all the hard work we have put in till now.“So we’re going to push even harder from now till the end of the play-offs.”Jakubiak is pushing for ato action before the end of the season but knows how much is on the line for the Dark Blues.With that in mind, he’s aware game time will not come easily with promotion at stake.But he’ll do his part when called upon.“I’ve been desperate to get back out there from day one in the gym!” he added.“That’s my mindset, I’m just eager to play and show what I can do. It’s been tough and frustrating recently not being able to play.“It was good to get a few minutes at the end of the Raith game, it felt good.#Although I am very self-critical and I know their goal was partly my fault.#Even that, regardless of my injury, I know there are parts of my game I can work on and improve on. That will only come with playing games.“I will keep working hard and I will hopefully get a chance in these games.“It will be tough, though, because the lads have been doing so well.“The performance on Friday night at Queens was pretty comfortable. We were good all over the pitch, solid at the back and Jason got his two goals. He’s in great form.“It will be tough to get into the team but all I can do is keep working.“As much as I want to play every minute, the only thing that matters is we win the ties. Our ultimate goal is promotion.“So whichever team the manager picks, he has a lot of fit, strong, lads who are ready to go. Whoever he picks will do a good job.# Shaun Byrne is determined to relive the best moment of his career by helping Dundee to promotion # and he says the Dark Blues are a better side than his Livingston play-off winners\" title\"#Shaun Byrne is determined to relive the best moment of his career by helping Dundee to promotion #

and then some.Ten-time Scottish Cup winners # all before  # Scotland#s oldest club will find themselves in League One next season and, hopefully, playing at a redeveloped Lesser Hampden as a club resurgent in the professional game.For Dundee United defender Liam Smith, however, his experience of playing Queen#s Park is as an amateur outfit steeped in tradition.In a loan spell at East Fe in  , while on the books at Hearts, the right-back played against the Glasgow side in front of  or so fans at Hampden and was on the losing end both times.No doubt, it was an eerie experience for a young kid but one Smith, now , feels will stand him in good stead for United#s Scottish Cup semi-final against Hibs at a near-empty national stadium on Saturday.He said: “I never played at Hampden with Hearts# first team but I played there for East Fe against Queens Park!“It will be similar this time because it was empty so I know what that’s like.“I’m looking forward to it but just gutted it won’t be full because I’m sure both sets of supporters would’ve brought a great support.“Having seen what it means to the United fans from their send off for the quarters # and they’ve sold loads of season tickets # we know the support is there going into it.“Nobody needs to tell us how big a game it is and we’re all looking forward to it.”Although they are yet to get one over the Hibees since theirto the Premiership this season, Smith believes the Tangerines have as good a chance as anyone of going all the way.Smith, who captained the Jambos in a  Youth Cup Final loss to Motherwell at the national stadium, is hopeful for a positive result against his old Edinburgh rivals to set up a showpiece against St Johnstone or St Mirren.“I don’t think form, particularly, comes into it and they got beat on Saturday as well ,# the Fer added.“It’s just  minutes, two teams and the previous games against them don’t count for much.“It’s a one-off, the occasion takes care of itself.“We’ve done our research on them, we’ve played them a few times already as well so we know about them.“We’re building up to the game seeking a positive result.“It’s anybody’s cup now isn’t it “The Old Firm are always favourites but when they go out and it’s down to four teams everyone thinks: ‘What a chance we’ve got’.“I’m sure all the teams will be thinking that but, equally,we can put in a performance like we did against Aberdeen then why can it not be us ”Last weekend#s - Premiership defeat to Ross County at Tannadice wasn#t the ideal way for the Terrors to warm-up for Saturday#s massive clash # a repeat of the  semi.Although he is convinced the United squad weren#t distracted by the Hibs match as they failed to replicate their performance in a - quarter-final win over Aberdeen, Smith says they have to put the County disappointment behind them.“I don’t think so but you know it’s there because it’s a massive game.# he said when askedthey had one eye on the semi-final.“I think you’ve got to be professional and take one game at a time so there was no speaking about it through the week.Dundee United analysis: Ross County get it right against road-weary Tangerines unable to stop eyes wandering towards Hampden humdinger\" title\"#Dundee United analysis: Ross County get it right against road-weary Tangerines unable to stop eyes wandering towards Hampden humdinger# #

levels of activity in the Aberdeen housing market, leading to property prices beginning to climb.According to local experts, activity in the first quarter of the year is usually a good indicator of how the market is set to perform in the coming nine months and this year’s figures bring encouraging news.The first quarter numbers show that nearly % more properties were bought and sold between January and March this year compared to the same period in .Prices too are looking positive, with the annual house price in Aberdeen and surrounding suburbs rising .% year on year.This is no doubt welcome news after the shaky year the north-east property market has faced since the coronavirus pandemic took hold last March.Evidence that the north-east market was beginning to recover could be seen in the final quarter of , when property sales began to pick up.This has continued into , with , dwellings sold in Q.John MacRae, chairman of the board of directors of ASPC, has called these signs “invigorating” and adds that March this year saw the highest volume of traffic ever recorded on aspc, Aberdeen’s most well-known property site.However he cautions against any rash action, and reiterated that we are not out of the woods just yet. After all, the annualised house price change over five years in Aberdeen is -.%.He said: “The report released by the Centre for Real Estate Research at the University of Aberdeen Business School, for the first quarter of the year brings encouraging news.“This year, we have a strong positive indicator on prices, the first in several years.“The first quarter figures are always of interest because, by the end of March, we generally have a good indication how the market is likely to be during the year.“The last quarter of  had seen unusually good activity in our local housing market, leading to positive movements across two out of three categories. This was very welcome, given the year that we had endured. I recall endeavouring to dampen expectations for . I was concerned not to raise hopes.“It is invigorating, therefore, to see that results for the first quarter of this year continue to show improvement in our local housing market, albeit not yet of a comprehensive nature.“Nevertheless, the first quarter results reinforce the anecdotal evidence of practitioners that we may be experiencing a recovery in our market.“An additional sign of how our local market is doing is the increase in our website traffic.

The current change is +.% Given the mediocre performance of our local market since , this is a very hopeful sign.“Finally, the annualised changestands at -.%.“What all this means, I think, is this: Despite a severe knockback to activity, last year, we saw evidence of increasing confidence, and increased activity, after lockdown was lted.“The activity was not of “boom time” proportions but was welcome. The first quarter of this year appears to be continuing at similar levels of activity and is also having an upward effect on price.“Do bear in mind that we are in a recovery situation, prices are

vaccination clinic have been treated to some first class service with the help of grounded cabin crew volunteers.The charity Project Wingman started up last March, as the pandemic swept the country and masses of flights were cancelled.With medical staff flat-out caring for coronavirus patients, the organisation’s founders realised airline crews’ formal training could provide the perfect antidote.Since then, more than , aircrew from every UK airline have been volunteering their time to look after NHS staff at hospitals and clinics.So far they have set up more than  lounges at locations including Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and Dr Gray’s Hospital in Elgin.This list now includes the mass vaccination centre at P#J Live, with Project Wingman#s cabin crew members volunteering one day a week from their new lounge.Used to working in stressful situations, they have been empathising and offering support to staff at the centre – and keeping them stocked up with hot drinks and snacks and on their breaks.Clare Houston, NHS Grampian’s project manager at P#J Live, said: “We’re really pleased to welcome Project Wingman to the mass vaccination centre.“Obviously, the set-up here is quite dferent to a hospital, so we have had to think a bit dferently about how it will work.“However, they were really receptive to our suggestions and I know the space they provide will be much appreciated by everyone working on the vaccination programme.”Kirsty Cruickshank, a senior cabin crew member with Loganair who has been volunteering with Project Wingman, said: “We#re delighted to bring our latest lounge to the mass vaccination centre at the P#J Live at Teca.“The staff here are doing an incredible job and it’s great to be able to spoil them during their breaks with a little of our first class service.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium

We are also looking for volunteers to support the service.There are an estimated , armed forces veterans in Scotland, with an average age of .  The Comradeship Circles also welcome their partners, widows, and widowers.Participants simply dial into the weekly chat, with a facilitator on hand to assistnecessary. The service is popular with those who are unable or find it dficult to enjoy social connection online.Our Comradeship Circles has been a social leline for many over the last six months, so we’re delighted this funding means they can continue. Even before the pandemic, thousands of older veterans still felt isolated because of health conditions, disabilities, or living in a rural location. Although restrictions are now easing, we know that many are feeling lonelier than ever before.While more and more older people are getting online, there are still hundreds of thousands who are unable or prefer not to use the internet. This telephone service has been especially valued by older veterans who have a disability or health condition which means they struggle to use the video conferencing apps.Comradeship Circles mean they can enjoy banter and share stories and memories of military le. It’s been inspiring to see the care and support that the veterans’ community give each other, helping each other through dficult time. Many participants have told us that they’ve rekindled old friendships or made new ones, or look forward to a natter to get them through the week.If you or someone you know is a veteran aged  or over, we’d encourage them to give it a try.A call to the Age Scotland helpline     can open the door to camaraderie and extra support for older members of the ex-service community.Brian Sloan, Age Scotland chief executive "},{"url":null,"title":"argyll gardens bloom for 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Online records showed his birthplace as #Inchial Argileshire#, which turned out to be the parish of Glenorchy and Inishail at the head of Loch Awe.Alexander McNab was born there to Alexander senior and Margaret McNab in  # one of a family of three brothers and four sisters # and moved south to Burnley in Lancashire in the s. In Lancashire in , he married Janet Wardrope, who came from Milngavie outside Glasgow, and they went on to have  children.Going back a few generations, Clare#s research has traced Alexander#s great grandfather, John McNab, born in Kilbrandon in the area around Loch Melfort in .His son Peter, born around , went on to farm in Connel and is recorded in the  census as an -year-old farming  acres at South Ledaig, though is described as a #smith# in an earlier record.Born in , Peter#s son Alexander grew up to work in farming around Glenorchy. In the  census he is recorded as a ploughman at Barbreck.#Our# Alexander seems to have been a blacksmith when he moved from Argyll to Burnley to start a new le.Sadly, two of Alexander and Janet#s family died as young children.Later, however, they found themselves # like so many other families # caught up in the horrors of the First World War.They lost three sons # Andrew, aged , missing in action,  Alex, , missing in action  and John, , missing in action  # during the war.The grief the family must have borne is unimagineable. The boys# names are recorded on three separate First World War memorials in Belgium and France.Clare said: #What a tragedy losing your sons. Andrew, Alex and John were brothers of my great grandma, Grace McNab Bridge.#Alexander died in  at the age of , after being hit by a tramcar in Blackpool during the blackout. He was living with daughter Grace and her family at the time. A short newspaper report from the time describes him as a #retired blacksmith#.Clare was born in Blackpool and moved to Tees-side, via a spell in Dumfries, through her husband David#s employment.Though her great grandmother Grace passed away in , Clare believes she can detect echoes of the past in her own family today.She explained: #My son, who is in army, has just trained in music and learnt the bagpipes.#Little bits keep popping up. My other son is into blacksmithing, which is also in the family.#And while she has never visited Argyll, Clare would love to at some point once Covid restrictions have eased.#I had a look at images of Loch Awe and have been reading up about the area. It looks amazing.#[Note: Would you set the following as a piece within the overall feature please]It was while talking with a cousin about the family#s McNab heritage that Clare learned of a th century tragedy in the family.Her cousin mentioned a drowning on Loch Awe involving Donald McNab, elder brother by four years of Alexander.Parliamentary records reveal that Donald, a boatman, drowned on the morning of June  .Hansard records that Sir Charles Cameron, Liberal MP for Glasgow College, asked the Lord Advocate Mr J H A MacDonald about the incident in the House of Commons during September that year.He pointed out that Donald#s body was not found where his companions in the boat alleged he had fallen overboard and, when found floating weeks afterwards, it bore marks on the head and hand.Given those circumstances and #considering the anxiety of McNab#s family to have the case investigated#, he asked the Lord Advocate whether he would direct the procurator fiscal #to order such post mortem examination as may show whether the marks referred to had been caused before or after death or,such an examination has been made, he will allow MacNab#s family to inspect the medical report and any depositions in the case #The Lord Advocate replied that the people who were with him in the boat gave information at once to the police.He added: #The body was not recovered until August  and was, of course, in an advanced state of decomposition and had been injured from being in that state.#It was examined by a competent medical man who reported there was no sign of any injury having been inflicted before death. It was not the practice to make public the particulars in cases where those responsible for criminal investigation were satisfied that no crime had been committed but he might mention, for the satisfaction of the honourable member and those on whose behalf the question was put, that on recovery of the body what was observed tended strongly to confirm the accuracy of the statements which had been made at the time by those who were with the deceased when the accident took place.#PICS:Alexander McNab, born Argyll in , at two stages in le. no_aMcNab_story_AlexClare#s great grandmother, Grace McNab Bridge, as a young woman in the early th century. no_aMcNab_story_GraceGrace in later years. no_aMcNab_story_GraceClare Frith has been researching her family history. no_aMcNab_story_ClarePrivate Andrew McNab, one of three McNab brothers killed during the First World War. no_aMcNab_story_Andrew"},{"url":null,"title":"shorter racing only scottish series planned","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This has allowed us to concentrate on a purely on-the-water racing event which reduces contact possibilities. It is also important we reduce the movement of crew as much as possible.#By moving the event to the Clyde, we have taken a massive step towards achieving this goal, however, it is clear we need to take measures a bit further. As such, we will be shortening the event, dropping the last day, Monday.#In line with the shortened event, charges have been lowered below  prices.PIC:Sailors will miss Tarbert#s social scene at this year#s Scottish Series. _aScottishSeries"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 16 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Each route takes visitors on a real pilgrimage to ancient Christian landmarks, through remote and impressive landscapes.#Whilst Faith in Cowal is a Christian organisation, the routes are open to people of all faiths and none and provide the perfect way to connect with the wild beauty Cowal has to offer. Some of the sites that book-end each trail date as far back as the th and th centuries as well as more ancient landmarks such as Auchnaha Cairn that are thought to be Neolithic in origin.#The walks take in locations close to the major settlements and population centres of Cowal including Strachur, Dunoon, Kilfinan and Colintraive but they#re unlike any other path you#ll find. These are not all neatly manicured and waymarked trails. We have deliberately kept them dynamic and wild by making use of forestry roads and ancient heritage paths. Many of the routes require short, improvised hikes between paths so you#ll feel like a real pilgrim forging your way through the landscape.#There are detailed guides on our website as well as downloadable GPS tracks. We hope as many visitors to Cowal as possible will take this opportunity to step in the footsteps of ancient pilgrims and travellers, enjoy the wonderful scenery of Argyll and explore fascinating sites of genuine spiritual and religious importance,# added Dan.PICS:A map of the routes. no_aFootstepsFaithPhotos: subtlesensorHistoric Kilmun church, on the shores of the Holy Loch. no_aFootstepsFaith_©subtlesensor_Kilmorich graveyard, Cairndow. no_aFootstepsFaith_KilmorichGraveyard©subtlesensor"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 16 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

One of the highlights from last year’s event included celebrity supporters dressing up as much-loved characters to recreate tea party scenes from the world of film. Phyllis Logan was Mary Poppins, music producer Naughty Boy was Jay Gatsby, Emma Barton was Holly Golightly and Jess and Natalya Wright were Alice in Wonderland and the Queen of Hearts.Families with dementia have been adversely affected by the lockdown for just over a year. Care home visiting restrictions, the closure of support and respite services and the resulting social isolation and loneliness has disproportionately affected people living with dementia and their family carers.Whilst Time for a Cuppa will be slightly dferent this year, we know dementia support is needed more than ever.

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past  dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland’s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days. The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best, serving their customers.Re-opening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps to support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain.Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail ConsortiumThe reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints.Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers.Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.Tracey Gilbert, Usdaw deputy isional officer for ScotlandSir,Oxfam’s shops in Argyll and Bute have an urgent need for volunteers to help deal with an anticipated deluge of donations as they prepare to re-open from Monday April .Sales from the first day of trading following the re-opening of its English and Welsh shops were up  per cent on  figures, with it being the most successful Monday ever sales-wise for the organisation outwith Christmas periods.Money raised by the dedicated staff and volunteers in Oxfam#s shops in Dunoon and Rothesay helps fight poverty and injustice around the world providing people with lesaving essentials like clean water and soap as well as the hope of a better future.We know from the last lockdown that people will have taken the chance to have a good declutter and we’re anticipating a deluge of generous donations.Volunteers are asked to give as little as a few hours a week of their time and can take up a range of vital roles, from serving customers to sorting donations and arranging window displays.Each shop typically relies on a team of  dedicated volunteers and one or two staff, with more than , volunteers required across the country.As well as volunteers, Oxfam stores are also appealing for good quality donations.Protecting staff, volunteers and customers from Covid- remains Oxfam’s priority, with shop teams continuing to implement strict protocol, including social distancing, readily available hand sanitiser, masks and gloves for staff, screens at tills, regular and frequent cleaning, closed changing rooms and encouraging contactless payment.In advance of shops re-opening, people are invited to register their interest online via www.oxfam.org.uk # just click on #get involved#.Tom Richardson, Oxfam interim head of retailSir,The demands placed on Scotland’s health service by the pandemic have intensied pleas for an increase in funding for Scottish NHS.NHS funding in Scotland comes from the block grant from Westminster. If huge sums of Scottish taxpayers’ money were not being used to pay Scotland’s share of renewing and maintaining Britain’s nuclear submarine fleet, there would be funds available to properly support the Scottish NHS. This will only be possible when Scotland is independent once more.Susan Swain, Dunbar"},{"url":null,"title":"self help bike workshop opens in tayvallich","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

So, it’s an easier morning round for us crofters with only the daft pigs to feed, who long ago foraged every root, acorn and pine-cone from their sizeable woodland.Their little forest is perfectly, porcinely ploughed, but they must still be finding some nourishment there as they seem less frantic at feeding-time, pausing their grubbling and guzzling for the occasional scratch and cuddle.The let-up in winter feeding has allowed much-needed attention to be given to the now stuffed-full Polycrub where every speck of soil, every hanging beam has been usefully employed in the mission to feed the family entirely from its harvest.Raspberry canes, lemon, orange and cherry trees should keep rickets at bay, while the plethora of weird and wonderful ieties of carrots, potatoes, asparagus, and squashes will nourish us throughout the season and beyond.Our newbie attempts to live off the land mirror the much more experienced efforts of families throughout theand breadth of this peninsula and in the village beyond. Thanks to those techie neighbours who set up email networks and social media groups there is a fantastic bank of information and expertise shared locally.Whether you want to learn how to plant oak trees, acquire foraging skills or find out how to run your home on renewable energy, somebody local has been there, done it and is happy to point you in the right direction.Over the last few months this valuable mine of knowledge and enthusiasm for environmental projects has been formalised into the Tayvallich Sustainability Plan, a  for sharing information and taking action to create a more sustainable community.The plan has grown organically from a pilot scheme run through the winter months with Keep Scotland Beautul to a website, action plan and monthly activities.Open to everyone with an interest in achieving a healthy, sustainable future for the village and its surroundings, the plan will work on the whole gambit: from food growing to flood mitigation foraging to forestry and heat pumps to bike pumps # a new cycle repair work-stand has been installed outside the village shop.Joining the online meetings throughout the winter, I was amazed to see not just the number of locals involved, but also the extraordinary talents and interests they share.We only entrenched ourselves full time on this wild wee bit of Argyll a month or two before lockdown so we’re not well-kent faces and, likewise, the faces of many villagers I’ve only ever seen strangely pixellated thanks to my dodgy connection to the Zoom meetings.Hopefully the same is true for wi throughout the area and that my, now ubiquitous, Zoom-accompanying glass of wine has stayed safely out of shot."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 30 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Less than  years ago the Borders were th.With such a consistent list of failures from a Tory Council and an SNP Scottish Government no wonder the Tories and the Nats want to shout about Separation, Independence, another Referendum, the Constitution, why it is or isnrsquot all the fault of the English or of Westminster or of a bad boy that ran away.By posing as polar opposites, the Tories and the Nats seek to ide the people of Scotland and to prevent an examination of their respective records in power, whether at St Boswells or Holyrood.At a time when Scotland is suffering from the greatest health epidemic of modern times, with all its social and economic consequences, this is not the time for emphasizing ision, but for concentrating on what unites us.Thatrsquos why Labour has our focus on uniting our nation behind a National Recovery Plan, which has within it a Jobs Recovery, Health and Social Care Recovery, Education Recovery, Climate Recovery and Community Recovery.Born and brought up in the Borders, I recognise that for the whole of the South of Scotland, Devolution has been a disappointment.We have only ever had the crumbs from Edinburghrsquos table.Local powers, money and jobs have been sucked away and services have declined.Scottish education, once the envy of the world and which gave me my chance in le, is but a shadow of its former glory.People in the Borders deserve better .FOR A CHANGE ndash BOTH VOTES SCOTTISH LABOURRachael Hamilton Rachael Hamilton, Scottish ConservativesIrsquom Rachael Hamilton, the Scottish Conservative and Unionist candidate for Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire. I have served as the MSP for the constituency since , following a by-election, gaining . per cent of the vote and a , majority.At every turn, I have stood up and fought for my constituents. Most notably, throughout the pandemic, I have been supporting constituents and businesses with COVID- related matters such as sourcing financial help and dealing with concerns over vaccinations.I have delivered real results for the Borders. I campaigned for the poundm Borderlands funding for a Bordersrsquo Railway extension feasibility study, supported the successful re-instatement of Reston station and called for a fund to fix the crumbling roads. On the rural front, I put pressure on the SNP Government for more funding for agriculture and pushed for more resources to tackle rural crime and fly-tipping.As the Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Social Security and Older People, I worked with the Scottish Conservative strategy team, to formulate new policies to support older people and matters relating to Social Security Portfolio, such as narrowing the disability employment gap and improving digital inclusion.Looking ahead to the election I will campaign hard for local issues. When it comes to our fantastic NHS, I want a focus on reducing waiting times, improving mental health services and protecting local GP surgeries.As we emerge from the COVID pandemic, we must attract high quality, well-paid jobs to the Borders and improve infrastructure and digital connectivity to bolster the rural economy.On education, I support a national tutoring programme to help pupils catch up, more rural teachers and free school breakfasts and lunches to all primary school children.My campaign, alongside Doddie Weir OBE, continues on automatic access for people living with MND to receive a Blue Badge. Moreover, I have urged the Scottish Government to provide free dyslexia tests for adults to improve social mobility  opportunities.I continue to strongly oppose a second independence referendum and believe we can build back better with the strength of the United Kingdom.Barbra Harvie Barbra Harvie, Scottish GreensThe Scottish Green Party candidate for Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire, Barbra Harvie, is a semi-retired lecturer in Ecology, Environment and Countryside who lives in Selkirk.She says: \"Our isolated rural communities and small urban environments in South of Scotland have come together with resilience, determination and care to tackle the enormous challenge of COVID- but we are also facing a global climate emergency that can no longer be ignored.\"Scotland needs a Green recovery from the global pandemic that also confronts the global climate emergency.

Before politics I worked in the third sector as a fundraising assistant for Marie Curie, and then for international oil company National Oilwell Varco Mission Products handling customs and logistics. I now work part time as Office Manager for a member of the Scottish Parliament and as a Communications Manager for an MP. I decided to stand in the General Election in  in Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk because I was tired of the constitutional wrangling and wanted to bring the focus back to making a dference locally and further afield. Now, we need to put recovery from the pandemic first. From supporting tourism and local business to tackling the climate emergency, delivering a better education system, supporting the NHS, bettering mental health provision, and making the case for a truly federal UK, I will always stand up for the disadvantaged and will make fairness and tackling inequality central to everything I want to achieve. I want to remove the barriers to opportunity which face rural areas more than others. Everyone should have the chance of living the le they want and to be as successful as possible. During the last year the curtains have been pulled back on where the help is most needed and we need to have a needle sharp focus on getting help to all those in that position. Ultimately, I want to tackle to the root of inequality which is poverty, and keep the climate crisis at the top of everyonersquos agenda. We know our country is wracked by constitutional ision and inequality so now our representatives need to focus on healing and serving communities to the best of their ability at a time when it has never mattered more. Thatrsquos what I will do.Jesse Rae Jesse Rae, independent candidateThose that know me, are probably a the kids and pupils of Hawick High School , Berwickshire High School, Duns Primary, Langlee Primary, and Philiphaugh Primary ndash all of which I gave ye yer own Radio and TV Station in  and .

Paul, who is a former Corsquopath and then Ayton community councillor, can trace his roots to the th Century in Bonchester. He was born near Belfast in  and moved to Scotland as a three-year-old. He was educated in Edinburgh before studying for his honours degree in Economics at University of Aberdeen, before embarking on a -year career as a professional economist. In , Paul graduated with a Masters in Business Administrationfrom University of Edinburgh. A keen rugby player at school, Paul is a fan of both rugby and football, and has a keen interest in local history and genealogy. Paul has one son.Paul has served as a South Scotland MSP since . In the last five years alone, Paul and his team have helped or supported more than , constituents from his office in Hawick. Paul is an experienced parliamentarian and minister, having led seven Acts through Parliament ndash most recently legislating on Heat networks. Indeed, after serving for a year on the Parliamentrsquos Finance Committee and Standards Committee, Paul was appointed within the Scottish Government in , as Minister for Environment and Climate Change, in which role he served until November . In Nicola Sturgeonrsquos first ministerial team following her appointment, Paul was appointed Minister for Community Safety and Legal Affairs and, following, the  election, became Minister for Business, Innovation and Energy.

Indeed, I spent years at an Edinburgh healthcare technology company, collaborating with universities and NHS Scotland on articial intelligence software for cancer screening and diagnosis of stroke.Throughout this pandemic we have seen the power of our countryrsquos science base. Despite bumps in the road, the roll-out of testing and multiple vaccines has been impressive.But the pandemic tells another story too ndash of warnings ignored and preparations left unmade. We could and should have had a better plan for one of the highest-ranked known public health risks. We must learn from this collective failure.Scientists have warned for decades that the world is heading towards climate breakdown. They also now speak of a ldquonature emergency ndash an era of mass extinctions caused by humans. Yet greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere relentlessly rise and our forests and oceans continue in dangerous decline. Nowadays, I see scientists practically weeping as they watch this unravelling accelerate, with no believable action plan from politicians.The Scottish Greens recognise that technology will play a huge part in stepping us back from the brink. Our co-leader Lorna Slater is a renewable energy engineer, and our proposed poundbn Green Recovery investment programme will fund thousands of high-quality, unionised Scottish jobs in renewables. But letrsquos not kid ourselves. Itrsquos mostly not technology we lack, itrsquos political will.The Greens will invest massively in warm homes ndash upgrading insulation and converting to low-carbon heating systems. We have bold plans to improve rail, bus and active travel, and already won free bus travel for under-s from this summer. Finally, we propose an urgent programme to repair nature, dramatically accelerating the positive steps already taken by rural businesses, workers and charities.These solutions are not high-tech, not ldquosexy and may not generate huge profits for international investors and a rich elite. But theyrsquore effective, labour-intensive, local, and fair.This election is our chance to tackle the climate emergency, to build a green recovery, and to secure our future as an independent European country. Please vote like our future depends on it. Vote Scottish Greens.Michael Banks Michael Banks is a retired barrister and Vanguard Partys candidate for Midlothian South, Tweeddale  Lauderdale, and heads the partys list for South Scotland. He has lived in the Scottish Borders for  years.Vanguard Party champions the Union and Brexit. The UK, four nations in union, will prosper as an independent country, outwith the EU. If Scotland were to leave the Union and join the EU, it would not be an independent country. It would be a rule-taker from Brussels. There would be a hard border with the rest of the UK. Scottish exports to the rest of the UK are currently worth three times those to the EU. Funding via the Barnett formula would end. Scots would lose British citizenship.Vanguard Party believes Scotlands future should be decided by the people, not the courts. However, independence is not practical without the support of a simple majorityof the registered electorate, not merely a simple majority of valid votes. IndyRef must require a simple majority of the registered electorate of the whole of Scotland, for the whole of Scotland to leave. In  only  per cent of the registered electorate of the whole of Scotland voted for independence.Vanguard Party will preserve the distinction between sex and gender. It will protect womens rights to same-sex spaces. It will oppose self-identication. It will oppose any denial of biological truth.Vanguard Party will champion children of disadvantaged backgrounds by providing help and support to raise attainment. It will not promote quotas and targets that may excuse lower attainment.Vanguard Party will champion the NHS. It will recognise the true worth of all NHS staff. It will tackle hospital waiting lists and support GPs to resume face-to-face appointments for all.Vanguard Party will abolish hate crime including incitement of hatred in peoples minds. It will require crimes to be based on evidence, tested objectively, not on subjective perceptions of victims or others.Vanguard Party will champion traditional values and culture. It will take back control of British institutions and push back against the tyranny of woke.*Please note: Michael Banks of the Vanguard Party did not supply a photograph to this newspaperChristine Grahame Christine Grahame, Scottish National PartyI am privileged to be a member of the Scottish Parliament since , representing the constituency for ten years. Most important was keeping in touch with you through my surgeries: in supermarkets, libraries, and my annual summer surgery tour through the villages. This past year of course has changed everything. We have all been stuck at home keeping in touch through emails. COVID has dominated and I have tried to help you with the problems it brought in its wake. Moving now through vaccination, queries arise as you await that appointment. At the same time other issues continue: unsuitable housing, planning concerns. This is the essential work and duty of an MSP to constituents no matter what their politics. I hope I have discharged that duty. I have also chaired the parliamentrsquos cross-party group on animal welfare for many years with two Bills to my name: The Control of DogsAct , now law, putting the blame on the owner not the dog and The Welfare of DogsBill which aims to end casual purchase of puppies. COVID prevented it proceeding butelected I intend to bring it back, especially with concern that some of those \"COVID\" puppies will end up in animal rescue centres. Yes, how le has changed, COVID has been hard: losing a business built over years, living with children trapped in a flat, not attending a funeral, delaying the wedding, the new baby not socialising with family. The list is endless of the sacrices, the losses. COVID has broken the link with the way we were, just as those World Wars changed society. Nicola Sturgeon has demonstrated true leadership and moving to recovery it must not be back to the same old, same old but to a socially just society, valuing people from cradle to grave, our public services, rejoining the EU as an independent nation. On May , I ask for your constituency vote on my record as your MSP and the list vote for the SNP, giving you and Scotland a democratic choice to move forward as a renewed nation.Shona Haslam Shona Haslam, Scottish ConservativesOn Thursday, May , voters are faced with a choice. Rebuild our communities after the pandemic by improving our childrenrsquos education, delivering record funding to our NHS and enhancing employment opportunities, or, once again, reopen the question of Scotlandrsquos place within the United Kingdom.Make no mistake: the next few weeks will see one of the most important elections of our letime.Nicola Sturgeon has demonstrated recently that she only cares about one thing, an independence referendum that most Scots do not want but one that she will still foist upon them anyway. The past year has been tough for us all. Many of us have struggled with the pressures of lockdown, myself included. But the way to recover from this pandemic is not to launch into another constitutional argument that threatens our livelihoods, our childrenrsquos futures and our way of le.As a mum to two lovely boys, I want to see a government that puts aside its own agenda and commits to focusing on whatrsquos best for the next generation of Scots. ldquoJudge me on my record said Nicola Sturgeon on education. Well, the attainment gap remains as large as it ever was, and Scotlandrsquos education system has plummeted in international rankings. It would seem the First Minister has been found wanting.Itrsquos not just our schools that under threat other public services are too. As leader of the Scottish Borders Council, I have fought tirelessly against repeated cuts to our budget, forcing councillors to make dficult choices simply because the Scottish Government finds it easier to pass the buck. After the strain of COVID, we need a Scottish Government that will step up, empower councils and work with them, not against them.Butthe SNP gain enough seats to form a majority in May then all that is at risk. Once again, they will push for another isive referendum.There is only one way to stop that: lend me your constituency vote, and the Scottish Conservatives your party vote, on May .ACMay AC May, Scottish Liberal DemocratsI intend to represent you the only way I know how - by working tirelessly with a keen eye on the future to ensure that there is investment and improvement in education, employment opportunities and business growth. I will stand up for better funded healthcare and demand that money is directed towards care homes, mental health and wellbeing to bring these up to the standards we all deserve. To do this will need a strong economy and the Scottish Liberal Democrats are putting recovery first ndash this must be Scotlandrsquos priority. A vote for me is a vote of confidence for a more secure future for you and your families.Its time for a change. The area needs someone who will heed the concerns of constituents, and voice these strongly in parliament, not just another person sitting in Holyrood applauding every word of the First Minister.Prior to the boundary changes, the Scottish Liberal Democrats had a long record of success here, and its high-time for ato rational, clear thinking on the issues that matter locally and nationally.Our high streets and town centres ndash the beating heart of our communities ndash need urgent help. This was apparent before the pandemic, but even more so now. Online commerce can bring tremendous benefits and is here to stay. Many businesses have transformed to the new normal, but many others have struggled. We need to focus on how growing online spend can coexist with a vibrant local economy, and work to restore community feeling.Im looking forward to getting stuck into the campaign. By their own admission, a ided Tory party has mishandled Brexit, driving Scottish voters in desperation towards nationalism, while the opportunist and populist SNP seeks to compound the disaster of Brexit by withdrawing from the UK completely, just at the point when we need economic recovery the most.A vote for me is a vote for progress through strong partnerships within Scotland, across the UK and with our European neighbours, so that together we can recover from the COVID crisis and move beyond the politics of ision.Katherine Sangster Katherine Sangster, Scottish LabourCOVID-rsquos impact on our families, our communities and our economy has been profound. We now need to start the hard work of rebuilding our country and that task needs new faces, fresh ideas and experience outside of Holyrood.I am a working parent who prior to  had never been involved in politics. However, I like many other parents soon realised that the SNPrsquos childcare policies sound good on the back of an election leaflet but donrsquot work in practice. So, in , I campaigned for fairer access to childcare and led Fair Funding for our Kids - a nationwide campaign that got childcare on to the national agenda, building a movement of mums that demanded action from Government. Our campaign secured more funded childcare from Government - a step towards equality, but there is still plenty to be done.Soon, I was speaking on television, writing for newspapers and lobbying politicians. All things I has never done before but I was speaking from the heart and articulating mine and othersrsquo experience. Now with five years plus experience in politics I still firmly believe that policy is best made by those with lived experience and the job of a politician is to listen and advocate on peoples behalf, and I will always put that at the heart of what I do.Working for an MP now, every day I support people with the issues that blight their lives from poor housing to an inhumane benefits system to bins not getting picked up. These are issues that affect people day in day out. Chatting to voters and speaking to constituents, I have experienced no appetite for debate on a second referendum just a desire from people that we as politicians and aspiring politicians listen to their concerns and respond to those concerns.We need to elect MSPs to Holyrood who understand these concerns and will fully use the powers of the Scottish Parliament to make peoplersquos lives better. Holyrood is one of the most powerful devolved parliaments in the world lets start using those powers. As Donald Dewar said at the opening of the Scottish Parliament in  ldquoA Scottish Parliament, not an end but a means to greater ends.On May  please use your vote carefully and letrsquos start the task of uniting our country behind our national recovery."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-bank-holiday-offers-big-mac-mcchicken-sandwich","story":"Have you enjoyedthe Bank Holiday weekend a bit too

The site was founded in AD  by St Columba and his Irish following.Many believe the world-famous Book of Kells was made at Columbarsquos monastery, along with other great pieces of art. Despite being the target of many a Viking raid, the monastery survived until the end of the th century, after which a Benedictine abbey was founded.The abbey museum has a collection of early medieval carved stones and crosses on display for visitors. The abbey continues to be an active place of worship after the Iona Community group went to great efforts to revive the sacred structure.. Battle of Bannockburn, StirlingThe Battle of Bannockburn in  was a signicant victory in the wars of independence. Robert the Bruce won a famous victory over the English troops of King Edward II, despite the Scots being outnumbered two to one and facing a much better equipped force.Now we can experience part of the action at the award-winning visitor centre. Situated just outside Stirling, near the battleground, the centre harnesses fully immersive D technology to depict Brucersquos decisive victory.At the site, visitors can wander through the battlefield itself and admire the restored monuments, including the impressive statue of Robert the Bruce

And now, more than a week later and despite updates in the interim about the reopening of schools, they#re still waiting – and it#s not acceptable.Like everyone , islanders are desperate to know when they can reconnect with family and friends. Island businesses are equally frantic to know when and how they can make plans for the weeks ahead.But, unlike everyone , our islands are at a complete disadvantage. They still don#t know what is happening, or when. They deserve better. The Scottish Government needs to respond to our islands# call for clarity and let them, like the rest of the country, start to think and plan ahead.Now in its nd year, the Big Garden Birdwatch is a chance for people of all ages to count the number of birds that visit their garden helping the Royal Society for the Protection of Birdsto build up a picture of how they are doing.This year, more than a million people across the UK, including more than , in Scotland, took part, counting  million birds.The event, held over the last weekend in January, revealed the house sparrow held on to its number one spot.

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past thirteen dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland#s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days.The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best — serving their customers.Reopening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain. Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.The reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints. Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers. Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.The national charity for older people is encouraging people to get moving every day next month as part of a new fundraising activity challenge.Throughout May, Age Scotland is asking people across the country to Spring into Action to help support older people in Scotland.Fundraisers can take part however they choose, but the most important thing is to make sure they are active every day.All funds raised by Spring into Action participants will go towards Age Scotland#s vital services, including the national friendship line, which offers a place older people can turn tothey are in need of support, comfort and reassurance or even just missing a friendly voice.Running and walking events have always been a great way to help raise vital funds and, even with many regular events unfortunately cancelled over the past year, we#ve been overwhelmed by the kindness and generosity shown by fundraisers still going above and beyond.We hope to see as many people as possible taking up our challenge to Spring into Action this May. With nights getting lighter and better weather on the horizon, this is a great excuse to get out and about and support a worthy cause at the same time.#Whether you run one mile, walk five, or design your own challenge, your fundraising efforts will be making a real dference for older people in Scotland.#The money you raise will fund vital services like our friendship line. Every week we receive hundreds of calls from older people looking for support. Many are lonely and isolated and just want to hear a friendly voice. We listen, provide comfort and friendship and let them know someone cares.#No one should feel like they have no one to turn to.

Online records showed his birthplace as #Inchial Argileshire#, which turned out to be the parish of Glenorchy and Inishail at the head of Loch Awe.Alexander McNab was born there to Alexander senior and Margaret McNab in  — one of a family of three brothers and four sisters — and moved south to Burnley in Lancashire in the s. In Lancashire in , he married Janet Wardrope, who came from Milngavie outside Glasgow, and they went on to have  children.Going back a few generations, Clare#s research has traced Alexander#s great grandfather, John McNab, born in Kilbrandon in the area around Loch Melfort in .His son Peter, born around , went on to farm in Connel and is recorded in the  census as an -year-old, farming  acres at South Ledaig, though is described as a #smith# in an earlier record.Born in , Peter#s son Alexander grew up to work in farming around Glenorchy. In the  census he is recorded as a ploughman at Barbreck.#Our# Alexander seems to have been a blacksmith when he moved from Argyll to Burnley to start a new le.Sadly, two of Alexander and Janet#s family died as young children.Later, however, they found themselves — like so many other families — caught up in the horrors of the First World War.They lost three sons — Andrew, aged , missing in action,  Alex, , missing in action,  and John, , missing in action,  — during the war.The grief the family must have borne is unimaginable. The boys# names are recorded on three separate First World War memorials in Belgium and France.Clare said: #What a tragedy losing your sons. Andrew, Alex and John were brothers of my great grandma, Grace McNab Bridge.#Alexander died in  at the age of , after being hit by a tramcar in Blackpool during the blackout. He was living with daughter Grace and her family at the time. A short newspaper report from the time describes him as a #retired blacksmith#.Clare was born in Blackpool and moved to Tees-side, via a spell in Dumfries, through her husband David#s employment.Though her great grandmother Grace passed away in , Clare believes she can detect echoes of the past in her own family today.She explained: #My son, who is in army, has just trained in music and learnt the bagpipes.#Little bits keep popping up. My other son is into blacksmithing, which is also in the family.#And while she has never visited Argyll, Clare would love to at some point once Covid restrictions have eased.#I had a look at images of Loch Awe and have been reading up about the area.

The three now face a legal costs bill estimated at £,.Mr Morris Finer, QC for John, George, Ringo and Apple, told the appeal court on Monday that they now considered it was in the common interest to explore ways of allowing Paul to free himself from the partnership by agreement.Mr David Hurst QC on behalf of Paul said: #He will most willingly enter into the proposed negotiations to achieve his freedom from the partnership by consent rather than by court action.#Well, it looks very much like the end of the #long and winding road# to quote a well known McCartney ballad.What does Paul himself feel about the rise and fall of the Beatles Two Courier men drove up to High Park Farm — which has a long and decidedly bumpy road leading to it — to find out what the man in the centre of it all felt about things.Apart from being obviously excited about his latest and most important success, Paul did not like saying anything about the matter.Though very polite and friendly, he made it quite clear that he does not see any point in giving interviews or saying anything remotely sensational.After ten years of being harried and hustled by journalists and photographers never having a minute#s peace to himself always having been the centre of attraction never having been able to pop in to the #local#, is it any wonder that Paul is determined to live as quietly as possible He seemed as happy as a sand-boy, out there in the wilds.When we approached him, he had obviously been brushing down one of his horses because he still held a horse brush in his hand.His we Linda looked the essence of happiness as her golden hair mirrored the warm sunshine. The children yelled and gurgled contentedly and even Martha, the English sheepdog, seemed happy.The farm house itself has been extensively renovated, a new roof having been constructed and the farm work appears to be progressing normally.Paul himself has changed. Outwardly at any rate. Gone is the Beatle mop, the style which was copied the whole word over. Gone is the boyish grin, which once sent screaming thousands into ecstasy.What has taken the place of these characteristics  Paul now sports a beard the hair remains longish but it is brushed back, revealing the full extent of his forehead the smile is no longer boyish.The former bass-guitarist song-writer with the most influential and certainly most famous foursome the world has ever known has changed.Paul will probably continue to compose such brilliant songs as Maybe I#m Amazed and Another Day but to millions of people, from Campbeltown to Honolulu, pop music will certainly never be the same again.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSparks and flashesThere would be some fluttering this week among the ladies in the town who are liable to serve on a jury, summonses to appear on the occasion of a forthcoming jury trial having been issued to  ladies and  gentlemen.

If you are taking a long-term view then a garden full of reliable flowering shrubs is also an option.Whatever garden you have, watering and weeding are the key watchwords for May. It is essential to water newly planted fruit trees, roses and shrubs regularly to help their root systems get established.It is also the time of year when many plants# demand for water increases as they start their major growth period. Top watering tips include – every time you plant something, water it in well, make a moat of soil round newly planted plants so that water doesn#t run off and goes to the roots, water pots and containers so that water appears right to the top of the pot and get a water butt.If you have a drainpipe, you have a natural water supply so a simple garden solution for May is to ensure that you have adequate water storage. If you buy and fit a water butt, it will provide you with water for the garden in an environmentally friendly way and on a regular basis.Annual weeds will be popping up now, so weeding borders once a week to prevent weed seedlings establishing is a good idea. The problem with the most common weeds such as nettles, dandelions and bindweed, is that they are very, very tough. They can continue to grow in conditions that make most garden plants simply fade away – and they do that, in part, by using the moisture, nutrients and light of the plants around them.A great plant to get you into the summer gardening spirit is the pretty petunia – perfect for containers and hanging baskets and a great choice for instant colour. It can flower all summer long, providing you deadhead regularly, and comes in a iety of colours to suit any garden palette.Petunias are also available in dferent blooms including single, double, ruffled or smooth petals. They can be striped, veined or solid in colour and most sold today are hybrids developed for specic design purposes such as fragrance.They need full sun and can#t tolerate frost but can grow in a wide range of soils and thrive in multipurpose compost when planted in containers.Keeping on top of garden maintenance is crucial in May. The garden is coming alive so there is plenty to keep you busy. Here are some jobs you should be thinking about this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"liveargylls leisure facilities and libraries reopen","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Still unable to control his weeping, he began to crawl backwards. Izzy opened the door and cradled him as he crumpled onto the floor in the corridor outside the room.Izzy glanced quickly inside, checking Finn was still asleep. He moved for a moment, then turned over. She slowly and carefully closed the door and sat down with Ewen, putting her arms around him.She had no words, but knew words were not what was needed. She just held him in a hug as he wept his soul out.A fellow guest walked by on the way to the showers. He paused for a moment with a towel hanging over his right shoulder.ldquoYou all right  he asked.ldquoMy friend has just had some bad news, said Izzy.ldquoOK, yeah, I can see that, hope it works out, he said awkwardly and headed for the showers.Finally, Ewen began to compose himself and appeared from behind his hands, his face a sodden mess. Izzy took her arms away, gave him a sympathetic look and stood up.ldquoLetrsquos find a place we can sit and talk, she said.Ewen nodded and pulled himself up off the floor with Izzyrsquos help. When they entered the kitchen area, everyone instinctively moved away and left them alone. Ewen sat at a table and Izzy put the kettle on.Then she came and sat next to him, putting a supportive hand on his left arm. They both sat, not speaking. Ewen finally stopped crying and Izzy got up and brought some paper kitchen towels so he could wipe his face, then went to make tea for them both. She ed with two steaming mugs and sat by him again, still not speaking, just being there for him, her best friend.He stared at the mug of tea, lted it to his lips, then spoke before he drank.ldquoI hardly recognised him, he said.He took a gulp of tea and looked up at Izzy.His voice began to break as he tried to explain: ldquoItrsquos been four years since I saw him ndash last time was just before his eighth birthday. Hersquos changed so much. But then I heard his breathing as he slept, thatrsquos the same, I recognised that.He drank some more tea, took in a deep breath, then exhaled loudly with a sigh.ldquoHe used to fall asleep after Irsquod told him a story and I would stay for a while and listen to him breathe.He could feel tears welling up again. ldquoSorry Izzy, I canrsquot help it, so embarrassing.Tears streamed down his cheeks again and he lowered his head.Izzy walked to the sink, tore some more kitchen towels from the rack and gave them to him. She sat by him.ldquoI canrsquot imagine what it feels like, Ewen, all those years of pent-up emotion missing your son, there is no need to apologise. I should have realised how hard that would be for you. It was my mistake.Ewen looked up. ldquoGod no, Izzy, thanks to you Irsquove seen Finn, close up, in the moonlight and sleeping. I was able to whisper to him under my breath that I loved him, just before I lost it and made that scene.Izzy looked round the empty kitchen.ldquoI think everyone in here thinks wersquore a couple whorsquove fallen out, she said. ldquoIrsquom a bit concerned that people will talk about it tomorrow morning and Finn could overhear. I think, to be on the safe side, we will leave as soon as possible and have breakfast by the loch. At least then you will get to see him in the morning in the way wersquove arranged.ldquoYeah, thatrsquod be great. Irsquove pitched the tent in the hidden spot in the trees, Irsquoll keep an ear out for you arriving.Ewen realised he was hungry.ldquoYou havenrsquot got something to eat, have you  he asked. ldquoIrsquove not eaten since lunchtime just not been hungry, till now.Izzy gave him a packet of crisps: ldquoSorry thatrsquos all I have to hand.ldquoNo, thatrsquos perfect, thanks, I just need a snack. Irsquoll cook something by the loch later.He opened the packet, then scrunched the crisps into small bits. Izzy watched as he tipped them into his mouth and carefully folded the empty packet into a small square.ldquoFinn does exactly that when he eats crisps, she said.ldquoWersquod have a competition, explained Ewen, ldquoto see who could fold the packet into the smallest square. It was just one of the things we used to do. I dunno how we started it. I think the idea is you canrsquot fold anything more than seven times, so we would try to.ldquoWell, he still does it.Ewen smiled but it was a sad one. Izzy wasnrsquot sureshe was making things worse or better for him by telling him such things.ldquoDoes he like his boots  he asked.ldquoLoves them and they fit perfectly.Ewen nodded, then clenched his hands together on the table. Izzy could feel his pain. She placed her hands on top of his.ldquoEwen, you are doing amazing, this must be hell for you, I know how much you love Finn and want him to know it. But please, be careful. He could have seen you at the Falls of Leny, and he definitely saw you talking to me at Balquhidder. Hersquos seen your car. We have to be super careful to ensure he doesnrsquot recognise you or realise.Ewen nodded: ldquoSally comes up with a dferent hire car tomorrow, so that should make things less obvious. I think shersquos worried about me.ldquoMe too, you be OK tonight  asked Izzy.ldquoIrsquoll be OK. This evening, even though it was for a brief moment and he didnrsquot know it, I was with Finn. Irsquoll know hersquos near and will have a distant view of him in the morning. I feel closer to him than I have for four years, although itrsquos making me feel like a stalker.ldquoYoursquore not a stalker, Ewen, yoursquore a dad who loves his son.Ewen clenched his hands again. ldquoThank you.ldquoIrsquom doing it for Finn as much as for you, said Izzy. She was still sure she was doing the right thing, but was terried of the risks.ldquoPlease remember to be careful and stick to the plans we made, she pleaded. ldquoWe have to keep him safe. Hersquos been through enough already.ldquoI will, I promise.Ewen finished his tea and left the hostel.Izzy sat a while, trying to calm herself, eyes closed and breathing deeply.ldquoYou all right, honey She opened her eyes: it was a woman who had come into the kitchen. Izzy wanted to say yes but the womanrsquos concern and kind words triggered a flood of tears. It was her turn to be comforted, by a stranger who knew nothing of the burden she carried, of her guilt and overwhelming feeling of responsibility.ldquoThank you for being so kind, she said to the woman. ldquoI feel much better now after a wee greet.ldquoNo man is worth such upset, my lovely, the kind woman said. Izzy just nodded and smiled at her. If only it was that simple, she thought.She ed to the room and opened the door slowly Finn was sound asleep. Izzy felt emotionally exhausted and hoped shersquod fall asleep quickly, but as she lay in her bed after a hot shower, she couldnrsquot stop her mind racing it had been so close, whatFinn had woken  She trusted Ewen to be careful. But she must be careful too. Finally, under the gaze of MacFarlanersquos Lantern, sleep overtook her.Finn was first to wake in the morning.ldquoAunty, aunty, itrsquos morning! he said while looking out of the window. It was daylight but the sky had clouded over and thick mist hung on the hills.ldquoA typical Highland morning, he said cheerfully.Izzy got things packed as Finn had his shower and they left the hostel before most of the other residents were out of their beds. After a phone call to Finnrsquos mum, they set off.ldquoWhere we having breakfast  asked Finn.ldquoVery close by, on the banks of Loch Dochart.They drove for just a few minutes and pulled into a layby. Izzy performed her usual routine of bringing her rucksack. They walked through some woodland and arrived at the waterrsquos edge.ldquoWow, is that an island with a castle on it  asked Finn.ldquoIt is, said Izzy, ldquoand what stories are here!

It looked so mysterious.ldquoOne day, Taileachd discovered that his sweetheart had met Fionn and they had fallen in love.ldquoSo Fionn ran off with her, thatrsquos ironic! laughed Finn.ldquoNo, you see she loved them both, maybe in dferent ways, but she was now torn between them.

They were equally matched but when they jumped backwards, Fionn momentarily lost his balance and the giant, fearful he was going to lose his sweetheart, took the opportunity to cut off Fionnrsquos head!ldquoAw, ouch, foul! cried Finn.Izzy nodded and spoke with a solemn tone.ldquoIn that moment of violence, they all lost everything. The faery woman fled: she no longer loved Taileachd because of his brutal act, and Fionn, whom she loved, had lost his le. His body floated down the river, and was found by the Fiann, his band of warriors. They buried him at Killin and now they were full of vengeance, so went to search for Fionnrsquos murderer.ldquoDid they find him ldquoWell, Taileachd fled to Rannoch Moor and Irsquoll tell you what happened when we get there, later today.ldquoAw, aunty!Finnrsquos protest was interrupted as his attention was suddenly caught by the sight of a man in a dinghy rowing out into the loch.

It seems very unfair that we should no longer be able to use a road that we pay for to access the hills.I noticed a picture on Facebook, taken on a sunny Sunday when people would normally be out enjoying a walk around the reservoir, but only one car seems to be using the car park.As East Lothian grows, we should be utilising as much of our outdoor space as possible to help our population exercise and take pressure off coastlines and popular woodland areas. The Lammermuir Hills are underused for recreation and have a superb network of paths, but woefully inadequate parking.Overriding everything in the letter you printed is the Scottish Governments Land Reform Act of , which clearly states the Right for Responsible Access in Scotland.. The overall framework of land rights, responsibilities and public policies should promote, fulfil and respect relevant human rights in relation to land, contribute to public interest and wellbeing, and balance public and private interests. The framework should support sustainable economic development, protect and enhance the environment, help achieve social justice and build a fairer society.. There should be a more erse pattern of land ownership and tenure, with more opportunities for citizens to own, lease and have access to land.The landownerrsquos decision to heavily restrict parking prejudices families, those with disabilities and groups who take people walking in the hills and need an access point. I understand that during the last year, the countryside has suffered littering, fires and irresponsible parking, but to punish responsible visitors because of the behaviour of a minority is a knee-jerk reaction and will only create animosity towards the estate at a time when public opinion is turning against grouse shooting. Instead, the landowner should be working with local residents, East Lothian Council and interested parties to help improve access and educate visitors on how to visit responsibly.Name and address supplied"},{"url":null,"title":"builders-merchant-built-instead-hotel-former-raceland-site","story":"The former Raceland karting site, between Gladsmuir and Longniddry, closed in early .Work is due to start later this year on a petrol station, two drive-thru restaurants and a drive-thru cafe on the southern section of the site.Initial proposals suggested a hotel could be built on the northern part of the former karting site, where the outdoor track was located, but that could now be ditched for a buildersrsquo merchants.The karting centre was given planning permission in  and also operated a paintball centre.

Officially revealed at the  Geneva Motor Show, the Mini took the motoring world by storm, thanks to its retro looks and classy interior. Then, when they hit the road, it soon became clear BMW had crafted a car that wasnt just great to look at, but great to drive too.Prices started at pound, for the Mini One, rising to pound, for the more powerful Cooper iant, with both being built in Oxford and hitting the market in the UK two months before anywhere  in the world.Arrival of the Cooper SHot on the heels of the One and Cooper iants came the Cooper S. With performance in mind, it combined a .-litre petrol engine with a supercharger, resulting in a lot more power than the standard version. It had a more focused suspension set-up too, while the bonnet air intake became a design feature for all future Cooper S models.Production ramps upIncredibly, by May  ndash just over a year since it went on sale ndash the ,th Mini was produced at BMW Groups Oxford plant. It was a testament to the success of the design and execution of the Mini, thats for sure.The Mini goes drop-topFlash forward to  and the Mini Convertible arrived, bringing that wind-in-your-hair experience to the already-popular model. It still retained space for four, but used a fabric roof that folds up behind the rear seats and didnt require a cover.The boot may have been small at  litres with the roof open, but as with the rest of the range, the Convertible sold like hotcakes.Arrival of the GPThings took a turn for the more serious, with the arrival of the GP in . Limited to just , models worldwide ndash with  made available to UK buyers ndash the lighter, faster and meaner GP sold out before a single customer had even driven a car.Arriving as the most powerful production Mini to date, it used the same .-litre supercharged petrol engine as the Cooper S, but it was boosted for more power while plenty of weight was stripped from the cabin to make the GP even more exciting to drive.The dficult second albumIn August , Mini chose to reveal its second-generation car. It retained the same retro look like the original but was bigger and more efficient than before. The .-litre engine was changed, while the Cooper S used turbocharging instead of supercharging for the first time. Prices increased, too, with the One starting from pound, and the Cooper commanding pound,.Here comes the ClubmanMini took its first step in expanding the range with the introduction of the Clubman in . Debuting a new, estate car-like layout, the Clubman offered more space than the conventional hatch but retained the standard cars nimble handling and punchy range of engines.The start of electricationAt the  Los Angeles Auto Show, Mini presented the E, an electric concept. It created  Mini E vehicles, which were shipped for testing by private customers in Calornia, New York and New Jersey, with the results from this trial relayed back to Mini. It also helped BMW to develop its electric i model.The Countryman hits the roadNot content with the Clubman, Mini expanded the range in  with the Countryman. Taking advantage of the growing appetite for SUVs, the Countryman effectively took the Mini recipe and raised it further off the ground.It had seating for five, four doors and a reasonably large boot. It also retained the same funky styling that you got from the standard hatch.The Roadster and Coupe add even more styleMoving along to  saw the introduction of the Mini Coupe, a two-seater version of the standard hatch which was famously styled to resemble a backwards-facing baseball cap. It was joined by a soft-top version ndash the Roadster. It used a fabric roof like the standard convertible, but had a sleeker, more aerodynamically focused design.A change of pace for MiniIn , Mini introduced the Paceman, which represented a mash-up of an SUV and hatchback. In truth, it was a slightly odd combination, as it had an upright body style but just three doors. Sitting alongside the rest of the Mini line-up, it saw the firms range of cars swell to seven.Third times the charmShortly after the introduction of the Paceman came the introduction of a third-generation hatch. It debuted a new interpretation of the cars classic styling, but was still built in Oxford and was centred around that fun-to-drive experience. Arriving in , the third-generation hatch was bigger in every sense and utilised .-litre three-cylinder engines ndash though the more powerful Cooper S benefitted from a four-cylinder, .-litre petrol.The Mini gains a set of doorsShortly after the arrival of the third-generation Mini came a new, five-door iant, which brought improved rear legroom, a third rear seat, and a more accessible cabin. It has continued to be a great option even today.The Clubman ndash betteredMini followed on from the revitalisation of its hatchback with the introduction of a revised Clubman. It was bigger than before but retained the useful split rear doors, which gave access to a larger boot than before.An electried CountrymanIn , Mini showcased a real attempt at electrication with its Countryman Plug-in hybrid. The first hybrid model to be offered by the brand, it combined a three-cylinder petrol engine with an electric motor and batteries. Capable of driving for up to  miles on battery-power alone, it was easily the most economical car in Minis stable.The Mini goes electricThe year  proved to be a big deal for Mini, as it was when the companys first EV arrived in showrooms ndash the Mini Electric. Its styling was largely unchanged over the regular petrol and diesel models, while a zippy electric motor ensured it delivered the same winning driving experience. The Mini Electric has gone on to prove popular, despite its relatively short range of  miles.The present dayIn January , Mini presented the latest incarnation of its famous hatchback, delivering a new look and a range of technology updates. Though the styling was classical Mini, some key refinements ndash such as a new body-coloured front grille ndash ensure that it has remained looking sharp and up to date."},{"url":null,"title":"gardening-squirrel-proof-bird-feeders-actually-work","story":"Gardening: Do squirrel-proof bird feeders actually work A squirrel feederI have long had a problem with grey squirrels. They feast on birdseed in trays, play acrobatics to jump on fat ball feeders and make light work of scaling metal poles to steal the peanuts from my bird feeders.So, is there really a squirrel-proof feeder which works Matthew Tume, RSPB product manager of birdcare and optics, says that in reality, no product on the market is totally squirrel-proof.\"Squirrels are very intelligent and very determined, and they will find ways around things.\"However, Rachel Schofield, of birdfood and wildle product specialist CJ Wildle, says: \"Theres a great number of really good squirrel-proof feeders on the market, as far as adult squirrels are concerned. Juveniles, however, can squeeze through protective cages.\"What material should you go for \"Metal and preferably powder-coated. Plastic feeders wont last very long. You can buy protective cages for many feeders, but its cheaper to buy an integrated unit,\" says Schofield.\"Squirrels can chew through plastic ports, so we would recommend you use metal feeders, rather than plastic ones,\" Tume agrees.What about birdseed Youre best off with a no waste seed mix, says Schofield, which will help deter pigeons and squirrels from picking up the discarded husks which smaller birds deposit on to the ground. You can buy huskless seeds and sunflower hearts.\"De-husked ieties will be more expensive, but you get what you pay for. Reputable companies which sell good quality seed mixes wont pack them full of wheat or maize. And using de-husked ieties means that birds dont lose time trying to get to the nutrients,\" says Schofield.Where should I put the feeders \"Set them away from jumping-off points, such as fences and hanging trees. However, there is a balance. You want your feeders to have a degree of cover, as the further out in the open they are, the easier it is for predators - such as birds of prey - to spot them,\" says Tume.Are there any other ways to deter squirrels Some people suggest dusting the birdseed with chilli powder or hot sauce like Tabasco, which apparently doesnt bother the birds, but the squirrels dont like the spice, says Tume.Others recommend smearing your bird feeder poles with Vaseline to stop the squirrels climbing up them.Or, you could always try putting up a squirrel feeder at the other end of the garden, away from your bird station, and give visiting squirrels some peanuts of their own.On test: Which squirrel deterrents should I consider Feeder s\"There are feeder s, which are effectively cages which go around your feeders. You hang your feeders inside the cage. The idea is that the cage holes are big enough for small birds to enter and exit safely, and small enough to act as a deterrent for squirrels. They make it more dficult for squirrels to access, but juveniles will be able to squeeze through,\" says Tume.\"Smaller birds - such as blue tits, goldfinches and greenfinches - will be able to fly in and out of the cages, but larger birds - such as jackdaws and magpies - may be deterred, although magpies have long necks, so may be able to reach through to get the seed, depending on the gap between the cage wall and the feeder.\"They should be made to the exact specication which allows small birds in safely, but also deters adult squirrels and large birds,\" he adds.Tried  Tested: The Squirrel  Port Adventurer withThis was the only item which really stopped the squirrel in its tracks. It managed to jump on to the top of the feeder from a tall shrub but was too big to get through the metal guard. It even tried to open the lid of the tubular feeder, but couldnt get in.Squirrel bafflesThese are plastic domes which fit either over the bird feeder, or half way up the poleyou are securing the feeder from the ground, but under the feeding stations. They aim to prevent squirrels from descending on to or climbing up to the feeders.\"If they manage to climb on to the baffle, the baffle often rocks the squirrels loose, so they fall off,\" says Tume. \"We get mixed feedback on them.\"Tried  Tested: The Squirrel Guard Baffle This cone did stop the squirrels from climbing up to reach the feeder, but one managed to get on to the feeder from above, and then accessed the food. However, once Id moved the pole away from tall shrubs and trees from which it could gain access, the baffle worked very well.The weighted feederSquirrel Buster feeders are weighted devices which shut off access to the feeding points when a squirrel or heavy pigeon lands on them, via a metal shutter. These are widely available and one of the most popular deterrents.Tried  Tested: The Squirrel Buster Peanut Birdfeeder I made the mistake of hanging this weighted feeder from a bracket on my garden fencepost, which enabled the squirrel to access the peanuts by taking its weight on its back legs on the fence and then gently placing its front paws on the feeder.It didnt manage to get much food though, as the feeder bobbed up and down as its weight distribution changed. Place the feeder in a clear space with no other balancing points nearby, and it will be much more effective."},{"url":null,"title":"hannah-simone-for-sake-comedy-pit-women-other","story":"Overflowing with charmingly relatable, and, at times, utterly bizarre story arcs, US sitcom New Girl was quick to capture the hearts of viewers on both sides of the Atlantic.It is, in essence, the ultimate embodiment of le during your late s and early s.Encapsulating the day-to-day escapades of four equally quirky characters living under one roof, the show quickly achieved cult status, running for a grand total of  episodes before finally drawing to an end in .Now, as the show prepares to mark its th anniversary, Disney has announced that New Girl will be available to a whole new audience when it arrives on Star on the Disney+ streaming service this April.\"I mean, I would be up for it.

So our friendship was really close.\"And then when the writers and the creators of the show genuinely saw how close Lamorne and I were, they then started to write it into the show, which is why Winston and Cece became this kind of like very odd but wonderful duo.\"Its a friendship that translated seamlessly onto our screens, including the finer details such as the pairs synchronised finger clicks.\"I remember Lamorne and I on set doing this kind of like, snap, snap thing that kind of moment when we agreed on something.\"And then it made it into the show.\"And it was just a wonderful, genuinely funny moment for me that my weird little friendship that I have in real le with Lamorne had become such a huge part of the show and something that people really liked.\"So I love that I love that people really dig Winston and Cece and their mess arounds.\"The shows lasting legacyComprising of seven series and making up over a hundred hours worth of viewing time, New Girls legacy will continue to live on - both on our screens and as memories for the actors themselves.\"It was almost a decade of my le,\" notes Simone of the shows run.\"Its a huge part of who I am personally now...

We cannot manage what we cannot measure, which is why it is often left out of the carbon equation.:Claire Taylor: Indyref and a blinkered green agenda could harm Scottish farmings futureThis could all be about to change. Last week saw the launch of a global farm metric ndash a common benchmark to measure the sustainability of food and farming. I attended a TEDx event hosted by the Sustainable Food Trust which is leading a new coalition to establish a standardised approach for assessing the sustainability credentials of dferent farms. A common toolkit which will be rolled out internationally and will allow us to present a harmonised approach to measuring and managing agriculturersquos global emissions.Finally, the role our grasslands play in storing carbon will be properly recorded and recognised for their valuable contribution towards our journey to net zero emissions. It is now up to the next Scottish Government to embrace this global farm metric and start recognising farming as part of the solution.Farming practices will have to change to be part of this journey and I believe from speaking to farmers and reading the manestorsquos of dferent farming organisations that they are ready and up to the challenge, but this sht in production will require long term commitments over future funding.If farmers are going to be tasked with producing more environmentally friendly food which comes with a higher price tag, this has to be reflected in the value of food or  farmers will continue to need subsidies in order to keep food affordable for the public.Farmers today are producing food which is sold at the same price as it was  years ago. The same certainly canrsquot be said for the price of clothing, petrol or house prices.If we as consumers really value a future where low carbon produce becomes a staple in our shopping baskets, then we might have to start footing some of the bill.We all go into our local supermarket with the moral intentions of choosing food which supports good animal welfare and boasts environmental protections, but % of us go in and buy based on price.Food is cheap and we are so disconnected from the way it is produced that we often donrsquot value it and think nothing of throwing it away. Why  do we allow % of UK food to end up in the bin But are we lazy consumers with a disregard for seasonality and the origins of our food, or is it simply that we are overwhelmed by too much choice on the shelves that we canrsquot begin to understand the impact of our purchases :Claire Taylor: Blue Peter has no right to push an anti-meat agendaWe all might recognise a free-range egg label or red tractor assurance mark, but do we really feel equipped to make informed choices on the sustainability of our purchases  I back the proposals by the Scottish Greens and the SNP to introduce carbon labelling, but will it not all ultimately come back to a case of price During the TEDx event, the Chief Executive of Morrisonrsquos explained: ldquoChoice often means the balance between price and quality, price and provenance, price and healthier ingredients, but it always comes down to price.Morrisonrsquos have a clever solution to remove the pressure from consumers and place the onus on themselves to provide sustainable produce on their shelves. In March they announced that they would only be supplied by net zero carbon farms by  and will be working with their  farmers and growers to produce affordable net zero carbon meat, fruit, vegetables, and eggs. This takes away the uncertainty and ambiguity for its customers.As a nation emerging from a pandemic with rising levels of poverty and social inequality, we cannot expect the public to be putting sustainability at the top of their list, but longer term the responsibility will have to be shared by consumers.We as the public need to play our part in tackling the climate emergency and committing to responsible food choices is a good place to start. We need to start valuing the produce on our shelves and nipping in the bud the throwaway culture which has resulted from our disconnect.There is an urgency to rebuild our relationship with food and our understanding of how it Is produced. All roads lead back to education, and by introducing sustainable food production as part of the national curriculum will equip the next generation with the knowledge to make responsible food choices.Constitutional issues cannot be allowed to dominate and ide discussion over the next five years. A collaborative approach is needed to properly address and tackle the looming climate emergency and how our food is produced, purchased, and consumed has to be front and centre of policy decisions."},{"url":null,"title":"agenda-shifting-business-mindset-recovery","story":"AFTER a year of almost constant stop-start operations, businesses across Scotland are now seeing restrictions easing.

It was the first book he purchased after escaping slavery. He was none other than the abolitionist leader and social reformer Frederick Douglass, who passed on the treasure to his son, Lewis, in .From the moment he turned its pages, Frederick Douglass cultivated not only an admiration for Burns, but for the writings of Sir Walter Scott, and a le-long affection for Scotland and the Scottish people.Douglass at his desk at  Gilmore Street in Edinburgh composing persuasive letters and formidable lectures as an anti-slavery activist was only eight years removed from escaping his own trauma of slavery in Maryland in . He must have pondered this as he walked Princes Street or surveyed the city from Calton Hill.:Derided, bullied, but triumphant: the Scottish heroine who planted the seeds of freedomDouglas was in the remarkable position of advocating internationally for human liberty so soon after his own bondage. This rapid rise to prominence was a testament to his talents, but also to the shting moral consciousness of the throngs of people he addressed.He once wrote of Edinburgh: ldquoI enjoy everything here which may be enjoyed by those of a paler hue ndash no distinction here. I have found myself in the society of thehellipfirst people of this city and no one seemed alarmed by my presence.Douglass had initially come to Scotland as part of a tour to Britain and Ireland between  and  and again in  and . His specic engagement with Scotland was to speak out against the Free Church of Scotland which had financed itself through funds that came from slaveholders in the United States.He spoke widely across Scotland, filling up chapels and assembly halls beyond capacity. He first arrived in Glasgow in . Many of his speeches and public appearance in Glasgow were delivered at City Halls in Candleriggs. Audiences and communities responded to his Send Back The Money campaign with fervent support.The story of Douglass in Scotland links to a person he called, \"the single most important influence on his le.\" That personrsquos name was Dr James McCune Smith. A fellow American and former slave, Smith was an extraordinary figure and pioneer.:David Pratt: Indias Covid tragedy shows a tale of two pandemicsHe had been blocked from further education in the United States because he was an African-American. He turned to Scotland and the University of Glasgow which made the bold decision to admit him in the early s. Smith went onto to earn a bachelorrsquos degree, a masterrsquos degree, and his medical doctorate from the University of Glasgow. He was the first African-American to receive a medical degree, and it was from a Scottish university.There is no question that as Douglass embraced Scotland, he was influenced by his close friendrsquos example. To their great credit, the University of Glasgow has named a new pound million facility the James McCune Smith Learning Hub.Douglassrsquo first visit to Scotland ended with a moving stop in Hawick in the Borders. A reporter wrote that Douglass ldquospoke for nearly two hours, in a calm, cool, dignied, and impressive manner, that shewed him to be qualied above most men to command the attention of an audience. He was enthusiastically praised by the spectators, and then with fond farewells departed for northern England. The first Scottish tour of Douglass was monumental in terms of the scale of people he educated, touched and motivated.The spirit of Douglassrsquo legacy is still intact, but as with all historical figures who advocated for progressive social change, their tones and path prints can fade unless we download their voices, trace their footsteps, and disinter their ideas from the clutch of distant history.:Uzma Mir: Why cant Scots, in Scotland, use Scots words, without being called jakeys Douglass would have been inspired by todayrsquos Black Lives Matter movement, in fact, he was a courageous catalyst of it. In Scotland, he would have eagerly supported the Black Lives Matter Scottish Mural Trail developed by Wezi Mhura and artists from Black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds, living in Scotland.The trail is a reminder that the work of Douglass for global unity and racial equality is still an unfolding journey around the world. It is a winding road stridden by valiant feet fractured by the trying passage to greater equality. Wherever we are in the world, humanity is duty bound to enter the trail, for each to do our part in marching forward for racial justice and harmony.Ian Houston has spent his career in Washington, DC as an advocate for diplomacy, trade, global poverty alleviation, intercultural dialogue, and as a non-profit leader.

I also focused on raising my profile on social media and had far more buyers from around the world than any previous year.

It is well to remember that at the time of the independence referendum in  the EU opposed Scottish independence and was far from welcoming.The likely possibility of a customs border with England, our biggest trader, in the event of rejoining the EU would be abhorrent to most Scots, independence supporters included. The tears of Brexit are drying and it is time to face up to new realities which an independent Scotland can look forward to without the EU,only the leadership would catch up with events and accept that it is not desirable to go through the problematic negotiations of rejoining when a new promising course lies before us.John Inglis, Corrie, Arran.EUROPE WANTS SCOTLAND BACKGEORGE Renniewould have us believe that it could take  years for Scotland to get back into the EU Dr Kirsty Hughes, European relations expert, is a lot more optimistic. On the myth that Scotland would have to get to the end of the queue to rejoin the EU, Dr Hughes has stated that Scotland is in a strong position and while the EU has a clear technical process, \"Scotlands going to be ahead in that technical process\".The Scottish Centre on European Relations has stated that the EU views the UK as being \"unreliable, unpredictable and untrustworthy\" but that there is \"broad openness to Scotland having a normal accession path to the EU\" as long as that followed a \"legally and constitutionally sound referendum\".Among the member states there is great enthusiasm for Scotland rejoining the EU, expressed by such senior members as Donald Tusk, the former European Council President, and Ursula von der Leyen, EU Commission President, while Hungarian MEP Istvan Ujhelyi received strong support from fellow MEPs when he called for an independent Scotland to be allowed to rejoin the EU in an \"unobstructed and accelerated way\", pointing out that the Brexit situation was not caused by the Scottish people and that their voice must be heard.All the indications are that Europe has left a light on and the door open for Scotland toand take its place alongside the  other independent nations of the European Union.Ruth Marr, Stirling.* IT is interesting that Gordon McCallumhas been able to adjust his company and its customers to continue doing business after Brexit ndash well done.

Of course, Scotland was none of those things. Worryingly England seems to be heading toward the ldquoone-party state situation, where a minority party has total control over all the levers of state power and the BBC, and the opposition are in terminal decline.Now we have a Ruritanian situation where gunboats are dispatched over a small fisheries dispute, with jingoist backing of the right-wing press .

The only way we will make progress with a constitution is to draft it ourselves.Most countries have constitutions that are closer to lay terms than legal language, allowing their citizens to easily understand their rights. We should have the same and it is for this reason that the charity Constitution for Scotland has been set up and has produced an interactive website at www.constitutionforscotland.scot that allows everyone the chance to shape a model constitution. Mr Morris mentions Dr Elliot Bulmer, who was involved in its early stages. Although drafted with the assumption that Scotland will be independent, whether readers are in favour of independence or not, a constitution helps us define what is important to us and how the country should be run.John C Hutchison, Secretary, Constitution for Scotland, Fort William.BROWN HAS FORM FOR CHILD POVERTYGORDON Brown out on the recent hustings criticised the SNP with its failure to signicantly reduce child poverty in Scotland.I fully agree we should be doing better.He went on to say: \"Poverty is not just a scandal ndash for children it is a crime.Does Mr Brown ever consider how much child poverty he helped create when he voted for the Iraq war  Thousands of innocent kids were killed or orphaned in Iraq, all resulting in major child poverty for thousands of innocent Iraqi children.I would like to think Mr Brown might have a road to Damascus moment and get himself out there to help.

Its always sunny in artists impressions, which is a bit of a swizz.Its far more rare to see pleasant weather in our drizzly city and thats one of the long running complaints about the Avenues, which seem to be a solid use of the Scottish and UK governments City Deal money.As mentioned, you cant please all of the people and there are relentless grumbles about the local authority trying to make Glasgow like Amsterdam when it has too many hills, and like Copenhagen when it rains all the time.Honestly, some people will turn their nose up at anything. Yes, cycling in the rain can leave you with a day spent smelling slightly of damp, and thats not for everyone, but we have to work with whats in front of us, which includes inclement weather and inclines.A more reasonable grumble is the pace of the Avenues project, which extends across the city centre and to the south and north west of Glasgow. It seems logical that the pandemic shut down would have been the ideal time to accelerate the work on the cycle routes and streetscape improvements. While the city centre was deserted, there might have been some cracking on with these new routes.One of the elements of this election has been the broad similarities in manestos. On developing a green future, only the Scottish Conservatives stood out as taking a dferent path. While the other four main parties looked to ideas to boost active travel and focused on public transport and cycling, the Tories suggested widening the M motorway, upgrading the A to a dual carriageway and scrapping parking charges on publicly-owned car parks.Not to entirely do them down, they did also have some decent cycling proposals but they also had a strong focus on vehicles at a time when we need to sideline private cars for other options.The Conservatives did make mention of introducing an extensive network of charging points. As we push towards a future where all cars are electric, infrastructure is, of course, the right way forward and the introduction of charging points is currently still too slow.At the same time as the Scottish Tories are thinking electric, incentives for upgrading to electric cars have been slashed by their Westminster counterparts, a short sighted move exactly when the switch to electric needs to be consistently incentivised.Manesto-wise, the SNP spoke enthusiastically about the creation of -minute neighbourhoods while the Greens took it one step further - or, many steps fewer - with a claim it would focus on creating -minute neighbourhoods.These are living spaces where everything you need for work, rest, education and play are within a  minute radius and are a new key focus of cities globally.Active travel infrastructure and  minute neighbourhoods form a key role in the other major Glasgow news this week, another area where Id like some time travel involvement. Glasgow City Council released its development plans for the next  years, plans which aim to contribute towards making Glasgow carbon neutral by , helping post-covid recovery and creating the next incarnation of this ever-regenerating city.In it, there are progressive, innovate ideas. There are also ideas that should have been tackled years ago. One such is the development of the riverside.What a waste it is to have the River Clyde swelling through the city and not use it. Theres little suggestions of le here and there - the two Hiltons at Finnieston, the Riverside Museum, the BBCs headquarters and the under construction Barclays campus all hint at what might be.On those rare bright days, the banks of the Clyde behind St Andrews Cathedral are jam-packed with sun seekers lounging on the grass, making the most of the view. Every other day its grey and glass strewn along an incoherent cycle path, quiet but for the high-vis of police vests as officers attend to day drinkers and graffiti artists.Making the most of the river is one element of plans to make the city more liveable. Another is, of course, cutting down car use - yet another issue that meets relentless, grumbling resistance.Why you would opt for city living where everything is in walking distance and be determined to park a car immediately outside your flat I cannot fathom.But you do have to wonder what it will take to ease peoples resistance to greener, healthier measures for the city. The evidence of the dangers of inaction are already there.Last month a coroner in England called for a change in the law following the death Ella Adoo-Kis-Debrah, who died in  in Lewisham, south-east London. An inquest found air pollution had \"made a material contribution\" to her death, making the nine-year-old the first person to have air pollution listed as the cause of death on their death certicate.The month before, the EUs highest court ruled that the UK \"persistently\" exceeded legal limits for nitrogen dioxide over the past  years and has failed in its legal duties to reduce air pollution limits. The British Medical Association has described air pollution as a public health emergency.Glasgow city centre hosts some of the highest nitrogen dioxide levels in the country, with Renfield and Hope Streets particular hotspots, along with the Anderston area where the M motorway runs next to a primary school.As a result of the pandemic, we know the effect of a reduction in vehicles in the city centre. Air pollution levels dropped to their lowest since  due to fewer cars being on the roads.Glasgow has had its many incarnations and its overdue another, one focused on equality, sustainability and green values and its residents need to keep pushing to make sure promises are delivered.Its never going to be halcyon. We cannot step inside the artists impression and have a le as sharp coloured and clean as an illustration. We can, though, look to the future with ambition as these new plans do, and embrace change come rain or shine."},{"url":null,"title":"conservatives-win-hartlepool-by-election-claiming-seat-labour","story":"RESULT JUST IN: @JillHartlepool is ready to get to work for the people of Hartlepool#PeoplesPriorities pic kxYCLeFfgIt comes after Labour had all but conceded defeat in the Hartlepool by-election, when a shadow cabinet member admitted the party was ldquonot close to winning this.Shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon, who led the Opposition partyrsquos campaign to hold the North East town, said it looked clear that Labour had not ldquogot over the line.It means Sir Keir Starmerrsquos hopes of leading a Labour revival have been dealt a crushing blow after the Tories romped to victory in the Hartlepool by-election.:Rebecca McQuillan: The results of English elections could be critical to Scotlandrsquos futureThe Conservatives took the seatwith a stunning majority of ,.Shadow communities secretary Steve Reed admitted it was an ldquoabsolutely shattering result as another brick in the partyrsquos once impregnable ldquored wall crumbled.It provoked a furious reaction from the Labour left ndash sidelined since Sir Keir became leader last year ndash who said the party must now change direction.However, Mr Reed insisted they would double down on the more centrist approach taken over the past  months.ldquoWhat this shows is that, although we have started to change since the cataclysm of the last general election, that change has clearly not gone far enough in order to win back the trust of the voters, he told BBC Breakfast.In a major boost for Boris Johnson, Conservative candidate Jill Mortimer gained , votes ndash more than half the total cast ndash with Labourrsquos Dr Paul Williams, trailing on ,.And early results in council contests appeared to show voters deserting Labour, with the Tories seizing Redditch and Nuneaton  Bedworth councils in the Midlands, along with Harlow in Essex and Northumberland.In her victory speech, Ms Mortimer said the result ndash overturning a Labour majority of more than , at the  general election ndash was ldquotruly historic.ldquoLabour have taken people in Hartlepool for granted for too long.

We protect ourselves and others by following public health advice and getting vaccinated when our turn comes.“Social distancing and limiting the number of contacts we have are still vitally important. So too are wearing a face covering and washing hands well and often.“Also, please always remember the particular risks from indoor settings, especially those that are crowded and have poor ventilation.”Northern Ireland yesterday recorded  new cases of Covid-, with zero cases recorded in the over- cohort in five out of  council areas over the previous seven days, while no deaths linked to the virus were reported.There were  Covid- inpatients, of which seven were in intensive care and five care home outbreaks.Belfast Most ReadAstonishing antics of NI hospital medic revealed: Doctor Tsakov admits to lewd and racist outbursts and showing porn to colleaguesTop Belfast chef fumes as ‘weekend cancelled’ with forced outdoor terrace closure while indoor petrol station dining allowedFormer Presbyterian moderator joins ex-IRA man on SDLP’s Irish unity groupRevealed: the BBC NI presenters paid the most for external workBritish and Irish Lions squad in full: Ulster captain Iain Henderson earns spot in  but Johnny Sexton misses outTop VideosPlayWatch: Suzanne Breen gives her take on the DUP leadership racePlayVideo: Finn McCool caught on camera at the Giant’s Causeway!PlayNew BBC Documentary shine slight on Northern Bank RobberyLatest CoronavirusFionola MeredithOpinionIs it morally right to vaccinate children against Covid- Covid- will lead to a decline in le expectancy, health chiefs sayThe £. pint: How price of premium beer has soared in Belfast pubsNon-essential cross-border travel must be stopped ‘by enforcementrequired’Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Over-s to be offered jab ‘within a few weeks’LatestHenderson eager to take learnings from first tour as he bids to become a Test Lion in South AfricaUEFA to push for fans to be admitted to potential all-English Windsor Park Super Cup clashCounting begins in Scottish constituenciesInterContinental Hotels sees improvements in US and ChinaBlast that hurt former Males president ‘act of terrorism’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

new party leader and deputy leader on Thursday.Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots and Sir Jeffrey Donaldson MP will go head-to-head to succeed Arlene Foster as no other party member entered the leadership race.East Londonderry MP Mr Campbell, North Antrim MLA Paul Frew and North Belfast MLA Ms Bradley are all in the running for deputy leader.Mrs Foster said she would resign as DUP leader on May  and as First Minister at the end of June.The electoral college is made up of the party’s MPs and MLAs and they will vote for their new leader on Friday, May .In order to become party leader, a candidate must secure the support of at least  of the DUP’s MLAs and MPs.The deadline for nominations was pm on Thursday.In a brief statement, Lord Morrow confirmed the contenders on Thursday evening.Lagan Valley MLA Mr Poots sent a four-page document to his party colleagues telling them thathe becomes leader, he will aim to “restore the party’s fortunes and rebuild unionism”.He added that he will restructure and re-energise the DUP as he confirmed that he will split the jobs of First Minister and party leader.Meanwhile, Sir Jeffrey said he wanted to rebuild a “shared future for Northern Ireland” during his campaign launch in Belfast on Monday.It comes after the News Letter reported that the party has issued a gagging order on both Mr Poots and Sir Jeffrey, banning them from speaking to the media in the run up to the internal elections.It is the first leadership contest in the DUP’s -year history.The gagging order was issued by the DUP press office on Tuesday and stated that party officers had decided that “no candidate is to be fielded by the party for media appearances interview during the period of the leadership during the period of the leadership campaign”.“This applies to both candidates for leader and deputy leader positions,” continued the guidance note.It continued: “No candidate is to unilaterally give broadcast or print interviews about their candidature.”Other party representatives are still permitted to speak to the media but have been advised not to commentate on a preferred candidate or any campaign.Explaining why leader and deputy leader candidates cannot speak to the media, a spokesperson for the DUP stated: “The party officers have taken decisions as to the processes for the election campaign, including the fact that candidates will not be fielded by the party for media opportunities during this time.“Candidates, rather than the apparatus of the party, will continue to promote themselves to the electoral college at this time.“All candidates who have thus far publicly indicated their intention to run have been advised of the details of these matters.”Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph

Credit : Test PixMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailIn the  years since I worked on the Good Friday Agreement and its implementation I have been involved in many other peace processes around the world, from Colombia to Mozambique.There is always a stage you reach in every successful process when you have to find a way to confront the past so you can move forward. Otherwise you just keep being dragged back into the very history you are trying so hard to escape.I am no fan of the way this Conservative government has handled Northern Ireland nor do I know what their plan is with regard to the legacy of the Troubles, partially leaked yesterday and condemned by most political leaders in Northern Ireland.I certainly believe it would be wrong to have a one-sided amnesty just for soldiers and policemen and their role in the Troubles.Buttheir plan is to deal with the past in an even-handed way in consultation with victims, and with the Irish government, and establish a workable truth and reconciliation process, then I would welcome it as the only way in which Northern Ireland can finally move on.We tried before Tony Blair left office to find such a route to truth and reconciliation by establishing the Eames-Bradley Commission in . Unfortunately it was unable to find a consensus on the way forward.And since then we have seen peace repeatedly interrupted by the arrest of republican leaders, like Gerry Adams in , and the attempted prosecution of police and soldiers for crimes committed during the Troubles.Substantial police resources are being poured into historical investigations and prosecutions which are rarely successful and almost never bring satisfaction to any side. Contrast that with the healing brought about by the Bloody Sunday inquiry exposing the truth of what happened on that terrible day to all the families who had suffered for so long.Blanket amnesties are no longer right or even possible in modern conflicts. And this is a deeply sensitive issue in which the rights of victims who have suffered so much should be central.But you have to balance peace and justice rather than being absolute about either — you don’t want to create more victims in the future at the cost of trying to secure absolute justice for victims of the past.That is why in other peace processes the two sides have opted for transitional justice programmes, as in Colombia, or truth and reconciliation programmes as in South Africa.What most victims want are the facts about what happened, that those responsible acknowledge their responsibility and to find a way to reach closure.In Northern Ireland, as where in the world, that has to be done through a process that does not necessarily end up in court, which in any case, as time passes, is less and likely to result in a successful prosecution.It needs to be a system tailored specically for Northern Ireland. But examples where in the world show there are ways forward where there is imagination and the political will to face the past.I hope that rather than just preventing the prosecution of the security forces for crimes committed in the Troubles, the Government will now consult victims, political parties and civil society in Northern Ireland as well as the Irish government on the right way to establish a new process of truth and reconciliation.If not, Northern Ireland’s progress towards a lasting peace risks being constantly interrupted by the reappearance of the bloody history from which it is trying to escape.Jonathan Powell was chief of staff to Tony Blair and chief British negotiator in Northern Ireland from -Belfast Most ReadAstonishing antics of NI hospital medic revealed: Doctor Tsakov admits to lewd and racist outbursts and showing porn to colleaguesTop Belfast chef fumes as ‘weekend cancelled’ with forced outdoor terrace closure while indoor petrol station dining allowedFormer Presbyterian moderator joins ex-IRA man on SDLP’s Irish unity groupRevealed: the BBC NI presenters paid the most for external workBritish and Irish Lions squad in full: Ulster captain Iain Henderson earns spot in  but Johnny Sexton misses outTop VideosPlayWatch: Suzanne Breen gives her take on the DUP leadership racePlayVideo: Finn McCool caught on camera at the Giant’s Causeway!PlayNew BBC Documentary shine slight on Northern Bank RobberyLatest Northern IrelandCatching dog poisoner with CCTV ‘impossible’Covid- will lead to a decline in le expectancy, health chiefs sayRows over protocol ‘could harm bid to rebuild ailing NHS’Corncrakes making a comeback on RathlinUnions call for end to ‘fire and rehire’LatestLinfield boss Healy will be a man in demand across the water, believes predecessor FeeneyClarke remaining level-headed after surging into early lead at year#s first seniors# MajorHenderson eager to take learnings from first tour as he bids to become a Test Lion in South AfricaUEFA to push for fans to be admitted to potential all-English Windsor Park Super Cup clashCounting begins in Scottish constituencies,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is arguably one of the least affected sectors from the ious lockdown restrictions.“Only  manufacturing jobs came off furlough in March relative to the previous month. That means a sizeable , jobs within manufacturing, or  in  of all jobs, are currently out of action.“The concern is that a signicant number of these jobs may be lost when the furlough scheme expires.

He was a  chair for the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce on February  and a list at an event at Queen’s University in Belfast on March .Both of these were in the earnings bracket of up to £,.Also listed is BBC NI weatherman and presenter Barra Best, who hosted an event for Charter NI and the Short Strand Community Forum on February .

Graphic designer Ryan met the part-time dog groomer in  before proposing a year later in front of Disneyland Paris’s Sleeping Beauty Castle.As first reported in the Strabane Chronicle, when he and Megan began planning their wedding and looked into the possibility of renting a photo booth, Ryan instead decided to create his own photo prop.“I’m just a real cheapskate. As the money we were spending started to ratchet up, I just thought I would make it myself,” he told the Belfast .“I have already made all the centrepieces for tables from each of the houses of the Seven Kingdoms, including the Lannisters, Starks and Targaryens.We have done our wedding invites in the theme and there will be pop-up banners. This extra addition was just supposed to be a bit of fun, but now it’s all gone a bit mad.”Thanks to Ryan’s efforts, the wedding guests, whether Games of Thrones fans or not, will have the chance to sit on the iconic Iron Throne and rule like a king or queen of Westeros,only for a few moments.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseRyan McDevitt on the Iron Throne he built for his wedding in July FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueRyan McDevitt on the Iron Throne he built for his wedding in JulyIn the land of Westeros, the Iron throne was made by Aegon Targaryen, the first king of the Seven Kingdoms, from swords surrendered by his enemies.According to the show’s lore, the throne was made from , swords over  days. Spikes and jagged edges in every direction make it one very intimidating seat.In Ryan’s case, he had to make do with plastic swords purchased from the internet. “I went to loads of charity shops in search of the right chair and finally came across a really old-fashioned one, like what you see in your granny’s house,” he said.“I ripped all the cushion off the chair, stripped it down to the bare bones and then built up from the base.I got big sheets of plywood from a building supplier, made a stencil for the back part and worked from there.Then I bought a load of medieval plastic swords from eBay. I got yoga mats too and cut them up to be wrapped around the chair.“I started work on the throne last year, just before Covid hit, and worked on it bit by bit.

The commission is a very progressive body and hearing a range of perspectives will be invaluable.There is so much work to do. If there’s a future referendum, people need to know what sort of Ireland they’re voting for.”Dr Hamilton said: “I am delighted that the SDLP have reached out beyond the usual political activists to people of faith like me. I didn’t hesitate for a second in agreeing to come on board.I will be sitting on the commission as a Christian minister, and not as an armchair politician.”Dr Hamilton said he would “be surprised”he didn’t face criticism for joining the commission. “Some people will struggle to understand why a former Presbyterian moderator would want to be part of a discussion on Irish unity,” he said.“It’s important to remember that Presbyterians weren’t always unionists. It may seem strange, and a bit unpalatable now, but historically Presbyterians have been on both sides of the constitutional question here. The United Irishmen were radical Presbyterians.”Askedhe was a unionist or a nationalist, the former moderator said: “The unionism I come from is being changed by what is happening in London and Edinburgh. The underpinnings of the Union are being challenged by a rising English nationalism. It’s no longer clear to me what a unionist is.Dr Hamilton may head a policy think-tank on the role of faith communities in a new Ireland. “The Catholic Church’s relationship with the Irish state has a dficulty history so this would be important  work,” he said.Other  members included ex-NIO political director Chris McCabe former joint leader of the Green Party NI, Professor John Barry Lilian Seenoi Barr of the North West Migrants Forum victims’ campaigner Jude Whyte and disabled rights’ activist Michaela Holywood.Former Policing Board vice-chair Denis Bradley civic activist Conor Houston Dublin barrister Brian Barrington and Northern Ireland’s former chief probation officer Breidge Gadd are also members.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said: “This is the beginning of the real conversation about what type of society we want to be. Instead of platitudes and demands, the SDLP is rolling up our sleeves to work with people across our communities, to have the dficult conversations and to bring forward the practical detail that has been lacking from the constitutional debate.”Belfast Most ReadAstonishing antics of NI hospital medic revealed: Doctor Tsakov admits to lewd and racist outbursts and showing porn to colleaguesTop Belfast chef fumes as ‘weekend cancelled’ with forced outdoor terrace closure while indoor petrol station dining allowedFormer Presbyterian moderator joins ex-IRA man on SDLP’s Irish unity groupRevealed: the BBC NI presenters paid the most for external workBritish and Irish Lions squad in full: Ulster captain Iain Henderson earns spot in  but Johnny Sexton misses outTop VideosPlayWatch: Suzanne Breen gives her take on the DUP leadership racePlayVideo: Finn McCool caught on camera at the Giant’s Causeway!PlayNew BBC Documentary shine slight on Northern Bank RobberyLatest PoliticsJuly target is set for bonus payments for health staff Troubles prosecutions amnesty: ‘The last time I felt as angry was on the day my sister was killed’Allison MorrisOpinionTroubles prosecution amnesty latest in long line of initiatives to tackle issue of NI#s pastJonathan PowellOpinionNew process of truth and reconciliation is a way for NI to move onThe forgotten: , Troubles murders could go unpunished under government plansLatestClarke remaining level-headed after surging into early lead at year#s first seniors# MajorHenderson eager to take learnings from first tour as he bids to become a Test Lion in South AfricaUEFA to push for fans to be admitted to potential all-English Windsor Park Super Cup clashCounting begins in Scottish constituenciesInterContinental Hotels sees improvements in US and China,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Baroness Ritchie lost her seat in  to Sinn Fein’s Chris Hazzard, the first MP from his party to be elected in South Down.“I moved on from [being SDLP leader] because I definitely had something  to do,” she said. “My role as an MP was already very busy and demanding and I wanted to devote more time to that position. It was already very dficult to lead the party from Westminster,” she said. Mrs Foster will step down as DUP leader on May  and as First Minister at the end of June after an internal revolt against her leadership came to a head last week. It’s after a letter of no confidence was signed by a majority of the party’s senior elected representatives.“It must be very dficult for her personally,” said Baroness Ritchie, who was given a peerage in former Prime Minister Theresa May’s resignation honours list. “She will be moving out of a job and the permanence of a situation she has been in after being active in politics for a number of years. It also must be challenging to continue in your role after an announcement like this has been made, it’s not easy.”Prior to her role as SDLP leader, Baroness Ritchie held roles as Minister for Social Development in the Assembly from  until and remembers sitting around the Executive table with Mrs Foster, who had previously worked as Minister for Health, Enterprise and Finance before becoming First Minister.“I’ve sympathy for her on a personal level. There comes a time in le where, after being so busy for so long with the demands of politics and all the other areas of your le, you have to say I’ve to take a step back.“Everyone is human. I got breast cancer a few years later which put things in perspective and forced me to slow down — as long as you still have your health, that’s the most important thing.“[Stepping down] leaves a void. I can understand as a woman and as a woman in politics especially, what she’s going through, even though we have very dferent political perspectives,” she said.The end of Mrs Foster’s leadership both as First Minister and the leader of the DUP will usher in an era of upheaval, Baroness Ritchie said. “It will spell change for the DUP and politics in the north because we will have a new leader in that party and a new first minister,” she said “It could mean an earlier Assembly election and it could breed political instability but it depends on who the DUP choose as their leader.”Belfast Most ReadAstonishing antics of NI hospital medic revealed: Doctor Tsakov admits to lewd and racist outbursts and showing porn to colleaguesTop Belfast chef fumes as ‘weekend cancelled’ with forced outdoor terrace closure while indoor petrol station dining allowedFormer Presbyterian moderator joins ex-IRA man on SDLP’s Irish unity groupRevealed: the BBC NI presenters paid the most for external workBritish and Irish Lions squad in full: Ulster captain Iain Henderson earns spot in  but Johnny Sexton misses outTop VideosPlayWatch: Suzanne Breen gives her take on the DUP leadership racePlayVideo: Finn McCool caught on camera at the Giant’s Causeway!PlayNew BBC Documentary shine slight on Northern Bank RobberyLatest PoliticsJuly target is set for bonus payments for health staff Troubles prosecutions amnesty: ‘The last time I felt as angry was on the day my sister was killed’Allison MorrisOpinionTroubles prosecution amnesty latest in long line of initiatives to tackle issue of NI#s pastJonathan PowellOpinionNew process of truth and reconciliation is a way for NI to move onThe forgotten: , Troubles murders could go unpunished under government plansLatestLinfield boss Healy will be a man in demand across the water, believes predecessor FeeneyClarke remaining level-headed after surging into early lead at year#s first seniors# MajorHenderson eager to take learnings from first tour as he bids to become a Test Lion in South AfricaUEFA to push for fans to be admitted to potential all-English Windsor Park Super Cup clashCounting begins in Scottish constituencies,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

So Ill be in the kitchen prepping on Christmas Eve and then the dinner will be cooked and delivered on Christmas Day for anyone who’s alone or in need of one.Last year we actually had some spare meals left over so I went and delivered them up to the Fire Station, which was the highlight of my Christmas, she said.Paula has been provided with the names of people in the local community who would benefit from the scheme by the Operation Snowball at the OLT and staff at the Long Tower Youth Club.This service is free of charge of course, soyou or someone you know needs help this Christmas please send me a message to the Peggys Kitchen Facebook page,continued Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push Last year we covered the cost of it ourselves, apart from the desserts, but this year Foyle Fruit have kindly offered to donate the potatoes and vegetables and we have also had donations of containers and cups. All donations are welcome andanyone wishes to help our efforts that help would be much appreciated.Ms Monk has enlisted the help of two delivery drivers to take the food to the Bogside, Brandywell and Creggan areas of the city.Like all cafes, Peggys Kitchen is closed at the moment due to current restrictions.Its sad that we cant open because we really miss our customers like the Over s Club that used to meet here every Wednesday and for a lot of them it was their only source of interaction but the safety of everyone needs to come first, said Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push We cant wait to reopen again but until then please keep safe.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A media briefing was held on Tuesday where the Trust revealed that over  per cent of care home residents have been inoculated. According to Dr Bob Brown, Executive Director of Nursing Primary Care and Older Peoples services, there has also been a ‘very good response’ amongst care home staff. The Trust previously stated that  per cent of care home staff had accepted the vaccine. There are currently no Covid outbreaks in local care homes. The Trust provides care for over , service users in their own homes every day. There has been  per cent vaccine uptake amongst home care staff. googletag.cmd.push Information on vaccine uptake amongst hospital staff and Trust-wide numbers are not available, the meeting heard. Dr Brown explained: “I would say that’s not information that we would be providing on the basis that we cannot ask iniduals, have you or have you not had a vaccine.” “Therefore, we’re working on the basis of exit information. We know we’ve had an increasingly positive uptake but, he said, it’s dficult to provide evidence of specic numbers in each area.” Askedstaff on high-risk hospital wards would be encouraged to take the vaccine, such as those who treat cancer patients, he said: “We’ll certainly use every opportunity we can through our leadership walks to encourage uptake of the vaccine, that’s something as a corporate management team that we have taken as a priority in recent weeks, to absolutely do that.” googletag.cmd.push Chief Executive Dr Anne Kilgallen added: “We continue to have very stringent infection control measures at ward level, continue to have the use of PPE and social distancing as far as possible. “So those measures remain in force and are continually monitored and encouraged by ourselves. “The vaccine is another line of defence but we always will adhere to the very high levels of PPE and infection control at clinical patient contact level.” The prospect of another wave of infections was raised at the media briefing. Geraldine McKay, Director of Acute Hospitals, said there is some data which assures the Trust ‘no high surge’ is anticipated over the summer but a ‘small spike’ could take place at the end of Autumn and beginning of Winter.     She continued: “That would be normal winter pressures and respiratory disease so we’re not surethere would be any additional spike there due to Covid. “That’s the basic information we have at this time.” Dr Kilgallen encouraged the public to take the vaccine and adhere to restrictions to allow the Trust and wider NHS to treat other important health issues. “Take the vaccine when it’s offered but also be aware that restrictions that remain are in our best interests and we should do our best to comply at all times,” she said. ‘VOLUNTARY’ A debate has been ongoing in other parts of the UK about whether the vaccine should be mandatory for care home staff or those working in high-risk areas. The Derry News lodged Freedom of Information requests with the Western Trust, Health and Social Care Board and Department of Health- which oversees the running of the programme - to get a detailed breakdown of vaccine uptake amongst staff. In response, each organisation said it did not hold the information. The DoH explained that thevaccinationprogramme remains voluntary but where uptake is lower than average staff will be ‘encouraged’ to accept the vaccine. A spokesperson said: “As cohorts become eligible, iniduals make their own decisions about stepping forward forvaccination. “The Department does not routinely record reasons why people choose not to bevaccinated. “As the programme proceeds and more information becomes available on uptake rates within particular parts of the HSC workforce, action will be taken to try and encourage uptake in any areas where the uptake levels remains lower than average.” The DoH believes that overall, there has been a ‘good uptake’ of thevaccineamongst health and social care staff. More detailed data will be available in the coming weeks, a spokesperson said. She concluded: “This will enable the Department and Trusts to drill down and obtain more granular data regarding the ious parts of the health service andnecessary focus on those areas with lower uptake rates.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Its time to get balls whizzing around coaching sessions, in house games on tap and a multitude of fixtures.Supporters will be absent. As will the use of dressing rooms. But thats okay. In time thatll . For now players need action. Thats the priority, though it would be a nice touchsome of the older fans, who have already been vaccinated, could get out to see a game.This column has also been pushing for the importance of young people getting out and active. The buzz from the endorphins flying around the body is one aspect, but the social interaction they have missed has been colossal.Underage coaches dont realise how much of an influence they have on the players under their watch. From interviewing players from ious teams for nostalgic features, they will often recall their early days playing sport.Just last week, former Ballinderry player Martina Devlin described Rita Moran, a coach at St Marys Magherafelt, as a fantastic person and mentor, a role model and the most influential person on her camogie career. It was more than just sport.As teams go back to training, it makes me think how clubs have a second chance to make a first impression on our youth. Just as a teacher can shape the career path of a student, a coach and sporting memories will determine how far a player will develop. You cant make a horse drink, but it still has to be brought to the water first.Seamus Downey still talks about Laveys one ball each philosophy at underage that helped hone a group of youngsters at a club languishing in the realms of B football into one of the top sides in Ulster. Their indoor facility was a help, but working on the basic skills all year round has worked wonders.The same can be said for Glen, who got their house in order before totally dominating underage football with a group that has their seniors jostling for a place at the top table. People will point to the size of their catchment area, but it wasnt until they organised themselves properly that things started to change.Underage coaching in clubs should be about bringing everyone up a level.Not only will it give everyone an enjoyable experience, which is the number one priority, But, in the long term, it will be a much healthier club.I always remember chatting to Crossmaglen player Cathal Short and looking on with envy at their success. What made them stand out  Yes, they had county players like himself, Oisin McConville, the McEntees and Francie Bellew. But, in club football, , on a given day, the county players from each team were to cancel each other out, Cross other players were of a higher standard. This made the dference.His uncle Aidan, a coach at the club and former teacher in St Patricks Maghera, spoke at an underage coaching camp I attended one weekend in St Marys Magherafelt. He revealed something that has always stuck out.Other clubs in Armagh judged themselves on being able to beat Crossmaglen at underage level. A victory over the Rangers constituted a successful year.In Cross, their benchmark was for the minor team to produce at least four players, every year, to push into the senior  the following season.They didnt concentrate on just the elite. Some years they would churn out more, but four was always the target. Underage medals were a welcome addition and driving the standards of coaching would iniably have them at the cutting edge of competitions.Their underage teams seeing All-Ireland titles being paraded into the hall helped with the motivation, but it still doesnt kick the ball over the bar for you.The biggest challenge in the GAA is giving everyone a chance to play on a regular basis. The Go Games format at the younger ages has been brilliant in terms of smaller sided games. Not only does it give more touches, but a  of  can be split into three teams of seven. There will be no subs and everyone has the chance to test their coaching in a game.The problem started at U level, with full dug-outs. A bigger club, of which there are a few, can add in a few extra Us to take the total to  and enter two U teams. Its not ideal,there is a case of playing across two codes – football and hurling or camogie.The case mentioned above is common, with three teams of seven becoming a team of , with  subs. This is where underage coaches need to ask themselves questions How can I finish the season with  players still coming to coaching sessions  We have all heard stories of the top three or four players not going as far as senior level. Emigration, injury, a loss of interest or their sheer size at underage no longer allowing them to dominate a game at minor level and above.In the long term, its bringing everyone up the ranks so that come senior level, there are enough numbers to field senior and reserve teams with regularity. Thats a healthy club.Bringing more players up through the underage grades is more important than success. Winning the odd trophy is great andyou are able to win U, U, U and minor titles while bringing everyone along, then thats the ultimate.Underage players will stick with youthey are getting games. In a squad of , like above, starting the same team every week is criminal. Ten minutes at the end of a game every week isnt development. It is tokenism.The greatest prize you can give anyoneis a starting jersey. Based on attendance at training, everyone should be given a chance to play a full game as often as possible. If someone is seen as a key player, use games to rotate them into dferent positions. Challenge them to use their weaker side, to develop a dummy. Give them the best possible chance to better themselves. By senior level, they will thank you for it.If you have big numbers at training, ide them up and play seven a side games. Two teams on, the other working on skills with another coach before swapping places. Introduce a competition every so often. Count the blocks, count the assists, count the dummies. Stick a photo of the winning player up on the club social media. Anything to keep things fresh.It is up to coaches at nursery level to give players the skill base. By U, they should be playing as many games as possible. And the more they get at training, the better placed they are to shine in a league game.When the final bell tolls for the season,a coaching group can still boast the same amount of players, they have delivered in spades for them.Thats the sort of impression a coach will leave on a child. After that, their development will take care of itself and a greater sense of self-esteem will see them blossom away from the pitch.What does  hold for the teams in your club  googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Its time to get balls whizzing around coaching sessions, in house games on tap and a multitude of fixtures.Supporters will be absent. As will the use of dressing rooms. But thats okay. In time thatll . For now players need action. Thats the priority, though it would be a nice touchsome of the older fans, who have already been vaccinated, could get out to see a game.This column has also been pushing for the importance of young people getting out and active. The buzz from the endorphins flying around the body is one aspect, but the social interaction they have missed has been colossal.Underage coaches dont realise how much of an influence they have on the players under their watch. From interviewing players from ious teams for nostalgic features, they will often recall their early days playing sport.Just last week, former Ballinderry player Martina Devlin described Rita Moran, a coach at St Marys Magherafelt, as a fantastic person and mentor, a role model and the most influential person on her camogie career. It was more than just sport.As teams go back to training, it makes me think how clubs have a second chance to make a first impression on our youth. Just as a teacher can shape the career path of a student, a coach and sporting memories will determine how far a player will develop. You cant make a horse drink, but it still has to be brought to the water first.Seamus Downey still talks about Laveys one ball each philosophy at underage that helped hone a group of youngsters at a club languishing in the realms of B football into one of the top sides in Ulster. Their indoor facility was a help, but working on the basic skills all year round has worked wonders.The same can be said for Glen, who got their house in order before totally dominating underage football with a group that has their seniors jostling for a place at the top table. People will point to the size of their catchment area, but it wasnt until they organised themselves properly that things started to change.Underage coaching in clubs should be about bringing everyone up a level.Not only will it give everyone an enjoyable experience, which is the number one priority, But, in the long term, it will be a much healthier club.I always remember chatting to Crossmaglen player Cathal Short and looking on with envy at their success. What made them stand out  Yes, they had county players like himself, Oisin McConville, the McEntees and Francie Bellew. But, in club football, , on a given day, the county players from each team were to cancel each other out, Cross other players were of a higher standard. This made the dference.His uncle Aidan, a coach at the club and former teacher in St Patricks Maghera, spoke at an underage coaching camp I attended one weekend in St Marys Magherafelt. He revealed something that has always stuck out.Other clubs in Armagh judged themselves on being able to beat Crossmaglen at underage level. A victory over the Rangers constituted a successful year.In Cross, their benchmark was for the minor team to produce at least four players, every year, to push into the senior  the following season.They didnt concentrate on just the elite. Some years they would churn out more, but four was always the target. Underage medals were a welcome addition and driving the standards of coaching would iniably have them at the cutting edge of competitions.Their underage teams seeing All-Ireland titles being paraded into the hall helped with the motivation, but it still doesnt kick the ball over the bar for you.The biggest challenge in the GAA is giving everyone a chance to play on a regular basis. The Go Games format at the younger ages has been brilliant in terms of smaller sided games. Not only does it give more touches, but a  of  can be split into three teams of seven. There will be no subs and everyone has the chance to test their coaching in a game.The problem started at U level, with full dug-outs. A bigger club, of which there are a few, can add in a few extra Us to take the total to  and enter two U teams. Its not ideal,there is a case of playing across two codes – football and hurling or camogie.The case mentioned above is common, with three teams of seven becoming a team of , with  subs. This is where underage coaches need to ask themselves questions How can I finish the season with  players still coming to coaching sessions  We have all heard stories of the top three or four players not going as far as senior level. Emigration, injury, a loss of interest or their sheer size at underage no longer allowing them to dominate a game at minor level and above.In the long term, its bringing everyone up the ranks so that come senior level, there are enough numbers to field senior and reserve teams with regularity. Thats a healthy club.Bringing more players up through the underage grades is more important than success. Winning the odd trophy is great andyou are able to win U, U, U and minor titles while bringing everyone along, then thats the ultimate.Underage players will stick with youthey are getting games. In a squad of , like above, starting the same team every week is criminal. Ten minutes at the end of a game every week isnt development. It is tokenism.The greatest prize you can give anyoneis a starting jersey. Based on attendance at training, everyone should be given a chance to play a full game as often as possible. If someone is seen as a key player, use games to rotate them into dferent positions. Challenge them to use their weaker side, to develop a dummy. Give them the best possible chance to better themselves. By senior level, they will thank you for it.If you have big numbers at training, ide them up and play seven a side games. Two teams on, the other working on skills with another coach before swapping places. Introduce a competition every so often. Count the blocks, count the assists, count the dummies. Stick a photo of the winning player up on the club social media. Anything to keep things fresh.It is up to coaches at nursery level to give players the skill base. By U, they should be playing as many games as possible. And the more they get at training, the better placed they are to shine in a league game.When the final bell tolls for the season,a coaching group can still boast the same amount of players, they have delivered in spades for them.Thats the sort of impression a coach will leave on a child. After that, their development will take care of itself and a greater sense of self-esteem will see them blossom away from the pitch.What does  hold for the teams in your club  googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The guidelines, spread over two documents, offer bespoke advice depending on the category of care setting involved. “I fully recognise the importance of visiting for those who are receiving care. I hope this guidance will be widely welcomed, said Mr Swann. “It is also important to remember that the threat from COVID- remains very real. Everyone has a vital role to play when it comes to safe visiting. That includes social distancing, hand hygiene and not visitingyou are feeling unwell yourself.      Visiting was only ever restricted because it was absolutely necessary to do so to protect patients and residents from the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV- virus and subsequent development of COVID- infection. Given the progress that has been made against the virus, the time is now right to take steps to carefully re-introduce visiting. I welcome the work completed to draw up these updated guidance documents and hope that by implementing them we will take another step along the road to recovery.”   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This marks the latest stage of the easing of the coronavirus restrictions. Hospitality businesses can also reopen but must only operate outdoors, with table service and limited numbers per table. Gyms and swimming pools, including those based in leisure centres, can only open for inidual training or for one-to-one coaching with a personal trainer. Restrictions on meeting up outside have also been slightly further eased, with  people from three households allowed to meet in a private garden. Earlier closing times for takeaway businesses and off-licences have also been removed. googletag.cmd.push Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Cllr BrianTierney, has asked the public to support local businesses as more prepare to reopen today. He said that it has been an incredibly challenging year for so many businesses within the district, and he asked that the public do what they can to support them while also adhering to health guidelines. I know there will be many businesses across our city and district really excited to open their doors today after a turbulent and dficult past year. I hope that everyone will support those businesses in the weeks and months ahead as they try toto normality, said MayorTierney. googletag.cmd.push In doing so, I would ask everyone to please make sure theyre following the health guidelines in place including wearing a face mask where required and always maintaining social distancing. It really is brilliant to see businesses reopen, but we also have to be mindful that the COVID- virus is still in our community so the best way that we can help our local businesses is by following the guidelines while in stores and out and about.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Thats always been Cormac ODoherty. From the U playing in goals for Slaughtneils Feacuteile team, with a stick almost as big as him, to playing in the field at home with his older brothers and sisters, he has always had to learn fast. He sits relaxed in Owenbegs canteen. Wearing a customary red baseball hat and the same ice cool look as standing over frees on pitches across Ulster and beyond. Now , he has eight seasons of senior championship hurling under his belt with Slaughtneil and going into a fth at county level, having been called up by Collie McGurk in Derrys Nicky Rackard winning season. A veteran now. googletag.cmd.push “Maybe,” comes the reply, with a smirk and the same affable nature in which it was offered. “Its starting to feel that way, there are a lot of young boys involved so I am getting to the older half of the group now.” Last season, Slaughtneil hurling boss Michael McShane handed him the captains role and last Tuesday night he was appointed as Derry captain. “This is another big step, it is a challenge and something to look forward to...something that hopefully will be a successful one,” he points out. The new role doesnt bring pressure. The new skipper points to the leaders in the squad that still includes Sean Cassidy, captain under John McEvoy. googletag.cmd.push “We have a lot of players who have played big games, a lot of leaders and it is up to everyone to step up to the mark,” he adds. Personally, its about performing as well as he can. And hopefully the results will fall into place. Looking ahead, Sundays Mayo game is as far as he ventures. And looking back, the two promotion finals stick in the throat, but they are yesterdays news. “Thats done and dusted now, its a dferent year, its a dferent management, a few dferent players and a few dferent teams, so it is a new challenge,” he said.     In the last two seasons, Derrys scoring average was - versus - against. The margins are small. Goalkeeper Sean Kelly saved their bacon on many occasions, but at the other end they didnt lt the green flag often enough to trouble teams, when it matters. ODoherty is often the man picking open defences for club and county. He feels they need to be more clinical in the final third. “Its in the tight games, with a point or two each way. Its maybe that we can create them , but we didnt take them. It is costly in tight games.” It will be the third county management he has played under and he is enthused about having Cormac Hippy Donnelly in the frame, who coached Slaughtneil to two Ulster senior titles. “It is hard to put your finger on it,” said ODoherty of the input of Donnelly, who was a popular addition with the Derry players. “Mickeyhad been there and he came in with new ideas to the group and a fresh voice that gave us a bit of renewed energy. A new coach always brings new ideas. “Then you have Woodyssuccess with thecamogs, thats two experienced men. “They were good players and Cormac is new into management, we saw in Slaughtneil what he brings to the setup. “Then you back that up with Conorand Kevin , two players who gave a lot to Derry hurling and have that Derry experience, so hopefully that will stand to them.” Murray won back to back Ulster medals with Derry in and . “It is somethingthat we dont have the opportunity to do any more,” ODoherty adds. “He is somebody who had success with Derry senior hurlers and won major honours, it is great to see that and he brings something dferent to the party as well.” Of the  new players in this years , his brother Oisin makes a , with Gerald Bradley, Conor McAllister, Niall Ferris and Brian Cassidy. “It is a strong  of players,” Cormac states. “Ferryhas committed and it is something we have worked on over the past number of years, getting the best players out. We have managed that and it is a good opportunity to take advantage of it.” It has been something that has been a theme since Collie McGurk took over in , of getting the best players hurling for the county. “Collie was a big believer in getting the best players on the pitch and well see what happens after that. “Dominic and Cormac have put a very strong  together, it is up to the players to make use of it.” Getting off to a winning start in Mayo on Sunday is crucial. Despite the Kildare game poised in the distance as a potential top of the table clash in the group, ODoherty is keeping his thoughts in the short term. Any mention of the Christy Ring Cup is casually brushed off. If you start looking too far down the line youll get caught,” he said. “Our focus is on the Mayo game,you lose that then you are chasing for the rest of the league, so it is important to get a good start.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Thats always been Cormac ODoherty. From the U playing in goals for Slaughtneils Feacuteile team, with a stick almost as big as him, to playing in the field at home with his older brothers and sisters, he has always had to learn fast. He sits relaxed in Owenbegs canteen. Wearing a customary red baseball hat and the same ice cool look as standing over frees on pitches across Ulster and beyond. Now , he has eight seasons of senior championship hurling under his belt with Slaughtneil and going into a fth at county level, having been called up by Collie McGurk in Derrys Nicky Rackard winning season. A veteran now. googletag.cmd.push “Maybe,” comes the reply, with a smirk and the same affable nature in which it was offered. “Its starting to feel that way, there are a lot of young boys involved so I am getting to the older half of the group now.” Last season, Slaughtneil hurling boss Michael McShane handed him the captains role and last Tuesday night he was appointed as Derry captain. “This is another big step, it is a challenge and something to look forward to...something that hopefully will be a successful one,” he points out. The new role doesnt bring pressure. The new skipper points to the leaders in the squad that still includes Sean Cassidy, captain under John McEvoy. googletag.cmd.push “We have a lot of players who have played big games, a lot of leaders and it is up to everyone to step up to the mark,” he adds. Personally, its about performing as well as he can. And hopefully the results will fall into place. Looking ahead, Sundays Mayo game is as far as he ventures. And looking back, the two promotion finals stick in the throat, but they are yesterdays news. “Thats done and dusted now, its a dferent year, its a dferent management, a few dferent players and a few dferent teams, so it is a new challenge,” he said.     In the last two seasons, Derrys scoring average was - versus - against. The margins are small. Goalkeeper Sean Kelly saved their bacon on many occasions, but at the other end they didnt lt the green flag often enough to trouble teams, when it matters. ODoherty is often the man picking open defences for club and county. He feels they need to be more clinical in the final third. “Its in the tight games, with a point or two each way. Its maybe that we can create them , but we didnt take them. It is costly in tight games.” It will be the third county management he has played under and he is enthused about having Cormac Hippy Donnelly in the frame, who coached Slaughtneil to two Ulster senior titles. “It is hard to put your finger on it,” said ODoherty of the input of Donnelly, who was a popular addition with the Derry players. “Mickeyhad been there and he came in with new ideas to the group and a fresh voice that gave us a bit of renewed energy. A new coach always brings new ideas. “Then you have Woodyssuccess with thecamogs, thats two experienced men. “They were good players and Cormac is new into management, we saw in Slaughtneil what he brings to the setup. “Then you back that up with Conorand Kevin , two players who gave a lot to Derry hurling and have that Derry experience, so hopefully that will stand to them.” Murray won back to back Ulster medals with Derry in and . “It is somethingthat we dont have the opportunity to do any more,” ODoherty adds. “He is somebody who had success with Derry senior hurlers and won major honours, it is great to see that and he brings something dferent to the party as well.” Of the  new players in this years , his brother Oisin makes a , with Gerald Bradley, Conor McAllister, Niall Ferris and Brian Cassidy. “It is a strong  of players,” Cormac states. “Ferryhas committed and it is something we have worked on over the past number of years, getting the best players out. We have managed that and it is a good opportunity to take advantage of it.” It has been something that has been a theme since Collie McGurk took over in , of getting the best players hurling for the county. “Collie was a big believer in getting the best players on the pitch and well see what happens after that. “Dominic and Cormac have put a very strong  together, it is up to the players to make use of it.” Getting off to a winning start in Mayo on Sunday is crucial. Despite the Kildare game poised in the distance as a potential top of the table clash in the group, ODoherty is keeping his thoughts in the short term. Any mention of the Christy Ring Cup is casually brushed off. If you start looking too far down the line youll get caught,” he said. “Our focus is on the Mayo game,you lose that then you are chasing for the rest of the league, so it is important to get a good start.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Collie McGurk took them from the Nicky Rackard Cup to the cusp of a Christy Ring Cup Final. An inspired goalkeeping performance from Kildare goalkeeper Paddy McKenna thwarted theirto Croke Park. Two years ago, John McEvoy came in as boss and an impressive season took them back to the league decider, where Derry lost to Wicklow in a low scoring afternoon at a blustery Inniskeen. A day when Brian Oacuteg McGilligan hobbled off after  minutes and the appearance of Brendan Rogers wasnt able to spark the goal they needed to take them over the line. googletag.cmd.push Last year, after ticking along nicely, Covid kicked in and when the league final was played, Derry werent at the races. It wasnt even a contest. Dominic Woody McKinley came in as joint manager this season, alongside Cormac Donnelly. McKinley, who managed both Derry senior hurlers and camogs in the past, knows what he wants from this season. “My personal opinion is that the National League is more important than the championship to us,” McKinley outlined. He has been around the block. An All-Ireland winner with Loughgiel in , an All-Ireland Final appearance with Antrim in , he coached Antrim at all levels and was a major cog in Slaughtneils rise to the pinnacle of camogie. googletag.cmd.push Sitting at Derry hurlers press evening last week, there is enthusiasm as he talks hurling. The words flow with a passion. The facial expressions dont tell any lies. Its about getting Derry up a level. There is a hurt that hurlers below the elite, top level counties dont get the recognition. Counties like Derry. Seven or eight of their squad are capable of playing at any level. When the Champion  - the All-Star team from the Christy Ring, Nicky Rackard and Lory Meagher Cups – was announced, Derry werent represented. “I suppose you have to earn that,” Woody admits. “The only way is to keep your head down, work hard and then people will recognise you as a group.     “I want Derry to get up a league, you get more of a profile for the players and get to play against better teams. “If you are playing at a higher standard, it is more attractive for the media and hurling people. If I had a choice, Id love to get moved up a league.” As our conversation continues, Liaison Officer Terry Gray issues a list of the Derry squad. Of the  names, Alan Grant is in rehab from a knee injury last year. The  is open, but McKinley is happy with the squad. Brian Cassidy, Niall Ferris and Gerald Bradley are back on board to give them extra attacking options. There is afor Slaughtneil goalkeeper Oisin ODoherty, who last donned the Derry goalkeeper jersey in  having played outfield the previous year. “That was the first thing we looked at before we got the job, could me and Cormac draw all these players all back in again,” he points out. Dual players arent on the table. Chrissy McKaigue and Brendan Rogers have played under the last two management teams. But it was a balancing act. The fixture calendar doesnt permit it. Mark Craig is managing his long-term back injury. Brian Cassidy and Conor McAllister are doubts for the Mayo game, but everyone should be available for selection. Challenge games arent on the menu. It frustrates McKinley, so an in-house game last weekend will have to do as they sharpen the focus for the season ahead. “A lot of wee niggly injuries are there now that club training has started as well,” adds McKinley, as frustration creeps into his voice, from the increased workload on the players. “We want to manage it so they are there for the full season for club and county.” There is a plea to clubs, who wont have their serious business until the heel of the year. “These matches are very important for Derry hurling as well,” he adds, while hailing the support of Chairman Stephen Barker. “He is very fair,” Woody states. “He is wanting progress. It is a serious business and we need to be serious about getting themup a level and thats what the players want.” The closest Derry came to promotion was their  decider, a day when Wicklows goal was the dference. Its Derrys failure to find the net that has left them on the wrong side of tight games. During the off-season, selector Conor Murray has been looking into the scoring statistics and Derrys know where the gains are to be made. “He came back to us and it is interesting reading,” McKinley said. “If you were looking at it from another teams point of view, you could think theyll capitalise on our team by blocking a couple of players off in our forward line and wed be in serious bother. “So we are looking for a greater spread of scores,you look at the players we have, there is no doubt we can.” McKinley questions Derrys team play, shot selection...all the pieces of the puzzle of their scoring conundrum. “Thats what weve been going over this last few weeks and hopefully we can get more out of it,” he continues. “We are even recording what we are scoring in our training games, what we do in each sector, to seeour scoring averages are up.” Now the challenge is taking it to Castlebar on Sunday.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Collie McGurk took them from the Nicky Rackard Cup to the cusp of a Christy Ring Cup Final. An inspired goalkeeping performance from Kildare goalkeeper Paddy McKenna thwarted theirto Croke Park. Two years ago, John McEvoy came in as boss and an impressive season took them back to the league decider, where Derry lost to Wicklow in a low scoring afternoon at a blustery Inniskeen. A day when Brian Oacuteg McGilligan hobbled off after  minutes and the appearance of Brendan Rogers wasnt able to spark the goal they needed to take them over the line. googletag.cmd.push Last year, after ticking along nicely, Covid kicked in and when the league final was played, Derry werent at the races. It wasnt even a contest. Dominic Woody McKinley came in as joint manager this season, alongside Cormac Donnelly. McKinley, who managed both Derry senior hurlers and camogs in the past, knows what he wants from this season. “My personal opinion is that the National League is more important than the championship to us,” McKinley outlined. He has been around the block. An All-Ireland winner with Loughgiel in , an All-Ireland Final appearance with Antrim in , he coached Antrim at all levels and was a major cog in Slaughtneils rise to the pinnacle of camogie. googletag.cmd.push Sitting at Derry hurlers press evening last week, there is enthusiasm as he talks hurling. The words flow with a passion. The facial expressions dont tell any lies. Its about getting Derry up a level. There is a hurt that hurlers below the elite, top level counties dont get the recognition. Counties like Derry. Seven or eight of their squad are capable of playing at any level. When the Champion  - the All-Star team from the Christy Ring, Nicky Rackard and Lory Meagher Cups – was announced, Derry werent represented. “I suppose you have to earn that,” Woody admits. “The only way is to keep your head down, work hard and then people will recognise you as a group.     “I want Derry to get up a league, you get more of a profile for the players and get to play against better teams. “If you are playing at a higher standard, it is more attractive for the media and hurling people. If I had a choice, Id love to get moved up a league.” As our conversation continues, Liaison Officer Terry Gray issues a list of the Derry squad. Of the  names, Alan Grant is in rehab from a knee injury last year. The  is open, but McKinley is happy with the squad. Brian Cassidy, Niall Ferris and Gerald Bradley are back on board to give them extra attacking options. There is afor Slaughtneil goalkeeper Oisin ODoherty, who last donned the Derry goalkeeper jersey in  having played outfield the previous year. “That was the first thing we looked at before we got the job, could me and Cormac draw all these players all back in again,” he points out. Dual players arent on the table. Chrissy McKaigue and Brendan Rogers have played under the last two management teams. But it was a balancing act. The fixture calendar doesnt permit it. Mark Craig is managing his long-term back injury. Brian Cassidy and Conor McAllister are doubts for the Mayo game, but everyone should be available for selection. Challenge games arent on the menu. It frustrates McKinley, so an in-house game last weekend will have to do as they sharpen the focus for the season ahead. “A lot of wee niggly injuries are there now that club training has started as well,” adds McKinley, as frustration creeps into his voice, from the increased workload on the players. “We want to manage it so they are there for the full season for club and county.” There is a plea to clubs, who wont have their serious business until the heel of the year. “These matches are very important for Derry hurling as well,” he adds, while hailing the support of Chairman Stephen Barker. “He is very fair,” Woody states. “He is wanting progress. It is a serious business and we need to be serious about getting themup a level and thats what the players want.” The closest Derry came to promotion was their  decider, a day when Wicklows goal was the dference. Its Derrys failure to find the net that has left them on the wrong side of tight games. During the off-season, selector Conor Murray has been looking into the scoring statistics and Derrys know where the gains are to be made. “He came back to us and it is interesting reading,” McKinley said. “If you were looking at it from another teams point of view, you could think theyll capitalise on our team by blocking a couple of players off in our forward line and wed be in serious bother. “So we are looking for a greater spread of scores,you look at the players we have, there is no doubt we can.” McKinley questions Derrys team play, shot selection...all the pieces of the puzzle of their scoring conundrum. “Thats what weve been going over this last few weeks and hopefully we can get more out of it,” he continues. “We are even recording what we are scoring in our training games, what we do in each sector, to seeour scoring averages are up.” Now the challenge is taking it to Castlebar on Sunday.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In March , Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning committee refusedClanmil Housing Association permission to build a four-storey complex comprised of  apartments at Victoria Road. However, Clanmil appealed the decision and it has now been overturned. Local planning officers had described the location as ‘possibly the most dficult regeneration site’ in the city. However, the officers had recommended that councillors approve the application for the Victoria Road apartments as the application was ‘entirely compliant’. In their report, planning officers stated that they believed it would reinvigorate the riverfront land and put an end to anti-social behaviour at the site. googletag.cmd.push  Among the objections raised by councillors had been that there was no parking provided within the plans for the Victoria Road apartments. At the meeting in March , local councillors said they believed a parking ban ‘discriminated’ against people with disabilities. At last year’s meeting, Hugh Hegarty from the Victoria Park Residents Group said the apartment complex design looked like a ‘horric brutalist East German style eyesore’. Mr Hegarty said pollution and parking problems would be exacerbatedresidents were to park on Spencer Road and Duke Street. A lack of space in the area has already resulted in ‘hazardous parking’ on Victoria Road and he envisaged problems at the site with numerous couriers and taxis arriving. googletag.cmd.push In response, a representative for Clanmil said it is a ‘highly accessible’ location with bus stops and train travel nearby. The housing association claimed that the design respects the history of the site, the city’s shirt factory heritage and complements existing buildings. A report by the Planning Appeals Commission into the matter has now found that the objections were not sustained and overturned the decision to refuse planning permission. The decision to overturn the councils refusal decision has been criticised by local rail campaigners, Into the West. The land at Victoria Road was previously part of the Derry to Strabane railway line which closed in .     Into the West has been campaigning for the line to be reopened and they have described the decision to allow the apartment complex to be built on the site as a disaster. A building there will make it impossible to restore a railway line along that route in future – making it extremely unlikely we will ever see rail from Derry to Strabane or Letterkenny again, said Steve Bradley, chair of Into the West. Without a route to Strabane, there can be no direct rail services form Derry or Donegal to Dublin. And as Derry has a bigger population than every other town on the former Derry-Portadown rail route,our city can no longer be included in that proposed reopening then the viability of restoring rail to places like Omagh, Strabane, Enniskillen, Dungannon and Letterkenny also collapses. In short – building  apartments in that location will destroy any future for rail across the west of Ulster and prevent it being ed to Tyrone, Donegal and Fermanagh.

Dr Glynn said he is hopeful that additional measures will not be required for the county in the coming weeks and he is confident that the situation in Donegal will improve quickly. He was speaking at a press briefing for the media in Donegal on Wednesday following the fallout from comments made by chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan last Friday about the high incidence of Covid- in the county. googletag.cmd.push There has been a backlash in Donegal to the tone of the comments Dr Holohan made when he said there were concerns about things happening in the county that “even the dogs on the street” know shouldn’t be happening. Figures released at the press briefing put the national incidence rate in the county at  cases per , people compared to a national rate of . The highest rates are in the Milford local electoral area at . and the Letterkenny area where the rate is .. The lowest rate in the county is in the Donegal LEA at .. The briefing was told there were  GP referrals for testing in the county on Tuesday, an increase of % on the same day last week. googletag.cmd.push Dr Glynn said the concerns were raised last week so that people can take protective measures and ensure the situation does not get worse. He said there is a bigger number of smaller clusters in Donegal than in other parts of the country. “It was not meant as blame. It certainly was not made as a threat,” he said. “It would be very strange for us to preside over a situation where incidence is very high and increasing in a county and not draw attention to that.” At the briefing, director of public health for the HSE in the north-west, Dr Anthony Breslin, highlighted a number of clusters that have occurred due to events in the county in recent weeks, including awake, a family gathering and an th birthday party.     The events resulted in dozens of cases and infections in workplaces, in families and at a school. One social gathering has been linked to  cases of Covid-, he said. Dr Glynn said that there are concerns about the situation in the county and that some people in Donegal have “pushed the boundaries”. “We are concerned about the current incidence. That is not to say that Donegal has not come a very long way over the past number of months, just as the rest of the country has, and that can only have happened because the majority of people are trying to do the right thing,” he said. “This is not in any way a reflection on the majority but clearly there are a number of incidents where people have pushed the boundaries. “We have seen that in other counties, it is not just in Donegal. But I suppose the dference at the moment versus some other places where we have particularly high incidences, is that there are large clusters driving incidences. “In Donegal, it seems to be a little bit more widespread with a bigger number of smaller clusters which makes it that little bit harder to control. Sowe can continue to emphasise, andwe can get people who have been pushing the boundaries a little bit just to comply that bit more over the coming weeks, we should see incidence drop quickly in Donegal.” He said we can not get away from the fact that the high incidence rates in parts of the county are due to the fact the disease is being transmitted from person to person. “It gets transmitted from person to person when people come into contact with one another and when for whatever reason masks are not worn, distance is not kept, people who are symptomatic don’t self-isolate. “Right now we are seeing a higher incidence in Donegal than we have in other parts of the country and in that regard, it is incumbent on us as doctors to point out our concerns so that people can take proactive actions because there are many people who remain very vulnerable to this disease over the coming weeks,” he said. “All we are asking people in Donegal to do is to protect themselves and their families. We are not proposing any dferent measures for any one part of Donegal as things currently stand, and I would be hopeful and optimistic given the level of engagement over the past number of days that we wont be looking at some sort of additional measures for the county or any part of the county over the coming weeks.” He said the priority for people over the coming weeks is to meet people outside. “As far as is possible at all, do not meet up with friends or extended families or do not have parties inside. Inside gives this virus such an advantage in terms of transmission,” he said. “Last January Donegal had an incidence of , per ,. It is now  per ,. It is the highest in the country but it’s an order of magnitude lower than where it was and that’s down to the work of the majority doing most of the right things most of the time.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Grade A listed building also known as ‘The People’s Hall,’ was the venue of choice for some of the world’s most iconic performers and notaries after it was built in . But how many people nowadays know that its remarkable guests included both Emmeline Pankhurst and Eleanor Marx   Emmeline Pankhurstwas the leader of the radical suffragette movement that played a key role in helping to win British women the right to vote. googletag.cmd.push She was founder of the Women’s Social and Political Union and gave a rousing speech in St Columb’s Hall on th October . Eleanor Marx, the daughter of German socialist revolutionary Karl Marx, organised a trade union recruitment drive for Derry’s mainly female factory workers in St Columb’s Hall on th November , just five years after the distinctive venue was built at Orchard Street within the Walled City. Friends of the Factories  “in solidarity with” Derry Trades Union Council, organised the placement of two plaques side by side to coincide with events to mark May Day weekend, the annual celebration of workers and union rights across the world. googletag.cmd.push The plaque erected in memory of Emmeline Pankhurst was a tribute shared with Margaret Cousins, the Irish and Indian suffragettewho attended Victoria High School in Derry. Co-founder of the Irish Women’s Franchise League, Dublin in , she was credited with organising and inviting Pankhurst to speak at St Columb’s Hall in . The plaque dedicated to Eleanor Marx who visited the Hall almost  years before Pankhurst, reads: “Eleanor Marx, Fighter for socialism and women’s rights . In this hall, th November , Eleanor launched a recruitment drive for women and general workers previously excluded from most union activity.     The organisation of Derry shirt factory workers was a key moment in the development of trades unionism in Britain and Ireland.” Yvonne Norris, local campaigner with Friends of the Factories , said: “Friends of the Factories came together at the most dficult of times, united in doing something positive by contributing to the legacy of the factory workers and their contribution to the City. I have been honoured to be part of an initiative made up of so many formidable women, driven by women and achieved by women. We thank the Derry Trades Union Council for their unwavering support of our project, it has got us to the point we have reached today. As well as the ceremony in honour of the two female revolutionary thinkers who addressed rallies in St Columb’s Hall, plaques to honour the legacy of the workers were also unveiled at a number of former shirt factory sites including Welch Margeston, Sinclair, Ebrington, Rosemount, Hogg  Mitchell and the City Factory. Anne-Marie Gallagher, Project Director of St Columb’s Hall, said she was delighted that the roles of three illustrious women historically associated with the venue, had finally been etched into the fabric of the building more than a century later. She said: “These beautul plaques are very much in keeping with the character of the Hall and add to the already vibrant story of Derry’s built heritage and history. The fact that these remarkable women left such a lasting legacy is very poignant, especially to think that they were standing in here over  years ago. “We are thankful to Friends of the Factories and Derry Trades Union Council for their foresight and determination in shining the spotlight on the somewhat lesser-known connections with this building’s rich history to the wider world.” St Columb’s Hall is located on the East Wall of the city’s historic Walls and was originally built in  by the St Columb’s Hall Total Abstinence Society as part of the Temperance movement. Now used as a noted conference and events venue, the building is currently in the midst of a major regeneration project.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Alongside the signicant investment in  new social homes in an area of acute housing need, this project will support both Sean Dolan’s ambition to develop as a club and also the wider strategic plans of the GAA in growing the prominence of Gaelic games across the city. A range of other opportunities, activities and events, which will have a positive impact on the wider Creggan community, will also be facilitated as a result of the project. googletag.cmd.push Radius Housing is a leading housing developer, constructing more than  new social and affordable homes each year. Radius also manages more than , social homes, and provides care and support for many more across Northern Ireland. This project is the latest Radius development in Derry, with construction currently underway on the former site of Ebrington Primary School in the Waterside. Anita Conway, Director of Development at Radius Housing, said: “We are delighted that the construction of this major project is beginning, and we are excited by the ambition and benefits this will bring to the whole community. “We have been working with Sean Dolan’s GAC and the other partner organisations for over three years, and we see this as an innovative way to deliver high quality homes, in an area where social homes are needed, and support essential community development.     “As a developer we know the dficulties faced in acquiring suitable development land, and working with Sean Dolan’s we have both been able to develop an innovative partnership approach which addresses a wide range of needs in the local area. “Working with community based clubs like Sean Dolan’s allows Radius to help them realise their untapped potential, and bring much needed homes to the local area and maximise all available amenities within these areas for the benefit of the local communities. “This is so much more than a housing project and a sports hub. This will be a vital economic and social driver for the Creggan area and City wide.” Stephen McGeehan, Head of Operations for Ulster GAA, said: “Every GAA club is keen to develop the best facilities for their members, which allow their teams across all ages to develop their skills and increase fitness and wellbeing. “But there are always limitations on how this can be done, and we are delighted that Sean Dolan’s have been able to partner with Radius Housing on this amazing and far reaching project. “This will bring an incredible level of community benefit, not just to the club, but to the wider city area, and we hope it is a new partnership model which can be replicated in other GAA and sports clubs.” Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey has welcomed commencement ofthework on the new much needed social homes in the city. “I’m delighted to see this work started. My priority is to deliver housing in areas where it is needed,and Derry City needs more housing. “This pound million investment is part of my new build programme, a programme I was able to secure poundmillion to be invested this year. “I commendthe work of Radius Housing and Sean Dolan’s GAC for working together on this ground breaking scheme. “This is co-operative working at its very best and I look forward to seeing the finished scheme in due course. “I look forward to seeing other developments in the near future as we continue to deliver the biggest shake up of our housing system in over  years. “Housing, and having a place to call home, is a fundamental right. I am committed to delivering a housing system that delivers rights to everyone across society.”   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Grief is a signicant undertaking and will be funded entirely by Black North. Although the pandemic has prevented many of their plans from proceeding, the film company are also putting the final touches to Stealth, a feature film that is set in both  and . The film will premiere online next week.

While a student in St Patricks Maghera, she played on the schools first Ladies Gaelic Football team. She is a walking advocate for ladies sport, getting involved and trying to promote it.There is no hiding her enthusiasm. A break from her studies to talk all things football lts the lid on her sporting knowledge and an obvious passion for the exciting developments at Draperstown Celtic.“Sport is great, not just for the physical aspect, but there are the mental health benefits too,” explains Niamh.Student le in Belfast gave her an opportunity to try her hand at soccer with Queens, something she had longed to do. A grand-daughter of former Draperstown Celtic player Malachy McGuigan, Niamh qualied as a Level  coach in the autumn and is now coaching the underage players in the clubs Diamonds Ladies team and is part of the recently formed senior team. googletag.cmd.push Niamh, back row second from right, pictured before a QUB game. Her placement has already been secured in the Dublin branch of international pharmaceutical giants Alexion secured for next year. Sunday mornings are the perfect getaway from the stresses of revision.“I even had an exam on a Monday and I went to DC on Sunday, the buzz you get ,lts your mood so much...that escape from everything ,” Niamh points out.Her camogie career took her up the underage ranks to senior level. An injury forced her out of action and with her A-Levels on the horizon, study took preference.With no soccer clubs on her doorstep, travelling to Cookstown-based Mid Ulster Ladies wasnt feasible.“It was a great team and they were lovely there, but I just couldnt balance it,” Niamh adds. “Now I have got involved with DC, it is only down the road and my Granny and Granda live in Draperstown.”It wasnt until the age of  that she began her soccer career with Queens.“I just thought I have the opportunity now to start something I wanted, I joined their team in  and I havent looked back since,” Niamh points out.“Every evening, you were looking forward to training. You make friends for le and it is such a great sport.”When Chairman Paul McCallion floated the idea of a ladies team in Draperstown, she jumped at the chance. There was no second thought required.“I want to give the younger ones the opportunity from that age to be able to play football instead of waiting until they are . The atmosphere around DC, you couldnt get nicer people,” Niamh enthused. googletag.cmd.push COACHING Despite having her coaching qualication tucked away, the sporting lockdown kept her itching to get started. Enthusiasm morphed into frustration.“I was raging because there was no sport and I wanted to get straight out into it,” Niamh adds.“For me, coaching is so rewarding. Even when you are taking the session, at the start the players are a bit timid, but by the end of the session, especially the young ones, you can see how much they have progressed. For me, that gives me a real buzz.”“They are playing with their own age group,with girls. Through the years, theyll build a team with each other. “I have learned so much from the last two years, so imagine young girls learning the game from a young age. The love of the game and even building a team with each other.”In her younger days, she remembers her Granda Malachy taking her to the St Colms Draperstown school and Ballinascreen camogie teams he was involved in. There is a photo doing the rounds of a young Niamh, as a mascot, perched at the front of a team photo.Niamhs love for soccer came from watching the US womens national team and their promotion of the game. The Los Angeles based Angel City team, starting up in , will be the th team in the National Womens Soccer League.     Tobin Heath inspired Niamhs interest in football.  “When you look at the US team, they are a successful team with big players like Tobin Heath. She is such somebody I would look towards,” Niamh adds.Her engineering background comes to the fore as she number crunches the rise of the game. The most watched game, the USAs - win over Holland in the  World Cup Final had an increase of  percent in just four years.Add in the Northern Ireland ladies qualication for a first ever European Womens Championships. Local heroes. Niamh was starstruck when Northern Ireland ladies captain Marissa Callaghan came to DC Diamonds first senior session recently.“Those are the types of people, idols youd want to be, those you see on the TV,” Niamh said, while remembering some of the advice.“Marissa told us to aim to play on the Northern Ireland team. It is about having expectations and always wanting to better yourself....dont doubt yourself.”The first session brought excitement. Others have declared an interest in joining the senior squad, coached by Chloe McPeake and Alice Bradley. Niamh will also weigh in with a helping hand.“It was such a great session, they had it down to a tee,” Niamh stated. “It was a fun session, we played a fun and competitive game. There is a balance, it is recreational and there is a chance to play more seriously.”Niamh urges others to come along. The door is open to everyone.“I have made friends for le, people from America and England and just down the road,” she concludes of her soccer involvement so far.“Even the confidence you get from being on a team, you build so much as a person and you are out there getting fit. It is a great release.“It is a bit of fun and it can be competitiveyou want. It is about getting out there, enjoying the game, the great game that it is.” The Draperstown Celtic Senior Diamonds train every Sunday morning at .am at the Back Row G pitch in Draperstown.

Thatrsquos not the same as having a formal British Irish Intergovernmental Conference with officials and an agenda, he said.ldquoI have no objectionthey want to talk every day. Thatrsquos a good idea, but I think the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement should be followed and that means there should be a BIIC on a regular and frequent basis. That is what was signed.Speaking weeks after street violence by loyalist protesters erupted in Belfast over issues related to Brexit and the NI Protocol, Mr Ahern said BIIC meetings were very important.ldquoIt does concern me that we havenrsquot had a British Irish Intergovernmental Conference for a long, long time, maybe a few years.Mr Ahern was interviewed by former BBC political correspondent Martina Purdy and former barrister Elaine Kelly, who spoke to the former Taoiseach about peace-building, faith and St Patrick.ldquoThe two governments, the British and Irish governments are the custodians of the Agreement. They are not meeting to discuss these issues. That clearly is not in line with the agreement.ldquoI am not using any other words than what the Agreement usedhellip The agreement says that there must be frequent meetings and you know that should be happening.ldquoThey donrsquot have to be for long. They can be on zoom, Microsoft teams anything you like. They should be having these meetings and where there are dficulties they should be dealing with at those meetings.ldquoIn the absence of those meetings, things can drt. Quite frankly I donrsquot understand why those meetings canrsquot take place.ldquoI donrsquot expect the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach to have a meeting all day ndash they donrsquot have to do that. They could have a meeting for an hour and half. Thatrsquos not going to kill anybody.He said other officials or ministers or institutions within departmental structures could then follow through with the issues.Mr Ahern also spoke about the future of the Catholic Church in Ireland, where he said there must be more involvement of the laity.He said his faith was important to him. ldquoYou donrsquot want to overplay it because you are attacked nowyou do that.ldquoReligion is important to me. I am a believer and I understand it and I read about it and I think itrsquos part of my le and I often think that a lot of people, who have a lot of problems and dficulties - it is because they donrsquot have it. All I can do is pray for them.During lockdown Mr Ahern shared how he went to mass regularly from his kitchen in Drumcondra, sharing masses online from Clonard monastery in Belfast, as well as Derry, Cork and Dublin.He said lockdown had given people time to reflect and enjoy walking, something he really enjoys.He told the podcasters mdash former Sisters of Adoration who are now pilgrim guides on Saint Patrickrsquos Way Downpatrick mdash that ldquohe would love to come and walk the Irish Camino with them.He revealed he had spent nine months of the lockdown reading The Annals of the Four Masters, chronicles of medieval Irish history.Mr Ahern described it as a ldquotough read, admitting he could only manage  pages a day.Asked what he would like to banish from Ireland, in the Spirit of St Patrick, he said ldquoinjustice and violence..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Breast.jpg","title":"Breastfeeding is the most beautiful thing  ","story":"WHEN Joanne Masseyrsquos second child, Edward, was born six months ago, she knew she wanted to breastfeed him, but also,possible, donate to the milk bank.Weighing in at just over lbs, Edward fed for  minutes soon after he was born and it seemed like establishing feeding would be no problem.However, a few months before Edward was born, Joannersquos family found out her father, Jim Watson, had cancer.She explained: ldquoEventually we would learn it was terminal. So my stress levels were abnormally high.ldquoI soon felt like I couldnrsquot feed Edward enough, stress got the better of me at times and my brilliant health visitor Maura pointed me to a local breastfeeding group and also another brilliant lady, my breastfeeding peer support worker Aine Jordan-Doxey, who just completely gave me the confidence and support to keep going.ldquoThe peer breastfeeding group is hosted by a midwe health visitor and contains a beautul bunch of souls who are just there for each other. Wersquore all in the same boat and through this group I have received many tips, tricks and even friends.Despite Joannersquos determination to breastfeed Edward, it wasnrsquot all plain sailing.ldquoBreastfeeding is just the most beautul thing.Yes it can be dficult and absolutely frustrating at times but the benefits far outweigh those short blips, she said.ldquoThe best advice Irsquove ever heard mdash lsquodonrsquot give up on a bad dayrsquo.On a rough day, breastfeeding Edward gave me comfort, knowing I was the reason he is full and happy made me feel so good.ldquoAine gave me so much advice, including certain foods to eat to boost milk supply. Oats, theyrsquore your best friend! And you cannot drink enough water.Soon Joanne had more milk that Edward could take so she began collecting extra milk for the milk bank.She said: ldquoThe bottles arrived and I filled the first ml on December  last year. The donation was nearly full in a month but sadly my dad passed away on January  at the age of . There was a few weeks with no donations as my milk supply ped to an all-time low. Itrsquos just incredible what stress can do to your body.ldquoWell, Aine was there again, checking in, keeping me in chat, and keeping me motivated to keep breastfeeding. I am very lucky to have a wonderful, supportive husband, a close knit family and a close circle of best friends who have been tremendous during this very dficult time.Joanne went on to complete her donation of four litres of milk she calls ldquoliquid gold on Motherrsquos Day and wants to thank Aine for all her help and support.She said: ldquoI fully support every motherrsquos choice to either breastfeed or bottle-feed butanyone was struggling to breastfeed I would strongly recommend taking the support thatrsquos available.ldquoPersonally I am continuing to breastfeed because it gives me a little comfort in this time of grief, itrsquos a moment where I just look into his eyes and feel so needed and loved. So not only for the instantly available nutrition and comfort to my son but for those moments of joy I get from it too.Aine says she is so proud of Joanne mdash not only for continuing to breastfeed during the emotional time of her fatherrsquos illness and death but also for contributing four litres of milk to the Trustrsquos milk bank.The mother-of-threersquos own experience of breastfeeding had been rewarding but also not without its challenges.While she was living in England at the time, she recalled a time when one of her children was not thriving while she was feeding them.ldquoMy doctor and my health visitor both told me to stop breastfeeding my son and it was so frustrating as I knew that was not the problem so I continued on and it turned out that there was something  wrong.She began supporting Joanne in November last year when Edward was five weeks old.ldquoJoanne was exhausted and had been through some dficult nights where Edward wasnrsquot sleeping and was screaming through the night.I remember speaking with her about developmental leaps and what to expect at this stage and the normal infant sleep patterns, said Aine.ldquoFrom the beginning I could tell Joanne had so much passion for breastfeeding and wanted to succeed in every way. Joanne began expressing enough to give Edward a bottle and soon after he started sleeping better, just in time for her toddler to stop sleeping through. Joanne never let this stop her and carried on with minimal sleep.Aine said that when Joanne first mentioned to her about the possibility of donating milk, there were only  donors on the Northern Ireland milk bank.She said ldquoI was so proud as Joanne was the first of my mums to donate and it honestly made me smile at the thought. As usual Joanne just laughed and said it was no big deal as she enjoyed it. It was the first time I disagreed with her as I thought she was doing an extraordinary thing.ldquoWhen I opened her message and saw Edward surrounded by four litres of expressed milk for the milk bank, I was blown away again. What an incredible gt for the sick babies in theneonatal units.ldquoNot only was Joanne potty training a toddler and breastfeeding on demand, but she was expressing for the milk bank. I am so thankful to have been a part of her journey.

However, he did not make it through to show his impressive main course and dessert to the judges.Both chefs threw their all into devising four courses, including an appetiser and pre-dessert mdash based on the theme celebrating British innovation.Hopes were high for East Down given that Dundrum chef Alex Browne Greene, from EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, got two dishes to the national final last year and narrowly missed out on being crowned champion of champions at the banquet.Gemmarsquos starter was a twist on gammon, egg and chips, inspired by Kegomatic from Queenrsquos University students and for her fish course, the innovation shown in the building of the Titanic inspired her sea bass fish dish.She used William Clannyrsquos invention of the safety lamp for miners for her main course of lamb and the influence of astronomer Alice Everett as the first woman to work for the Royal Observatory to inspire her dessert, Out of this World.The dessert was her favourite course and she was delighted to have been scored a ten by chef Daniel Clford.ldquoIrsquom known for my desserts so I was really delighted to have got that score from Daniel, said Gemma.ldquoI also took his advice on my main course as therersquos no better person to take advice from and generally scaled back my dishes and made them more refined as the comments back were that there was too much on the plate.While Gemma was proud to have made it through to the regional final, she said she was not disappointed at not going through to the national judging.ldquoTo be honest, it was a bit of a relief as I did not know how I was going to go up against all the other chefs in the national final as I have only been cheffing for seven years and am mostly self-taught, she revealed.Gemma went into the competition, which was filmed last November, full of confidence and determined to do her best.ldquoI think I just went into a zone and concentrated on my own dishes and not to get too caught up in what the other chefs were doing, she said.ldquoPhelim was brilliant on the day and deserved to win and I remember saying on the programme that the better chef won. I hope that he goes on to get a dish to the banquet.While she has been receiving fantastic customer feedback from her popup, A Peculiar Tea, which she has been operating during the lockdowns, Gemma admitted that cooking was not her first career choice.ldquoWhen I left school I actually went to Queenrsquos University to do a nursing degree but a medical issue I experienced meant that I couldnrsquot complete it, she said.She then studied Bio Medical Sciences for a while before going to Ulster University to complete a software engineering degree.Her love of food and cooking mdash inspired by her chef mother mdash was strictly a hobby until the age of  when she took her first job at Slims Kitchen on the Lisburn Road in Belfast where she cut her teeth for a year while doing a Culinary Masters course.For four years Gemma continued studying and working full-time at a iety of great establishments, such as the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast where she rose to head pastry chef, before moving The Old Inn, Crawfordsburn, where she worked all the sections and eventually became sous chef.She has been in Alexanders for the last two years and got the opportunity to become an owner last year.ldquoIt may have taken my several attempts before I found the right career but I was determined not to do any job that I did not absolutely love and was passionate about.Like Gemma, Brunels chef Paul Cunningham hopes to be invited back next year after his disappointing showing this year.The  year-old had hoped to get to the regional judging to please his six-year-old daughter, Farrah.ldquoFarrah and I are massive fans of the show, we watch every year and of course, I wanted to further than I did but Irsquove got over the disappointment now and concentrating on getting the restaurant ready for re-opening, Paul told the Recorder.Paul is known for only using local produce from within a -mile radius of Newcastle and foraging for herbs and plants.His menu reflected his locality and passion for pioneers including Belfast-born Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Isambard Kingdom Brunelrsquos refloating of the SS Great Britain in Dundrum Bay mdash an incident which led him to name his restaurant by the great engineer.Paul only got to cook his starter and main course on the show but said his main course and dessert were showstoppers, with the main course of lamb called Healthy Heart made without using any salt or butter, inspired by Frank Pantridge who invited the portable defibrillator.He also collaborated with Doran Precision Engineering to create a model of the Titanic for one of his dishes and a special dish to show off his dessert, the Atom Smasher, inspired by Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Condemnation.jpg","title":"Condemnation over Murlough vandalism  ","story":"LOCAL politicians have criticised vandals responsible for setting fire to a gate at the Murlough Nature Reserve two weekends ago as  firefighters were battling a huge blaze in the nearby Mournes.The vandals also left behind a trail of rubbish at the internationally acclaimed area with their actions condemned by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Mournes councillor Laura Devlin.They say it ldquobeggars belief that while the raging wildfire destroyed  acres of rich habitat across the Mournes, there were people who thought that it was appropriate to start a fire at the Nature Reserve.The politicians also revealed that National Trust staff had to remove  bags of rubbish from the Reserve location on the Sunday the fire in the Mournes was eventually extinguished.Cllr Devlin said as young people drank alcohol and watched the blaze raging across the mountains, they set fire to a pedestrian gate which is also used to prevent Exmore ponies at the Reserve from escaping.ldquoI am really shocked at this behaviour, she said. ldquoBy the Saturday evening, everyone in the locality had an idea of the widespread damage in the Mournes but these iniduals thought it appropriate to cause more damage and potentially risk another blaze.ldquoI have no idea who these iniduals were and how old they are so I am appealing to people young and old.

He had a rare gt for making everyone feel better about themselves and for knowing they always had a friend in him. Facebook notices of his death drew an unprecedented outpouring of tributes and comments from across the region and demonstrated the levels of affection in which Jim was held.As a footballer he had few peers. His time with Downpatrick Rec was marked with cup and league successes, culminating in lting the Steel and Sons Cup in front of record attendances at the Crusaders Seaview ground for the first drawn match and the subsequent replay.Supporters from Downpatrick travelled in their thousands, marking the event one of the most widely celebrated sporting achievements of that era. The gate receipts were the highest ever recorded for the annual showpiece of amateur soccer in Northern Ireland, so much so that for the first time the income exceeded the VAT threshold, which meant tax had to be paid.On the day the Rec won that Steel Cup replay, Distillery tried to sign Jim as he left the pitch. He turned them down with a typically firm but gentlemanly refusal and stayed with the Rec for another four years, helping them to add to their cabinet of silverware.Jim lsquoCootrsquo Connolly was a player of exceptional talent. A classy and cultured defender, he is remembered for his unique ability to rise above other players, most of whom had a distinct height advantage, but lacked Jimrsquos trademark for timing his runs and hanging in the air for longer than ought to have been humanly possible. Many a spectator were left speechless after matches, shaking their heads in puzzlement at his exploits. Yes, he was that good.Tony lsquoDartrsquo Curran, who was the Downpatrick Rec goalkeeper, said it was ldquosometimes scary playing behind Jim. ldquoWhen I walked with Coot or talked with him or more often had a beer with him, I felt I was in the presence of greatness.So much so that everyone wanted a part of that, and his we Angie and family had to learn to share Coot because he just made you feel good about yourself. For that we as a community are eternally grateful to them. His footballing ability was absolutely extraordinary. I played behind him and said to him on a few occasions lsquoCoot you scare me. The things you do defy the laws of physics and gravityrsquo. He would jump for a ball start to come down and without touching the ground go up again. I swear it.Tony added: ldquoThe world is a sadder place for his leaving but somewhere up there hersquoll be playing with the guys that have gone before him and maybe BFwill be managing. I hope they will keep me a place on their team.Former Rec manager Jim Prior was devastated to learn of Jimrsquos death. ldquoLike all his former teammates I am cut to ribbons that Jim is no longer with us. As a footballer, he was simply out of this world. The other players on our most successful team were in awe of Jim and all loved him. He had star quality written all over him.He could do things that others couldnrsquot do, whether that was on the training ground or in the toughest of matches. I canrsquot remember him putting in less than a five-star performance.The Recrsquos former club secretary, Patricia Murrayremembers Jim as the baby of the Steel Cup team. ldquoMy deepest and heartfelt sympathies to Angela and all his family and friends. His laugh, smile and craic will be truly missed, Patricia said.Jim Connollyrsquos impact with Downpatrick was repeated at his next clubs, Ards and Killyleagh YC, where he suffered a career ending injury. He had been with the club for just two seasons but left an indelible mark. One of Killyleaghrsquos stalwart players, Philip Jennings, posted his own tribute. ldquoGreat memories of watching Jim for the great Down Rec team and playing with him at Ards and Killyleagh. A real legend in local football, but even more than that, just an absolute gentleman.Despite his injury, Jim ed to football several years later to turn out for the Downshire Hospital, with whom he won an all-Ireland medal winner in  under the management of Brian Cheetham.But the question always remained about what could have become of this precocious talent had he been able to stick with one of English footballrsquos premier clubs.His trials there were cut short by homesickness, more particularly an abiding love for his recently widowed mother. Downpatrick was his anchor. Family, friends, and the Stream Street precinct of his youth were too deeply ingrained for the young Connolly to ever contemplate leaving them behind. It was never a regret for Jim. Indeed,anything, the choice to stay reinforced his passion and love for the area. He perhaps never knew how deeply those feelings of connection were ed by those who had the good fortune to know him.Jimrsquos trials were at Nottingham Forest, Newcastle, and Everton, all three organised by local scout Bill Oakes. Everton came closest to getting his signature after pursuing him back to Downpatrick, although it was later learned that Newcastle too badly wanted to bring him on board.Local sports writer Charlie McStay recalled being contacted in later years by one of the Newcastle coaches who was enquiring about what had happened to Jim. ldquoNewcastle knew they had a gem on their hands, but he slipped through the net.All the coaches rated him at the highest level and believed he would have gone on to become a true star of English football, said Charlie.What a journey that would have been. All the way from Dunleath City and Santos in the Downpatrick Youth League to the pinnacle of professional soccer.Although soccer was Jimrsquos first love, he was an accomplished boxer and in his early days was trained by Owen Kerr, a respected coach who was a friend of world heavyweight champion, Floyd Patterson. Coincidentally, Owen was uncle to Cathal Kerr, who married Jimrsquos sister Bronagh. Small world!Jim also played juvenile and senior football for the Downpatrick Russell Gaelic Union, which this week remembered him as ldquomore than just a great footballer.An online RGU statement said: ldquoHe was one of the nicest guys you could ever meet. A true gentleman with an infectious laugh, he will be sadly missed by all who knew him.Away from sport, Jim trained as a mechanic and later became a minibus driver at Knockevin School and the local hospitals. He then joined Ulsterbus as a driver at the Downpatrick depot and rounded off his career as a groundsman at the Delamont estate. Always active, alwaysbusy that was the Jim Connolly way.Throughout his le, Jimrsquos singular passion was his family and friends. He was devoted to his we Angela mdash the couple were together from their teenage days and were rarely seen apart mdash and to his children, Aurla, Blaine and Clare. Nothing brought him greater happiness also than the birth of his grandchildren, Ruby, Darcy, Fianna, Fiachra, Grace and Eve. He is also survived by brothers Pat and Martin, sisters Ann, Marie, Bronagh, and Eilish, by his father-in-law Paddy Teggart, and by sons-in-law Feargal and Jude and his daughter-in-law Megan.Theirs is not a private grief. It is shared by countless hundreds who remember the boy and man who gave so much pleasure and for whom there is always a place in their hearts.Joe McCoubrey.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Job.jpg","title":"JobStart scheme to help young people welcomed by MLA  ","story":"THE launch of a new government scheme designed to create job opportunities for young people has been welcomed by local politicians.Department for Communities minister Deirdre Hargey last week launched the poundm JobStart scheme designed to support - year olds facing additional employment challenges due to the impact of Covid-.In addition, the government department has also helped create additional employment opportunities for young people and remove barriers for those seeking employment through the work experience programme and an expanded adviser discretionary fund.Minister Hargey said the Covid- pandemic has had an ldquounprecedented impact on the local economy and labour market and that as part of her departmentrsquos response, it has addressed the anticipated impacts on young people and those who are ready to be re-employed but need help negotiating the process of finding work.ldquoThis has included creating job opportunities and placements for young people providing additional payments towards travel or childcare expenses financial support of up to pound, a year to assist in the removal of barriers to employment and training to help people increase their chances of gaining employment.The JobStart scheme is designed to create opportunities for - year olds by providing positions with employers for a period of six months, increasing to nine months for those who meet additional criteria.An Opportunity Guarantee strand has been added to The Work Experience Programmefeaturing  week placements with the guarantee of an interview for a job or an apprenticeship on completion.Strangford MLA Kellie Armstrong and Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran have both welcomed the new scheme.Mrs Armstrong said the scheme was originally due to start last year, arguing that many young people may have missed out as a result of its delayed implementation.She continued: ldquoThe roll-out of this scheme is welcome as it will help young people climb back from the pandemic financially, while giving the economy a boost. I encourage them to apply for it.ldquoHowever, it is frustrating it has taken us so long to get to this stage. The rest of the UK benefited from it [the scheme] while Northern Ireland lagged behind which was unacceptable. Something which would be so useful can only lose value as time moves on.The MLA said that during the height of lockdown, people under  were the most impacted in terms of job losses and went from ldquoexpecting a scheme to wonderingone would appear at all, confirming that she has asked for confirmation that the Department for Communities will ensure opportunities from the JobStart scheme will be made available across Northern Ireland and will not just be concentrated around Belfast.Cllr Curran said with lockdown restrictions continuing to ease, any move to create job opportunities for young people is particularly welcome as they have a key role to play in future economic success.ldquoMany young people have bore the brunt of an unparalleled economic situation which has had a massive impact on the provincersquos economy, he continued.ldquoRebuilding the economy will require access to highly skilled and talented young iniduals to enable employers to compete globally and young people, in particular, need to be able to avail of high quality routes into careers.Cllr Curran also highlighted the importance of apprenticeship schemes to assist with economic recovery, and, looking forward, believes it is vital that the Newry, Mourne and Down area has access to highly skilled employers as businesses work to recover from the devastating impact of coronavirus.He said he firmly believes that the enterprise, innovation and entrepreneurship of young people is crucial to the economy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Athletics.jpg","title":"Lady luck for East Down AC runners  ","story":"THE  Belfast Half Marathon was always going to be a virtual affair due to Covid- restrictions, but that didnrsquot seem to put people off entering and setting their own route in order to chase a personal best for the distance or simply to claim their T-shirt.This event is normally well attended and attracts a raft of spectators, which creates a great atmosphere, but this year it was up to the runners to come up with a way of motivating themselves on the day.East Down AC had several runners who have used this as their incentive to keep churning out the long runs and as the date approached they were well prepared to cover the . miles.It was a case of girl power as all the EDAC athletes who took part were female on this occasion. Joanne Carson is credited with coming up with a pleasing route for her buddies, Helen Vint, Mags Flynn and Cathy Burke.These girls are to be seen most weekends, rain, hail or shine, chalking up miles in and around Downpatrick. Their dedication is most commendable. In their opinion, a half marathon is long enough to challenge the legs but not as draining as a full marathon so you could almost say that it is an enjoyable task.Joanne got them off to a familiar start. They met outside Castlewellan Forest Park on Saturday morning and ran into the park to do three laps of the lake. Nicely warmed up, they then headed out the main road to Newcastle and didnrsquot stop till they were in the grounds of the Slieve Donard hotel.They fairly breezed along and were all within sight of each other as they came to a halt. Cathy andMags were at the head of the pack in one hour  minutes with Helen less than a minute behind.Joanne was just a few seconds over the two hours and more than happy with her run and they all agreed that it was a scenic route.Being at the Percy French and the fact that outside hospitality had conveniently opened the night before, it would have been rude not to have an ice cold beverage to celebrate. Well deserved ladies.And so to Sunday, Suzy Smith often meets with friends and family including Kelly her niece for a long Sunday run.They stay close to home in Ballykinlar where the terrain could be described as lumpy. In fact whichever way they go, there are some challenging hills but these girls are well used to it and tough enough to persevere.Suzy had actually only planned to run a few miles with brother Patrick to encourage him on his way to the half marathon distance but she was enjoying it so much that she ran on and on until before she knew it, she had covered the entire . miles.Despite this only being her second time to complete a half marathon, she finished in a very respectable time of two hours and five minutes.Who knows how well she could doshe was participating in an official race Kelly meanwhile had struck a brisk pace from the off and followed her own rhythm easing ahead in the early stages. She has been running very well in training and it was no surprise that despite the gradients involved, she ended up with a personal best time of one hour  minutes.Again there is no doubt on a flatter course with other runners to chase, there will be improvement to come but for now both Smiths were content with their efforts and so they should be, well done..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/7May2021-Leader.jpg","title":"Leader and inspiration  ","story":"FINNEBROGUE Artisan has promised to continue the legacy of founding chairman Denis Lynn who died in a quad bike accident at the weekend.Hailed as an ldquoinnovator and visionary, Mr Lynn died following a tragic incident at his home in Killyleagh on Sunday.Mr Lynnbecame synonymous with his Downpatrick-based firm, which now employs , people over four local sites.On buying Finnebrogue Estate on the outskirts of the town in , the former potato chip seller turned to beef and deer farming and established Finnebrogue as the biggest venison processor and supplier in the UK.He then produced quality sausages, supplying Marks and Spencer and other leading retailers, and developed the nitrate-free bacon brand, Naked Bacon, in .More recently, Finnebrogue has ersied into developing meat-free products.The firmrsquos senior management team will now lead the business with non-executive director David Manning stepping up as interim-chairman and non-executive director Colin Walsh as interim deputy-chairman.A company statement paid tribute to Mr Lynn, who is survived by his we Christine, daughters Kerry, Clare, Tara and Ciara, and his wider family circle.It said: ldquoDenis was an innovator and a visionary with an infectious passion for delivering positive change for the planet and its people.

The secretary of state’s sparse statement in March  did presage a narrowing of the ludicrously overblown Stormont House Agreementarrangements on re-investigation and ‘truth recovery’.    \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...These were not agreed by all parties, while the NIO’s  draft Bill went far beyond SHA by creating a new offence of historic police misconduct. It also promised a police force of the past, the Historical Investigations Unit , to both investigate and judge past crimes, a travesty of our human rights commitments in ECHR Article  and .In the event, what the NIO is now spinning in the London press is a two-winged policy liable to fail from being neither fish nor fowl. Howeverthe HIU and Stormont House are out we have an advance of sorts.Their tacked-on truth and reconciliation concept is dead in the water following the A and C case. The advice is already out from retired generals to squaddies, who say: ‘have nothing to do with anyone knocking your door wanting to talk about truth recovery and reconciliation’. The paramilitarieslearnt their lesson after being recorded in the Boston Tapes debacle. That ended in police investigations and prosecutions. Nobody can risk believing that a no-prosecution policy today would not be followed by the opposite tomorrow. The mantra of truth, justice and reconciliation is a  god. Historians alone can bring you toward a synthesis of what constitutes the truth while lack of evidence for prosecutions means justice for some , families is impossible. Continuing lawfare against the state only worsens community relations. Is this an NIO amnesty  First we have % of an amnesty already in place with early release of prisoners and the OTR letters of comfort etc.An end to all prosecutions, perhaps in the form of a ‘stay’ has been advocated by many. But next to no prosecutions against paramilitaries will ever be started. Veterans however are increasingly liable to charge due to the PSNI choosing to re-open investigation into all the  security force caused deaths. This occurred after the Historical Enquiries Teamwas destroyed in the HMIC Otter report. It discovered what was always the case, that Hugh Orde had created an information recovery operation, not based on standard policing procedures. Yet it had been agreed by the ECHR Committee of Ministers.That proves that compliance with ‘Article ’, which seeks to protect le and is often cited in cases against state forces, compliance’ can be achieved in a dozen dferent waysthe Committee can be brought round diplomatically. There is no sign however that our Ambassador at Strasbourg is working to that end on the other  member states. Ireland can be excluded as it has the whip hand beingone of six countries on ‘the Bureau’ that controls the Committee agenda.Kenova under Jon Boutcher with its currently limited remit is very willing to take on all , historic cases with a required budget of billions and a two-decade operation. But why should a murder case in s Belfast be re-opened without credible and compelling new evidencethe same would never happen in Birmingham  The NIO has long promised equivalent protection from prosecution and to a degree re-investigation for veterans who served in Northern Ireland as those in Iraq and Afghanistan are getting in the Overseas Operations Act. That act is no amnesty, rather it has put in place extra hurdles before a prosecution can start. They involve time limits, new evidence, the military context , the public interest in finality and the level of previous investigation. It also allows for a current prosecution to be discontinued.The NIO seems to have either boldly decided to scrap all future prosecutions or been advised thatit only addresses veterans it will be arraigned in the Courts and eventually at Strasbourg for discrimination. Fear of court action has probably been key to a general no-prosecution decision, one that will please no one. It would be best to proceed with protections for veterans alone and deal with the inevitable storm from Dublin, Amnesty International and the Alliance Party already being experienced.It is worth noting that the Supreme Court says on its website, “UK courts are not required, however, always to follow the decisions of the Strasbourg Court.Indeed, they can decline to do so, particularlythey consider that that Court has not sufficiently appreciated or accommodated particular aspects of our domestic constitutional position.” I doubt that Brandon Lewis was advised by government lawyers of that way forward.The key question is will no prosecutions mean no more re-investigation and thus an end to lawfare  Without closing down new inquests, civil suits, private prosecutions, free legal aid, judicial reviews etc, which are overwhelmingly examinations of the security forces, such a policy will do little or nothing to reduce the hurt, damage or cost. All wounds will remain open and festering.We await the detail in the Queen’s Speech but may get little.Jeffrey Dudgeon, Convenor of the Malone House Group on Legacy and Lawfare——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

A place can still be well-ventilated with a parasol. It doesn’t make sense not to cover people when it’s raining.”Read More Read MoreWant to visit grandma  Here’s  pages of documents to read first Click here: DUP councillors back government curbs on anti-abortion protests  Click here – Sinn Fein man: NI state’s law was the envy of racist apartheid regime  Click here – NI centenary celebrations ‘a far cry from Republic of Ireland extravaganza’——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityVale of Glamorgan council put forward Aberthaw, a recently closed coal-fired power plant, as a potential site for a fusion prototype.The UK government last year called for suggestions for possible sites to pioneer the technology which could generate electricity with low carbon emissions.But opposition councillors on the Vale council have claimed the cabinet has ldquorushed through its decision to suggest Aberthaw as a site.More NewsCardf Tomasz Waga murder investigation sees two more arrestedFour coffee shops in Penarth for meeting a friend outdoorsThings to do in South Wales on May Bank Holiday weekend Plaid Councillor Ian Johnson said: ldquoIt was strange that the council leadership did not consult with other parties or ask a cross-party scrutiny committee to consider issues before making the expression of interest about a possible future use of the Aberthaw plant.ldquoEven though it is an early point, many people will have questions about the technology, the impact of the development and the process, and discussing this in scrutiny would open up the debate and ensure transparency.Fusion technology is still in its infancy and no fusion reactor has ever created more power than it consumes. But scientists say it could be cleaner and safer than fission, the nuclear technology currently used to generate electricity.If Aberthaw is chosen, the council is hoping the power plant could bring lots of high-tech high-paid jobs to the region. Westminster should decide on a site by the end of next year, and the power plant would be built by , costing about pound billion.But the Valersquos cabinet used controversial emergency powers last month to put forward Aberthaw as a site, without consulting the full council or any scrutiny committees. Council leader Neil Moore said this was due to the deadline for suggestions at the end of last month.     However, Westminster made the initial call for suggestions in December last year, meaning the council had four months in total to debate and scrutinise the decision to put forward Aberthaw. The council debated the issue in a meeting this week, after the deadline passed.Conservative Cllr Gordon Kemp said: ldquoThis is being dealt effectively without allowing any proper consideration or scrutiny. Itrsquos an extremely signicant matter, evenwe ignore the issue of public concern over such a proposal.ldquoWersquore looking at potentially a colossal, massive investment in the Vale. It could create many jobs, so I think itrsquos something that should have been discussed.ldquoI appreciate there are always deadlines on this. But Irsquom very concerned and surprised this wasnrsquot put before cabinet and scrutiny committees [earlier].Cllr Moore said the issue was ldquonot a debate, but promised to meet with the leaders of the opposition parties on the council, and to give a cross-party scrutiny committee a chance to consider the plans.He said: ldquoThis is just for noting. We used the emergency procedure because it had to be in by a deadline. This is not a debate about what we can do.ldquoBut Irsquom more than happy to have a meeting with the group leaders, and Irsquom more than happy to ask for an information report to go to the environment and regeneration scrutiny committee. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityNasir Adam - Plaid CymruRaised in Butetown, the son and grandson of merchant navy, Irsquove lived in Cardf South my whole le and itrsquos where I still work and live and itrsquos here Irsquom raising my family. During my  years as a community campaigner I have passionately campaigned for education, creating more opportunities for young people, tackling the housing crisis and the climate crisis. I was the regeneration officer for the Loudoun Square and Trowbridge redevelopment, and was selected as the Wales delegate for the International Association for Community Development and Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . Over the last  years Irsquove supported young people in Cardf South and Penarth to develop their skills in the arts and creative industries and to participate in a wide range of opportunities. I successfully gained the London  Olympic Cultural Inspire Mark for Butetown Community. I entered politics because of the increasing injustice around me - increasing food banks, homelessness, education, climate crisis, lack of opportunity for our youth, lack of affordable housing I was sick and tired of our communities being treated like second class citizens by the London elite. I want a fair deal for our communities for Cardf South and Penarth and for Wales.Alan Golding - Freedom Alliance. No Lockdown. No CurfewsRaised in Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taff, I have since lived in Brighton and Glasgow, moving to Cardf in . Since my early twenties Irsquove been interested in the workings of society and how we treat each other, animals and our planethellip and in the process Irsquove come to completely mistrust virtually all career politicians. I believe a new way of doing politics is needed in Wales with a new set of values across the whole system. I donrsquot believe the current political structure and its controllers have the interest of the people at its heart with regard to their mental and physical health, their quality of le and spiritual and economic well-being.     Paul Campbell - UKIPHello Im Paul Campbell and Im standing in the Cardf South and South Wales Central area for UKIP in the Senedd elections on MAY TH.Being. Born in Cardf and lived most of my le there I appreciate the Greatv Potential the pride and the Welsh Identity in Cardf and the Valleys towns. and I have seen how things have changed over the years with parts of the area unrecognizable from the place I remember.Areas of Cardf have become run down and standards have fallen with a loss of community spirit The surrounding Towns have been neglected with. A lack of investment and job creation initiatives.Mass immigration in the UK has put tremendous strains on cities like Cardf Newport and Swansea with wage depression and overstretched public services.. The Conservatives claim to be in control of immigration but they will only ever talk about it and under there watch in the in the last  years  million more people have come to our shires thats  cities the sthe size of Cardf . Increasingly they are choosing to come to Wales as Labour has encouraged them by a making Wales a Nation Of sanctuary.Helen Westhead - Green PartyOur current administration has ignored the climate emergency and has left so many people vulnerable and excluded. As we recover from the pandemic we have unique opportunity to create better ways of working - the influence of an elected Green in the room will be transformative.We see from across the UK, Europe, and beyond the incredible dference Greens make, holding government to account, speaking out against inequality, and representing real people and their communities, not political or corporate interest. Wales is long overdue that representation in the Senedd.We know that the way we recover from this pandemic and build back stronger is through investing in communities and public services, ensuring everyone has access to local facilities, and supporting small business. If elected, one of my main priorities would be better walking and cycling routes, connected to affordable public transport and green outdoor spaces that communities can enjoy. Advocating for a Universal Basic Income would ensure no one is left behind in our bold plan to transform Wales.With the more proportional voting system on the regional ballot in Wales, Labour cannot win regional seats. A Green vote on your second ballot is the only progressive option.Matt Friend - PropelPropel has led the campaigns on two of the most important issues affecting Barry, Penarth and Cardf.Wersquore the only party that has committed not to allow any nuclear mud to be dumped in our waters, including the mud dredged from outside Hinkley nuclear reactor in Somerset.And wersquore the only party that even mentions the scandal of dangerous fire risk cladding on so many of our flats and buildings. Through our Contract with Wales we have committed not to issue new building contracts to any housing developer involved in the scandal, until they have paid to fix the problem they created.Wersquoll also end the way leaseholders are getting rinsed by introducing a service charge cap, linked to the Retail Price Index. That will stop the double digit increases in service charges that leaseholders have had to put up with.Most importantly, wersquoll introduce a Coronavirus Recovery Act to end Welsh lockdowns, save lives and restore freedoms. We canrsquot just hope wersquoll get our freedoms back, we have to vote for them.The ten laws in our Contract with Wales will transform our nation. Wales needs champions. Vote Propel.Alex Wilson, Liberal DemocratsI live with my family in Penarth and I became involved in politics because of the widening isions that seemed to occurring our community. I feel that with the Liberal Democrat core values of tolerance and understanding we can bring people back together. We can cut through the shouting of partisan politics and once again listen to what people want in their community.The next five years is going to be critical and I feel the Senedd must put recovery first. That means recovering from the Covid pandemic, the recovery of our economy, better healthcare services and a happier community which can be achieved by better transport links, saving our environment and ato community values.Irsquove been around long enough to know a political status-quo without a strong opposition can breed complacency. Wersquove seen this in national and local government. If I am elected I will ensure that the voice of the people is heard. If yoursquove ever wondered how we almost lost the Kymin or how they plan to build over  homes on contaminated land at Cosmeston Farm in Sully, well itrsquos because our current political leaders often lack empathy with local communities.Other candidates standing are:Vaughan Gething - LabourAngus Hawkins - Gwlad The Welsh Independence PartyLisa Peregrine ndash Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party Alan Pick ndash Reform UKDavid Rolfe ndash IndependentLeighton Rowlands ndash Conservative article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Otherwise a coalition must be attempted.:Who can vote Anyone over the age of  can vote in the Senedd election provided they are:- registered to do so- living in Wales- not legally excluded from votingThis is the first time  and -year-olds have been eligible to vote. What impact that has on the result remains to be seen.How do I vote There are three ways - in person, by post and by proxy - however, the deadlines for latter two options have already passed.Voting at the polling booth with take place until pm today.Polling stations will be kitted out with hand sanitiser and distancing markers to help voters remain safe from coronavirus.Most crucially, voters are being asked to bring their own pen or pencil.Face coverings must also be worn, unless exempt.How does the voting system work Each voter will have two votes - one constituency vote and one regional vote.Youll be represented in the Senedd by five Members. One for your constituency and four for the region of Wales where you live.Constituency vote - this is for the person you want to represent you and your local area. Wales has  constituencies, with each being represented by one MS in the Senedd. Constituency votes are counted in a first past the post system - so the candidate with the most votes is elected.     Regional vote - This is for who you want to represent your region of Wales - South Wales East, South Wales Central, South Wales West Mid and West Wales and North Wales. There are  regional Senedd Members, elected by the additional member system.When will results be announced As with a lot of things this past year, the election has been hit by Covid restrictions.While voting will happen today, counting will not take place the same night as is usually the case on election night.Instead, the votes will be taken to the counting locations and kept secure until morning.They will then be veried - spoiled ballots removed - and counted.Due to Covid restrictions, this will likely take longer than in normal counts, but results are expected within two days of polls closing.Keep an eye on the Argus website for the latest, and results. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In August  they were sentenced to a total of  months in prison, reduced to  months for early guilty pleas, suspended for  months. The pair also had to pay a victim surcharge of pound each.Cllr Eddie Williams, Vale of Glamorgan Council Cabinet Member for Legal, Regulatory and Planning Services, said: ldquoThis was a despicable operation that took money from members of the public for items that were not what they purported to be.\"Great work by Shared Regulatory Services has led to this prosecution, which ensures that no more people will fall victim to this company.ldquoI welcome the signicant sum Mr Payter has been told to repay, which reflects the amount of money he made from the operation.ldquoThis case should serve as a warning to others operating illegally within our community.
