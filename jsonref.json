But Camus’s The Plague had gone the way of dried pasta and toilet roll there was just a desolate gap on the shelves where the copies had once been.The primary lesson of plague literature, from Thucydides onwards, is how predictably humans respond to such crises. Over millennia, there has been a consistent pattern to behaviour during epidemics: the hoarding, the panicking, the fear, the blaming, the superstition, the selfishness, the surprising heroism, the fixation with the numbers of the reported dead, the boredom during quarantine.Defoe would have recognised the impulses behind the strange tableaux of life interrupted in central London: piles of ice melting outside abruptly closed bars a truck unloading gym equipment at an oligarch’s house in Mayfair jittery shoppers with overloaded trolleys. “Many families,” he writes, “foreseeing the approach of the distemper laid up stores of provisions sufficient for their whole families, and shut themselves up, and that so entirely, that they were neither seen or heard of till the infection was quite ceased.”The sudden, powerful need to know what’s coming is predictable, too. We turn to historical witnesses who can explain what it’s like. Defoe’s motive for writing A Journal of the Plague Year was an outbreak of bubonic plague in Marseille in 1720. Anticipating its spread, readers wanted to know what it had been like in 1665. Defoe, responding to demand, provided them with an instant book, fashioned out of statistics, reminiscences, gossip, anecdote and blood-curdling dramatic detail. “Passing through Token-House Yard in Lothbury, of a sudden a casement violently opened just over my head, and a woman gave three frightful screeches, and then cried, “O death, death, death!”Defoe almost certainly didn’t witness this – he would have been about five. Novelistic moments such as these would make the book compelling at any time, but right now it has a painful relevance. Defoe is particularly strong on the unpreparedness and prevarication that made the impact of the plague more severe. Or, as he puts it: “I often reflected upon the unprovided condition that the whole body of the people were in at the first coming of this calamity upon them and how it was for want of timely entering into measures and managements, as well public as private, that all the confusions that followed were brought upon us, and that such a prodigious number of people sunk in that disaster which, if proper steps had been taken, might, Providence concurring, have been avoided.”So much of the behaviour of our 17th-century forebears is uncomfortably familiar. The citizens of east London watch complacently as the plague tears through the West End, and assume they will be fine. They’re proved terrifyingly wrong. Defoe adds in a chilling parenthesis: “For indeed it came upon them like an armed man when it did come.”Even before germ theory, Defoe’s common sense and perceptiveness lead him to conclusions of which our chief medical officer would approve. He gives a prescient warning about the danger of asymptomatic carriers: “The plague is not to be avoided by those that converse promiscuously in a town infected, and people have it when they know it not, and that they likewise give it to others when they know not that they have it themselves.”If human behaviour remains dismayingly constant, one thing that has changed for the better is science and our understanding of it. Seven hundred years on, there’s something deeply poignant about Boccaccio’s pre-scientific description of the spread of the Black Death in his native Florence. “What was particularly virulent about this plague was that it would leap from the sick to the healthy whenever they were together, much as fire catches hold of dry or oily material that’s brought close to it. And that was not all. Not only did speaking with the sick and spending time with them infect the healthy or kill them off, but touching the clothes of the sick or handling anything they had touched seemed to pass on the infection.” You feel like the audience in a pantomime, wanting to shout across the centuries and tell him who the villain is and how he operates.Not everyone responds to plague by immersing themselves in data about epidemics. The escapist response to disaster is another predictable move and The Decameron epitomises it. After his short but terrifying description of the Florentine plague, Boccaccio sends his troupe of young characters into quarantine, where they spend the remainder of the book, swapping funny, ribald stories: the plague doesn’t feature again. It’s a welcome relief to lose yourself in a world of cuckolds and randy nuns. And once more, plus ça change. The gilded Florentine youths are doing the 14th-century equivalent of binge-watching Sex Education on Netflix.Thomas Mann and Camus are less interested in plague itself than in using it to make existential points. The plague in Death in Venice is an avatar of death in general, the terrible mystery, the pale horse it is something that strips away vanity and reveals unpalatable truths. In Mann’s novella, it is the catalyst for Von Aschenbach’s humiliating descent into clownish self-destruction. At the same time, the pages dealing with the cholera epidemic are vigorous and apposite. The hotels in Venice empty swiftly, despite official protestations that there is nothing to worry about. It’s a young English travel agent who finally cuts through the official flannel. The doubts he raises about administrative competence and probity are ones that in due course we’ll all be obliged to consider. “‘That is,’ he continued in an undertone and with some feeling, ‘the official explanation, which the authorities here have seen fit to stick to.’”Camus is the real odd one out. The Plague is often read as an allegory of the French experience under occupation, but right now there seems nothing allegorical about it: the hero, Dr Rieux, seems like a naturalistic depiction of a frontline care-worker forced into impossible decisions over who gets a ventilator. At other historical moments, the constant reflection on the meaning of the plague could seem heavy-handed – Gallic, not in a good way – but in 2020 it’s like reading The Crucible while your elderly parent is on trial for witchcraft. For long stretches, you forget any notion of allegory and simply wonder how Camus could have got it so right: from the panic buying of peppermints that people think will be a prophylactic, to the high mortality rate in the municipal jail, to the exhausted healthcare workers, and the terrible monotony of quarantine, something with which we are only just beginning to get acquainted.And then, of course, the plague ends. That’s the actual good news that these books bring. The epidemic always passes. The majority of people survive. Thucydides himself had it and recovered. “I shall simply tell it as it happened,” he promises of the plague that ravaged fifth-century Athens, “and describe the features of the disease which will give anyone who studies them some prior knowledge to enable recognition should it ever strike again.”Should it ever strike again is the phrase that awakens our sense of hubris. For all the talk of an unprecedented crisis, we are living through something with many precedents. “There was particularly high mortality among doctors because of their particular exposure,” Thucydides wrote 2,500 years ago in a sentence that could appear in tomorrow’s paper. We have assumed that deadly epidemics belonged to a phase of history that was behind us, as quaint and irrelevant as candlelight and milking your own cows.When the number of fatalities finally peaks and dwindles, Defoe’s citizens pull up their windows and shout to each other to share the news. Camus’s Oran is liberated its citizens struggle to make sense of what has happened to them. Back in fifth-century Athens, the Peloponnesian war continues. Whether society changes for the better or worse, or simply stays the same, is what we will find out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f717ad99206515924b73106fb016b5fec3ad5f4f/0_172_5331_3199/master/5331.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29641596a01051273024647f3fb0b100","title":"can the uks night time economy survive the coronavirus pandemic","story":"With crowds the new enemy, it’s feared thousands of venues have closed their doors for goodOn a normal Saturday thousands of Brummies would be making plans for a night out with friends on Broad Street, the city’s nightlife hotspot famous for its noisy pubs and nightclubs.By midnight the dancefloors of clubs like Pryzm – Birmingham’s biggest – would be packed. “People congregate on Broad Street and go through the bars and, every Saturday night without fail, we’ll end up with 2,500 to 3,000 people coming through our doors,” explains Peter Marks who runs Deltic, the UK’s biggest nightclub operator, which is behind Pryzm.But the lockdown means there will be no queues outside Pryzm – or any of the UK’s other 1,600 nightclubs tonight or, indeed, any time soon as crowds have become the nation’s enemy.Boris Johnson has promised to set out the government’s plans to “get our economy moving” next week but with no vaccine there is no light at the end of the tunnel for the country’s 106,000 bars, pubs, clubs and restaurants, which will be the last to reopen after the coronavirus crisis abates.“We’re about socialising, not social distancing,” says Marks. “It is a low-margin business that relies on a lot of footfall. We get around about 7 million customers a year, but they spend £15 or £16 plus VAT each.”This week the JD Wetherspoon pub chain floated the idea of reopening in June but many within the hospitality trade see that as fanciful and are focused on how to survive the next few months of no, or very low, sales.One campaign gaining momentum is #NationalTimeOut which is being led by Jonathan Downey, the entrepreneur behind London street food business Street Feast and the Milk \u0026amp Honey cocktail bar in Soho.The proposal seeks a package of additional support, including an extension of the government’s job retention scheme, a nine-month rent-free period for tenants and a matching debt repayment break for their landlords.Without help, Downey says, more than half of hospitality venues and as many as 2 million jobs will not survive the lockdown – and even that could be “lowballing it”. The safety measures introduced by supermarkets and DIY stores, with people asked to stand 2 metres apart, are a non-starter in intimate venues and nobody wants to eat in an empty restaurant or dance on an empty dancefloor.“We were the first sector to be shut down by the government and therefore it stands to reason that we may be one of the last to reopen,” says Rob Pitcher, chief executive of Manchester-based Revolution Bars, a nationwide chain aimed at 18- to 30-year-olds. “Opening with any sort of social distancing is very problematic. We would rather stay closed for slightly longer and be able to open with far less restrictions.”Eyal Winter, an economist who has been advising the government over how to ease the national lockdown, told the  this week one solution could be for landlords to ration how much beer they serve, to two or three pints, before asking customers to go home.Marks says that idea is “laughable” and the only way venues can reopen is when social distancing is no longer necessary. Other problems loom. With job losses mounting across the economy many people will just have less money to spend on shopping and nights out after the lockdown ends. Karl Chessell, the director for food and retail at consultancy group CGA, says there is a genuine fear that some venues have “closed their doors for good”.Even if late-night operators can cope with a long shutdown, he says, they will find it difficult to ever return to profit if customer numbers are limited. “Any social distancing will impact revenues and make it incredibly difficult when margins are already slim.”Pitcher says the nine-month rent break proposed by the #NationalTimeOut campaign makes sense: “The burden is shared and shouldn’t cost the government too much more money.” Hospitality firms would not be in a position to find deferred rent anyway, he explains: “With zero income coming in that is money that is completely lost. It is not going to reappear at some point.” For the time being Revolution’s “best estimate” is that its bars might be up and running by late summer. Until the lockdown the chain served 100,000 customers on an average Saturday night and Pitcher reckons they will be keen to come back. “We are well aware,” he says, “they will be desperate for a night out when the time comes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa5d0bcdd3fd4f1f0054b05c5fd51d30d6e235e7/0_0_4928_2955/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=138785b1896874829f1df47ade69b162","title":"coronavirus may allow norwegian airline to survive","story":"As one of Norway’s greatest exports, A-ha, put it, in their classic 1980s hit Take on Me, it’s no better to be safe than sorry. This advice may appear ever more overwhelmingly wrong to those who bet their kroner on the vision of the two Bjorns, Kjos and Kise, the co-founders turned chief executive and chairman of Norwegian Air.The pair wisely exited the scene last year after an extraordinary ride during which they turned Norwegian from a small local carrier into a global pioneer of low-cost, long-haul air travel, and eventually established bases all around Europe. With half an eye on transatlantic links and another on a booming short-haul operation, Norwegian became a dizzying array of subsidiaries whose complexity could not disguise the fact that it was heading for financial disaster.Although Norwegian had started to streamline and argues that it was on its way back from the brink prior to coronavirus, the pandemic may yet allow it to unexpectedly survive. However, the terms of that survival may be little consolation to investors, who face the choice of salvaging crumbs or waving goodbye to it all.Norway’s government has offered a lifeline, a 3bn kroner (£230m) aid package to tide it through months of grounded planes, but dependent on the airline effectively making itself solvent again by wiping out debt. Three groups have to decide just how palatable the scraps on offer are. First, the bondholders, who are being asked to take equity in the airline instead of ever seeing their money repaid, and whose foot-dragging past deadlines on Friday suggested little appetite for playing along.Second, the aircraft lessors, who have in theory until Sunday night to decide whether to accept an even less alluring proposition. For these firms, who own the tangible, flying, metal-and-carbon-fibre assets instead of mere paper, the swap is not exactly tempting. Do they want to trade $500m of aircraft payments to own a chunk of an airline? Norwegian’s hope is that the leasing companies decide it is better to take a stake – effectively becoming the airline operator themselves – rather than parking dozens of Boeings and trying to find a new customer in the current market.In those brave days, the Bjorns’ ambition was so great that they even launched a Norwegian operation in Argentina, which has to be the most insanely optimistic South American transport venture since Fitzcarraldo attempted to haul a steamship over a rainforested Peruvian mountain. And, having placed enormous orders for Dreamliners and other new planes, Norwegian boasted that it had the youngest and most fuel-efficient fleet in the world.Of a fleet that was due to grow beyond 160 aircraft this summer, just seven planes remain in operation – pootling around Norway, delivering bits and bobs of essential cargo. Norwegian may yet rise from these ashes – but no investor will ever want to see a Bjorn again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d5cab77a15bc15c48cbe79e8067ac575f0b6d65/647_107_3054_1833/master/3054.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c79f657005f0127f604e0c4e1b4571ba","title":"chloe sevigny unafraid of going her own way over lockdown etiquette","story":"The actress has reluctantly adopted videocalling, but knows that there’s nothing like the real thingThere is a famous scene in the first episode of Friends in which Ross says: “I just want to be married again” and Rachel runs into Central Perk, right at that moment, wearing a wedding dress. “And I just want a million dollars,” Chandler quips, holding out his hands.A few weeks ago, before the lockdown, I wrote about how I had tried to revive the old-fashioned phone call, wondering if ringing people for a chat might make a comeback. I missed the human connection of talking and when texting became our primary mode of communication, I felt the absence of a simple natter keenly.And I just want a million dollars. Six weeks in and here we are. We phone, we FaceTime, we Zoom, we Houseparty. I even did a Skype. In the absence of face-to-face human connection, the videocall is king. In her cover interview with The Cut last week, Chloë Sevigny admitted that she had not previously been a fan of videocalling. “It’s always so terribly unflattering,” she said. Still, needs must and Sevigny admitted that under lockdown she now FaceTimes her friends.The necessary shift from the total remove of texting to seeing people during almost every communication is like popping out for one quiet drink and returning home several nights later with a buttock tattoo and a new nickname that ends in “dawg”. It is a sensory overload, a 0-60mph in 2.4 seconds. Before social distancing, I tended to FaceTime only children, because it is hard to pull faces at kids using just audio. Now, almost everyone expects a videocall, no matter how old. (The face pulling is less in demand.)It requires some adjustment, not so much because it’s unflattering, but because the usual rules of communication no longer apply. How does a conversation between more than two people suddenly seem like a finals-week-of-Strictly manoeuvre? In real life, it just sort of flows. On screen, it’s a “no, after you” comedy of manners. Where does one angle the camera? Up, it seems: recently, a judge in Florida had to remind lawyers to dress appropriately during virtual hearings one man appeared topless, a woman while still in bed, under the sheets.More importantly, how does anyone manage to end a videocall without seeming rude? Ordinarily, I’d go for a “sorry, reception’s bad”, but that’s impossible to pull off when your bad acting is right there on display. Even Sevigny knows where to draw the line. “I’m not doing any Zoom parties,” she said.Over the last few weeks, watching a series all about travelling prodigious distances and exploring the wonders of this planet should have seemed as appealing as squeezing lemon juice into a paper cut, but Race Across the World has been one of the loveliest television shows in ages.During the first of the BBC Two series, five teams had to make their way from London to Singapore by land, without smartphones, using only the cash equivalent of the airfare. This time, the teams had to travel the length of South America, from Mexico City to Ushuaia at the tail end of Argentina.The finale was astoundingly tense, but when uncle and nephew team Emon and Jamiul Choudhury signed their names in the book first – 20 seconds ahead of the runners-up – it was hard to deny they deserved the win. They pulled it off by bartering MP3 players and ditching their bags before running up the final hill. But what made it the most life-affirming show I’ve seen all year was that the winners were so affected by seeing children sleeping rough in the streets in Brazil’s São Paulo that they donated half of their £20,000 prize fund to charity. They have since pledged another £5,000 to an orphanage in Bangladesh. I already thought it was Hunted for nice people and then they hit us with that.In the chaos of our present lives, watching people become more self-sufficient than they thought possible was almost as joyful as watching how much strangers can be willing to support each other when they really need to. As a series, this was a convincing advert for fundamental human decency. I thought University Challenge ending would be the biggest blow but now that Race Across the World is gone, too, I don’t know how I’ll manage.I imagine that one day there will be a corner of the internet that caters to everyone’s wildest dreams, no matter how niche. Last week, my corner appeared. During Take Me to the World, the online celebrations for Stephen Sondheim’s 90th birthday, a title card appeared, reading “The Ladies Who LunchCompany”. The musical Company is having a bit of a moment – not only was the gender-flipped West End revival, which turned Bobby into Bobbie, a deserved smash in 2018, but Adam Driver gave new breath to Being Alive in the film Marriage Story, belting out an intense rendition that could only be described as very dedicated.This performance of The Ladies Who Lunch began with the inimitable Christine Baranski pouring herself a glass of red and it only got better: on a Zoom call, Baranski’s Mamma Mia! co-star Meryl Streep appeared, mixing herself a martini, then Baranski’s The Good Fight co-star Audra McDonald joined in the fun. I thought Britney Spears casually letting it be known via Instagram that she had burned down her gym (“I had some candles, and, yeah, one thing led to another”) would be the best thing on the internet last week, but no, it was three icons, singing the line “another vodka stinger”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e937a9abf6ef5acc5bbf087643cc47321302b93/0_173_5143_3084/master/5143.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2e84bfe104a1458c28475043c7862a4","title":"deliveroo venture capitalism food delivery business model","story":"The food delivery company is a case study in the destructive nature of its own ‘disruptive’ business model• See all our coronavirus coverageIf any company can weather coronavirus well, it should be Deliveroo. The early days of lockdown saw demand surge for the service delivering food from restaurants and takeaways. The decision by several major restaurant and fast-food chains to shut for weeks during the early stages of lockdown might have dented demand, but as they begin to reopen for delivery – with most other activities still curtailed – prospects would seem bright for the tech company.Why Deliveroo is struggling during a crisis that should benefit its business model tells us about much more than just one start-up. The company’s nominal reasoning for needing cuts is that coronavirus will be followed by an economic downturn, which could hit orders. That’s plausible, but far from a given.The financial crash of 2008 – which led to the most severe recession since the Great Depression – saw “cheap luxuries” perform quite well. People would swap a restaurant meal for, say, a £10 Marks \u0026amp Spencer meal deal. Deliveroo is far cheaper than a restaurant meal for many people – there’s no need to pay for a childminder, or travel, and there’s no need to purchase alcohol at restaurant prices. Why would Deliveroo be so certain a downturn would be bad news?The answer lies in the fact that Deliveroo’s real business model has almost nothing to do with making money from delivering food. Like pretty much every other start-up of its sort, once you take all of the costs into account, Deliveroo loses money on every single delivery it makes, even after taking a big cut from the restaurant and a delivery fee from the customer. Uber, now more than a decade old, still loses money for every ride its service offers and every meal its couriers deliver.When every customer loses you money, it’s not good news for your business if customer numbers stay solid or even increase, unless there’s someone else who believes that’s a good thing. What these companies rely on is telling a story – largely to people who will invest in them. Their narrative is they’re “disrupting” existing industries, will build huge market share and customer bases, and thus can’t help but eventually become hugely profitable – just not yet.This is the entire venture capital model – the financial model for Silicon Valley and the whole technology sector beyond it. Don’t worry about growing slowly and sustainably, don’t worry about profit, don’t worry about consequences. Just go flat out, hell for leather, and get as big as you can as fast as you can. It doesn’t matter than most companies will try and fail, provided a few succeed. Valuations will soar, the company will become publicly listed (a procedure known as an IPO) and then the company will either actually work out how to make profit – in which case, great – or by the time it’s clear it won’t, the venture capital funds have sold most of their stake at vast profits, and left regular investors holding the stock when the music stops.This is a whole business model based on optimism. Without that optimism, and the accompanying free-flowing money to power through astronomical losses, the entire system breaks down. That’s the real struggle facing this type of company. It’s also why the very idea of bailing out this sector should be a joke: venture capital chases returns of at 10 times their investment, on the basis that it’s high risk and high reward. If we take out the element of “risk”, we’re basically just funnelling public money to make ultra-rich investors richer.What pushes this beyond a tale that many of us might be happy to write down to karma, though, is the effects it has well beyond the rest of the world.Tech giants move in on existing sectors that previously supported millions of jobs and helped people make their livelihoods – cabs and private hire, the restaurant business, to name just a few. They offer a new, subsidised alternative, that makes customers believe a service can be delivered much more cheaply, or that lets them cherry-pick from the restaurant experience – many restaurants relied on those alcohol sales with a meal to cover their margins, for example.These start-ups come in to existing sectors essentially offering customers free money: £10 worth of stuff for a fiver. It turns out that’s easy to sell. But in the process, they rip the core out of existing businesses and reshape whole sectors of the economy in their image. And now, in the face of a pandemic, they are starting to struggle just like everyone else. It’s not hard to see how this sorry story ends. Having disrupted their industries to the point of leaving business after business on the verge of collapse, the start-ups could be tumbling down after them.• James Ball is the global editor at the Bureau of Investigative Journalism"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1986444e8cd4e58ba375d939e259f8935fea6921/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb7760cc36403534f7a43150a8ce8af4","title":"home schooling is tough but parents are doing a fraction of teachers jobs","story":"The lockdown has made us grateful for the myriad other things that schools provide our children As the government considers a phased reopening of schools, let’s hear it for parents who’ve toughed it out home-schooling their children. Well done, everyone, but you do realise that you’re not real teachers, don’t you?The phased reopening of schools looks set to be complicated, just as for many disadvantaged pupils home education has proved chaotic and calamitous, with long-term consequences for social injustice. Many children have accessed little, if any, online learning. It has emerged that the promised 200,000 laptops to help them may not even arrive until late MayJune. Schools have experienced huge difficulties trying to access the free school meal voucher scheme. I could go on, but the point seems clear enough: educators educate, but that’s not all they do.Obviously, parents deserve praise, and lots of it. The lockdown continues to be challenging for children and carers alike – keeping on top of it is an enormous achievement. I know I’m lucky to have a teenager in this situation, that it would have been totally different with a younger child requiring constant hands-on supervision. You’d have to be a parenting saint not to sometimes find it stressful and difficult. Still, parents are only dealing with their child or children. Even after everything that’s happened, how many of us could claim to truly comprehend what it’s like to educate and care for whole classes, and entire schools, full of children?Whatever some of us may tell ourselves during these weeks, parents haven’t been doing what teachers do. Not that they were supposed to – this has been an emergency, not some bizarre competitive parenting contest. However, had it been, it wouldn’t even have been close. What has played out (if all went to plan) is more akin to a temporary parent-cum-teaching assistant, steered online by their school.It’s not running a full class, or several of them, and doing everything else that educators do. The childcare aspect alone has hit home for parents during this period – the fact that schools enable them to do something as fundamental as go to work. Then there’s the extracurricular stuff: the shocking amount of often unrecognised (and unpaid) proto-social work that goes on all over the country in Britain’s poorer schools, with many teachers having to feed and clothe their most vulnerable pupils.So pat yourself on the back if you’ve worked hard home-schooling your children, keeping them interested, happy and, of course, educated. At the same time, spare a thought for teachers who do all this, and more, but for many more children. People rightly applaud NHS staff and key workers, but perhaps our educators also deserve a lot more appreciation than they generally get. It’s a tough job sometimes the toughest parts aren’t even in the official job description. During lockdown, parents may been committed, patient, resourceful and lots of other great and admirable things, but they have not been teachers.What is the feminist position on caring about resembling a lockdown hell-hag?

My skin is more pallid than usual and would be “end-stage consumption” on the Farrow \u0026amp Ball paint chart. Now, after weeks of waiting for my hairdressing scissorshair dye to arrive, I’ve reached peak Methuselah’s grandmother. My nails look as if I’ve spent the last two months trying to claw my way out of a crypt. I suspect my eyebrows have developed their own eco-system. And on it goes.I’m not even that high maintenance. Once I could have said “road maintenance” and got a laugh now I’d just get sympathy and, worse, murmured agreement.I’m being facetious, but this is a feminist mind-melt. Am I a gender traitor for pining for my hair stylist or just a shallow idiot? In the past, I’ve tended to be impatient with people over-fretting about the rightnesswrongness of makeup and sundry grooming rituals – my attitude is, do what you like, with the emphasis on “you”. Still, even now, the core feminist questions apply. Should appearance matter so much? Who or what tells us that it should? When it comes to societal pressure, what conditioning are women also buckling under?The Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, doesn’t seem inclined to let coronavirus interfere with his one-tech-tycoon crusade to make us equate “billionaire” with “billions of stupid”. He has been raging about the US lockdown, describing it as “fascist” and “against all constitutional rights”.Previously, he derided the “panic”, passed on what’s been criticised as dubious science to his 33 million Twitter followers, incorrectly declared children to be “essentially immune” and much more. He is entitled to favour lifting the lockdown. He’s also entitled to be concerned about Tesla. (Though don’t cry him a river – along with others, Musk’s company, Space X, has just landed a multimillion-dollar contract for a Nasa moon landing project.)However, contrary to what his outsize sense of entitlement is telling him, he isn’t the last word on every subject. The effect of Musk’s sustained public protest has been to make the arena of techy super-moguls look ill informed, brattish and grotesquely self-interested. After a public outcry, Victoria Beckham reconsidered her decision to furlough staff in her fashion company. Maybe Musk could also try reading the global room."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2928cd1723c68e70f9474d47397a7839028f652/0_74_3014_1809/master/3014.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6574307d620780331ff9629813d3579","title":"the british charlatan style has been sent packing by too much reality","story":"Boris Johnson has trumpeted jingoism in the face of the coronavirus facts • See all our coronavirus coverageAs they were bound to fail. From the moment Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Michael Gove won the Brexit referendum in 2016 by promising we could inflict a shuddering change to our country without feeling pain, failure has been inevitable. The only wonder is that it has taken so long for the British charlatan style to die.It’s dying now as surely as the lost souls in care homes disappearing out of sight and out of mind. I say British rather than English because Alex Salmond’s promises of Scottish independence without tears anticipated Johnson’s promises of a painless Brexit and because British dishonesty takes a distinctive form.Since 2016, Johnson has been a postmodern populist. His myths have been cheerful, a world away from the menace behind Trump’s snarls. He claimed the impossible was possible with a wink to the camera and a smirk on his face. He believed, or seemed to believe, you could never be sure, that all difficulties could be overcome with a dose of British pluck.Good government in these circumstances would have been next to impossible. Now the pandemic has hit, it is impossible. Everyone involved in the fatal failure to contain the virus in February and early March is covering their backs. You do not, however, need to stare too hard at Johnson’s belated statement on 21 March that “we’re taking away the ancient, inalienable right of free-born people of the United Kingdom to go to the pub” to know that the ideology of the Brexiters is out of time. Johnson did not act until the pandemic had engulfed us because his puffed-up nationalism held that the Brits, so favoured by providence, would refuse to imitate the cowed continentals. We stood alone in 1940. We stood up for ourselves in the Brexit referendum. Why couldn’t we stand at the bar now?Behavioural “science”, a dubious discipline, since human behaviour does not follow paths as predictable as Newtonian physics, provided a pseudo-intellectual veneer to cover nationalist self-regard. Ministers and their scientific advisers tarried because they thought freeborn Britons would tire of the lockdown. “There is a risk if we go too early people will understandably get fatigued and it will be difficult to sustain,” said Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, on 9 March . In fact, the British were locking themselves down days before the government finally accepted the realities of the pandemic. We did so because one aspect of human behaviour remains predictable: we don’t want to die. Far from suffering from lockdown fatigue, every survey shows that an alarmed public is not straining to “get back to normal”.Invocations of the wartime spirit, so characteristic of Brexiters who have never fought a war, led to the dallying with the possibility of “herd immunity”. Britain could take the Blitz, so it could take the virus. Meanwhile, the love of simplistic slogans and over-promising so characteristic of the Brexit movement has been displayed to the point of tedium.Yet the practicalities best explain why, in the words of Professor Chris Grey, one of the best chroniclers of our decline, a Brexit movement “impervious to reason and incapable of engaging with complexity” has reached its terminus. Millions of Britons must have gazed on the cabinet and thought, “really, Tories, is that your best shot?” They should remember that Johnson destroyed the careers of Alistair Burt, David Gauke, Justine Greening, Dominic Grieve, Philip Hammond, Ed Vaizey and many another Conservatives with ministerial experience because they wouldn’t inflict a no-deal Brexit on Britain.He sent others to the backbenches. Jeremy Hunt, for example, was health secretary for six years and you can wonder why he isn’t helping out now. Then you remember he challenged Johnson for the Tory leadership and so had to be punished. I am not asking you to like the Conservative politicians Johnson pushed aside, only to accept that the emergency demands the services of ministers who know how government works. Instead, we have a dilettante PM, a cabinet of nobodies and a civil service policed by Vote Leave propagandists, who can fool the country in a referendum but have no idea how to manage it in a crisis. An administration of all the sycophants rather than all the talents.Its time has gone. I am not saying we are about to enter a better age of competent government. Hard times are rarely good times for the centre left and it looks as if we are heading into the hardest of times. Angry people cling to what they have in a slump. They blame foreigners and turn to shop-soiled saviours. Who knows, after populism with a smirk on its face could come populism with the authentic snarl. What’s over is the glib, deceitful spirit of 2016 with its false promise that bills need never be paid. The Brexit right has attempted a final rally. It dismissed warnings about public health as “over the top” just as it dismissed warnings about Brexit as “Project Fear” and assured us that “German carmakers” or some other knight on a shining unicorn would make everything all right.But the exhausted Johnson has stopped listening to his old allies. Even he knows that Britain will pay for being one of the last European countries to go into lockdown by being among the last to leave. There are many reasons why yesterday’s retailers of counterfeit optimism have become today’s frightened pessimists. To be precise, 27,510 reasons – and rising."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01b0f22c5dc9eca90b35891348571fd166bb2a75/0_233_5321_3192/master/5321.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6c8297463ac982c9799102c57284a42","title":"nostalgia for the beautiful world outside has made a collector of me","story":"A stash of the finest cigarette cards is helping to keep my mind at peaceTrapped indoors, we’re all overcome with nostalgia, the past being one way to escape the present. Butterscotch Angel Delight is now strangely hard to come by. Meanwhile, Stanley Gibbons reports a “gratifying” increase in customers as people remember how they once loved stamp collecting.This may explain why last month I spent more money than I should have on a large collection of old cigarette cards. These are not, however, any old cigarette cards: they are the silk flower cards given away with Kensitas in the 1930s – and so lovely you can hardly believe they were once just a free gift (“Why do we give you these inserts? Because tobacco is a plant, and we want you to realise that only the finest Virginia tobacco is used in Kensitas”). Each one is a tiny envelope. Inside is a piece of ribbon on to which has been woven a flower: violets and stocks, roses and lupins, pansies and nasturtiums. Having laid them all out on the kitchen table (I’m like a teenager with his Panini stickers, weeding out duplicates), I can gaze at them for minutes at a time. The past is another country or, in this case perhaps, another market garden.In all the lists I’ve seen of books about epidemics, one seems to have gone missing: Somerset Maugham’s novel of 1925, The Painted Veil, in which a shallow woman is brought to her senses by an outbreak of cholera in a remote part of China. I can’t account for its disappearance thus far. Maugham has such an instinct for psychology he writes women so well he looks at the expat and understands that his grating superiority is more than likely just a cover for the fact that he has basically run away from home. And then there’s its uncommonly gripping and queasy-making plot. This was inspired, he tells us in a preface, by Book V of Dante’s Purgatorio, in which appears the story of a gentlewoman from Siena, whose husband, suspecting her of adultery, takes her to his castle in Maremma, hoping that the noxious vapours from the marshes will kill her…Thanks in large part to a rallying cry issued by the food writer Jenny Linford, some of us have been buying quite a lot of cheese, the better to support the nation’s artisan makers during this crisis. Luckily, I’m all for cheese given a choice, I’ll always take a slice of Mrs Kirkham’s Lancashire over a bag of Maltesers. But even so, what might a person do should they happen to end up with – whisper it – too much cheese?Pondering this, I remembered the potted cheese of which my father was fond and out of which I used to take the piss as a child, on the grounds that it sounded (and looked) like something Fungus the Bogeyman would regard as a treat.If this has not put you off – my nod to Fungus and his horrible habits, I mean – you can find several recipes for the using up of ancient fromage in Elisabeth Luard’s timely new book Preserving, Potting and Pickling, including one with marc (though any white spirit – vodka? – would do just as well). It’s so easy. Simply grate your leftover hard cheese, pound it together with your soft, work in the booze and then stick the whole pungent ensemble in a ramekin. Seal with a layer of clarified butter. But be warned: this is not for the faint-hearted. It gets whiffier every day. After a fortnight, you’ll need to bury it under concrete."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17479024090011d428736004f838598851075ddc/0_75_4938_2963/master/4938.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed1d678c798e1e05830074d22d76f743","title":"the end of the old order cartoon","story":"Coronavirus will change society, but for whose benefit?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/398f7cba9c7748958910b9caa8884c17d444e7ff/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d0d67e5da8c09fc28856f42ae72840d","title":"university students have you stayed or returned to your term time address","story":"We’d like to hear from students who are returning to their university address for the start of third term, or who have remained there during lockdownAs universities prepare to enter their third term of remote teaching, some students are planning to return to their term-time home.

Many of the young people have lost their part-time jobs and can no longer afford even basic living costs.The Indian National Students’ Association, one of the largest student groups, says so far it has helped to distribute food to more than 3,000 struggling students across the country. A second UK-wide students’ group, the National Indian Students and Alumni Union, says it has also had calls from hundreds of students who cannot afford food. Charan Sekhon, chair of an Anglo-Indian charity based in Bedford called the Seva Trust, which has delivered food parcels to more than 60 Indian students in its local area, says: “We have had lots of examples where students are actually starving. They haven’t got anything at all to eat.”Virendra Sharma, Labour MP for Ealing Southall, wrote to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, on Wednesday calling for universities to ringfence money from hardship funds, which are often discretionary, for international students. He also called for minimum service standards for universities to ensure they are offering students enough advice and support.He wrote: “I have heard stories of international students contemplating suicide because they do not know what to do and cannot afford to eat.”India banned all international flights from 22 March, giving students only two days to arrange to get home. Flights that typically cost around £300 were selling for £2,000, and thousands of students found themselves stranded in Britain.India is the fastest growing market for British universities, with nearly 27,000 Indian students coming to the UK in 2018-19. International students can pay up to £38,000 a year in tuition fees to study for an undergraduate degree at a UK university. Indian student groups and charities say many Indian students are not from wealthy families, and have to rely on part-time jobs to cover their living expenses.Sekhon says his small charity, which usually focuses on education projects, has been flooded with queries from students since being listed by the Indian high commission as a coronavirus support group. It has been delivering free hot meals and food to Indian students in Milton Keynes, Bedford and Luton for the past four weeks. He says the students are mainly from the universities of Cranfield, Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire.“I don’t think universities fully understand what is going on,” he says. “Many of these students have been doing cash-in-hand or hourly-paid jobs, which they have lost. They can’t get home to their families, and they feel alone and don’t know how to access help like food banks.”A spokesperson for the University of Bedfordshire says: “Students don’t always highlight their difficulties and don’t contact our support team. We would urge students who are struggling to get in contact straight away.” The university can provide care packages and financial support as well as help finding work, she says.Cranfield University says it is aware of only one case of hardship. “Our student support and wellbeing team is looking into the details and will offer help,” it says.The University of Hertfordshire says is it offering wellbeing support, care packages, accommodation and food vouchers and has set up a new fund to help students in hardship as a result of the pandemic. Sameer Dhore, a student at the University of Greenwich and president of the university’s Indian Society, says: “Students are crying on the phone saying they want to see their mum or dad. The major issue is finance. Students are running out of money right now. There are students with nothing to live on.”The National Indian Students and Alumni Union says it has received thousands of queries from anxious students “trapped” across the UK, hundreds of whom say they do not have enough to eat.Sanam Arora, NISAU’s chairwoman, says: “A lot of students rely on part-time jobs, and now they have lost them they can’t pay their rent or buy food.” She says there is an atmosphere of panic: “The mental health issues are just flabbergasting. Some students have even threatened suicide.”The organisation has called on the Indian government to help get students home, and is backing a call by the UK’s National Union of Students for the UK government to do more to help. “International students are falling through the safety net,” she warns.Prerit Souda, an INSA committee member, says that as well as being unable to buy food, some students have been facing eviction because they cannot pay their rent. “We connect them with legal experts, but in some scenarios students have been sub-contracting and that is much more difficult as they don’t have the same rights. In those cases we have been working with Indian community organisations to find them somewhere free to stay.”The Indian government has said the flights ban will continue until midnight on Sunday. Student groups, charities and parents are calling for students to be put to the front of the queue for repatriation.Universities UK, the vice-chancellors’ group, says all universities now have support systems in place. Vivienne Stern, UUK’s international director, says: “The first piece of advice we would give students is please, please contact your university. If they don’t know, they can’t help you. They might not be able to fix everything, but there are people on hand who want to help and listen to your problems.”Stern says some universities are going the extra mile to reach out to students, rather than waiting for students to come to them. These include Exeter University, which has been calling all remaining international students daily. Meanwhile, Bath University has moved students who were in halls in the city centre into rooms on its campus, and is providing three free meals a day.Meanwhile, parents and relatives back in India have been using social media to beg the Indian government to bring their children home. They include Dipti Taluja, whose 18-year-old son is doing a degree in sound engineering and music production at a private higher education institution in London. “It is very scary sitting thousands of miles away and knowing you are helpless and cannot do anything to bring back your child,” she says from her home in Gurugram, near New Delhi. Her son has been “very depressed”, she says, but is coping better after speaking to volunteers at NISAU.The UK Council for International Student Affairs has an advice page to help students."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04c2420df62cf8869b2ef01a94b3552998b45492/0_0_3403_2269/master/3403.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=5485d1d12e52e9976c2ea51318b47d0c","title":"hair curtains are back and this time theyre for girls as well","story":"Style sported by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kurt Cobain in the 90s, and Timothée Chalamet today, has gone gender-neutral in lockdown BritainEvery decade has a signature cut. The 50s had short-back-and-sides, the 70s long flowing locks, and the 80s the mullet. In the 90s, though, from Leonardo DiCaprio to Kurt Cobain, it was all about curtains. Two decades later, they’ve made a comeback – and it’s not just for the boys.“They’re back, massively so,” said Jackson Acton, owner of Crab Salad salon in south London. “It’s a definite trend.”Back in the day, a grown-out fringe, parted down the middle, was the go-to style for teen heart-throbs. In Britain, Paul Nicholls and Take That’s Mark Owen perfected the look and in the US, Claire Danes swooned first over Jared Leto’s curtains by the school lockers in teen drama series My So-Called Life and then over DiCaprio’s curtains in Baz Luhrmann’s Romeo and Juliet.DiCaprio remains an inspiration, along with actor Timothée Chalamet, but this time around, says Luke Hersheson, of Hersheson salons, curtains are more for women. “It’s synonymous with the late 90s. Bella Hadid channels the vibe of that time and it’s very grungy,” he said. “Even parting your hair in the centre is a nod in the right direction.”Liam Freeman, a journalist at Vogue, said he had gone for a look that was a less gender-specific version of the hairstyle he had when he was 12. “It’s below the earlobe and not perfectly symmetrical,” he said. “Brad Pitt and Kurt Cobain famously popularised curtains at the time, but Winona Ryder, Gwyneth Paltrow, Halle Berry, even Princess Diana, also framed their face in a way that’s reminiscent of the style.” Curtains were certainly preferable to cutting your own hair, he added. Celebrity hairdresser Charlie Le Mindu thinks the comeback is part of the trend for DIY hair products and fits in with the coronavirus lockdown “no-shampoo” movement.

Trolls World Tour, which has become a lockdown hit, notching up digital sales of $100m (£80m) in three weeks, has become the focal point of a battle that could forever change moviegoing habits in the Netflix era.With cinemas closed, Hollywood studios are challenging the sacrosanct tradition that multiplexes air films first for up to three months, before their release on other platforms such as pay-TV, DVD and streaming. Instead, they are pushing new films straight to fans at home.Universal Pictures has been the most aggressive of the Hollywood studios with its strategy for Trolls World Tour. The film had been due for a global cinema release on 10 April, but instead became the most high-profile movie to be made available solely on digital services such as Amazon’s Prime Video at £15.99 ($19.99).Universal gets a greater cut of revenue from digital services than at the box office, which means the film has made the same amount of profit in its first three weeks as the first Trolls film did during its entire five-month run in US cinemas.Emboldened by its success, last week the company indicated that it would collapse the cinema release window by releasing films digitally at the same time. “As soon as theatres reopen, we expect to release movies on both formats,” said Jeff Shell, the chief executive of parent company NBCUniversal.Those comments immediately prompted the world’s two biggest cinema operators – AMC, which owns the Odeon chain in the UK, and Cineworld – to issue a global ban on screenings of all films from the maker of the Fast \u0026amp Furious and Jurassic World franchises when business restarts. The operators accused Universal of “breaking the business model” that has underpinned the Hollywood movie system for generations.That schedule is now filling up. Universal announced last week that Judd Apatow’s new comedy The King of Staten Island would scrap its planned cinema release on 19 June and premiere on-demand instead. And Warner Bros is doing the same with Scoob!, the first full-length animated Scooby-Doo film, which was meant to hit cinemas on 15 May.However, when it comes to true blockbusters, Hollywood studios, including Universal, are so far choosing to keep them in cinemas and reschedule their releases. The straight-to-digital strategy is only considered to be viable for mid- and lower-budget films forecast to earn at most a few hundred million at the global box office. The first Trolls film made $346m worldwide.Disney’s Mulan and Black Widow, the James Bond film No Time To Die, Warner Bros’s Wonder Woman 1984 and Universal’s Minions sequel – all potential $1bn-plus hits – are just some of the titles that have been shifted to later this year with a cinema release still firmly in mind.Global box-office revenues hit an all-time record of $42bn last year, dominated by blockbusters including Avengers: Endgame. Theatrical release represents a huge slice of income that is difficult for studios to ignore. When a film’s big-screen run is finished, there is a second wave of income from digital and on-demand services this double-window revenue stream would disappear if multiplexes were taken out of the equation.“Studios are not releasing ‘tier one’ titles on PVOD,” said Richard Broughton, analyst at research firm Ampere. “It’s unlikely that PVOD will be able to replace theatrical revenues for these titles. PVOD releases would also likely cannibalise secondary windows. If you rent a film for £15.99, you’re not then going to rent it again for £5.99 a few months later. But you might do that if you had seen it at the cinema first.”There are also other issues making a total shift away from cinemas unlikely, for now at least. China, for example, along with many developing countries, has a tiny digital-video rental market, which would severely limit income from direct digital releases, whereas it boasts the world’s second-biggest cinema box office market, at $9bn a year.And with PVOD releases such as Trolls priced at $19.99, it is unlikely that the strategy will work outside high-income markets such as the US and the UK.However, coronavirus has sideswiped cinema chains, which means direct-to-digital successes such as Trolls give studios more leverage. “Trolls is operating under optimal conditions – lockdown, kids at home and limited competing media,” says Broughton. “Having said this, the success of Trolls does offer studios leverage with cinema owners for a greater share of box office income for secondary titles. The option of the PVOD window improves their positioning.”Unless Covid-19 causes longer-term closures or serious attendance issues in cinemas, the chains remain confident they will return to the top of the pecking order for film releases.“These circumstances will not persist and should not be taken by anyone as a sign of lasting change,” said Phil Clapp, chief executive of the UK Cinema Association, the national trade body for cinema operators.“We are absolutely confident that when cinemas are able to reopen safely, the public will once again respond to the unsurpassable big-screen experience. After people have been required to spend weeks and sometimes months in lockdown, it seems unlikely, to say the least, that the first response of many will be ‘let’s stay in and watch a film.’”But if audiences do decide to bypass cinemas and stay in, Hollywood studios will have to follow them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e02834a48bf272110f6e7db45a9b3eff5f582a48/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03060aa59b8db650656975f3523f09a4","title":"tell us about your ultimate holiday food recipe","story":"We want to know the recipe you use to recreate the experience of food, freedom and funWith holidays on hold for the foreseeable and cooking a rare lockdown joy, your culinary repertoire can be easily expanded by recalling dishes that bring back memories of happier times on trips away.

There has been much speculation over the future of key players such as De Bruyne if the ban stands, but the Belgium international said he trusted the club as they insist they have done nothing wrong and can get the ban overturned.“Once the decision is made, I will review everything. Two years would be long, but in the case of one year I might see.”Remove a European ban from the equation, and De Bruyne said he had no reason to want to leave Manchester, even if the likes of Real Madrid and Barcelona came knocking. “I play for one of the best teams in the world, play in England – for my competitive view the best competition – and I like that,” the 28-year-old said. “It remains a challenge to be the best and I need that too.”De Bruyne has three years remaining on his current City contract but Pep Guardiola will be entering the final year of his own deal next season.

Then his contract ends,” he said. “But I’m not going to let my decision depend on what Pep is doing.“Of course I have already worked with other trainers and when Pep leaves, I have to continue working with someone else. But I haven’t really paid much attention to that for the time being. There are more important things at the moment.”The Premier League has been suspended for seven weeks due to the coronavirus but De Bruyne said he was sure the season would be finished. “My feeling is that we may be able to train again within two weeks,” he said. “The government wants to restart football as soon as possible to give people something. Everything will be finished without fans, I think. That is not really interesting for anyone, but this season will be finished.“The financial aspect is far too important in the Premier League. If the season is not finished, it will cause serious problems.”Asked about comments from his City teammate Sergio Agüero, who said some players were scared to return because of the threat of the virus, De Bruyne said: “I don’t think people are really afraid for themselves, but for their family. That is mainly the problem for many people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d413c34189777fd0cfd1d44de85d2c95830b43e/0_169_2560_1535/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5e09713e81fd74ff773038f417c86d0","title":"premier league critics should recognise football cannot wait for ever","story":"The objections to restart plans are understandable and the game should pay attention, but ultimately clubs need to play games to surviveWith each week the plans become a little more refined and with each week any final decision is pushed back. Football may return, and this is how it may look if it does, but nobody is sure, and any proposed date can only be provisional. Which is as it should be. In an age that often favours decisiveness over the decision itself, there is something vaguely comforting about a process that accepts the wisdom of waiting.But in the background there is a crucial, nagging voice, and what it is saying is this: if football isn’t prepared to return, at least initially, in a form very different to the one it took before the virus, it may not return for a very long time – and for many clubs that means never.Various fan bodies, particularly in Germany, have protested about the prospect of football returning behind closed doors. The stand-out proposal from Friday’s Premier League meeting is for matches to be played at neutral grounds. The accusation is of the authorities and clubs acting not for reasons of sport but finance, a tension that has existed since the advent of professionalism 140 years ago. At some point, though, the two intersect.Football long ago abased itself before the capitalist altar and, while it would be preferable if more than lip service were paid to the idea the game has a community role, that it is not merely a business and didn’t exist simply to make the rich even richer, equally there has to be some realism.Clubs, however socially responsible, need revenue to survive. In Europe’s big five leagues, a high proportion of that revenue is derived from broadcasting rights and to generate that games need to be played.One of the reasons Dutch clubs seem to have reacted with relative equanimity to their government’s decision to ban all public events until at least 1 September is that the pressure from broadcasters in the Netherlands is nowhere near as intense. The outcry in France after a similar decision would almost certainly have been louder – and various clubs are considering their legal options – had a new, far more lucrative television deal not been beginning next season.There has also been a quasi-moral argument raised, that there is something distasteful about plotting a return to live sport when people are still dying in their hundreds by the day. And perhaps there is it’s easy to imagine how modern football’s combination of glitz and pettiness could jar with a general mood of sombreness.But it’s not to diminish the unique nature of the coronavirus crisis or the tragedy of those deaths to observe that all life goes on all the time against a background of mortality. At some point, as the risk of contagion recedes, lockdown will ease and some version of some variant of life will begin again.Judging that point is, of course, enormously difficult, and where football should lie on the list of priorities can be debated. But the two principal factors in making a decision must be safety and resources. Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200430-55296-gnl.fw.200430.jf.SpainFranceupdate.mp3 The Premier League statement on Friday notably emphasised that clubs “will only return to training and playing with government guidance, under expert medical advice and after consultation with players and managers”.What is clear is the clubs have no desire to make any call without official support and that there is no appetite on the part of the government to institute the sort of ban seen in the Netherlands and France. That football could be considering a return in Germany, Italy, Spain and England while suspended in two ostensibly similar neighbouring countries is bewildering, but given the easing of lockdown is necessarily a gradual process, perhaps it is only natural that different countries should have different concerns and take different steps first.Germany looks the country closest to a return, though the revelation of three positive tests at Cologne may affect those plans, perhaps before the end of this month.That at least gives the Premier League an example of what football may look like, that minimising the risk to players will be complicated and require sacrifice and discipline is clear. To a layman, frankly, the processes look baffling and overwhelming, and it is entirely understandable that players should be concerned – and fully involved in any decision – but it may be their acceptance is the only way football can return without a wait of several months that could devastate clubs.Then there is the matter of resources. The guidance suggests players should be tested two or three times a week. Even if the tests are sourced privately, that clearly should not happen until staff in hospitals and other key positions – in shops, on public transport, in schools – are being tested regularly.Equally, there will have to be medical and security staff on duty at stadiums. Again, that cannot happen if they would be better deployed elsewhere. Those are matters on which football can only wait.Using eight-to-10 neutral stadiums would seem a way of making the process more efficient: fewer arenas to adapt to the guidelines and keep clean, less risk of fans congregating. It is far from ideal but these are compromises that may have to be accepted for football to get under way again.And the vital point, perhaps, is this: that these measures may be necessary not only for this season but for next as well. Ending 2019-20 now, whatever method is used to determine positions and titles, promotion and relegation and European qualification, may resolve certain issues regarding contracts that are set to expire on 30 June, may allow prize money to be distributed (although probably not without legal challenges) and may answer some perceived need to be seen to be decisive, but the fundamental will remain: the virus will still be there.Whether football returns in June or September, or later even than that, it will be a long time before it is played in stadiums packed with crowds of tens of thousands, without players having to undertake complex social distancing measures. Normal isn’t coming back any time soon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/101846dcb4d1599fd14a421c040b692ec3c9631f/0_0_2952_1772/master/2952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8a0fd4f1344cd1adcc17474d112113c","title":"calling her lifts my spirits three parents on isolation away from their children","story":"As the UK remains in lockdown, parents share their stories about how they’re connecting with their children via technology …With much of the world in lockdown, staying connected with our loved ones has never been more important. Whether we’re checking in with a call, keeping ourselves entertained by taking part in online pub quizzes, or updating the family WhatsApp with our latest baking attempts, we have a burning desire to keep in touch. Our home broadband has gone from “nice to have” to the lifeline between us and the outside world.For some mums and dads who find themselves self-isolating away from their young children, this lifeline is critical. Here, three parents describe how they are managing to stay connected with their families from afar …Rosie: ‘I haven’t seen my son in four weeks’ “Dropping my son off with his father without knowing when I’m going to see him again was the most impossible thing I’ve ever had to do. And that feeling hasn’t lessened over all these weeks of self-isolation. My son is only three years old he’s so young. I feel ready to run out of here and scoop him up at any moment – to hell with it all.“I have to remind myself constantly why I have to take self-isolation so seriously. I’ve got bad asthma. So when my doctor advised that I stay indoors for 12 weeks, I decided it would be best for my son if he was with his dad, who has lots of outdoor space. We broke up in October, so I was only just getting used to the separation. And now this.“It’s been four weeks already, which is the longest I’ve ever been away from my son. FaceTime is essential, but it can be incredibly painful as well – I have to be positive because naturally I just want to burst into tears. I call him on my laptop as it has a bigger screen and his face is the normal size. At the end of the conversation he’ll hug the phone he’s using.“He recently showed me that he can now put his own socks on and told me that he’s being ‘independent’. He’s learned quite a few new words – I’m really proud of him. He’s also been collecting sticks and stones as presents for me when we’re reunited.“We talk at breakfast and dinner – it’s like how we used to sit around the family table, and he finds it entertaining to try to feed me bits of his food through the camera.“We’ve also had some family group calls – we had a lovely one with my sister and her son, my ex-husband and my son, and my dad and my stepmum. My son was playing the keyboard, and his cousin, who has just turned two, was dancing. It was so good!”Leo: ‘I had to isolate away from my daughter when I became ill’“When I started to feel ill a few weeks ago, with what I assume was coronavirus, my 12-year-old daughter was with her mum so it was easy for me to self-isolate.“As the illness took hold, I could do nothing but be in my bed. One bright part of the day, though, was FaceTiming my daughter, which isn’t something we did much previously. My ex and I share equal custody, so I’m used to seeing her every few days.“We’ve WhatsApped each other a lot, too. That way I got to check she was OK, what she was up to and, of course, my knowledge of emojis became fairly impressive.“My symptoms are now subsiding, but we feel it’s best that she stays at her mum’s until I’m completely clear, so the video calls have been such a help. We don’t have to talk every day, but knowing I can see her lifts my spirits. The distinctive sound of the FaceTime ringtone, and then seeing her face and that she looks so well, and isn’t bored or scared, makes this all much easier for me.“It has been very hard to be away from her especially because we don’t know when this is going to end. Several years ago I went to Brazil to work for a few weeks, but this will be the longest I haven’t been with my daughter. I know she is OK, though, and I know that right now she is in the best place with her fantastic mum, and in a wonderful home.“Loneliness, of course, comes into it, but weirdly with everyone in the same boat, you can sort of move away from thoughts of pure isolation. Knowing my daughter is only a video call away helps me so much.“We chat about what we’re doing, laugh about how mad we’re going, and I can put her mind at rest about any questions she has right now. We give each other a kiss on the camera, but we can also just sit in relative silence. She is painting a lot and during one call when I was ill and quite weak, she just got on with that while I watched and relaxed. That was lovely.”Mark: ‘We haven’t told my daughter I’m back in the UK yet’“I travel a lot for work and had recently spent a month in New Zealand away from my family – but when it began to look like everything was shutting down I decided to catch a flight back to the UK so I wouldn’t be stranded.“After discussing it with my wife, we decided that it would be best if I didn’t come straight back to the family home and – as a precaution – I would spend two weeks in isolation. I was very lucky that a good friend had moved in with his girlfriend during lockdown and he kindly offered me his flat to stay in.“However, this meant telling my little girl, who is seven years old, that I was still away. Although she doesn’t totally understand everything about what is going on, she knows enough that she’s been scared of things she’s heard on the news and fearful of us getting ill. So my wife and I decided we didn’t want to worry her even more.“Every day I FaceTime her as I normally would when I’m away, and it’s been a real lifeline for me to be able to see how she’s coping and reassure her that I’ll be home soon. We even watched a film together and her mum made her popcorn just like when we have family movie nights. Doing my best to pretend that everything is normal is the right thing for her, and it helps me cope with this awful situation too.“It’s really difficult to be away from my wife and daughter, especially when this is the time you want to be close to the people you love most in the world. Hopefully one day, when this is all over, we’ll be able to laugh together about how Daddy was hiding in a flat around the corner when she thought I was calling from New Zealand.”Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedWe know that now, more than ever, it is important for you to stay connected to your family.That’s why every day, we at Vodafone are working hard to maintain our network.

On ourselves, our relationships and what’s important to us. For some of us, that means reaching out to old friends, or healing old wounds with people we once thought we’d never speak to again. And in a way, the tech that helps us reconnect makes repairing those relationships easier: the screen gives us an element of safety, yet we can tap directly into those emotional connections we need to get us through this crisis.Here, three people who found isolation has had a positive effect on their relationships share their experiences – from building bridges, to creating the foundations for better communication, and reconnecting with family members they haven’t spoken to in years …Emma*: ‘Coronavirus gave me a reason to reach out to my brother’“I’d always had a good relationship with my brother, but it came crashing down last Christmas when my family discovered he’d been keeping his gambling addiction from us. He’d even taken money from Mum, and I was upset that he could put her through so much stress – I just couldn’t bring myself to speak to him. But after chatting to Mum over the past couple of weeks and hearing that he’d been helping her with food deliveries while she’s been in isolation, I decided to reach out. I sent him a text first and then he called me and we chatted about coronavirus and how we’ve been coping – a few days later, he FaceTimed me and gave me a tour of his new flat that I’ve never visited. I’d wanted to reach out to him before, but I was struggling to know how, so while lockdown is a very weird situation, it gave us both an excuse to push our differences to one side.“I also realised that life is too short – if my mum could move past what had happened, so could I. In fact, I’m probably speaking to him more now than I ever did before.”Michael: ‘Lockdown made me realise what’s important’“My ex-partner and I split a year ago and we share a young daughter, but our relationship has been really rocky ever since we broke up. We’d fight all the time and nasty words would be fired back and forth at each other over text message. But when the lockdown happened, it really made me take a step back and think about what’s important.“I reached out to her via text and also sent her some money for petrol, as she is driving our daughter between our two houses during this time – I wanted to make sure she knew I appreciated that she was helping me to see my daughter. It has felt like a real turning point for us and our relationship and it’s a really positive outcome from a situation that is out of our control. Now my daughter is with me and I’ve been sending my ex-partner pictures and we’ve been having civil conversations. Without this happening, I don’t know if we’d have ever reached this point.”Jo: ‘I’m connecting with family members I haven’t spoken to in years’“We have an extended family WhatsApp group made up of the descendants of my grandparents, both of whom sadly passed away recently. We used to use it every so often to share pictures from when people visited them, but over the years as inidual families grew, and as my grandparents got more frail, we didn’t have the same opportunities to gather together. And for some of the family, my only contact was an annual Christmas card. Since everyone has been staying at home for the past few weeks, though, the group has blown up with almost daily messages – pictures of the great-grandchildren doing their home school work, baking or learning to ride bikes without stabilisers in abandoned car parks.“My mum and dad both work in the NHS, with more than 60 years of service between them, so everyone shared videos from the 8pm clap for the NHS in recognition. And my brother, who’s a musician, livestreamed a gig on Facebook and lots of the family who’ve never had the opportunity to see him play before got to watch. It’s really lovely to feel connected to everyone, particularly as the two people that held us all together are no longer here.”Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedFamily has rarely felt more precious, nor has staying in touch with each other and the world.

We talk to some of the people thriving under lockdownYesterday morning I spent an hour doing a jigsaw puzzle, followed by a game of Scrabble, fortified by tea and scones. For once, there was no one I had to see and nowhere I had to be. The way we live now has split us in two. For introverts, it’s largely business as usual. But for my more extroverted friends, who are clamouring for Zoom calls to fill the gaping hole the pub has left in their lives, it’s a deeply testing time.I’m an introvert, which means I need time alone to recharge. This doesn’t mean I hate socialising, but it may well mean I will feel stressed and fatigued if I’m not left on my own for a while afterwards.On the flipside, extroverts are energised by time spent with other people and are often, though not always, more outgoing. In the 1960s the German psychologist Hans Eysenck suggested the reason behind this difference lies in our environmental sensitivity. Introverts need lower levels of stimulation to reach their “set point” of social arousal than extroverts, leading them to seek an escape into quiet solitude sooner.So it makes sense that we introverts are finding lockdown easier than our extroverted counterparts. They are struggling to reverse their behaviour, which I sympathise with – I can’t imagine what it would feel like to suddenly have to live life the other way round, with the government forcing me to socialise relentlessly. The thought of having to meet and talk to new people day and night without the possibility of withdrawing alone to recharge my batteries makes me feel nauseous.Natasha Tiwari, a psychologist with a practice in London, agrees that self-isolation plays to an introvert’s strengths, but notes the importance of recognising that introversion and extroversion exist on a fluid scale. It’s natural to find things tough, however you identify. “Introversion and extroversion are not binary concepts,” she says. “Many of us flick between them depending on our mood, environment and the people surrounding us. The key is to work out how to attain the right balance in your lifestyle to support your mental health.”In his 2011 paper on introversion, the American psychologist Jonathan Cheek argued that there are four main types of introvert: anxious, restrained, thinking and social – though overlap is normal. Anxious introverts struggle with shyness, often avoiding other people. Restrained introverts can enjoy socialising, but will stay in their shell until they feel comfortable. Thinking introverts are happy around others but are prone to daydreaming, and social introverts enjoy meeting friends but prefer to do so in intimate groups.I fall mostly into the last camp and always have done. I socialise one-on-one where possible. I relish a deep and meaningful conversation, but find the small-talk element of big gatherings tedious. You’ll find me on the dancefloor, but I won’t be asking 20 different people, “How’s work?” Being a social introvert means I am missing the injections of real-life connection that I carefully thread through my diary every few days. Technology isn’t quite doing it for me it feels too frenetic.I’m living with my extroverted mum who has been enjoying regular “prosecco hours” on Zoom, the soundtrack to which goes like this: “Where are you? Turn your camera on! Oh, there you are! Cheers darling! Oh, you’ve gone again! Unmute! Unmute!”I downloaded the Houseparty app, opened it up and immediately a friend’s face popped up to say hi, entirely unannounced. The horror has stayed with me.Cat Archer Underwood, 36, a brand consultant from Hampshire and an introvert, is learning more about herself. “I’ve had moments of utter peace, watching my husband and four-year-old daughter pottering about in the garden,” she says. “But I have been surprised at how I am feeling about the prospect of more weeks of this. I am dreaming of hosting barbecues, having a house full of laughing children and seeing people who aren’t quite friends but are more than strangers. I may be choosier about the events I force upon myself in the future, but I’ve learned that this introvert needs to party sometimes, too.”Others further along the introversion scale are finding their daily life has barely changed. English teacher Ellie Grout, 29, from Bristol, is one of them. “Self-isolation is similar to my normal experience,” she says. “The difference is that, for once, there is no pressure to arrange social events and no guilt about cancelling plans when I realise I want to stay at home.”Jemma Broadstock, 24, a virtual assistant from Derbyshire, is hopeful this lockdown will reveal the often overlooked strengths of introverts and help erode what Susan Cain, author of the 2012 bestseller Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking, dubs “the extroverted ideal”.“Business is thriving for me,” she says. “The idea of networking events has always felt overwhelming, but now people are holding them online and I’ve been finding new clients. When everything goes back to normal, I hope employers will offer more remote-working opportunities, as I feel much more confident in my own space. I am able to make valuable input when I would normally stay quiet.”Cain, a former Wall Street lawyer, went some way in challenging misconceptions that introverts are always shy, serious and aloof with nothing much to offer. In her book she extols “the man of contemplation” in a society that has “always favoured the man of action”. Yet nearly a decade after its publication, extroversion is still considered a model of success, especially in the workplace where what Cain describes as “the omnipresent belief that the ideal self is gregarious, alpha and comfortable in the spotlight” prevails.Working in an open-plan office, taking part in daily meetings, public speaking and networking are all activities that are geared towards the extrovert’s need for stimulation, while introverts struggle to make themselves seen and maintain their energy reserves.Our response to the coronavirus pandemic means that society has changed overnight, reshaped to suit a more introverted way of being – one that is rarely permitted – of thriving in a quiet setting, having time to think and be creative, and having control over how much socialising you do. No social experiment could have gone this far in modelling a way of living designed almost exclusively for introverts. It may just show employers that, as Cain says in her 2012 Ted talk, “when it comes to creativity and leadership, we need introverts doing what they do best.”“There is zero correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas,” she says. “And I mean zero. We could all stand to unplug and get inside our own heads a little more often.”Tiwari hopes that this episode of upheaval will cause a long-term shift in working culture that could not come soon enough for introverts. “Introverts often enjoy having their own space to process ideas and work undistracted,” she says. “The lockdown is proving that working from home and being in one’s own space is not to the detriment of wider business interests and can, in fact, lead to a boost in productivity and wellbeing.”Tiwari believes that extroverts and introverts can cope with this strange time together, so long as they respect their differences. “Being one or the other doesn’t preclude you from sharing interests and being cosy together,” she says. “It just means that you may need to be extra conscious of each other’s needs. Extroverts may be surprised at how much they enjoy this quieter time, while introverts may find themselves craving the company of others. Don’t overthink how you label yourself. Follow your intuitive sense for what you need right now.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

The desert retreats featured on these pages – the Glass Pavilion in Granada, Spain, and the Desert Courtyard House, the Desert Nomad House and the Levin Residence, all in Arizona – are an invitation to do just that.These desert retreats are designed to help their inhabitants feel a sense of peace through connection to nature. Situation and design combine to turn the poetic idea of the idyll into reality.Architects designing homes or retreats in remote locations, whether mountain, coast, lake, forest, river, plains or desert, may choose to evoke the sculptural and make their dwellings stand out against a canvas of land, sea or sky. But sometimes, in the desert, as elsewhere, the dwellings are carefully camouflaged, often at the owner’s behest in order to give nature its due supremacy, and they sometimes recycle earth, gravel or turf from the excavation of their plots. Many use local, natural materials, not only to reduce transportation costs and carbon footprint, but also to provide an organic sense of belonging to the terrain.In these unique desert dwellings, the watchword is not abundance but lack, and this lack is embraced by those who want total escape. A stay in the desert is a chance to experience a wilderness that is sometimes brutal – only the hardiest plants and animals can survive here. Not for the faint-hearted, a desert retreat is the diametric opposite of a cosy rural escape.The retreats featured here tap into the desert’s mythic status and possess an enigmatic quality. The vast blankness of the landscape provides an opportunity to practise serious abstraction: it is the perfect backdrop for bold, sculptural forms. Experiencing (and sometimes mitigating) the intense stimuli of desert immersion is the central idea behind many designs. The desert is harsh, and sometimes inhabitants need to withdraw into a protective shell. Interiors in these homes are cocooning, cave-like and cool – devoid of much fuss. Why bring endless stuff into the desert when the point of being there is to escape it all? These are not retreats for long stays, but are designed around sleeping, resting, meditating, cloud-watching and, of course, star-gazing.With scant resources, desert retreats must be sustainable, using solar power and passive heating and cooling, and the remoteness of some locations means that prefabrication is essential. Aesthetic intentions range from careful camouflage to experiments in industrial homage.Positioned to capture poetic moments – the way a mountainside reddens as the evening sun slides over it, or the first rays of dawn – many retreats here function as viewing apertures. The invitation is to arrive, switch off all distraction, and simply be, allowing your gaze to wander unchecked over the sublime emptiness.Living on Vacation: Contemporary Houses For Tranquil Living is published by Phaidon at £29.95.

Dwarfed by a gigantic landscape, visitors can lie back to watch shooting stars streak through a night sky unspoiled by light pollution. Designed by Slovenian studio OFIS Arhitekti, the Glass Pavilion began as a project that aimed to prove that glass can be used as a fully structural element. The glazing features a near-invisible coating that prevents the interior from overheating. The Y-shaped structure rests on a mirrored wooden platform.Designed by Wendell Burnette Architects, this luxurious, monolithic courtyard house is located in the Sonoran Desert. The house is built from rammed earth, concrete, glass and weathered steel, merging land, house and sky. A glass-floored bridge gallery hovers over the earth so inhabitants get a sense of the natural world. Steps lead down on to a terrace and a narrow infinity pool that draws the eye towards a mountain peak beyond. The alchemy of water, rocks and cacti appeals to mind and senses.Concealed within a forest of saguaro cacti in Arizona’s Tucson Mountains, the Desert Nomad House (Studio Rick Joy) is a cluster of three cuboid dwellings, each with its own function: sleeping, working, and relaxing. The rusted-steel boxes huddle within a natural bowl-like formation at the foot of the Tucson Mountains. Each one is arranged perfectly to give a ‘single aperture’ view of the desert landscape. The steel-plate exteriors glow burnt sienna in the setting sun and pick up rust-hued tones in the desert earth. Inside, the home is clad in warm, natural maple veneer and dotted with objets d’art.Designed by Ibarra Rosano Design Architects, the Levin Residence in Marana, Arizona, cantilevers over a sloping terrain, providing shelter for desert animals beneath the house. The home surrounds a courtyard with a pool and a deck with a freestanding black framework, which further focuses the views."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3742e3560c07ee9082aa6cf85665212420d6ba67/0_43_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=988df96b4a45fc3f025b11842ea664bc","title":"how we stay together i dont want to just be flatmates its got to be more than that","story":"For Julia and Paul Miller, carving out space for each other has been the key to maintaining their affection over almost three decades togetherNames: Julia and Paul Miller Years together: 29Occupations: Therapist and engineerHearing her future husband sing The Sound of Music’s My Favourite Things sealed the deal for Julia Miller.The couple were finalising their wedding preparations, a stressful time made worse because Julia’s father was in the final stages of cancer. She was steeling herself for the inevitable, when late one night she got a prank call. After telling the random caller exactly what she thought of him, she was upset and couldn’t get back to sleep. And so Paul sang his favourite song, about whiskers on kittens and raindrops on roses, to soothe her. “That’s the moment that I knew he was the one for me,” she says now.The Sydney couple will celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary in November. Yet when they first met, the then-21-year-old Julia wasn’t interested in Paul, who was 23.She’d just come out of a bad relationship and wasn’t looking for anything serious. A mutual friend decided she needed a fling to cheer her up, so she set the couple up, organising a group date on a yacht. Reluctantly Julia went along.But Paul was keen: “I thought she was hot when I saw her. I was interested right from the first second.” He was an experienced sailor so he hoped to impress her, even feigning a dangerous moment that he skilfully navigated. Julia remained oblivious. Undeterred, the mutual friend nudged them into a second date. And this time, when just the two of them went to the movies, it was more successful. “That’s when I thought ‘I like what he looked like, but actually I really like him. He’s a nice guy.’”At the time Paul was living in Newcastle and Julia was in Sydney, but they spent as much time together as they could. They bonded over their similar upbringings and shared values and quickly realised they were right for each other. After six months they moved in together in Sydney. They were keen to get engaged too, but were conscious that others may think they were rushing. “I’ve still got the piece of paper where Paul wrote the plan of when we were going to get engaged, because he’s like that,” says Julia. Paul adds their courtship was “pretty quick” by “2020 standards”… “but I think in the late 80s it wasn’t probably too ridiculous.”The lead-up to the wedding was stressful. Not only was Julia’s father battling cancer, their priest was unwell with a brain tumour and a close family member died suddenly. Then three days before the wedding, Julia went to pick up her dress only to find her dressmaker was ill and not even close to finishing it, or the bridesmaid dresses. In a mad dash, Julia roped every woman she knew to finish the dresses in time for the wedding day. “I got an ulcer. I definitely got cold sores the day before. But I lost a lot of weight so I was really skinny,” she says with a laugh.The day itself went smoothly but all the stress taught the couple an important lesson. Julia says they learned “early in the piece how we would go through bad times together.”Young, happy and in love, the first few years of their marriage was fun. They saved hard and travelled. About four years into their marriage, they had their first daughter. Things got trickier around the arrival of their second child. “When you have just one child it doesn’t affect you so much, but when you have a second one and each of you have to share the load a little bit more, it probably separates you a little bit more than you’re first used to,” remembers Paul.They made an effort to spend as much time together as possible. It was something Julia had learnt from her own parents. “They’re the sort of people who had to make sure that they had time to themselves so to a certain extent they pushed the kids away,” says Paul. “A lot of that rubbed off on Julia, so she made sure that our kids didn’t get in between us. So I think that’s been a positive in our relationship.”They were always careful to maintain affection. “My mum and dad were really, really affectionate,” says Julia. “I think when I first met Paul he was affectionate, but he wouldn’t kiss me in public. It took him a little while, and now I find he’s probably worse than me,” she laughs.Both were determined to make it work. Julia in particular wanted a great marriage, not just a mediocre one. “I thought, ‘I don’t want to just be together because of the kids,’ or, ‘I don’t want to just be flatmates.’ It’s got to be more than that.” She says if it had come to it, she wouldn’t have stuck around. “It’s just too sad. It’s too sad to be living in a loveless marriage.”One of their biggest challenges came when Paul became very involved with sailing, spending huge amounts of time on it, to the exclusion of everything else. Julia made it clear things had to change. “That was probably our biggest hurdle, that was a couple of years and the girls were young-ish. But I remember one of my daughters saying, ‘All you do is argue’ … I just could not get him to understand how I felt about it.”It’s something that Paul recognises in himself: “One of my problems is that I focus too much and I have blinkers. I can’t see everything else going on in my life, but that’s where we’re a good couple together because we are very good at adapting ... I don’t think either of us are really stubborn, so we tend to be able to adapt to either bring the other back onto the right path or to, when required, stay calm and live with it.”What saved them was renovating their house, working shoulder to shoulder each weekend. It was another important lesson for the couple. “You’ve got to have projects together,” says Paul.Over the years, their approach to conflict has evolved. Where Paul usually avoids conflict, Julia prefers to deal with it straight away. “He now is starting to say, ‘I’m sorry, I didn’t realise that I was hurting you. Do you need to discuss it?’” And a lot of the time I go, ‘No, I’m fine. Because you validated it.’”They were never afraid to disagree in front of their two girls. Both had grown up in homes where their parents didn’t appear to argue, so when there was an argument, it would cause undue anxiety. Instead they wanted their children to see them disagree, resolve and move on.There was something else. For Julia, as a girl growing up surrounded by brothers, she had to learn to speak up for herself. She wanted her girls to learn that too. “I needed my girls to feel they could have a voice. My daughters will still say, ‘Good on you, Mum’s standing up to Dad.’ Not that Dad’s a pushover, but it’s to say, ‘Don’t let a man dominate you.’ For me that was important for the girls to see, that you can say what you think and not have to be pleasing all the time.”These days both daughters are adults and have moved out of home. Julia and Paul are enjoying their time together, not least because they still have much in common. “We’ve got friends who go, ‘Oh, I love the way you do things together,’ I think, ‘Yeah, because we’ve kind of kept at it,’” says Julia.

Try distracting yourself with online dates, box sets and classic novelsThe dilemma Several months ago my partner of five years left me very suddenly. He’d gone abroad to work, but as far as I knew everything was fine. I even had flights booked to go and visit. The break-up was a huge shock that left me in a low place. After a few weeks I felt I was beginning to come out of the fog and start moving on with my life, going out and seeing friends, going to classes, etc, but then the lockdown was imposed. Being shut away in my flat all day, alone with my thoughts, I seem to be going backwards.I’m very aware that we are in the middle of a global crisis and it’s awful for everyone. Luckily, I’m in a good position regarding pay and I’m not paying rent, so I really don’t have any reason to complain. However, all I can think about is my ex. It’s driving me a little bit mad. Do you have any advice on dealing with non-Covid-related troubles during this crisis? Talking to others about it is hard, and I don’t want to make it all about myself.Mariella replies That’s a pandemic for you! This insidious, headline-hungry virus doesn’t detract from the very real dilemmas that each of us will be confronting, but it does reduce our airtime for complaint. Big issues, such as how to survive economically and even physically, can be a compelling distraction from more mundane meditations, but that doesn’t make the minutiae of daily existence any less of a hardship. I’ve noticed that the less stress-inducing activity there is going on in our lives, the faster smaller concerns expand to fit the allotted space.The enormity of Covid-19 fears may dwarf our day-to-day dilemmas, but it doesn’t make what we are feeling any less relevant or painful. For some people, their biggest issues lie within their own four walls (the rise in domestic violence is a particular concern), for others the dangers are less immediate. Either way, few are entirely carefree.Whether it’s regrets and fears, vivid dreams or sudden contact from the very-much-alive ghosts of our past, this virus is playing as much havoc with our subconscious as it is with the economy. The mental flotsam and jetsam bobbing by in the deep of night – and even in our daydreams – can be overwhelming.It’s been fascinating to watch the highlights reel of my five-plus decades played out in my mind during these weeks of isolation. I presume I’m not alone in waking up from unexpected erotic nightmares or moments of particular passion or pain, dreams of contagion and euphoria, angst over abandoned friendships and pernicious thoughts about those lost over the years… I’m getting more sleep than usual, but I’m not sure it’s what you’d describe as restful as my mind relentlessly pounds the pavements of my past.Dreams during lockdown feel more like they spring from the imaginations of the likes of JG Ballard and Isabel Allende – not little old humdrum me. The sheer unexpected nature of where my unconscious takes off to is unsettling in itself. Daytime, too, with so many manual chores and so little mental stimulation, is provoking all kinds of extraordinary and unexpected emotional memory drifts. I’m sure I’m not alone in hearing from people I thought I’d never see again and, as a result, am reliving events I’d presumed were firmly consigned to the past.Thoughts of your ex are surfacing just as they might be expected to, and without the distraction of daily life it’s hard to shrug off such melancholic meanderings.I heard an item the other day about online dating, where even the dates are now happening via apps and on other platforms. It seems to me an excellent way to distract yourself. Either you will end up with a tale to recount to your friends that will amuse and distract you all or, as you check out prospective candidates, you might even find one worth downloading into your real-world contacts to be pursued when the lockdown is over.Being preoccupied with thoughts of your ex is predictable and unavoidable, but minimising the time you have to languish over them is in your power. There are three seasons of Ozark to watch, five of Peaky Blinders, there are documentaries on plastic in our oceans and Trump’s rise to power. There’s the pulse-racing dramatisation of Jeanine Cummins’s American Dirt to listen to on BBC Sounds, and a whole eternity of other books that you can finally get around to reading.My go-to tomes for romantic possibility are from the Australian writer Tim Winton, but Ann Patchett does a good line in the triumph of hope over adversity, too. Limit the time for thoughts of your ex and you’ll gradually reduce his hold on your imagination.A few months is a short time to recover from five years together, so look on lockdown as an opportunity to heal and don’t battle too hard against thoughts that will eventually fade. Our brains are in some ways similar to our bodies. We can’t remake them, but we can certainly train them to behave better. Try disciplining and inspiring yours to be a little less active where lost love is concerned and more proactive about where you’re off to next.• Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

The marketing model that makes up most of an influencer’s income is falling apart, with brands pulling out of lucrative sponsorship deals and advertising revenue plummeting. As we face a new economic era, it is unclear whether the aspirational lifestyle lauded by influencers can emerge unscathed. Could coronavirus provoke a reconfiguration of the influencer age?Payment for posts reflected this – businesses pay influencers with more than a million followers $10,000 or more for a one-off post endorsing their product.Yet despite creating an innovative new model that defined a digital era, the influencer industry was not without its issues. A saturation of social media marketing recently led to backlash, with many stars being forced to refocus their brand to appear more authentic after fears that they were alienating their fans with heavily posed and paid-for posts. High-profile scandals also rocked the industry, such as the Gabriel Grossman and Marissa Casey Fuchs “surprise” social-media proposal, which the Atlantic uncovered as having been pitched to brands, heavily staged and sponsored, and the now infamous Fyre festival which saw influencers being paid thousands of dollars to promote an event that had barely been organized and left attendees stranded on a beach in the Bahamas.2020 should have been the year for influencers to get back to their followers’ desire for “realness”. Instead, because of Covid-19, many influencers are being forced to focus on simply surviving 2020’s economic downturn rather than taking the chance to grow their businesses.“Due to the disruption in business operations a lot of companies are facing financial challenges,” explains Shane Barker, a digital strategist who offers consultancy services for companies using social media to boost their brand, and influencers hoping to reach the right brands and monetize their follower count. “In light of that, they are cutting down on all unnecessary expenses. Some are barely able to pay their employees, let alone hire influencers.”One of Shane’s clients, Chris Ruden, is a bodybuilder and amputee who uses his platform to share content on overcoming adversity. As one of many influencers who relies on speaking engagements and events to make up some of his income, Ruden has already experienced disruption as a result of coronavirus measures.While some popular influencers have attracted death threats after sharing images of glamorous trips despite social distancing measures, Barker believes that more sensitive content is crucial in order for influencers to future-proof their brand.“Influencers should create content that resonates with the current situation that people are in,” he says. “This does not mean that influencers from all industries should just start writing and talking about the pandemic. What I mean is that they should create content relevant to their niche, but keeping in mind what people are going through.”“I’ve always loved sharing workouts and healthy recipes, so for me it’s been more of an adaption,” she says. “People want to see home content right now as it’s relatable and we are all in the same boat. With more eyes now online, people are scrolling more than ever, so actually, as long as it’s fitting, authentic and tasteful, now is a great time to work with influencers.”Some even believe that this renewed awareness of authentic versus paid posts and the shift away from brand promotion is a good thing.“Biased product reviews were threatening to poison the well as people started to become disenchanted with self-serving influencers who had lost their objectivity,” says Michael Solomon, marketing professor and author of Social Media Marketing. “Where possible, influencers need to revert to a more altruistic message and find ways to help get through the crisis with constructive suggestions. In times of instability, people look to trusted sources and those that deliver will be remembered after the crisis is over.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c392de0a71b0b7087860c5d630ff1dfecfde60a8/0_33_1077_646/master/1077.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1fc95cbf2e6b666c9bccd4de7e88b97","title":"youtube deletes coronavirus conspiracy theorist david ickes channel","story":"Icke’s account was terminated for violating policy on spreading coronavirus disinformationThe video-sharing site said the 68-year-old violated its policies on sharing information about coronavirus.The former footballer has made controversial unproven claims about the virus on several internet platforms, including one that it is linked to the 5G mobile network.The video service, which is owned by Google, told the BBC: “YouTube has clear policies prohibiting any content that disputes the existence and transmission of Covid-19 as described by the WHO and the NHS.“Due to continued violation of these policies we have terminated David Icke’s YouTube channel.”The ban follows a similar move by Facebook, which removed Icke’s page on Friday.Well-known medics and broadcasters including Dr Christian Jessen and former junior doctor Adam Kay have called on social networks to remove Icke from their platforms.They are backed by the Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), which claims Icke’s conspiracies over Covid-19 have been viewed more than 30m  times.The CCDH asked for other networks to follow the lead, and added: “It is time for Instagram and Twitter to follow Facebook and YouTube by acting to remove Icke and his content from their platforms.“Lies cost lives in a global pandemic, and their failure to act promptly puts us all at risk.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14f67f00dd3e2bb4443321d69fac80070c243b21/0_72_2823_1694/master/2823.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9877a99f38596513460beaea01fda995","title":"coronavirus travel advice refund change summer holiday rights","story":"The pandemic has left thousands of holidaymakers out of pocket. Here’s a guide to your rightsThe effects of the coronavirus crisis have been felt everywhere, but one of the hardest hit sectors has been the holiday industry. With resorts closed and all but essential journeys banned in countries across the world, 2020 looks set to be the year that travel was put on hold.Less than two months into the pandemic, thousands of holidays, honeymoons, backpacking trips, cruises, and city breaks have either been cancelled, or look like they will be.The shutdown has left hundreds of thousands of consumers out of pocket, in some cases by more than £20,000. It has also left the travel industry fighting to survive. Here, we try to navigate you through the chaos.No. But that hasn’t stopped airlines doing exactly that. All flights on EU carriers within, or heading into the EU, and all flights leaving from an EU airport, are protected by “denied boarding” rules, which require a full refund in seven days when flights are cancelled.The problem is that enforcing these rights is proving very difficult. Many airlines are making it near impossible to get refunds in the hope that customers will reschedule or accept vouchers instead.After initially promising to reimburse consumers within 20 working days, Ryanair has now said they should accept vouchers valid for 12 months, which it will then refund if not used by the end of the year. Alternatively, it says customers can wait until the “crisis has passed” for a refund.Refunds at British Airways are being processed only by customer services, which is proving difficult to contact. It’s a similar story across the sector, and the regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, has so far declined to intervene. Airlines have asked the EU to suspend the rules and allow vouchers instead, although it is hard to see how this could be applied retrospectively.Accepting replacement vouchers is risky. While Ryanair looks safe, some airlines have already collapsed and others, including Norwegian, are in bailout talks.Coby Benson, a solicitor at the specialist flight compensation firm Bott and Co, says the law is on the side of cash refunds. He advises customers to submit their refund request using the following text:There is evidence that passengers have been getting refunds – but only after very long waits.If the airline does not respond or refuses to comply, you can issue small court proceedings or use the Alternative Dispute Resolution. You will need the airline’s address, which can usually be found online.Benson says all claims for flights that started or ended in the UK can be heard in Britain’s courts. The other option is to approach your bank card provider (see below).Amazingly, several airlines are still running flights in and out of UK airports, meaning the trip is not cancelled.Richard Colbey, a barrister at Lamb Chambers, says the fact that it is currently illegal to go on holiday to, say Lisbon, means that the contract between the passenger and the airline can be deemed to be “frustrated”. In such cases a refund is due, although the customer may have to resort to the courts to get the money.The easier option for many will be to claim on travel insurance. Because the government advised against all but essential travel, policies should pay cancellation claims provided you bought it before the pandemic was declared on 11 March.Package tour operators are required to refund customers within 14 days when a trip is cancelled. However, in many cases refunds have been denied and holidaymakers told they must rebook or accept vouchers.Your replacement voucher or new booking is protected by the government-backed Atol scheme in the event that the tour operator collapses before the trip is taken.If a refund is not offered, write to the travel firm stating that you want one under the terms of the package travel and linked travel arrangement regulations 2018, stressing that you will not accept vouchers. If have lost your job or income, ask to be moved to the front of the queue.Travel insurers will not pay out when the tour operator is legally obliged to refund and is still trading.The next big date in the holiday calendar is 25 May, the start of half-term in some parts of the UK, but trips look unlikely to go ahead. For those planning DIY trips, it seems highly unlikely that European countries will be accepting guests – France said this week its beaches would remain closed until June.If you are due to travel and your trip is yet to be cancelled, the advice is to do nothing. If the Foreign Office continues to advise against all but essential travel, your tour operator will have cancel and a full refund will be due.Even if you have no intention of travelling, do not cancel the holiday yourself as you will lose your booking and the possible refund. It is a similar story for UK trips. Whether these will happen will depend on the lockdown measures still in place. Holiday cottages in Cornwall, for example, may technically be accessible in May and June. But will the government allow such travel?The company is offering fee-free cancellations for those who booked their trips before 15 March and planned to check in before the end of May. Stays starting on 1 June onwards, and those booked after 15 March, currently carry the normal cancellation terms, unless you are ill and can show that there are extenuating circumstances. Airbnb is constantly changing its terms, so check for the latest updates.P\u0026ampO is still running its services and therefore is not cancelling, although its would-be passengers clearly cannot use the service during the lockdown. It is only offering vouchers, which have to be used for future bookings.Many owners have offered alternative dates later in the year, which could be a very attractive option come August, but this will not suit everyone.On 23 March the government ordered all holiday accommodation to close, except in a few circumstances. Until the ban is lifted, bookers can insist on a refund, arguing that the contract was deemed to be frustrated. You can expect a battle, if our mailbag is anything to go by, but the competition regulator has warned firms that they could face legal action if they do not refund customers.This is a conundrum lots of people are facing. Generally, the advice is to pay the balance owed, because if you do nothing you are deemed to have cancelled and will lose the deposit.If the holiday is subsequently cancelled you will get all your money back. This week easyJet Holidays said customers who had paid deposits on trips this summer could use them next year. Other operators may follow suit, so it is worth asking if you would like to delay a year.Ultimately, consumers are going to have to consider their financial situation. If you paid a deposit of £50 on a £2,000 cruise that you now have no intention of taking, you would probably be better off accepting the £50 loss than paying the rest and fighting to get it back.Those with good-quality (expensive) annual or single policies bought before the virus was declared a pandemic have the best chance of receiving a payout. However, insurers will not be paying out where the tour operatorairline simply refuses a refund or offers vouchers instead. Most policies bought after 11 March will not offer any Covid-19 related claims.If your airline collapses before your departure, half of policies – those with scheduled airline failure cover – should compensate customers. If you have to cancel a holiday in, say, September because you were due to take elderly parents – and they have been advised by the governmentdoctor against travelling – this claim should succeed, provided you bought the policy and holiday before March.If your legitimate claim is turned down, the Financial Ombudsman Service can adjudicate your dispute free of charge. There are signs that some travel insurers will be rejecting claims and hoping the claimants give up. Do not.Consumers who bought their trips using bank cards do have two other avenues to go down if they are denied a refund – a chargeback or a section 75 claim.Where there has a been a breach of contract – the holidayflight has been not provided – you can ask your bank to reverse the payments. There is no legal obligation on the bank to process a chargeback, and the retailer can object, but consumers have had success with them in the past. If your online travel agent, in particular, will not deal with your refund, a chargeback is worth trying.Section 75 claims are a legal obligation and make the credit card firm jointly liable for the service bought, provided it cost more than £100 and you bought it directly from the provider. If the airline goes bust and you bought the ticket from it directly, the credit card provider has to refund you.The problem is the banks are reluctant to process section 75 claims in the best of times, and there have been reports of some refusing to process them in the current climate. When things finally calm down we suspect many passengers will be forced down this route.You can. Whether it is wise to is another matter. The safer trips to book are probably in self-contained accommodation that will not require much social mixing. Self-guided walking or cycling trips may be possible. But it is unclear whether countries will be allowing tourists in.It’s probably worth waiting to see how the lockdown measures are to be eased. Once that becomes clear, expect a flurry of bookings, particularly for UK-based accommodation. If you do want to go abroad, ferries could be a better option than flying.House swapping could be an answer to our holiday needs as families look for a change of scene. Exchanging homes would allow the physical isolation that may still be required. It is also (almost) free.The ’s home exchange service is an excellent starting point and is very strong on UK exchanges. A six-month plan costs £35. Homeexchange is good for international swaps but it costs $150 a year to be a member. There are a host of other sites that connect people looking to swap.

Last year, Thompson joined young food ambassadors and the Children’s Right2Food campaign at Downing Street to call for an independent children’s food watchdog to help alleviate food poverty and monitor childhood nutrition. A year later, the government has yet to provide an official response.“It is difficult to accept, and for some even difficult to believe that there are still children going hungry in this rich and largely competent nation. But there are millions,” writes Thompson. “What is undeniable is that our government has yet to extend real lifelines to those who cannot afford food. We need emergency income support to put money in the pockets of families who are suffering.”Anna Taylor, executive director of the Food Foundation, called on the government to implement an emergency income support scheme and for child benefits to be doubled and paid fortnightly.She said: “The government needs to move fast to protect vulnerable children and make them a priority. Having access to a nutritious diet is a basic human right. Struggling families need money in their pockets now and we need government to look urgently at income support and child benefits to provide solutions.”“It’s really tough. Dad works as a restorer and mum stays at home but there are nine of us under 18 in the house all the time now: three in primary school, two in high school, one in sixth form and three little ones. We have to be more resourceful about what we’re eating – simpler things like pasta and pizza and fish fingers that are easier and cheaper to cook.“There are no snacks or treats and the little ones are finding it harder, they’re not used to food being rationed. Trying to keep everyone balanced and happy is really hard at the moment. Fruit and veg isn’t the main thing Mum and Dad are worried about, they’re trying to just give us the main meals.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/078ec5797bda8ffe32078afea6b5f5c51a78b940/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d55f419f222f4e1ce93bf6e94481a1bc","title":"officials hopeful of racing resuming in near future after talks","story":"Senior officials are optimistic about prospects of a return to racing in the near future, following an important week of talks with government figures.While much hinges on the national lockdown exit plan, racing’s bosses found ministers open to their message that the sport is well placed to resume within days of any ease in restrictions and to be the first major sport back in action. There remains a chance of racing behind closed doors within the next fortnight but trainers say they have not heard from the British Horseracing Authority about the earliest possible date for a return, with Friday 15 May understood to be the day.The BHA has declined to say anything about this week’s meetings, when its chief executive and chair, Nick Rust and Annamarie Phelps, met the sports minister, Nigel Huddleston, while the BHA’s chief medical officer, Dr Jerry Hill, was at an all-sports summit with officials from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport on Friday. But one well-connected source said the mood was “getting hopeful” in the aftermath of those talks.However German racing has cancelled its planned return at Dortmund on Monday after failing to secure approval. In Ireland it remains unclear whether racing can resume from 18 May or 29 June, a difference hinging on interpretation of the phased return outlined by Leo Varadkar on Friday.When British racing returns, it is expected it will be under tightly controlled conditions. “I know Jerry Hill has been working tirelessly within racing and with other sports at pulling together what measures are needed and establishing the relevant protocols,” said Paul Struthers, the chief executive of the Professional Jockeys Association.“I think there’s widespread confidence in Dr Hill within our ranks, and complete confidence from the PJA in Jerry and his colleagues working on racing’s return, that when we do return it will be as safe as it possibly can be for all the people putting the show on the road.“But equally, jockeys can take inidual decisions if it’s something they’re not comfortable with or if they have personal circumstances where they want to minimise the risk of their exposure to coronavirus. You might have someone whose partner is well into pregnancy, for example.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d652243b8c700e7baa88ce81398ca199fc217107/264_0_4680_2807/master/4680.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d78c78f3bf95eb99ba9f7c84707c7a09","title":"tommy fleetwood not living my life to finish second golf","story":"The world No 10 is philosophical about the Tour’s planned return in June and has been making the most of his downtimeWhether golf has mislaid its moral compass is a source of rising debate. The PGA Tour’s effort to return in mid-June – assisted in no small part by the US president – has onlookers pondering if this is all too much, too soon.Tommy Fleetwood can still be counted among those leading players who retain their perspective. He freely admits golf should have a place while being thankful he does not have to decide precisely where that may be.“Sport is great for society and as a motivational thing for people,” he says. “Life can be boring without sport on TV, but the reality has always been real-life heroes are the ones who save lives. That has really been shown up over the past few weeks. Certain sporting occasions can be important as light at the end of the tunnel but the safety of people should and will come first.”If the PGA Tour does restart as planned, with the Charles Schwab Challenge in Fort Worth, Texas, Fleetwood will have plenty to weigh up. Travel restrictions from and back to his base in the north-west of England for one. So, too, where golf sits in the Covid-19 mass-testing chain.Fleetwood cannot be counted among those immensely frustrated by lockdown. The 29-year-old has revelled in being with his family, away from the rush of the tour. Initially he was reticent to admit as much. “I was conscious not to sound too positive about it all, but after a while I thought it was hard enough for everyone and there shouldn’t be a problem stating that you’re happy. The time we are getting together is amazing.“I’ve done some really nice work. My body feels good, I’m rested, I’ve been doing work with my psychologist and speaking to my coaches. I’ve had time to read and think.”The hiatus has brought fresh fame to another member of his team. Ian Finnis, Fleetwood’s caddie, achieved social-media stardom after raising £135,000 for fellow bagmen who may be adversely affected by the pandemic. Finnis organised a raffle of golf memorabilia, with Fleetwood one of many high-profile donors.“I think he was more surprised than anyone at how well it went,” Fleetwood says. “He is the type of person to give someone the last fiver in his pocket if they needed it. What he did was amazing and I know how much effort he put in. He just pushed and pushed after setting his mind to it. I’m proud of him.”Fleetwood’s calm was disturbed once in the past fortnight. Nobody who observed the distraught Englishman after the final round of last year’s Open will readily forget the sight. He had refused all offers to look back on his round played in the company of Shane Lowry, to whom he was runner-up at Royal Portrush, until now.“There have been a lot of reruns since and I never wanted to watch it. I’d tell people to turn it off or say I wasn’t watching. It hurt a lot, it hurt to the pit of my stomach watching it. I could remember the feelings and watching it was almost worse because I couldn’t even keep my mind on playing. But I saw Shane talking to his team, waiting to go to the presentation, and he said: ‘That’s the best feeling ever,’ to someone. I wrote that down from watching it I thought: ‘I want that.’ Wouldn’t anyone want that?”Fleetwood articulates his level of despair – finishing second in the Open is hardly disastrous – perfectly. “When I was seven, I wanted to win the Open. I left the course that Saturday night, driving back with my family … the dream you’ve had for 20-odd years is very close. It went when I double-bogeyed 15 on Sunday, it was still there until then.“That might be the closest I ever get, but I can say: ‘You know what, I had a dream when I was a kid and I played in the Sunday of an Open in the last group with a chance of achieving it.’ But I’m not living my life to finish second. I don’t live in a bubble where I weep about being second in the Open but second isn’t what I’m striving for. I don’t think I’ve reached my potential yet.”If Portrush stung, Fleetwood left the 2018 Ryder Cup in Paris as one of the players of the moment. It remains highly doubtful this year’s version, scheduled for Whistling Straits, will take place. He has added his voice to the chorus against a joust between Europe and the USA taking place without spectators.Golf as a whole will undergo inevitable change. In the midst of that, Fleetwood will see a broader picture."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe5bfbe6eb3a3a9a055e1802f0536dbb399e84ec/0_150_4513_2708/master/4513.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e227eb08b453be7afa09b2cbbcfcf84","title":"moderate becoming good my journey to every place in the shipping forecast","story":"From Fair Isle to German Bight, Charlie Connelly has visited all 31 sea areas, but still finds the poetry of the daily radio odyssey mesmerisingThe shipping forecast is probably the closest thing we have in the modern age to a national epic. The institution’s rhythms and rituals have changed little since it was first broadcast on New Year’s Day 1924: there is poetry in the daily litany and mystery in its terminology. “The radio’s prayer,” Carol Ann Duffy called it. For Seamus Heaney it was “a sibilant penumbra”.The forecast reminds us we’re a maritime nation and its map binds us to our continent, covering not only our own coasts and waters but an area extending from Norway to Portugal to Iceland. There is democracy in its geography, where tiny Fair Isle carries as much heft as mighty Biscay while Lundy, a sliver of rock in the Bristol Channel, is equal in importance to the Irish Sea. And from the salty old seadog in his brine-encrusted fishing boat to the merchant banker on his yacht, the shipping forecast, all seafarers are equally reliant on it.Of the four daily broadcasts by BBC Radio 4 on behalf of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, my favourite is in the early morning. Usually this one goes out at 05.20, but in our current emergency it’s broadcast at 05.33, those 13 minutes representing the only significant schedule shift since the service was suspended altogether during the second world war. Before this, no disaster, no crisis and certainly no Test match climax had shunted the iron horse of the schedule from its position.While many prefer the cosy, late-night feel of the 00.48 forecast, all soothing nocturnal intimacy and somnolent talk of “falling slowly”, for me you can’t beat being roused from sleep by the familiar rhythmic intonation of the pre-dawn broadcast. Every morning I’m coaxed awake by a meteorological gazetteer of familiar names – Tyne, Dogger, Fisher – and cryptic crossword clues of forecast detail, on the face of it impenetrable but actually fairly straightforward. First there’s the wind and its direction and predicted strength according to the Beaufort Scale, north-westerly five or six, followed by the weather conditions, rain later, and finally the visibility, good becoming moderate.There’s reassurance in regularity. The forecast always progresses in the same order around its 31 sea areas, beginning with Viking off the coast of Norway and moving broadly clockwise, zigzagging across the North Sea, along the Channel, turning south towards the Iberian peninsula then tracing the Atlantic fringe back up to south-east Iceland.For those not out at sea, it’s a journey to fire the imagination without lifting your head from the pillow, a 31-stop tour better measured in duvet togs than kilometres, an odyssey in the mind through familiar places – Dover, Hebrides, Wight – and locations that seem to defy conventional mapping: Fisher, Sole, North Utsire.Not many people can say they’ve been to Utsira. I have. North and south. (The island off south-west Norway has been officially spelled with an “a” since 1924, though neither North or South Utsire appeared in the shipping forecast until they were introduced in 1984.) Reached by a heaving, churning 70-minute ferry ride across some of the most tempestuous waters in northern Europe, Utsira wears its forecast fame lightly. Not many places are namechecked on the BBC eight times a day, but forecast familiarity hasn’t inspired a flood of visitors. When I explained to the captain of the ferry why I was there (he’d assumed that, with Utsira boasting Norway’s widest variety of avian life, I must be a birdwatcher) he blinked a couple of times, said “OK”, and climbed back up to the wheelhouse.By chance I happened to be there the weekend Utsira’s football club was holding its annual knees-up, and I wangled an invite. Fielding a team from a population of a little over 200 is achievement enough, but the impressive collection of trophies I saw in a cabinet suggested that on the football field at least, Utsira was punching above its weight.I’ve now travelled to, or through, all of the shipping forecast’s 31 sea areas, which means the daily broadcast invocation conjures up my night on the lash with Ustira’s footballers, along with many other faces and places to which I can return without getting wet.In area Thames, for example, I was lucky enough, after a six-month visa application process, to visit the Principality of Sealand, since 1967 a self-declared independent nation on a former British gun emplacement in the North Sea. The platform on two vast concrete legs eight miles off Harwich looks like a North Sea Stonehenge. Arriving was unforgettable: Prince Michael of Sealand himself escorted me out there on a royal RIB and the micro-nation remains the only country in the world I’ve been winched into. Once I was through immigration, the pizza delivery leaflet pinned to a corkboard represented one of the greatest examples of optimism I’ve ever seen.I’m convinced that wherever you go, however unpromising or uninspiring a place might appear, you’ll always find something to make the visit worthwhile: a quirky piece of local history perhaps, or someone with a hell of a story to tell. It’s a theory that has served me well wherever I’ve been – and I’ve been to Stevenage – and has only failed me once.Shipping forecast area Fisher widens into the North Sea from a small stretch of the west coast of Jutland, northern Denmark. The only place to visit is the port of Hanstholm, where I spent a long weekend. A really long weekend during which I found nothing to do and nothing to see. Nobody hangs around Hanstholm they roll off the overnight ferry from Norway and head straight off. Not me. My weekend there must have come close to contravening the part of the Geneva Convention dealing with sensory deprivation. To give you an idea, according to someone I spoke to, the name Hanstholm is derived from an old Norse word meaning “islet of the glove”. The story goes that many years ago a woman once dropped a glove there.Fortunately the broadcast sweeps me past Fisher and on to other memories, other places I can revisit without leaving home. There was the time in Galicia when I sat for hours and watched the sun set over the Atlantic from the tip of Cape Finisterre – from finis terrae, the end of the earth, a holy place since way before Christianity. It gave its name to the sea area until 2002, when the Met Office renamed it FitzRoy to avoid confusion with the French and Spanish forecasts, whose Finisterre is of different dimensions. FitzRoy is named for Vice-admiral Robert FitzRoy, best-known as captain of the Beagle when Charles Darwin was aboard, but who in 1854 founded what became the Met Office, set up specifically to provide weather information for seafarers.As the area forecast reaches its conclusion I think of how I once stood on a black beach at the foot of a black mountain looking out at a grey sea under a grey sky, a monochrome vista that was the legacy of a 1973 volcanic eruption on the Westman Islands (Vestmannaeyjar) off southern Iceland. Standing on land that’s younger than you are is a sobering way to finish any journey.For all the poetic inspiration of its curious place names and recondite meteorological phrasing, the shipping forecast is there to save lives. The number of disasters and tragedies averted thanks to sailors and skippers being made aware of impending storms and high seas is impossible to calculate. The reassurance of its rhythmic incantation goes much further though, way beyond the seafarer. The daily recital wakens and nurtures something deep within us, a maritime people, its poetry of protection an evocative reminder that not everything about being an island nation is insular or inward-looking. The beauty of its composition and delivery serves only to elevate the forecast further in our national consciousness.“The shipping forecast is the closest I ever came to reading out poetry on the air,” the BBC broadcaster Charlotte Green once told me – and she should know, having been effectively the voice of the forecast for years. “There’s a real appeal about it, even if you don’t know anything about the sea and don’t know what the terms mean. It’s absolutely mesmerising.”• Charlie Connelly is author of Attention All Shipping: A Journey Round The Shipping Forecast (Little, Brown)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8cb291e1bc410a577b7c274e17dd874d1b46698/0_1102_2091_1253/master/2091.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8cd0d1fc840fddf12b9a55fa04dde3b3","title":"richard francis burton explorer mecca horn africa nile victorian","story":"This fearless Victorian flirted with several ways of dying while looking for the source of the Nile, entering Mecca illegally and exploring other cultures’ attitudes toward sexPassport detailsSir Richard Francis Burton, geographer, translator, writer, soldier, orientalist, cartographer, ethnologist, spy, linguist, poet, fencer and diplomat.Claim to fameIt says something about the shallowness of celebrity that a polylingual, dashing, brave, randy scholar who travelled through East Africa to try to find the source of Nile, translated The Arabian Nights into English and had the chutzpah to visit Mecca is overshadowed by a Welsh actor of the same name (with an admittedly nice speaking voice) who married Elizabeth Taylor a lot.Supporting documentationBurton, who was born in Torquay in 1821, lived a life of barely credible derring-do, which he recorded in dozens of books and articles. He was particularly interested in the contrast between Victorian prudery and the attitudes of other cultures towards sex and sexual morality. He translated various books of erotica into English. This and his general irascibility made him a controversial figure and hampered his subsequent career as a diplomat. However, a series of army postings gave him the chance for more travel and the time to work on his literary endeavours: the most famous of which is his multi-volume translation of One Thousand And One Nights. His most noteworthy expeditions were the ill-fated trips to the Horn of Africa (his team was set upon by Somali nomads and Burton’s face was impaled by a javelin) the failed attempt to discover the source of the Nile — Burton ended up too sick to continue and the insanely risky visit to Mecca, which he undertook in disguise: “a hasty action, a misjudged word … And my bones would have whitened the desert sand”. He also visited Iceland and lived for spells in Brazil, Damascus and Trieste.Distinguishing markWith his lush facial hair and stern physiognomy, Burton was the physical archetype of the Victorian explorer. Yet, he seems to have been sceptical about the British imperial project. His undoubted superpower was an ability to learn languages. He claimed to have developed a system that enabled him to master most languages in a couple of weeks and could speak dozens, including German, Urdu, Marathi, Greek and Arabic. However, he admitted defeat in his attempts to learn Russian.Last sightedIn death, Burton even managed to bring a whiff of orientalism to the buttoned-up London cemetery in Mortlake. The mausoleum he shares with his wife Isabel is a marble tent with a ladder in the back that leads up to a small window. Through it, you can see the great explorer’s dusty coffin surrounded by knick-knacks brought back from his trips overseas.Intrepidness ratingThe trip along the Nile almost killed him and the trip to Mecca would have led to his execution if his true identity had been discovered.

The proteins involved in that inflammation start circulating in the body at high levels.”In these patients, the lungs begin to struggle. Blood pressure lowers. Other organs, including the kidneys, may begin to shut down. Blood clots form throughout the body. The brain and intestines may also be affected. Some suffer changes to their personality, suggesting brain damage.“I think what is evolving is a very specific set of stages of disease and for some reason, not everyone goes through all of the stages,” Darley says. “Some go through to the most severe stage and they require breathing support and oxygen. These patients who are severe tend to be older, they are more likely to be men, and also have other medical problems like diabetes, high blood pressure or cardiovascular disease.”But there is no way of knowing which patients will be affected by the most severe symptoms. Clinicians like Darley hope that a disease biomarker – a unique characteristic in the blood, body fluids, or tissues – will eventually be discovered for each stage.“It would help clinicians predict what stage patients are at and maybe even if they will progress to the next stage of disease,” he said. “It could help us predict who needs to be more closely observed in hospitals and would mean we have all the systems ready to go if they worsen. And it would give us more confidence to have them discharged to home if a biomarker says they are low risk for developing severe illness.”Darley is one of the researchers working on a long-term St Vincent’s study of patients admitted to the hospital with Covid-19. Patients will be followed for a year after being discharged, receiving tests at regular intervals to see if there are any lasting effects or changes in the body’s immune system and blood. They will also be assessed for any ongoing changes to lung, gut and brain functions. No one yet knows if the virus causes permanent or long-term harm.“I don’t think it’s clear yet whether it’s the virus infecting the lungs and the blood vessels, or if it’s the body’s immune system which goes out of control which then causes lung and blood vessel injury,” Darley said. “Or, it could be a combination of both.“The pathogenesis is not clear yet. We are observing brain inflammation in a subset of patients, and in those we are seeing agitation and a change in behaviour or personality. That’s really interesting, and there are reports coming from elsewhere of some people, including younger patients, suffering stroke. It’s unclear whether the virus is infecting the lining cells of blood vessels in the brain, or whether the patient’s blood is excessively prone to clotting because of all the inflammation, leading to stroke.”A renowned intensive care specialist from Italy, Prof Luciano Gattinoni, said this type of clotting in respiratory diseases is “extremely unusual”. The 75-year-old has been working in intensive care for 40 years, and said he has never seen anything like what is happening to the lungs of some Covid-19 patients. What is particularly baffling is patients are presenting with poor oxygenation but little lung damage. This type of presentation is more typical of patients suffering from altitude sickness than a viral infection, Gattignoni says. As a result, patients who are very sick may not feel like they’re really struggling to breathe – even as they’re being critically deprived of oxygen.“How is this possible?” Gattinoni told  Australia from the intensive care department of the German hospital where he is working as a guest professor. “Bad oxygenation and good lungs tells me this must have something to do with the blood vessels. But these vessels are everywhere. In the brain. In the kidneys. So, in some patients, many organs are affected.”The problem is, mechanical ventilation in intensive care replaces the strength of the respiratory muscles. If patients are struggling to breathe but their lung structure is OK, this ventilation does little to help and in fact may prove harmful, Gattinoni said, because mechanical ventilation is invasive. He said while only a small number of patients are severe enough to require ventilation, a significant proportion of those on ventilators die, continuing to show low blood oxygen levels despite mechanical assistance.Gattinoni said doctors must use ventilators only when needed, and at the right time. Getting this right can improve survival rates, he believes, and he thinks wrongly timed ventilation is why some intensive care units treating Covid-19 patients have higher death rates than others.“Timing with this disease is absolutely critical,” he said. “Ventilation cannot begin too early or too late.” In the meantime, patients are given anticoagulants, drugs that prevent or slow blood clotting in the hope that stroke can be prevented.Darley said scans of the lungs of Covid-19 patients are unique, showing “ground glass opacity”, a hazy pattern that does not obscure the underlying lung structure. Lung cancer, for example, would typically show on a scan as a dark, solid lesion, obscuring other structures in the lungs. While other illnesses, for example bacterial infections, can result in ground glass opacity on a scan, there were some unusual features on scans for Covid-19, Darley said.“It has a classic pattern in Covid,” he said.He suspects men are more severely affected than women because the virus is activated by an enzyme controlled by androgens, a group of hormones that play a role in male characteristics. But more research is needed to test this hypothesis. Darley added that any research into the virus needed to be conducted ethically and with strong scientific protocols.“With no treatments for this virus, all we can do for severe patients at the moment is provide supportive care,” he said. “If the level of fluid is low, we can replace it. If they need ventilation, we can help them breathe. But treatments for this disease can only come from clinical trials. “Our commitment at our hospital is to work with the highest level of scientific inquiry. People are desperate for treatments but we are reluctant to try treatments outside of clinical trials here. “If we don’t clearly show a treatment is better than placebo or other treatments, we could be creating noise and adding to the current chaos of the scientific community. Our responsibility is to find treatments that work.”Gattinoni agrees. He said scientists had been trying for decades to find drugs that moderate the inflammatory reaction, and he said these drugs had been “romanticised and popularised” in the race to find treatments for Covid-19.“But in thousands of experiments over the years trying to block inflammatory responses, we’ve only had a lot of poor results,” Gattinoni said. “Like many other things in medicine, we have to be patient.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dee53ed3a9f5ab0dac3511d8dd5300f66faf65/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6545e252bfa8f09bf05d37da87ef68ec","title":"coronavirus uk how many confirmed cases are there in my area","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

Patten said the Chinese Communist Party had taken advantage of the pandemic to “turn the screws on Hong Kong”.Last month Beijing’s top organisations in the region, the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO) and the liaison office, weighed into domestic political arguments, drawing accusations they were acting in contravention to Hong Kong’s mini constitution, the Basic Law.In response, authorities claimed the law did not apply to those offices, sparking furious condemnation from defenders of Hong Kong’s democracy, as well as from several foreign governments including the US, UK, Australia, and European parliament.Patten said the two offices’ statements were “a flagrant breach of the joint declaration” – which he helped negotiate - signed by Britain and China when Hong Kong was handed over the the latter in 1997.In its Friday statement the government maintained the HKMAO and liaison office had “the power and responsibility over the proper and full implementation” of the Basic Law, and it was “clearly legitimate” for them to express concerns about the conduct of Hong Kong legislators.On 18 April Hong Kong authorities also arrested more than a dozen senior pro-democracy figures on charges relating to mass protests held last year, including media tycoon Jimmy Lai, veteran activist Lee Cheuk-Yan, and 81-year-old barrister and Hong Kong’s “father of democracy”, Martin Lee QC.On Friday the government took “great exception” to the widespread condemnation of the arrests, saying any allegation there had been an erosion of Hong Kongers’ freedoms was “unfounded”.“The SAR Government said it always respects and protects human rights and freedoms,” it said. “However, these rights are not absolute.”It said Hong Kong’s prosecution and judicial system were independent, objective, and respected.“We therefore note with abhorrence certain overseas politicians’ request that the HKSAR Government should drop the charges against the arrested iniduals.

Small retailers, leisure and hospitality firms can get bigger grants of £25,000.Government to increase value of universal credit and tax credits by £1,000 a year, as well as widening eligibility for these benefits.Statutory sick pay to be made available from day one, rather than day four, of absence from work, although ministers have been criticised for not increasing the level of sick pay above £94.25 a week. Small firms can claim for state refunds on sick pay bills.Local authorities to get a £500m hardship fund to provide people with council tax payment relief.Mortgage and rental holidays available for up to three months.The announcements follow lengthy discussions between the Treasury and UK lenders, which are expected to continue throughout the weekend before the scheme is formally launched on Monday morning.Stephen Jones, chief executive of the banking lobby group UK Finance, said bank staff were “working incredibly hard to get money to those viable businesses that need it”, and that lenders were working at pace to get the new scheme up and running.Some banks feared the fast-track application for BBLS would mean having to cut corners on affordability checks that would put them in breach of the Consumer Credit Act. The Treasury confirmed, however, that it would introduce retrospective legislation which would allow them to skip those checks to try get money to businesses faster.Kevin Hollinrake, a Conservative MP and co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on fair business banking welcomed the Treasury’s announcements, saying the standard interest rate was “fantastic” for small firms.

Against a backdrop of big skies, lonely farmhouses and sandy beaches, physical distancing comes easily here.In small communities, such as those on Uist, isolation and the vast open spaces have preserved the local population from the devastation wrought elsewhere by the Covid-19 pandemic. Like everywhere else, lockdown has been strictly enforced and observed. Travel has been highly restricted – only lorry drivers and essential workers have been allowed on to the ferries since 16 March. And, as of last week, this archipelago of six principal islands linked by causeways has had no confirmed cases so far.It is this very particular geographic and social profile that has led ministers to see islands such as Uist as the perfect location in which to test strategies to end the lockdown. The notion has been floated by several scientists and endorsed by Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, who said last week there was “scientific justification” for piloting measures such as contact tracing to “relax measures at a progressively greater rate” on some island communities before the rest of the UK.So are islanders rushing to volunteer to throw off the shackles of lockdown? Not a bit. In fact some want it to go on even longer.“People either want a lockdown as long as everyone else, or an extended lockdown,” Uisdean Robertson said. The councillor for North Uist, a ward in Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, the Western Isles local authority, said his constituents were evenly split and no one had contacted him to press for an early end to the lockdown.“When you have the Michael Goves of the world, people that are remote from here, coming out with that kind of stuff,” Robertson said, “there was some irritation. Guinea pigs was one of the terms used.”The reason for the irritation is that the situation in Uist is not as clear cut as it seems from the outside. There are a substantial number of retirees and two care homes on the islands. Some islanders feel at greater risk from Covid-19 than those on the mainland.There is also no doubt that surviving lockdown on the islands is easier than in cities such as Glasgow or London. Robertson can walk his dog for miles every day over the “machair” – the rich grasslands – and among the crofts without seeing another human being.On Benbecula, Rev Drew Kuzma has a large garden in his Church of Scotland manse and empty sandy beaches to wander with his family.“We’re fairly fortunate. My nearest neighbour is 300 yards away – if it’s windy, we can’t even hear one another,” Kuzma said. But he says he and others are cautious.“Everybody would love to see the economy return to normal. But if you had to weigh the economy against health – and given that I’d be the one to oversee the final moments of someone’s existence – I just don’t think you can compare that.”Stephen Peteranna, also on Benbecula, has more to lose from the lockdown. He runs three hotels, two of which are shut – the other remains open for essential workers, such as a refrigerator engineer who came to fix some supermarket freezers.He would support an early lifting of restrictions – he is sceptical of the claim that there have been no cases so far – but with some caveats. He said: “If there’s a national advantage to using the islands as test beds, maybe we just have to get on with that. But ending lockdown early wouldn’t mean tourists could come – and the government might end business support. I’d be really worried that staff would lose their jobs if we weren’t allowed to keep them on furlough.”There are signs of some normality returning. Hector Stewart furloughed most of his 21 staff at Kallin Shellfish five weeks ago, but last week they began fishing for lobster, crab and scallops again.“We have taken about half of our staff back on and we’re finding small markets – back to doing once- or twice-weekly trips to Glasgow,” he said. “Everybody would welcome the lockdown to be eased, but we’ve got to be careful that we don’t get the virus.”He is worried about the elderly and the relative scarcity of medical facilities, adding: “But if it can be done safely, yes, we’d support it.”Even so, there are still many questions. Who would decide if the lockdown is lifted? And how?Kuzma said: “There’s been no testing to my knowledge, and we’ve not been consulted as a population.“Although,” he added, “you get used to not being consulted.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b64c444edd91cb4d3cea52597589750340eaa2f7/0_78_1980_1188/master/1980.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec466714eabd38ad89e5935fffe7c721","title":"us military taliban withdrawal agreement afghanistan","story":"Previously secret agreement emerges as spokesmen for US military and Taliban clash on TwitterThe previously secret arrangement was revealed in a Twitter spat between the US military spokesman Col Sonny Leggett and his Taliban counterpart Zabihullah Mujahid. It comes after a sharp escalation in militant attacks since the agreement was sealed.In a rare open letter to militants published on Twitter, Leggett warned: “If the violence cannot be reduced – then yes, there will be responses.”The Taliban had “asked for clarity” after the top US commander in Afghanistan, Gen Scott Miller, called for a reduction in violence and warned that “if the Taliban continue to attack” they should expect retaliation.The militants have mounted more than 4,500 attacks across Afghanistan in the 45 days since they signed the agreement for a US troop drawdown, Reuters reported.It has been widely reported that the peace deal included secret annexes, but this is the first time the US has provided any details publicly of these side agreements.The Taliban spokesman attacked the US statement as “pointless and provocative” and said the path to resolving the war lay in the agreement signed in Qatar in February.“We are committed to our end, honor your own obligations,” Mujahid said.The Taliban have claimed attacks have fallen since the signing of the withdrawal deal and accused the US of breaking its commitment to secure the release of 5,000 of Taliban prisoners held by Afghan authorities.Adding to Afghanistan’s troubles, the increase in violence has coincided with the rapid spread of the coronavirus. The four provinces reporting the highest number of cases have also been the ones hit the most by Taliban violence in recent weeks, according to the Reuters report.There are fears that the virus may already be widespread, especially after tests in Kabul appeared to show almost a third of people selected for a random trial were infected, according to New York Times reporters.Afghanistan’s ided government is meant to embark on political talks with the Taliban soon, to pave the way to a negotiated end to the war. Leggett warned that if violence levels did not go down, those peace talks might never begin.The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who was in Doha for the signing ceremony, seemed more cautious in his assessment of the Taliban’s future behavior.“The agreement will mean nothing – and today’s good feelings will not last – if we don’t take concrete action on commitments stated and promises made,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/858becadc2ecc00c9384febb46418e15d9bbf274/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae7d12352281a1451e47f6a3e2bf1ad7","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance sunday","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:Warren Buffett, the legendary American investor, has dumped his firm’s holdings in the four major US airlines, warning that the “world has changed” for the aviation industry in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. In comments that will send shockwaves through financial markets already pulverised by the economic shock of the outbreak, Buffett said the outbreak could have an “extraordinarily wide” range of possible economic outcomes.According to the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus tracker there were 3,428,422 confirmed cases worldwide on Sunday, with 243,831 people losing their lives to the disease. The US continues to be the most affected country, with more than 1.3 million cases and 66,385 deaths.Almost half of Britain’s doctors have sourced their own personal protective equipment or relied on a donation when none was available through normal NHS channels, according to a survey. The British Medical Association said its latest survey was the biggest of frontline NHS staff during the coronavirus crisis.European leaders have pledged to raise billions of pounds to help find a vaccine and treatments for Covid-19 as part of an “international alliance” fighting the disease. An online pledging conference due to be held on Monday will aim to pull in €7.5bn (£6.6bn) in funding to support the global response to the coronavirus pandemic.The video-sharing site said the 68-year-old conspiracy theorist David Icke had violated its policies on sharing information about coronavirus. The former footballer has made controversial unproven claims about the virus on several internet platforms, including one that it is linked to the 5G mobile network.The spread of the coronavirus in India’s notoriously crowded prisons has prompted authorities to impose jail lockdowns and release thousands of pretrial detainees on parole, as health experts worry that the cramped facilities are serving as breeding grounds for the disease. Although there are no official numbers on how many inmates have been infected by the virus, India’s correction facilities are slowly recording more infections and have temporarily banned visitors.Boris Johnson has revealed that doctors prepared to announce his death as he spent three nights in intensive care last month. Britain’s PM told the Sun on Sunday: “They had a strategy to deal with a ‘death of Stalin’-type scenario. The doctors had all sorts of arrangements for what to do if things went badly wrong.” Johnson, 55, said: “The bad moment came when it was 50-50 whether they were going to have to put a tube down my windpipe.

Illustration: Michael VineyRocking in my rocking chair – which is what they’re for – I looked out through the branches of the big willow tree and there, framed in a distant triangle of twigs, our neighbour’s children were out-rocking me on their garden swings.On the television in the corner, Andrew Marr was quizzing David Attenborough about his latest, perhaps his last, and undoubtedly his most passionate film, A Life on Our Planet. It frames his view of humankind’s “last chance” at living on Earth.“Our lot,” said Attenborough (93), “are finished anyway. “It’s up to the young to do things better.” “Some people,” Marr offered, “think that Covid-19 could be the reckoning the human world deserves.” Attenborough backed off from anything so biblical. He countered merely that a densely living, overpopulated species was much more susceptible to plagues.His film, soon for Netflix, is apparently a properly terrifying catalogue of what we’ve been doing to the natural world. For all the years of brilliant films exploring and celebrating nature, he or his producers were slow to invite much public outrage about the darker destructions.Attenborough’s recent Blue Planet II, with its nightmare of plastic in the ocean, was the one that really touched some anger. What, Marr asked, was the one bit of change that ordinary people could effect. “Waste!” was Attenborough’s explosive reply.Veteran willowA breeze stirred the willow twigs and their first fringe of green. As the old tree drops her catkins, flushing fully into life, I’ll lose the playing children, along with the view of the mountain and the rising of the moon.It’s quite a veteran as willows go, couched in the stream’s ravine, its elbows propped on the banks. Nowhere else on the hillside could it possibly exist, so safe from people, from sheep and the worst of storms.But willows are everywhere on this soggy island – at least 18 kinds that botanists can ine, often with some difficulty. A tree that reached here naturally in perhaps six or seven forms has been added to by garden introductions and multiple hybridisations.If we had to choose one as the national tree (as I think it richly deserves), it should probably be the common “goat” or “pussy’ willow, Salix caprea. Like the one in my painting, it is ablaze with yellow catkins in early spring. The “goat” stems from an early role as fodder, and the flowers still offer nectar to bumblebee queens fresh out from hibernation. In the sort of little cameo captured by many readers alert to events in their gardens, Paul Dunne, of Lettermore in Co Galway, sent a photograph of ants perched on willow catkins and wondered how unusual this was.They had climbed the tree, he surmised, for pollen or nectar. But the ascent of ants on willows, in particular, is a well-known phenomenon. The ants’ attraction is more usually for aphids, or rather, the sweet liquid known as “honeydew” exuding from their fundaments.This sugary waste is extruded from the aphids’ extraction of sap in the willow’s youngest, most tender, shoots. Googling “ants on willows” offers a graphic Flickr close-up of ants in close attendance.No aphids appear on Dunne’s catkins, but bluetits I see foraging along flowering twigs of our own willow confirm that they abound. A score or more of different species suck at the shoots of sallies in these islands, and since the salicin in willows converts to salicylic acid, a natural aspirin, one may wonder if both aphids and ants are seeking to be spaced out.Of far more urgent consequence in the appetite of aphids is that of the grain aphid, Sitobion avanae. It sucks at the sap of spring-sown barley seedlings, barely greening the field, and flies around to spread the dreaded “yellow dwarf virus”. It is also evolving resistance to pyrethroids, the chemical ingredients of most modern pesticides.Teagasc, the farmers’ oracle, has long encouraged “integrated pest management”. Its advice at the national tillage conference in January was to sow early and spray once “if warranted”.Several sparrowsFor better news, my recent column on the reported decline of urban house sparrows brought many reassuring emails from readers with abundant chirping residents. This ties in well with the latest Big Garden Watch survey of the UK’s Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. From returns by nearly half a million people in late January, the house sparrow was the most commonly seen (or, perhaps, readily recognised) garden bird. With new mild winters to help survival, the society hopes “that at least a partial recovery may be happening”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4243828.1588435132!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"almost 2 000 working or job ready through ireland s call recruitment drive","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA cyclist passes by a bus stop with a public health warning on Covid-19 in Dublin. File photograph: Aidan CrawleyEPAAlmost 2,000 people hired through the Government “Be on Call for Ireland” recruitment drive to deal with the coronavirus pandemic are working or ready to work for the health service.The HSE released figures on Saturday showing that just 57 of these recruits have begun working, 553 are “job ready” and 500 are “available to the services as and when they need them.”Some 880 student nurses who applied through the call-out were progressed through a separate stream and are working as health care assistants in community and acute hospitals, the HSE said.This combined total of 1,990 to come through the “Be on Call for Ireland” drive amounts to less than three per cent of the 73,000 people to apply to help the health service through this crisis.Some 1,630 candidates have been “successful at interview,” said a HSE spokeswoman.The spokeswoman for the HSE said that “the vast majority of applications for the initiative were not health care professionals.”There were 24,000 expressions of interest received within 24 hours of the recruitment call being made to reinforce frontline medical staff when it was announced on St Patrick’s Day.The request to bolster staffing levels within the health service was made to anyone who had retired within the last five years as well as part-time workers and students.The HSE has hired the recruitment company CPL, which provides subcontractors to Facebook and other large employers, to support the “Be on Call for Ireland” recruitment drive.CPL has been recruited to contract the workers “due to the strain on existing HSE resources to meet the Covid-19 challenge,” the HSE spokeswoman said in a statement.The publicly funded health service declined to disclose what it was paying the private company, saying that the rate of pay “for its services for this project is commercially sensitive.”Three-month contracts of employment through the recruitment drive will be with CPL, and not the HSE, but the HSE stressed that the contractors will be paid the same as HSE employees.The contract includes “a paid sick entitlement for employment-acquired Covid-19 illness,” the HSE said, and that the contracts “may be extended as per the needs of the healthcare service and the wishes of the candidate.”“Employment contracts may be reviewed at a later date, once we understand the impact this is having on the healthcare system,” said the spokeswoman.The health service has said that it only plans to use the Be on Call for Ireland contractors “when all other resourcing streams are exhausted.”More than 1,000 people have been recruited to the health service separately by HBS Recruit, the HSE’s national recruitment service, during the Covid-19 pandemic.“The purpose of the Be on Call for Ireland initiative is to create reserve pools of ‘job ready’ new healthcare professionals for the services to use as and when they are needed in response to Covid-19 and healthcare management,” said the HSE in reply to questions from The .“The Covid-19 crisis is ongoing. However, to date, the staffing needs have been largely met through other recruitment channels. There continues to be a ‘job ready’ pool available through the ‘Be on Call of Ireland’ initiative.”People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett raised the short-term nature and other aspects of the contracts during Dáil questioning with the Taoiseach this week, asking him why the new workers had been “given the worst possible contracts.”The HSE said last weekend that about 4,500 HSE staff were out of work, either on sick leave in self-isolation with the coronavirus disease, with suspected Covid-19 symptoms or for other reasons such as childcare difficulties.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

File photograph: PAA further 25 people diagnosed with Covid-19 have died, the National Public Health Emergency Team disclosed on Saturday.There have now been a total of 1,286 deaths associated with the disease in Ireland, it said.Another 343 new confirmed cases were also reported. This brings the total number of cases to 21,176. This is the fifth day in a row that the increase in the number of new cases has been 2 per cent or lower.Four deaths previously thought to be Covid-19 related were denotified and have been reflected in the death toll figure of 1,286.The department released a more detailed breakdown of information from the State’s Health Protection Surveillance Centre on 20,742 cases as of midnight last Thursday.Of those cases, 2,785 people, or 13 per cent, have been hospitalised and, of those, 368 cases have been admitted to hospital intensive care units, an increase of one on the previous day.There were 5,973 cases associated with healthcare workers, up 133 on Wednesday’s figure. The gender breakdown of the 20,742 cases was 58 per cent female and 42 per cent male. The average age of these cases was 49 years. Dublin had the highest number of cases at 10,277, or 50 per cent of all cases, followed by Kildare with 1,226 (6 per cent) and Cork with 1,156 (6 per cent).Where the transmission of the disease is known, community transmission was found in 63 per cent of the cases, where close contacts account for 34 per cent and travel abroad 3 per cent. The latest figures come as Ireland prepares for another two weeks of restrictions, put in place in March, in an effort to combat the virus.However, a phased lifting of the restrictions on Irish life will begin on May 18th, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced on Friday evening.What about travelling abroad?On Saturday Minister for Health Simon Harris raised doubts about the possibility of people being able to travel overseas this year, saying that it was “not looking good”.He advised people not to leave the island of Ireland this year and said that it was looking highly unlikely that people could take foreign holidays this year. Mr Harris told RTÉ that any incoming travellers had to self-isolate for 14 days as a precaution to prevent the spread of the virus and that other countries had similar restrictions in place. In-bound visitors had to complete a Public Health Passenger Locator form, which had to contain their contact details and address at which they will be self-isolating.Mr Harris said the Taoiseach had asked some Ministers to assess with the Attorney General whether this needed to be supported by regulations. He added that a decision would be made on this over the coming weeks.The Minister disclosed that as of Saturday afternoon, there had been 169,377 tests for Covid-19 carried out and that the State was carrying out more testing per head of population than many other countries.Speaking at Government Buildings in his Friday night live televised address, Mr Varadkar warned that beginning the opening-up of the country too soon could result in “going back to square one”, with a rise in the number of cases, hospital admissions and deaths.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4243086.1588356643!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus the reopening ireland plan in detail","story":"The current restrictions on social and economic life will be maintained for a further fortnight, and will be eased in stages from May 18th, the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has announced this evening.“We need two more weeks,” Mr Varadkar said to effectively control the spread of the virus, warning that opening up the lockdown now could result in the country going “back to square one”.He announced two minor changes to the current restrictions - the 2km limit will be extended to 5km and over 70s will now be told that they can leave their homes but only if they avoid all contact with other people. Otherwise all restrictions will remain in place.Mr Varadkar said that on May 18th, should progress in containing the virus continue in the intervening two weeks, then the restrictions will be eased in a series of five stages, three weeks apart. “Our plan is to re-open the country in a slow, staged, phased way,” Mr Varadkar said.On May 18th, some retail outlets such as garden centres and DIY centres will be allowed open, some outdoor sports will be allowed and small groups of family and friends will be permitted to meet in the open. Construction and outdoor work will restart.In later phases, other businesses will be allowed reopen. Schools and colleges will reopen in September and October at the beginning of the next academic year. Cafes and restaurants will reopen on June 29th and pubs will reopen on August 10th.However, Mr Varadkar warned that the easing of the restrictions will depend on there being no “second wave” of the virus which could overwhelm health services.“Unfortunately the risk of a second wave of the virus is ever present,” he said. “So we can only move from one phase to the next if the virus stays under control between each phase. And there is a risk that we’d have to go back a phase if that happens.“In any scenario, at least until we have a vaccine or effective treatment, there will be a long-term need for physical distancing, good hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, regular cleaning and for people to stay at home and isolate if they are sick.”Micheál Martin said he agreed with the cautious advice of the public health officials but called for clarity about the leaving certificate.Mary Lou McDonald said that it was “essential” to have a roadmap for the reopening of Ireland, and said that the testing capacity needed to be improved to allow for the lockdown to be lifted.In a televised address on Friday, Mr Varadkar said thousands of lives have been saved “because of the sacrifices and choice you have made”.“When we come through this, we will come together as a nation and grieve for everyone who has died over the course of this emergency,” he said.But he warned that the phases of reopening the country may have to be reversed back a step, if the rate of the infection increases significantly as the lockdown is eased.“We need two more weeks of tight restrictions,” Mr Varadkar said, so the virus does not have a chance to make a “comeback”.The curve has been flattened but “we have not yet won this fight”, he said.“I know for me the worst part has been the daily text message I receive at around 5 o’clock every evening of the number of deaths, and number of new cases,” the Taoiseach said. “I yearn for the day it stops.”The Full PlanTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that Ireland will begin re-opening from May 18th under a roadmap which contains five phases.The first phase begins on May 18thIn this early stage, up to four people not of the same household will be able to meet outdoors while maintaining strict social distancing. Funerals will still be a maximum of ten people. Outdoor workers in construction can return including gardeners and those working on allotments. But remote working will remain in place for the vast majority of businesses. Garden centres and hardware stores can reopen as well as opticians, bike repairs and phone repairs.Electrical outlets may open\u0026nbspTennis courts and golf courses can reopen but social distancing will apply. Outdoor public amenities and tourism sites may open. A maximum of four people can engage in outdoor sporting and fitness activities. Schools and college buildings will be opened to allow teachers to organise remote learning.The second phase begins on June 8thIn this phase, people will now be permitted to travel up to 20km but will be advised to avoid all unnecessary journeys. Over 70s will be allowed to shop at specific hours. Visits to homes of over 70s will be permitted by no more than a few people for a short period of time and they must wear gloves, face coverings, maintaining strict 2m social distancing.For everyone else, up to four people may visit another household for a short period of time while maintaining strict social distancing. In terms of funerals, slightly larger numbers of people can be in attendance at funerals but they will still be restricted to immediate family and close friends.There will be a “phased return” of other workers who can maintain a distance from others of two metres at all times.\u0026nbspBusinesses that can maintain remote working will be asked to do so. Small retail outlets, with a small number of staff, and open marts could also\u0026nbspreopen.Libraries can open with limited numbers. People can engage in outdoor sporting and fitness activities where there is a small group team but this does not include matches.The third phase begins on June 29thTravel restrictions will remain at 20km. Cafes and restaurants that can adhere to social distancing guidelines will reopen. Creches will be reopened but only for the children of essential workers. Hospital and prison visits may resume but consideration will have to be given to the availability of PPE in each unit.Businesses will be asked to continue with remote working where possible but organisations where employees have a low level of daily interaction may return. There will be a phased reopening of non-essential retail outlets on the basis of restriction on the number of staff and customers per square metre so that social distancing can be maintained. This will be limited to retail outlets with street-level entrance and exit i.e. which are not in enclosed shopping centres due to higher risk.Playgrounds will be reopened where social distancing and hygiene can be maintained. Some “behind closed doors” sporting activities will be permitted. Public transport will remain restricted. The Government will consider implementing travel restrictions on numbers travelling to and in major urban centres.The fourth phase begins on July 20thIn this phase, people can now travel outside their region. A slightly larger number of people (more than four, but the exact number has not yet been specified)\u0026nbspmay visit another household for a short period of time while maintaining social distancing. Small social gatherings by family and close friends will be limited to a maximum number of attendees for a limited period of time where social distancing can be maintained. The same will apply to other social gatherings outside of family and friends.Creches for all other workers will reopen but only for one a day a week to start with. Businesses will be asked to stagger work hours but Government will ask that remote working will continue. Hairdressers and barbers may reopen as well as museums, galleries, religious places of worship. Hotels and hostels will reopen on limited occupancy. Hotel bars will remain closed. Caravan and holiday parks may reopen. Restrictions on the numbers allowed to travel into urban centres will be decreased on public transport.The last phase begins on August 10thPubs, bars, nightclubs and casinos will reopen where social distancing and cleaning can be complied with. Festivals and other cultural gatherings may be held but with restricted numbers. Large weddings will still be restricted due to risk, as will other large gatherings. Normal visiting will resume in hospitals.A phased return to normal work will start around this time. Shopping centres will reopen as well as theatres and cinemas that can maintain social distancing. Close physical contact sports like rugby, boxing and wrestling will be permitted. Gyms can reopen where there is regular and effective cleaning.Sports spectatorship which involves mass gatherings will be permitted, but only in accordance with both indoor and outdoor number restrictions. Indoor recreational venues like roller skating, bowling alleys and bingo halls may open where numbers can be limited. High-risk organisations which cannot maintain social distancing will be asked to implement plans for how they can eventually return to full complement. Some time after this period, schools will reopen.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Total of 1,286 have now died of Covid-19 in the RepublicFox seen looking mournfully towards Merrion Square where parents liveMan (40s) was detained following an apparent stabbing in Enniscorthy on FridayHSE declines to disclose rate paid to recruitment firm CPL hired to manage processCol Ringrose, who has died aged 89, described as an \u0026lsquoexemplary ambassador\u0026rsquo for IrelandGarda\u0026iacute looking for help in finding Reece Atkinson from MonasterboiceGarda\u0026iacute discover drugs after stopping motorist in Raheny on Friday eveningVaradkar says new government can be formed by JuneConcern over employment rights of hundreds of people recruited to fight Covid-19With fewer sittings due to lockdown, judges \u0026lsquoeat into\u0026rsquo list of reserved judgmentsHSE says there has been \u0026lsquoconcerted effort\u0026rsquo to encourage public to continue to contact their GP with non-Covid related symptomsTaoiseach warns restrictions will be reimposed in event of coronavirus \u0026lsquosecond wave\u0026rsquoHSE in talks to resolve impasse over plans for private consultants to treat public patientsFour motorbikes suspected to have been used in transportation of drugs seizedWidespread testing was undertaken at the centre in Cahersiveen last weekWhat will happen and when will it happen?Chief Medical Officer says guidance being developed as part of restriction easingStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4242928.1588346815!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the animals are baffled at dublin zoo what happened the humans","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPink flamingos stand silently  in their enclosure at a closed Dublin Zoo.

They are watched by a pride of biblical lions lounging at the front of their enclosure, while the macaques nearby throw fresh straw at each other as tigers prowl, alert to every move made by the handful of people who pass them each day.The elephant family does its own thing, as it always has done.More than six weeks ago the zoo – which is among the top tourist attractions in Ireland with over 1.2 million visitors annually – closed its doors to all but a core team of socially distanced zookeepers working in strictly controlled groups to combat infection.They are watched over by zoo director Leo Oosterweghel. He has been at the helm of Dublin Zoo for almost 20 years, and never once imagined he would see days like this. His home is the zoo, and he is the person best placed to record how the absence of people has impacted on the animals he cares for.“They look at me with more surprise now,” he says. “They come up and have a good look because they’re wondering what’s happened to everyone else. They are used to visitors.”Before the zoo closed it employed over 100 people – only 40 remain.“Most of our people have been laid off,” the director says. “All we have now is the animal care team and some support staff. We had to let so many people go and that has been extremely difficult. It is hard to tell someone they are non-essential because we are such a close-knit team here.”EntertainmentDublin Zoo was first conceived in the Rotunda Hospital in 1830 by a group of medics with a view to providing entertainment for well-heeled Dubliners and easy access to animal corpses for doctors. Once animals – specially the primates – had outlived their usefulness as spectacles their cadavers were prized for research purposes.It could scarcely be more different now. Today the animals always come first. The zoo’s main focus is their welfare and conservation, and much of the money it raises each year funds projects across the world aimed at protecting endangered species in the wild and developing critical breeding programmes in captivity.“We have had to slow down our conservation efforts because every euro counts. And that breaks your heart,” says Oosterweghel.But there are steps he will never take no matter how difficult things get.“I have heard of some zoos talking of animal euthanasia to reduce their costs, but that is never going to happen here, not on my watch. It is not even discussed.“We have all of the costs and none of the revenue,” he says.The food bill alone is close to €10,000 a week, added to which is the cost of wages for the essential staff. As a self-funding charity, the zoo gets no aid from the State but Oosterweghel says the zoo may need a “bridging loan” in the weeks ahead.60 acresWhile times are bleak, the zoo perhaps has an advantage over many attractions as it is outdoors and spread over 60 acres of the Phoenix Park. Yet even so social distancing in the future will have to be carefully managed. “We don’t know when we will reopen or what we might look like when we do,” he admits.He has given up speculating as to when that day might come. “It all depends on what the Government tells us to do, and when we can do it.”Just as it is beyond the zoo’s high fences, health is of utmost concern.“The virus is very much on our radar, and we have sharpened our protocols. From the start the zookeepers looking after primates wore mask because we knew there could be cross-transmission . They now wear masks when looking after the cats too.”That happened after it emerged in early April that a tiger at New York’s Bronx Zoo had tested positive for Covid-19 after contracting it from a caretaker who was asymptomatic at the time.As Oosterweghel talks and walks, the pink flamingos stand silently on little islands in their enclosure. Then one sees humans and starts squawking. Soon it is joined by dozens of excited others. Once the humans turn a corner, the flamingos fall silent again.Around that turned corner the sea lions are putting on a show for zookeeper Daniel Dunne. His job in recent weeks has been to “ensure that they are stimulated and exercised and fed and taken care of”. He also makes sure their habitat is in pristine condition.Like all the zookeepers he has been working in a small team with no interaction with others. He admits that it has become a little lonely.Nearby the tigers are having lunch at the front of their enclosure, seemingly unconcerned or even aware of the presence of people. But when we turn to walk away one of them is upon us in an instant, only inches away and separated by some thankfully thick glass. “You turned your back and their instinct is to go after you as prey,” Oosterweghel says.They don’t go after him, though. They high-five him instead. He casually places the palm of one hand on the glass and one of the great cats immediately responds by rising up on hind legs and putting a giant front paw in the director’s hand – or as close to it as the glass allows. The bond is impossible to miss.Super-smartMel Sheridan is minding the elephants as they mind their own business“I don’t doubt for a second that they have noticed that the humans are not around because they are super-smart and nothing gets passed them,” she says. “But they are just so focused on their own family unit, and they just want to eat and play and roll in the mud, so they’re okay.”As we walk away she shouts after us “it’s nice for us to see other people though”. She sounds lonely too.Oosterweghel walks past the zoo’s farm. A cow approaches him for a nuzzle, a sheep looks on with jealousy in her eyes.“It is so quiet now,” he says sadly. “You can really take your time walking around looking at the animals. But unfortunately we cannot share it.”Not now, perhaps, but soon.

Photograph: RTÉTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said he thinks there can be a new government formed by June.Speaking on The Late Late Show on Friday night, Mr Varadkar said: “The country actually needs it. . . The current Government is functioning well at the moment, but cannot go on like this forever. We are making decisions at the moment without a parliamentary mandate.”Mr Varadkar said he was “very keen” to meet the Green Party’s demand for a 7 per cent a year target for reducing carbon emissions. He acknowledged there are many farmers who will worry about what that might mean for them but added: “We need to see more ambitious climate action as an opportunity - to remake agriculture, to give much better and secure income to our farmers, creating lots of jobs, becoming a net exporter of energy . . . Climate action can be a big economic success story for Ireland. ”His comment comes after the Green Party held its third round of discussions on government formation. Speaking to host Ryan Tubridy, Mr Varadkar said he hoped the Green Party was “coming to a point where they would enter talks” but said: “Even if we do agree on a programme for government, most of the parties, including my own, have to get it ratified by our membership.”Asked why he would not consider a coalition with Sinn Féin, Mr Varadkar said he was remaining true to his word given during the election. “Sometimes in politics, you have to go back on your word because of circumstances outside of your control. This isn’t one of those occasions,” he said.Speaking in relation to the Government’s announcement that the current restrictions regarding the coronavirus pandemic will be extended until May 18th, Mr Varadkar said he would have liked to have eased restrictions further but it was not possible as the virus “isn’t suppressed enough”.Mr Varadkar said Ireland is “going slower than other countries” in order to avoid “going backwards” but said there are elements in the later phases of the roadmap published on Friday that could potentially be brought forward.Mr Varadkar indicated unemployment supports and wage subsidies put in place due to coronavirus could be extended as it “wouldn’t be right to unwind it before those sectors reopen . . . when people have the opportunity at least to go back to work”. However, he said the supports cannot last forever.Asked about the trend of fatalities in nursing homes around the country, the Taoiseach said: “When all of this is over . . . we’ll find things that could have been done differently, better or not done at all”. He said it would have been “much better if we’d been able to do testing earlier but the capacity wasn’t there”.The Taoiseach suggested the possibility of the 2020 All-Ireland football and hurling championships going ahead behind closed doors this year and confirmed it was still the plan to have the Leaving Certificate examinations go ahead from July 29th.The reopening of the country could be more difficult than shutting it down, the Taoiseach said. “There are going to be difficulties, rows and disputes . . . But I think we can do it.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"United Nations warns authorities against detaining people in overcrowded centresNorth Korean leader reportedly attends event after speculation about healthChen Jieren has been detained since 2018 after he published two blog articles claiming corruption by Hunan party officialsRescheduled general assembly to take place next month against backdrop of coronavirusHundreds of firefighters tackle blaze in new warehouse in city of IncheonBeijing mounting \u0026lsquono-holds-barred\u0026rsquo diplomatic effort to stem growing calls for compensationReports of North Korean leader\u0026rsquos illness expose limits of foreign insight into countryPM says it will be weeks before movement restrictions lifted and some could be reintroducedKim Yo-jong was a favourite of her late father and is reported to have been groomed for the roleLockdown restrictions eased as community transmission eliminated, but Ardern warns fight not over\u0026lsquoNo suspicious movements\u0026rsquo detected in North Korea as conjecture grows over leader\u0026rsquos absenceWhile the number of new coronavirus cases has begun to fall, experts say the rate of change is not as fast as expectedIn recent years China has sought to expand its control over the region by building artificial islands around reefs and atollsSouth Korea reiterates that it has detected \u0026lsquonothing unusual\u0026rsquo in the NorthSecondary school students told to arrive early for temperature checksContribution comes days after Washington said the US would freeze funding to WHOHardline clerics calling the shots and urging devotees to ignore anti-pandemic measuresLatest cases raise concern about potential impact on Nagasaki residentsSouth Korea\u0026rsquos presidential Blue House says no unusual signs coming from neighbourLeatherbacks are world\u0026rsquos largest sea turtles and are endangered in ThailandStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4243758.1588408781!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"kim jong un reappears after weeks of absence state media","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA photo released by the official North Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) shows North Korean leader Kim Jong-un attending a completion ceremony of a factory. Photograph: EPAKCNAAfter weeks of intense speculation about the health of Kim Jong-un, state news agency KCNA said on Saturday the North Korean leader attended the completion of a fertilisers plant north of Pyongyang, the first report of his appearance since April 11th.Reuters could not independently verify the KCNA report.KCNA said Mr Kim cut a ribbon at the ceremony on Friday and those attending the event “burst into thunderous cheers of ‘hurrah!’ for the Supreme Leader...”Mr Kim was seen in photographs smiling and talking to aides at the ribbon-cutting ceremony and also touring the plant. The authenticity of the photos, published on the website of the official Rodong Sinmun newspaper, could not be verified.Many in the large crowd of people, described as officials of the army, the ruling party and the community who worked on the project, were wearing face masks and standing some distance from the podium where Mr Kim and his aides took part in the ceremony.North Korea has not reported any cases of the coronavirus and has said it has been taking tough measures to prevent an outbreak. One reason for Mr Kim’s absence has been the suggestion he may have been taking precautions against coronavirus.Mr Kim was accompanied by senior North Korean officials, including his younger sister Kim Yojong and top aides vice-chairman Pak Pong-ju of the State Affairs Commission and cabinet premier Kim Jae-ryong, and KCNA said.Asked about the KCNA report on Mr Kim, US president Donald Trump said: “I’d rather not comment on it yet.”“We’ll have something to say about it at the appropriate time,” he told reporters at the White House.Speculation about Mr Kim’s health has been rife after he missed the birth anniversary celebrations of state founder Kim Il-sung on April 15th. The day is a major holiday in North Korea and Mr Kim as leader usually pays a visit to the mausoleum where his grandfather lies in state.He last made a public appearance on April 11th attending a meeting of the ruling Workers’ Party politburo.Following his absence from the anniversary, a South Korean news outlet specialising on the North reported that Kim was recovering after undergoing a cardiovascular procedure. A flurry of other unconfirmed reports about his condition and his whereabouts followed.Officials in South Korea and the United States expressed scepticism about the reports.State TV footage on Saturday showed Mr Kim’s leg movements appearing stiff and jerky and one of the images showed a green golf cart in the background, similar to one he used in 2014 after a lengthy public absence.“Preparing desks and chairs on the stage seemed a bit rare for such an outdoor occasion,” Nam Seong-wook, a professor of North Korean studies at Korea University, said of the ceremony.“Kim might have some physical conditions that prevent him from standing too long and he needs to be seated after standing up for awhile.”Prof Nam said if Mr Kim is unable to stand for long periods that maybe the reason he did not attend the anniversary event in April at the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, where he would have had to stand for at least about an hour.The city of Sunchon where the fertiliser factory was built is about 50km (30 miles) north of Pyongyang in the western region, away from Wonsan, the eastern coastal resort where South Korean and US officials have said Mr Kim may have been staying.Satellite images showing a train usually used by Mr Kim near the Wonsan resort, as well as boats often used by Mr Kim and his entourage, suggested he may be staying there.Officials in South Korea and the United States have said Mr Kim may be there to avoid exposure to the coronavirus, and have expressed scepticism about media reports that he had some kind of serious illness.–ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4242166.1588270051!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus north netherlands stopped following national advice here s what happened","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn intensive care patient is moved from an air ambulance at the University Medical Center in Groningen, the Netherlands. Photograph: Robin UtrechtEchoes WireBarcroft Media via GettyAccording to the official Dutch count, there have been 4,795 coronavirus deaths in the Netherlands. This is an underestimate: it only includes people who tested positive, and mortality data suggests actual deaths are 40 per cent higher. It also disguises deep regional differences.In the worst-hit region of North Brabant in the south, twice as many people died between March 16th and April 5th, 2020, than in the same period last year. But in the northern region of Groningen, home to a university city the size of Cork, deaths were just 4 per cent higher in the same period.What can explain this stark difference in a country half the size of Ireland that is one of the most densely populated in the world?The man held partly responsible is Prof\u0026nbspAlex Friedrich, a virologist and head of microbiology and infection control at\u0026nbspthe University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG), the major hub of medical care in the northern Netherlands.Friedrich announced on March 19th that the north was departing from national Dutch policy. While the public health agency would be restricting testing to only severe and priority cases, he announced the north would follow\u0026nbspthe World Health Organisation’s advice: “test test test”.\u0026nbsp“In the Netherlands, in our country, they said that diagnostics is interesting for statistics but not important for the fight against the disease. There I strongly disagree,” Friedrich told The .The UMCG set up a test centre on its grounds, hired medical students for extra staff, and asked the local health authorities to direct people there for screening.\u0026nbsp“We just did it,” Friedrich recalled. “You save lives by doing diagnostics. Proper diagnostics, case tracing, information, is one of the strongest weapons we have to fight the virus.”International insightCrucial to the decision-making was an international perspective. Friedrich did not rely on the limited academic studies available on the new virus, but directly telephoned doctors in Italy to ask what they were seeing in their patients.He learned they were spending twice as long in intensive care than Dutch national modelling accounted for, and he adapted the hospital’s plans accordingly. Friedrich maintains that learning from the experience of other countries is crucial to fighting the pandemic.This insight was important, but so was luck.School holidays in the Netherlands are staggered. The north had theirs a week earlier than the rest of the country. It meant that Dutch people from the south and west were much more likely to bring coronavirus home from skiing holidays in Austria and Italy, as they travelled when outbreaks there were more widespread. This was compounded by the mass public events of carnival season, which are held in the south but not the north.This meant when the Dutch government finally began banning public events on March 10th, it was too late for Brabant, but not for Groningen, according to Friedrich.“We talked to the public health service and said we are going to do something different from the national way,” he recalled.A few initial detected cases in Groningen were health workers who had travelled abroad. But soon\u0026nbsptests were discovering Covid-19 in health workers who had travelled only to other regions of the Netherlands.“We realised there was no difference anymore between the south and the west of the Netherlands and northern Italy. So we told our staff: you are not allowed to go outside our region, and if you do so you cannot come to work. You have to stay at home for two weeks,” Friedrich said.With 15,000 staff and as the central healthcare node for the whole region, the UMCG was big enough to set policy for the wider north. According to Friedrich, the decisive intervention was screening healthworkers, whether or not they had symptoms. A fifth of those who tested positive never developed any.“In healthcare institutions, 10, 20 or 30 people can be infected by just one person,” Friedrich said. “In other parts of the country where the numbers are still high, I suspect it is outbreaks in healthcare institutions and long-term care that are the major drivers of the epidemic.”‘Group immunity’Though Friedrich has been part of the outbreak management team that co-ordinates the Dutch response to the crisis, he is critical of aspects of national strategy.On March 16th prime minister Mark Rutte announced that the Netherlands would build “group immunity” by allowing the virus to roam the population in a controlled manner. The government subsequently walked back from this, but the policy still has its adherents.Friedrich is not one of them.“Herd immunity can never be a public health strategy. It can never be controlled, and it means people will die, and if you are not very careful a lot of people will die,” Friedrich said.“It’s not a law that we’re all going to get infected. It’s just the consequences of our insufficient action to protect people.”He has doubts about whether survivors of the disease even reliably built immunity. “Immunity does not happen automatically,” Friedrich said. “It might be very local, in the nose or throat. But then you could swallow the virus, and get an infection in your gut.”Delaying the spread gives doctors and scientists time to understand the disease and develop more effective treatments, which Friedrich believes will emerge more quickly than a vaccine.“For a vaccination you need to produce it for all the billions of people on the planet, which takes time, and you have to administer it,” he explained.“It’s not like a therapy that you give to a sick person: there, you might take into account there are side effects, but consider them acceptable because you have to save a life. If you are giving a vaccination to healthy people all over the world, you need to be very, very sure that this is safe.”His focus now is preparing for the winter, the worst season for respiratory infections. Friedrich expects it to bring a wave of infection that was worse than the first.“We need personal protective equipment, we need more intensive care beds, we need more healthcare staff, we need more diagnostics in all hospitals in the country,” Friedrich said.“You cannot expect things will go back to normal, thinking that normal is the world as it was before February. That is not really realistic. We have to change so that we can handle this.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4241997.1588258217!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"europe s relationship with china is now one of mistrust and hostility","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tReferring to China, French president Emmanuel Macron told the Financial Times last month: ‘There are clearly things that have happened that we don’t know about.’ Photograph: Lintao ZhangGettyAs a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, relations between the People’s Republic of China, the West and Europe are undergoing a profound transformation, characterised by mistrust and, in some cases, open hostility.The pandemic’s origins in Wuhan, Chinese secrecy about its evolution, and what has been called China’s newly aggressive “wolf warrior” diplomacy (after a patriotic, Chinese blockbuster film) have accelerated a chill in Sino-European relations that started before the crisis.Early conspiracy theories that suggested coronavirus was a manmade product of biological warfare have been refuted by the scientific community. The hypotheses most widely circulated in the West now are that a scientist in a high-security biological laboratory in Wuhan was accidentally infected and spread the virus, or that one of several labs sloppily disposed of contaminated research materials. China has denounced these theories as “not science-based”.Referring to China, French president Emmanuel Macron told the Financial Times last month: “There are clearly things that have happened that we don’t know about.” Clarifying later, the Élysée said Macron referred only to the Chinese government’s lack of transparency.Although US president Donald Trump is widely disliked in Europe, researchers and diplomats say European officials and the public agree with much of what he says about China.Trump continues to be the most strident critic of China’s role in the pandemic. On Monday, he responded\u0026nbspto an editorial in the sensationalist German newspaper Bild that demanded China pay €150 billion in reparations to Germany for the death and economic destruction wreaked by the pandemic.Trump said he would “hold China accountable”, though he hadn’t determined the amount yet. More than one million Americans have been infected with Covid-19 and more than 59,000 have died, a higher toll than the Vietnam War.In late April, the US state of Missouri filed a lawsuit demanding that the Chinese government be “held accountable for their actions”.And in the past week, the Australian government has asked for an international investigation by the World Health Organisation (WHO) into the origin of the virus. The Chinese ambassador to Canberra disagreed, and threatened a Chinese boycott of Australian universities and tourism sites.China’s deputy ambassador to London, Chen Wen, told BBC radio in recent days that China could not agree to an international investigation. “While we are concentrating all our efforts on fighting against the virus, why talk about an investigation into this?” she asked. “This will ert our attention, our resources. No one can agree with this kind of politically motivated investigation.”Also in April, China’s ambassador to Paris, Lu Shaye, was summoned to the French foreign ministry, a serious step just short of breaking diplomatic relations, for the first time in a quarter century.Lu tweets several times a day regarding Covid-19 issues. He has repeated claims by the Chinese foreign ministry’s spokesman Zhao Lijian that the virus came from the US. He has alleged that French parliamentarians supported racist Taiwanese comments against the Ethiopian director of the WHO, and accused caregivers in French nursing homes of “abandoning their positions overnight, deserting collectively, and leaving their residents to die of hunger and disease”.“We expect to be respected by China, as they wish to be respected by us,” foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian says. In an interview with Le Monde, he described the pandemic as “the continuation of power struggles by other means”. Asked whether he feared that China would take the place of the US in world affairs, Le Drian replied: “My fear is that the world after will furiously resemble the world before, only worse.”Scarcely a day passes without damning reports on China in French media. “The Great Chinese Lie,” was the title of Le Figaro magazine’s 10-page cover story on April 25th, illustrated by a photograph of Xi Jinping wearing a surgical mask and wagging his finger.On the Chinese side, Lu boasted that “China has helped 140 countries and international organisations” in an interview with L’Opinion newspaper.But as noted by the European Think-tank Network on China on April 29th: “It is important to note that commercial deliveries of medical supplies from China have far exceeded aid volumes.”At the beginning of the pandemic, Europe helped China. Then China helped Europe. In February, France sent 17 tonnes of medical supplies to Wuhan, including 560,000 face masks. A month later, China dispatched a “solidarity freight” of one million masks and 10,000 protection suits to Paris. The French health ministry said France subsequently ordered “close to two billion” masks from China.French commentators initially praised the ability of China’s autocratic regime to impose such a draconian lockdown.But the French mood changed in late March, says Marc Julienne, China researcher at the French Institute for International Relations (IFRI). The French found Trump’s allegations of Chinese influence over the WHO convincing, says Julienne. They were skeptical of the low fatality figures reported by China, suspicious of Beijing’s “mask diplomacy”, and outraged by Ambassador Lu’s outbursts.Chinese officials routinely accuse the West of attacking China to hide their own ineptitude in fighting the pandemic. “It wouldn’t have come to this if westerners had been more successful in stopping the epidemic,” Lu told L’Opinion.“If there’s a problem, it’s the fault of certain media,” Lu continued. “They align themselves with American media. Every time the US press makes an allegation, almost immediately French media howl with the wolves.”Lab rumoursThe origin of the virus is particularly sensitive in Paris, because France built one of the Wuhan biological labs whose security practices have been questioned.Wuhan is the most French of Chinese cities, the investigative journalist Antoine Izambard writes in France-China, Dangerous Liaisons, published just before the pandemic. About 100 French companies, including PSA, Eurocopter, L’Oréal and Pernod-Ricard have plants there.When Izambard visited the Wuhan Institute of Virology to interview its director, microbiologist Yuan Zhiming, in February 2019, the walls of the stairs were lined with photographs of French officials.France built the highest security biological laboratory in China there, under a 2004 agreement. An outbreak of Sars had just killed 800 people in Asia. “It was logical for France to give China a tool to help it detect viruses and develop vaccines,” Izambard says.Not everyone was comfortable with this. France had recently lost track of four mobile P3 biological labs it gave China. (P4 stands for pathogen level 4, meaning the most deadly viruses for which no cure has been discovered. P3 and P2 indicate lower levels of lethality and safety precautions.)Military intelligence and the foreign ministry opposed the P4 lab project on the grounds it could be hijacked for biological warfare. (There is no evidence it ever was.) The US also opposed construction of the lab. A French researcher, quoted by Izambard, was upbraided by the US scientific attaché in Beijing. “No P4, no P4. It’s forbidden. You can’t do that!”It went ahead, and has been the subject of rumours and debate for some weeks now.US intelligence says the Covid-19 virus definitely came from China, was not manmade or genetically modified, and that it is still investigating whether it came from a laboratory in Wuhan. On Thursday evening, Donald Trump said he had seen evidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the source.Yuan and his deputy, Shi Zhengli, have figured prominently in French coverage of the pandemic. Shi wrote her thesis at the University of Montpellier and was later one of a half dozen scientists from the Wuhan Institute of Virology who trained in biological security in Lyon. In 2016, the French ambassador to Beijing decorated Yuan and Shi with the National Order of Merit and the Legion of Honour for their work in preventing infectious diseases.In 2004, Shi and her team began roaming the caves of southern China, identifying hundreds of bat-borne coronaviruses, as recounted in Scientific American magazine. The magazine published the article this week “to address rumours that SARS-CoV-2 emerged from Shi Zhengli’s lab in China”.The team hung nets at the mouths of caves before dark, then waited for the bats to come out to feed. They took samples of the bats’ blood, saliva, urine and faeces.On the night of December 30th, 2019, Shi received a telephone call from the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, a biosafety level 2 lab located less than 300 metres from the seafood market where Chinese authorities claimed the epidemic started. They had found a new coronavirus in two hospital patients and wanted Shi to investigate. “Could they have come from our lab?” Shi asked herself.Questions around the lab had persisted. The Washington Post revealed on April 14th that US diplomats who visited the Wuhan Institute of Virology in January 2018 warned Washington the laboratory was not secure. A cable dated January 19th, 2018 said the new lab “has a serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory.” The cable warned that the lab’s work on bat coronaviruses risked creating an epidemic similar to the 2003 Sars outbreak.Shi went through years of lab records, checking for any mishandling of research materials. When it emerged that none of the genome sequences in the Covid-19 virus matched those she had taken from bat caves, it “really took a load off my mind,” Shi told Scientific American.Researchers have now published 4,500 genomic sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Shi says the fact that none exactly matches the viruses she has studied proves that Covid-19 could not have come from her lab.Yuan Zhiming, director of the lab, has said: “It is impossible that the virus came from here. We have very precise and rigorous rules for avoiding leaks and we are certain of that.”In the absence of a full investigation, the truth of this remains unknown and the hypothesis remains just that. Yet unease persists about labs in China.France has no connection with the lower biosafety level Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention lab. According to a report on the ResearchGate website in February, it houses 600 bats captured 1,000km away, in the subtropical Yunnan and Zhejiang provinces.A video posted on YouTube in December showed lab technician Tian Junhua telling how he self-quarantined after coming into contact with bat blood and urine. Such reports, widely covered by French media, prompt a question: could lab personnel have inadvertently been exposed to the Covid-19 virus and brought it into the local population?This speculation, combined with a Chinese attempt to control the narrative of the pandemic, are inflaming French opinion.“Until now, in France, only a few disappointed businesses, a small group of diplomats and high-ranking officials at the ministry of defence objected to the ultra-nationalist and fundamentally opaque behaviour of this country,” Le Monde said in a two-page investigative report into the Wuhan laboratories.Izambard interviewed 140 diplomats, officials and scientists for his book. “France rarely wins,” he says. “In nuclear energy, high-speed railways, aeronautics and biology, China wants the technology, but it doesn’t want co-operation.” Fifty French researchers were supposed to have worked in the P4 lab. There is only one.Crude and clumsyThese days, it is not uncommon to hear criticism of Jean-Pierre Raffarin, the unabashedly pro-Chinese former prime minister, and Alain Mérieux, the Lyon industrialist who lobbied for the P4 lab.“What did the French think they were doing when they gave China that lab?” a European diplomat ask a few days ago in Paris.“Xi Jinping wants to impose his narrative of how victorious, glorious, heroic China defeated the virus,” says Françoise Nicolas, director of the Asia Centre at IFRI. “I don’t think he can win this one. It’s too crude, blatant and clumsy. It’s over-confident and aggressive.”Before the pandemic, there was already a widespread belief that China wanted to rule the world, Nicolas says.President Macron has called Beijing’s trillion dollar Belt and Road Initiative to build Chinese roads, ports and industrial centres around the world “hegemonic”.Xi’s Made in China 2025 plan to make China the world leader in fields such as aeronautics and robotics is also viewed with suspicion. A Chinese attempt to take control of Toulouse airport was thwarted. But Greece and Italy allowed China to invest in the ports of Piraeus and Trieste.Reliance on trade with China makes some EU countries skittish. In the third week of April, Beijing put heavy pressure on the EU to water down a report about Covid-19 disinformation, the New York Times reported.For example, the sentence, “China has continued to run a global disinformation campaign to deflect blame for the outbreak of the pandemic and improve its international image,” was removed, as was an account of China’s dispute with France. Monika Richter, an analyst involved in the report, denounced the changes as “appeasement” and accused the EU of “self-censoring to appease the Chinese Communist Party”.The think tank network report on Europe-China relations says the pandemic has “simultaneously brought Europe and China into closer cooperation and pushed them further apart”.The crisis has amplified isions between countries desperate for Chinese aid, such as Italy and Spain, and those like France, Germany and Sweden, who see Chinese behaviour as provocative and aggressive.In March, the European Commission repeated past advice to member states to shelter strategic industries from China. Margrethe Vestager, the competition commissioner, says EU governments should buy stakes in companies rather than allow Chinese incursions while prices are low because of the pandemic. France and others have vowed to repatriate strategic industries they outsourced to China.Over four months of the pandemic, “China has lost Europe,” Reinhard Buetikofer, a German Green who heads the European Parliament’s delegation for relations with China, told Bloomberg News.Macron often says that Europe must not become a casualty of rivalry between the US and China.In March 2019, the EU publicly labelled China a “strategic rival” for the first time. Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and Josep Borrell, the representative for foreign affairs, have made repeated statements about the need for greater transparency on the part of China, and for the EU to protect itself from China.With €700 billion in annual trade pre-pandemic, mutual dependence between China and Europe will not disappear. But interaction will be more difficult after the crisis.“Until now, we let the Chinese walk all over us,” says Françoise Nicolas. “Now the Chinese are more assertive, and we are more wary. This has laid the basis for a tense and complex relationship, on both sides.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"watch covid 19 teaches us human behaviour","story":"What can our response to pandemics tell us about our social psychologies?

It is vital that we work together to establish a clear and workable set of proposals, so that we are in position to lead discussions with other countries.“It’s clear that social distancing does not work on any form of public transport.“UK airports have put a package of measures on the table for discussion with Government. We now need the Government to work urgently with airports and airlines to agree how we operate in the future.”The anger among airports comes amid a growing expectation that families may yet rekindle hopes of a summer holiday abroad and airports will not be ready to deal with a bow wave of travellers in late summer.Michael O\u0027Leary, the boss of Europe’s biggest airline Ryanair told the the  that he expects “a rush to get to the beaches in July and August”.Last week the  disclosed that British officials were drawing up plans based on the 14-day stay home notices currently issued to Singaporean citizens returning to their country from abroad.Mr O’Leary said: “I don\u0027t think that would be 14-day quarantines. I don\u0027t think that\u0027s practical.”However, a new poll found overwhelming support for proposals for those flying into the UK to be asked to self-isolate for two weeks - with 92 per cent of those surveyed agreeing that such a scheme should be in place.A ORB International survey of 2,082 people found that only 4 per cent of people disagreed that both British citizens and those from abroad should be forced to quarantine for a period of two weeks after flying into UK airports.Some 34 per cent said they agreed with the statement, while 58 per cent strongly agreed. Only 4 per cent said they did not know either way.The requirement for travellers to wear face masks comes amid split among experts as to their efficacy.Martyn James, of consumer complaints service Resolver, said there was real confusion over the advice on face masks. If the Government advises wearing one they could become the new toilet roll within days, as consumers will scramble to get hold of one.He said the Government should consider requisitioning masks and distributing them centrally to avoid price gouging.It would make sense for the Government to take control, he said. Even if they appointed a retailer to provide the service. You can see this being the new toilet roll in three days\u0027 time and that\u0027s not going to help anyone, least of all our front line workers.Sue Davies, Head of Consumer Protection at Which, said: “We’ve seen unscrupulous sellers exploiting people... There is evidence suggesting this is already happening with face masks, and the problem is likely to get worse if they see a spike in demand.”UK Meds, an online pharmacy, said its sales of face masks increased by more than 800 per cent from March to April, from 64,784 sales to 593,847.The Government declined to comment.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"parents must not attempt interfere childrens predicted grades","story":"Parents must not attempt to “interfere” with their children’s predicted grades by pressuring teachers into submitting higher marks, a union boss has said.Dr Patrick Roach, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers said teachers should “very firmly resist” demands from parents over which grades they submit to exam boards.In March, the Government announced no exams would take place this summer and all students due to take their GCSEs and A Levels would instead receive predicted grades.Schools have until May 29 to submit predicted grades to exam boards based on a combination of pupils\u0027 mock exam results, if they have them, and other non-exam assessment.Teachers are meant to submit their judgment about the grade that they believe the student would have received if exams had gone ahead to the relevant exam board, according to the exam watchdog Ofqual.A moderation process will then take place and students will be awarded their final grades by the exam boards in August.Within each predicted grade band, teachers will need to rank students in order of best to worst. This means that, during the moderation process, if the school was deemed to have been too generous with their predicted grades, the students at the bottom of the ranking could see their grade drop.Likewise, if the school was thought to have underestimated students\u0027 predicted grades, the students ranked towards the top could be bumped up.This means that a pupil’s place in the rank order could end up being just as important as their predicted grade in deciding what they ultimate grade will be.Dr Roach said that parents and pupils are “understandably anxious” about exam grades, but added that they must respect the professional judgement of teachers.“Parents and pupils: resist the urge to make contact with schools or teachers,” he said.“Schools must support teachers and very firmly resist any pressure by pupils or parents to interfere in the assessment process or seek advance information about grades.”Ofqual has said that schools should not tell pupils what their predicted grade is, nor where they are in the rank order.“This is important in ensuring that schools can resist any pressure that pupils or parents may seek to assert over the professional judgments made by teachers,” Dr Roach added. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said he is also aware of parents “lobbying” headteachers to boost their children’s grades.“We are aware of a handful of cases where parents or students have contacted schools to lobby over calculated grades,” Mr Barton said, adding that so far it does not appear to be too widespread.Students disappointed with their predicted grade will be able to appeal through a specially designed process, but their request for an appeal will only be upheld if they can prove there was some kind of data or processing error with either a single paper or a whole year group “We know this is a difficult and worrying time for parents and students but we would ask them to respect the fact that schools cannot discuss grades with them,” Mr Barton added.“This is to protect the integrity of teachers’ judgments and to avoid pressure to submit a grade that is not supported by the evidence.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"postcard austria blazing trail early easing virus lockdown","story":"Austria is celebrating the 75th anniversary of the foundation of the Second Republic.Chancellor Kurz pledges that the country will emerge stronger from the current crisis. He promises a “comeback”.Austria, one of the first European countries to “flatten the curve”, has many reasons to think optimistically, although the road back to normality will be a long one.Freedom is in the air. The federal Government is lifting the lockdown on May 1st, easing restrictions in the upcoming weeks. We will be among the first in Europe to taste liberty again.As of Labour Day citizens across Austria will be permitted to leave their homes without any restrictions for the first time in 45 days. The obligation to wear a mouth and nose mask in shops and public transport, as well as maintaining at least 1 metre distance, remain in place.In restaurants a maximum four adults plus children will be allowed to share a table and wearing a mask will be compulsory when entering and leaving.At the end of a long day working in my home office I use my suspension rope for the first time this week. With fitness studios closed for 7 weeks and not opening until late May it’s a major plus to have such a tool in the wardrobe, physically and psychologically. Besides cycling, this is what really gives me energy.The last 24 hours of lockdown. I’m headed to my favorite Oriental market to purchase humus, dates and tahini. When I reach Favoritenstrasse, one of Vienna’s shopping streets, the area is packed. It looks like an average day. Some are wearing masks, many are queueing up at banks, pharmacies and shops of telecommunication companies. The local clown is making balloons. It’s not easy to follow social distancing guidelines with a bigger crowd.Labor Day, and the estrictions of movement are finally lifted. From now on the wearing of protective masks in covered public space is compulsory and protests are permitted again.Curiosity leads me to City Hall Square. The traditional parade of the Social Democratic Party is cancelled but several left-wing protesters have gathered, many of them waving flags of the Communist Party.The lockdown turned me into a bike fanatic. Fortunately, Vienna is a bike-friendly capital. At night, with less traffic, I could count the number of people on the streets on one hand. Corona made this possible. I get to enjoy the fabulous St. Stephen’s Cathedral totally on my own. A very unique moment.Another step towards normality is being made today. Shopping malls, large stores and hair salons reopen for the first time in almost 2 months.At Mariahilferstrasse, Vienna’s No.1. shopping street, hundreds of locals are already out strolling. Restaurants and cafés are only open for take away. Their terraces remain closed for now, with the first ones opening in two weeks.Austria has achieved semi-normality within 7 weeks. The Health Ministry’s data shows the epidemic curve had its peak in Austria with 974 new confirmed cases on March 26th. This number was pushed back to 20 (twenty!) on May 1st. The total number of coronavirus infections is 15,503, with the death toll in Austria hitting 566 as of May 2nd.The Austrian data shall give hope to British, Italians, French, Spanish and all other nations even in desperate times. It requires collective sacrifice, but at the end it will bear fruit.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/04/28/TELEMMGLPICT000137047632_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqek9vKm18v_rkIPH9w2GMNoGXySPv9M1Jbe0Fc3Bi1Fk.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"public opinion not scientific advice keeping us lockdown","story":"Ministers keep repeating that they are Guided By The Science, but the trouble is that there is no such thing as The ScienceWhat has come over us? Is Covid-19 turning us into a nation of authoritarians? Are we secretly enjoying the lockdown and its associated feelings of community, simplicity and purpose? Were some of us longing all the while to be bossed about? Opinion polls continue to show massive support for the restrictions, with more people wanting them tightened than loosened.In the most recent survey, 70 per cent of British voters wanted businesses to be closed unless the coronavirus was “fully contained”, with only 23 per cent disagreeing, making us the most illiberal of the 14 nations polled. Think about that for a moment. Eradication is not a realistic possibility: even if we find a vaccine, the coronavirus will continue to circulate, as bird flu and swine flu still do. So seven in ten of us are asking for an open-ended lockdown.When the closures were imposed, no one tried to claim that they would halt the disease. Rather, they were intended to buy time, to “squash the sombrero”. But the distinction between preventable deaths and deaths per se was quickly lost. Commentators began to speak of “defeating the disease”, and politicians realised that they would be judged only on the number of coronavirus-related fatalities.Never mind that different methodologies make international comparisons meaningless. Never mind that measures designed to contain Covid-19 can cause preventable deaths elsewhere as cancer victims go unscreened, children go unvaccinated and so on. Never mind, come to that, that there is no clear correlation between the severity of the lockdown and the number of fatalities. Voters wanted eyewateringly harsh measures, and they got them.No one puts it in quite those terms, obviously. Instead, ministers keep repeating that they are Guided By The Science. The trouble is that there is no such thing as The Science. There are, rather, thousands of scientists scrambling to respond to a mutating situation and, quite possibly, a mutating virus.Some of those scientists think that too restrictive a quarantine is weakening our immune systems and possibly slowing benign adaptations to the virus. Others argue that, although the lockdown is working in its own terms, it is causing excessive collateral damage through non-covid deaths. Still others believe that the infections follow pretty much the same trajectory regardless of what measures are taken, peaking at six weeks and dropping after eight.There is no way of knowing who is right, obviously. So, in the absence of certainty, our leaders should aim to respond proportionately. Imagine a spectrum of possible responses. At one end, we could do nothing at all and run the risk of our hospitals being overwhelmed at the other, we could close every business and let the country starve. Where is the optimum point on that spectrum, the point where the most bearable closures yield the clearest gains?In answering, it is impossible to be Guided By The Science. The question is an essentially political one. We should listen to epidemiologists and virologists within their fields of expertise. But it is unreasonable to expect them to make judgments about the impact on, say, educational outcomes or unemployment figures.In theory, we elect politicians to make these trade-offs. In practice, we don’t like to think about trade-offs at all. Rather, we (or at least 70 per cent of us) want our leaders to err on the side of caution – “err” being the apt word.Consider, for example, schools. A meta-survey by University College London found that school closures have no noticeable impact on slowing the spread of coronavirus. Studies from Iceland, Switzerland and the Netherlands all show the same thing, namely that children are extremely unlikely either to have symptoms themselves or to infect others.How Covid-19 affects the bodyWe are, in other words, inflicting undisputed costs on children (lost education) and their parents (lost livelihoods) in exchange for, at best, negligible epidemiological gains. Why? Because an epidemic flicks switches in our brains. The whiff of pestilence throws us back onto our most basic Stone Age heuristics: stay away from strangers, avoid risk, hoard food, keep your children close. These basic promptings will always prove stronger than academic papers.Last week, I argued that Sweden’s relatively light-touch approach looked like being vindicated. The infections, I wrote, were following roughly the same curve as in places that had ordered far more severe crackdowns suggesting that, once basic hygiene and social distancing measures were in place, closing shops and schools made little differenceThe responses were telling. A lot of people pointed, almost gleefully, to the fact that Sweden has a higher fatality rate than Norway or Denmark (though lower than Britain, France or Italy). In fact, Swedish policy always allowed for a higher initial infection rate. Other readers argued that we couldn’t draw any lessons from Sweden because of its sparse population.Yet most Swedes live in towns and suburbs: 85 per cent of the population occupies 15 per cent of the land, and Stockholm is more densely populated than London. What became clear was that, perhaps subconsciously, a lot of people wanted Sweden to fail, and thereby to vindicate the lockdown policy.That may yet happen, of course but, so far, there is no sign of it. In the week since I wrote my article, Sweden’s death rate has continued to drop, and the WHO now cites it as a “model”. Yet, just as the evidence in favour of a Swedish approach piles up, Britain is moving in the opposite direction. Instead of protecting the vulnerable and lifting restrictions on those least at risk, we are maintaining our closures.A month ago, Sweden was the outlier. Now, as the rest of Europe begins to open up, it is Britain that stands apart, maintaining restrictions on schools and small businesses which other countries are dropping. One of the small ironies of the debate is that many people who spent three years decrying the idea of British exceptionalism as a Europhobe fantasy now find themselves arguing that we must remain in lockdown for longer than Continental countries.“Better safe than sorry” we say. But what if we are making ourselves sorrier but no safer? We shall be very sorry if European companies take business from their locked-down British rivals, if our children face a lifetime of debt repayment, if millions of jobs are lost. But we shall be in no position to moan at our leaders: they are doing precisely what we ask.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

I do not mean coronavirus which, although unique in its particular structure, is not unprecedented in its consequences or its attributes. Terrible plagues – now called pandemics – appear repeatedly in the recorded history of virtually all peoples from pre-Biblical times to the current century.No, what is surprising is not the fact of an infectious disease which reaches global proportions. It is the almost universal willingness of governments to take extreme and potentially very damaging measures to protect what are expected to be quite small minorities of their populations and, even more remarkable, the willingness of the majority of those populations to accept such measures.An enormous number of people, living in societies with different political, religious and ethical traditions, are consenting (largely without protest) to restrictions and privations that they know are almost certain to damage their own futures, in the interests of protecting the (relatively) few. There have been instances in the historic past that were not entirely unlike this: the plague villages of the Middle Ages that voluntarily closed themselves off from the country at large, or the quarantines of cities in the twentieth century.But has there ever been such a mass voluntary adoption of self-inflicted sacrifice throughout the developed world?The British, as I have frequently written, are exceptional in this regard. They have behaved with a stoical, humorous, communal spirit that is unsurprising. But – without the humour and with rather more heavy-handed enforcement – so many other countries have accepted the same basic assumption: that it is the responsibility of the majority to protect a minority who are in particular danger.This principle is now apparently embedded in the modern social conscience to such an extent that it is scarcely being remarked upon. Before the moment passes, we should give it a thought, if only because it runs contrary to so much of the conventional wisdom.The idea that contemporary society, particularly in the free market economies, is addicted to selfish materialism – that it has lost the community solidarity that previous generations took for granted, that the egotism of the inidual now rules over all other considerations – has dominated the popular imagination for at least 40 years.This interpretation may have been rooted in a Left wing world view but it is tacitly accepted even on the Centre Right. Never mind that contributions to charities and participation in voluntary work have never been higher, which should have given an important clue to the weakness of the analysis.Now we have a substantive disproof of this calumny. In overwhelming numbers, ordinary people, most of whom must know that they are extremely unlikely to be at personal risk of dying from coronavirus, are willing to relinquish many of their personal freedoms and comforts in the altruistic hope of saving the lives of others. That is quite something.So where does it come from? Could it be that the prosperity and material comfort of modern life in the advanced economies has actually produced not selfishness, but the opposite? That because security and confident optimism have largely replaced desperation and a constant struggle for survival, the population as a whole can be more generous and forbearing?Ordinary people can now enjoy the moral satisfactions once available only to the very wealthy: benevolence and nobility of purpose. It is certainly true that there can be solidarity in poverty but this universalised sense of having the power to do good in the wider world is something different. (It has been perfectly captured, or exploited, in that stupendously successful government message: “Stay home, protect the NHS, save lives”.)There is a less appealing possibility, of course. Some analysts have suggested that advanced societies, having become accustomed to a world without serious want and with the extended longevity delivered by modern medicine, are simply more risk averse than their fatalistic predecessors. Put cynically, people now expect to live pretty much forever and consider death to be an outrage even long after the three score and ten years that was once considered a reasonable life .The decline of religious belief may have a part in this. Instead of accepting the end of life as a natural inevitability that gives meaning to one’s existence, it must now be seen as an enemy to be defeated at all costs. (Perhaps oddly, while we seem to have cast death as outside the normal order, we have come to accept an idea which is grotesquely unnatural: that iniduals who are loved by others should die alone.)Or could it be that much of the world’s population has grown up so accustomed to affluence that it simply cannot conceive of the possibility that it might be lost? Has this age of secure employment and economic growth bred an unrealistic blithe confidence that truly bad times – of hardship and despair – could never return?Then again, maybe this isn’t about either economics or metaphysics. Perhaps it is the rise of democratic politics that has transformed the notion of public responsibility – even in countries that are not democratic.The general assumption that government exists to promote the greater good is a principle to which even most modern totalitarian countries must pay lip service. In fact, the most common justification for dictatorship is that people are happier under its rule. So if governments – and nation states – only exist to promote the wellbeing of their populations, then the moral duty of care of national leaders and of their peoples must be sacred. And what could be more worthwhile than the desire to prolong the lives of others? In a world where the value of inidual freedom and self-determination are taken for granted, one’s personal obligation becomes greater.Whatever the causes, we now clearly live in a world in which it is taken for granted that our responsibility to one another is absolute and must be counted into the equation whatever the cost. That has to have been a lesson worth learning.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The Government has insisted that reciprocal trade is needed with countries such as China to help ensure that overseas governments provide the UK with equipment that it needs during the course of the pandemic.But the Government has been left with no choice but to accept the rule under the terms of the Brexit transition period, which is due to end on December 31.Last month, Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, who deputised for Boris Johnson when he was hospitalised with coronavirus, used an article in The Sunday  to warn countries against damaging protectionism. The Prime Minister, Trade Secretary and I are pressing the G7 and G20 groups of major economies to keep trade routes open, he said.But under the temporary measure, British firms must obtain a PPE export licence to export key equipment to countries outside of the EU and European Free Trade Association.The temporary measure was first introduced in March, without fanfare in the UK, before being extended last Sunday. A statement on the Department of Health website says: As part of the response to coronavirus (COVID-19), the UK has implemented Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020568 to ensure an adequate supply of vital PPE equipment within the UK, the European Union, the EFTA member states (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland) and certain dependent and other territories.The regulation came into force on 26 April 2020. It will initially last for 30 days, until (and including) 25 May 2020. It adds: Where the proposed export would constitute emergency supplies in the context of humanitarian aid, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) will grant the authorisation.In any other case, DHSC will only grant a licence where the proposed consignment poses no threat to the availability of PPE in the UK or in the EU, and satisfies a legitimate need for official or professional medical use in the country concerned.A Government spokesman said: Coronavirus demonstrates the importance of keeping trade flowing and building erse supply chains that are robust in a crisis.That\u0027s why as an independent trading nation, the UK is making the case for free trade across the world and was instrumental in ensuring G20 agreement to maintain supply of essential goods and services during this unprecedented time.

But Japan’s Nikkei 225 index slipped 2.8 per cent to 19,619.35 while the S\u0026ampPASX 200 in Australia gave up 4.2 per cent to 5,289.40.The future for the S\u0026ampP 500 lost 1.7 per cent while that for the Dow industrials gave up 1.5 per cent.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe S\u0026ampP 500 fell 0.9 per cent on Thursday after reports showed millions more US\u0026nbspworkers filed for unemployment benefits last week and the European economy crumpled to its worst performance on record last quarter, among other lowlights. It was the biggest loss for the US\u0026nbspstock market in more than a week, but just a wiggle within the S\u0026ampP 500’s 12.7 per cent gain for April, its best month in decades.“Maybe it was the whole month-end malaise, or maybe they just need to hear something new and impactful, and that we’re ultimately seeing buying fatigue,” Chris Weston of Pepperstone said in a commentary.Wall Street suffers worst fall in three weeks amid falling oil pricesTrump defends virus response with newspaper op-ed and Cuomo videoThis is what Trump should’ve actually done to save the economyUS stock market falling faster than during the Wall Street CrashPromises from the Federal Reserve and other central banks to do whatever it takes to prop up the economy through the coronavirus crisis have supported buying by investors betting that a recovery will come soon. Professional investors say that optimism may be premature.“The rebound in April was an assumption that this was going to be a short, V-shaped recovery, both economically and at the corporate and business level,” said David Lyon, global investment specialist at J P\u0026nbspMorgan Private Bank.“In our view, it probably has gotten a little ahead of itself. We think it’s going to be a longer and slower recovery.”The month’s gains for stocks came in the face of mayhem in the oil market, where prices in one corner dipped below zero for the first time, and as investors continued to rush into US\u0026nbspgovernment bonds in search of safety. Reports piled up by the day showing the severe hits the economy is taking from widespread stay-at-home orders meant to slow the spread of the virus.US\u0026nbspbenchmark crude picked up 46 cents to $19.30 (£15.44) per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It is\u0026nbspstill way below the roughly $60 (£47.99) level where it started the year as worries pile up about the effects of a collapse in demand and as storage tanks fill close to their limits.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.2 per cent\u0026nbspto 24,345.72, and the Nasdaq fell 0.3 per cent\u0026nbspto 8,889.55.The US\u0026nbspjobless figures brought the total to 30 million in just six weeks, while consumer spending plunged a record 7.5 per cent\u0026nbspin March from the prior month. That is\u0026nbspcrucial for an economy where consumer spending makes up 70 per cent of the total.US unemployment hits another record high as 4.4m more workers fileAmong European countries that\u0026nbspuse the euro, the economy shrank by 3.8 per cent\u0026nbspin the first three months of the year from the quarter before in the biggest contraction since records began in 1995. Discouraging data also came in on China’s economy, which is concerning for anyone expecting a first-in-first-out economic wave.“This is the saddest day for the global economy we have ever seen” in the 50 years that economists at High Frequency Economics have been following economic data, they wrote in a report. “The statistical offices of the economies we watch pumped out 19 economic reports overnight. They revealed historic declines of activity and surging unemployment on a scale we have never seen before. We are sad.”The yield on the 10-year Treasury edged down to 0.61 per cent\u0026nbspfrom 0.63 per cent\u0026nbsplate on Thursday. It started the year close to 1.90 per cent. Treasury yields tend to fall when investors are downgrading their expectations for the economy and inflation.In currency trading, the dollar fetched 107.09 Japanese yen, down from 107.13 yen on Thursday. The euro rose to $1.0963 (£0.88) from $1.0955.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Mr Musk then posted the final lines of the US national anthem.In recent days, many of Mr Musk\u0027s posts have criticised the government lockdown and attempted to suggest that the public are misled over the scale of the coronavirus crisis.In a flurry of tweets earlier this week, he posted FREE AMERICA NOW and Give people their freedom back.He also used a Tesla earnings call to attack the lockdown as fascistic as part of a impassioned diatribe.Mr Musk has been known to use his Twitter account to post controversial and unusual messages in the past.He has said in the past that the strange nature of those messages has led to Twitter locking his account, fearing that they had been posted by a hacker.Created with Sketch.Armed protests against stay-at-home coronavirus measures in Michigan Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A demonstrator shouts next to two masked security guards at the state Capitol in Lansing, Michigan during a protest against stay-at-home ordersArmed members of a milita group at the state Capitol building in Lansing, Michiga, during a protest against coronavirus lockdown measuresA protester at the state Capitol in Lansing holds a sign comparing Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer to Adolf Hitler during a demonstration against coronavirus lockdown measuresAn armed protester takes part in a demonstation against lockdown measures at the state Capitol in Lansing, MichiganA protester holds a sign saying \u0027Bill Gates is evil\u0027 at a demonstration against stay-at-home orders at the state Capitol in Lansing, Michigan.

But they have largely attempted to do that by impersonating him, including taking control of other verified accounts and making them look as if they were Mr Musk\u0027s official account.The new outburst came as Nasa announced that one of Mr Musk\u0027s other companies, SpaceX, was one of three firms in the running to make the lunar lander for humanity\u0027s return to the moon\u0027s surface. SpaceX already has a number of key contracts with the US government, including one that will see it send Nasa astronauts to the International Space Station in a matter of weeks.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So, Keanu’s gotta go finish his commitment up on The Matrix, which is a big deal and which I think will probably take him until the end of the year. Then we have to go into our prep mode and then we’ll start.”How Keanu Reeves could return as Neo in The Matrix 4Why All About Eve is as topical as it was 70 years agoNilüfer Yanya on Tirzah’s beautifully human debut albumAs Stahelski mentioned, The Matrix 4 has also had its production\u0026nbspshut down, but director Lana Wachowski is yet to comment on a change to its\u0026nbsprelease scheduling.Should the new John Wick film change release dates, it would certainly\u0026nbspput an end to any high-concept theories relating to a crossover between the two films.It seems like this particular theory was too good to be true, even if it seemed entirely plausible (read more on it here).Created with Sketch.The 27 worst film sequels of all time Show all 27Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Like a reliable friend – or a movie franchise worth millions of dollars – Zoolander returned for another film. In place of a funny script and a decipherable plot, the sequel shoves in endless celebrity cameos. Skrillex, Susan Boyle and Justin Bieber are one of the 39 celebrities that appear in the film, but the force of star power fails to make Zoolander 2 enjoyable.227 I Still Know What You Did Last SummerAn island getaway becomes the setting of predictable kills and lazy thrills in this sub-par slasher. Jennifer Love Hewitt, haunted by the events of the first film, leads a cast running for their lives. The implausibly gullible teen characters still scream, the red herrings are still obvious, and we still know how it’s all going to end.Jaws 2 sees the great white original reduced to a lukewarm b-movie filled with bad special effects and clumsy editing. The only positive thing about Jaws 2 is that all the characters are so annoying that it’s actually pretty satisfying watching them get eaten alive. See also Jaws 3, 4 and 5.He might have been a crazed narcissist, but Patrick Bateman deserved better than this sequel. Thankfully, no one actually remembers that American Psycho 2 exists, or that Mila Kunis is the lead, which is good because it ruins the ambiguous ending of the original film. No amount of peppermint sheet masks could ever clean this mess of a movie up. Deciding to leave Baby in the corner, Havana Nights shares little with the original Dirty Dancing. Patrick Swayze’s simmering dance instructor becomes a charisma deprived pool boy. Our heroine has been replaced by an uptight WASP and worst of all there’s no overhead lift. Your eyes will be left hungry for more.Even if you don’t like James Cameron’s 1997 Oscar-winning behemoth, it’s hard to forget the iconic image of a ship and its passengers meeting their watery doom. The digital effects of Titanic II, however, look like a child’s version of the original’s visuals. The plot – about a boat literally named Titanic II that takes its maiden voyage 100 years after the first – is equally creaky.Ten years after the original film, Mac Davis and Jackie Gleason fill in for Paul Newman and Robert Redford in this heist remake. Considering the movie’s clumsy mobster dialogue and slow-moving plot, the audience in 1983 might have felt like they were the ones who had really been hoodwinked.827 Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2The original Blair Witch changed the face of horror forever, inspiring hysteria with its cheap but innovative found-footage hook. Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 has better production values, but manages to be far less clever. A group of students visiting the first film’s location find themselves in danger, and the plot unravels from there.John Rambo is stripped of any the nuance he had in the first film, becoming an all-American macho cliche and increasing his body count through cartoonish violence. The ex-soldier tears through Vietnam to rescue American prisoners of war as a one man army, seemingly impervious to bullets or logic. If the absurd plot doesn’t jar for you, the politics probably will.Given the global recession that hung over this follow-up to the original 1987 Wall Street, director Oliver Stone could have made a far more interesting and timely film. A cast including Michael Sheen and Shia LaBeouf provide diminishing returns in a tale of greed that ultimately pulls its punches.1127 Weekend at Bernie\u0027s 2You may ask yourself how it’s possible to make a sequel to a film based on two friends pretending a corpse is still alive in order to party. The makers of Weekend at Bernie’s 2 were probably asking themselves the same thing in 1993. This tired comedy never crosses over from stupid into funny, despite many of the cast returning to try and recapture the dubious magic.The sequel to Donnie Darko toys with the concept of time, by wasting yours. The dialogue is awful, the acting wooden, and you don’t even get to see an angsty black haired Jake Gyllenhaal in all his blue-eyed glory. Director of the original, Richard Kelly, was so offended by S. Darko he described the experience of watching it as “horribly violating”.Robert De Niro’s reputation continued to devalue with the third installment of the Meet The Parents series. The title indicates how much effort was put into this family comedy, which relies on under-the-belt hits to wring any laughs out of its audience.This follow-up to the flashy 2013 film squanders the only reason it would have a sequel, and somehow is not named Now You See Me Now. The sleight-of-hand magic here is all style and no substance, and the endless overcomplicated reveals of characters tricking each other become very irritating.Mulan is a gender-bending, brave heroine who refuses to conform to society\u0027s expectations of her. That is, until she reappears in the Disney sequel as a devoted wife who is more than willing to comply with her husbands demands. Now even her pet dragon Mushu doesn’t like her. 1627 Son of the MaskJim Carrey is replaced by Alan Cumming in this low-budget comedy sequel, which manages to be both frantic and boring at once. Director Lawrence Guterman tries to make up for the lack of Carrey’s signature comedic vim by adding a baby and a dog, but their antics can’t distract from the ugly production design.Danny and Sandy flying off into the sunset should have been the end of Grease. But money-hungry film execs brought us back to Rydell High for sequel fans were hopelessly undevoted to. I hated that film with a vengeance and could not believe how bad it was, said Sandy stand-in Michelle Pfieffer years later. At the time I was young and didn\u0027t know any better.1827 Dumb and Dumber ToStupider even than its title, the Farrelly brothers’ sequel puts its stars (Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels) through an overlong retread of past material. The broad humour feels decades out of date, and the energy that propelled the original through its juvenile jokes is gone. It’s hard to imagine who was the target audience for these gross-out sight gags.Hitchcock’s 1963 film The Birds was a masterclass in suspense. The birds that menace Tippi Hedron and the other inhabitants of Bodega Bay become genuinely disturbing through a slow, atmospheric build of tension. This made-for-TV sequel has the same avian threat, and some of the same cast, but none of the classic thrills.Sharon Stone had bad instincts when she agreed to this film. Even a new take on her iconic leg-crossing interrogation scene couldn’t save this sequel from one of the worst rotten tomato ratings on record. It managed to make less than $6m Stateside on a $70m budget.Amy Adams tries her best to tear into her role as a sadistic, sex-obsessed bully but the script for Cruel Intentions 2 – strictly speaking, a prequel, but sssh – is so bad that even she failed to save it. When her stepbrother Sebastian moves into her Mum’s Manhattan mansion, she barges into his shower and warns him, no one is going to threaten my cushy life. What teenager would ever say cushy life? Did a Mean Girls sequel happen if Tina Fey wasn’t around to write it? No, no it did not. A Plastics vs nerds turf war in the pits of the high school jungle just doesn’t work without Fey’s tight one-liners. In Mean Girls 2 we hear none of the “on Wednesdays we wear pink” “that\u0027s why her hair is so big. It\u0027s full of secrets” “you can’t sit with us” zingers that made the original film so magical. Although the soundtrack had its fans, this film is essentially a remake of the 1980 original without one half of the titular Blues Brothers (John Belushi died in 1982). Bafflingly, he is replaced by a 10-year old child in sunglasses. It’s half as funny and nowhere near as infectiously fun, but if you only care about the music, that might not matter.Infamous for ruining what would have been, in many critics’ eyes, a perfect trio of movies, The Godfather Part III delivers a slow anti-climax. The film has its defenders, but given the calibre of the first two Godfathers, this last instalment is the black sheep of the family.A young Hilary Swank stars in the fourth Karate Kid film, a precursor to the modern trend of rebooting ailing franchises with a female lead. Pat Morita as Mr Miyagi is charming as always, but the script is mostly recycled. There are a couple of interesting differences: Swank has a pet hawk, Buddhist monks dance to the Cranberries, and there’s almost no fighting. But what’s a Karate Kid sequel without the Kid or the karate?It might be called Staying Alive, but you won’t want to after watching this sequel. Six years after our hero Tony Manero made white polyester bell bottoms popular, we check back in on him as he auditions for a new Broadway musical called Satan’s Alley. There are far too many romantic subplots, oiled up chests and loincloths to make this film okay. Keanu Reeves wisely didn’t pick up the phone for this Razzie-winning action thriller. The speeding bus rigged by a bomber in the 1994 film is bizarrely replaced by a cruise ship here, making the action a lot slower and more boring. Poor Sandra Bullock is given nothing interesting to do, and surely must have been tempted to look for a lifeboat. Like a reliable friend – or a movie franchise worth millions of dollars – Zoolander returned for another film. In place of a funny script and a decipherable plot, the sequel shoves in endless celebrity cameos. Skrillex, Susan Boyle and Justin Bieber are one of the 39 celebrities that appear in the film, but the force of star power fails to make Zoolander 2 enjoyable.227 I Still Know What You Did Last SummerAn island getaway becomes the setting of predictable kills and lazy thrills in this sub-par slasher. Jennifer Love Hewitt, haunted by the events of the first film, leads a cast running for their lives. The implausibly gullible teen characters still scream, the red herrings are still obvious, and we still know how it’s all going to end.Jaws 2 sees the great white original reduced to a lukewarm b-movie filled with bad special effects and clumsy editing. The only positive thing about Jaws 2 is that all the characters are so annoying that it’s actually pretty satisfying watching them get eaten alive. See also Jaws 3, 4 and 5.He might have been a crazed narcissist, but Patrick Bateman deserved better than this sequel. Thankfully, no one actually remembers that American Psycho 2 exists, or that Mila Kunis is the lead, which is good because it ruins the ambiguous ending of the original film. No amount of peppermint sheet masks could ever clean this mess of a movie up. Deciding to leave Baby in the corner, Havana Nights shares little with the original Dirty Dancing. Patrick Swayze’s simmering dance instructor becomes a charisma deprived pool boy. Our heroine has been replaced by an uptight WASP and worst of all there’s no overhead lift. Your eyes will be left hungry for more.Even if you don’t like James Cameron’s 1997 Oscar-winning behemoth, it’s hard to forget the iconic image of a ship and its passengers meeting their watery doom. The digital effects of Titanic II, however, look like a child’s version of the original’s visuals. The plot – about a boat literally named Titanic II that takes its maiden voyage 100 years after the first – is equally creaky.Ten years after the original film, Mac Davis and Jackie Gleason fill in for Paul Newman and Robert Redford in this heist remake. Considering the movie’s clumsy mobster dialogue and slow-moving plot, the audience in 1983 might have felt like they were the ones who had really been hoodwinked.827 Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2The original Blair Witch changed the face of horror forever, inspiring hysteria with its cheap but innovative found-footage hook. Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 has better production values, but manages to be far less clever. A group of students visiting the first film’s location find themselves in danger, and the plot unravels from there.John Rambo is stripped of any the nuance he had in the first film, becoming an all-American macho cliche and increasing his body count through cartoonish violence. The ex-soldier tears through Vietnam to rescue American prisoners of war as a one man army, seemingly impervious to bullets or logic. If the absurd plot doesn’t jar for you, the politics probably will.Given the global recession that hung over this follow-up to the original 1987 Wall Street, director Oliver Stone could have made a far more interesting and timely film. A cast including Michael Sheen and Shia LaBeouf provide diminishing returns in a tale of greed that ultimately pulls its punches.1127 Weekend at Bernie\u0027s 2You may ask yourself how it’s possible to make a sequel to a film based on two friends pretending a corpse is still alive in order to party.

Altogether, the contracts for the initial 10-month period total 967 million US dollars.This is the last piece that we need in order to get to the moon by 2024, Mr Bridenstine said.Nasa shares images of \u0027doomed\u0027 Comet Atlas as it breaks into piecesHe noted it will be the first lunar lander since the last Apollo moon mission in 1972.Over the next 10 months, each company will refine its concept and Nasa will decide which lander to test first.Mr Bridenstine said Nasa will go with the company that has the highest probability of success by 2024.Nasa will rely on its own Orion capsules and Space Launch System megarockets - still under development - to launch astronauts to the moon.The two other companies, Boeing and Vivace, put in bids but were eliminated early on, leaving the three awarded contracts.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

The Dynetics lander is so low to the ground that only a few steps are needed, like a front porch, a feature that Nasa gave high marks for safety and efficiency.SpaceX is using its own Starship spacecraft - still under development in Texas - and its own rockets. Blue Origin and Dynetics are partnering with numerous subcontractors, including commercial launch companies.Going commercial, Mr Bridenstine said, will drive down costs while increasing access.It builds off of Nasa\u0027s commercial cargo and crew programs for the International Space Station.Just last November, SpaceX and Blue Origin were among the companies that won contracts to make cargo deliveries to the moon.Nasa wants the new Artemis moon-landing programme to be sustainable, unlike Apollo, with multiple missions and multiple locations on the lunar surface.While only one company will carry the first woman and next man to the lunar surface, all three will participate over the long haul, officials noted.By learning how to live and work on another world - the moon - Nasa will be better equipped to eventually send astronauts to Mars, Mr Bridenstine said.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe letter, which was also signed by campaign groups including Hope not Hate and the Community Security Trust, was addressed to the heads of Facebook, YouTube, where Icke has 899,000 subscribers, Twitter, where Icke’s account has 288,000 followers, and Amazon.“There is a moral duty on each of you to act,” it said. “Please remove David Icke from your platforms.”It was published on Friday morning, as Facebook appears to have removed Icke’s main account, which had almost 800,000 “likes”.Almost half of Britons believe coronavirus is ‘man-made’, poll finds5G conspiracy theory most common fake news story about coronavirusMuslims targeted with ‘dangerous’ conspiracy theories during lockdownBut the “David Icke – Headlines” page, with a smaller following of 68,000, and London Real, an account with 586,000 followers that regularly publishes interviews with Icke, remained online.A post on Icke’s website called Facebook “fascist”, and included a message from Facebook reading: “Your page has been unpublished for going against the Facebook Community Standards on health misinformation that could cause physical harm.”Polling previously commissioned by Hope Not Hate found that 51 per cent of British people had heard of Icke, and one in eight had read or watched his claims in the past six months.Broadcaster London Live was sanctioned by Ofcom for interviewing Icke and YouTube and Facebook removed the footage.But the CCDH report said the “piecemeal” response allowed Icke to launch a fresh drive for new followers using the publicity, leading to a huge expansion of his audience.Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the CCDH, said: “While people around the world make enormous sacrifices to stall this pandemic, social media firms are instead profiting from the proliferation of misinformation on their platforms.“Misinformation puts all of our lives at risk by encouraging the public not to comply with clinical guidance.“It’s time to stop giving valuable airtime on their platform to the most dangerous voices and instead join with the rest of us in trying to contain this lethal pandemic. The reckless endangerment of public safety by greedy social media firms must stop.”A spokesperson for Twitter said it was removing coronavirus-related content “when it has a call to action that could potentially cause harm”.“We will not take enforcement action on every tweet that contains incomplete or disputed information about Covid-19,” a statement added.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Indeed, they have become four times as frequent\u0026nbspin the past half-century.Since the 1970s, it is\u0026nbspestimated at least three dozen infectious diseases have emerged from human interference with animals, including Sars, Mers, Ebola, bird flu, swine flu and the Zika virus. As far back as 2007 the World Health Organisation warned that infectious diseases were emerging at a rate that had not been seen before.The spread of the viruses is put down to a deadly combination of wildlife trafficking and consumption, increasing human encroachment into wildlife habitats as more people live in densely populated areas – and air travel, which enables pathogens to take hold globally.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThree years ago, an article\u0026nbsppublished by the US National Centre for Biotechnology Information stated, presciently: “The Aids and influenza pandemics have claimed and will continue to claim millions of lives. The recent Sars and Ebola epidemics have threatened populations across borders. The emergence of Mers may well be warning signals of a nascent pandemic threat.”Zoonotic diseases are complex, and it’s sometimes impossible to say a virus has disappeared, because it might have many different strains, and might mutate and lie dormant. This is a timeline of the main zoonotic diseases to have hit us since the start of the 20th century:Wildlife trade continues in Asia amid calls for restrictions China tries to shut down wildlife trade but markets remain openBlack-market trade ‘may undermine Vietnam ban on disease-rife markets’Stray dogs eating bat meat ‘could have sparked coronavirus pandemic’The 1918 flu pandemic: This was the most severe pandemic in modern times, killing at least 50 million people in two years. It is widely believed that the virus originated in birds because it shared genetic mutations with the bird flu virus later found in Asia, and could have transferred to horses in the trenches of the first world war before spreading to humans. This is disputed, with one study suggesting it came from mammals.Asian flu, 1957:\u0026nbspIn February 1957, a new influenza virus, known as H2N2 emerged in east Asia, which spread into a pandemic. It originated from an avian influenza virus, causing an estimated 1.1 million deaths worldwide.HIV: First identified in 1981, the disease is thought to have been acquired by people in central Africa hunting chimpanzees and coming into contact with their infected blood. However, studies show that HIV may have jumped from apes to humans as far back as the late 1800s, and it has existed in the West since at least the mid to late 1970s. HIV has killed about 35 million people to date, according to the World Health Organisation.Sars:\u0026nbspSevere acute respiratory syndrome is another type of coronavirus, which killed at least 770 people globally in an epidemic in 2002-3. Most victims were in southern China, Vietnam and Singapore. Scientists are not certain of its origins but like Covid-19 it’s thought it could have come from bats and spread to other animals such as civet cats, which are commonly sold in squalid conditions in street markets. The epidemic resulted in more than 8,000 cases, in 26 countries. Of those, 774 died.Swine flu: In 2009-2010 a new strain of flu emerged in pigs in Mexico. The H1N1 virus killed nearly tens of thousands of people in a global pandemic that spread to 214 countries in less than a year. However, overall the outbreak was not as serious as originally predicted, largely because many older people were already immune to it. And the NHS says it now circulates each year and is considered a normal seasonal flu strain, which is covered by the annual seasonal flu vaccine. A study in 2013 suggested between 123,000 and 200,000 people globally may have died as a result of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.Mers:\u0026nbspFirst identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome is also a coronavirus whose symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. With an estimated death rate of 35 per cent, the disease has killed 858 people, according to the WHO. Again, scientists think it spread to humans from bats, this time via camels.Ebola: A 2014–2016 outbreak in West Africa was the largest and most complex Ebola outbreak since the virus was first discovered in 1976, killing 11,300 people. Scientists say it began with a child in Guinea who came into contact with infected bats, but it has since been widely linked to the killing and butchering of bush meat, including monkeys, chimps, antelopes, fruit bats, porcupines and rats.Zika: First identified in Uganda in 1947 in monkeys, the mosquito-borne virus caused alarm in 2015, when it was thought to be the cause of thousands of cases of microcephaly – a shorter-than-normal head – in babies in Brazil. Outbreaks soon appeared throughout the Americas, Africa and other regions. It was thought to have killed 29 babies.Bird flu: Avian influenza, also called avian flu or bird flu, has many different strains but one of those, H7N9, has caused 1,568 cases in humans and 616 deaths worldwide since 2013, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.Another strain of the virus, H5N1, first identified in 1997, spread across east and southeast Asia, killing six people in Hong Kong and leading to vast swathes of chickens and turkeys – from Hong Kong to Britain – having to be culled early after contracting the disease. To date 861 cases of human H5N1 infection and 455 deaths have been reported.\u0026nbspThe highest number of infections and deaths were in Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand. The H5N1 virus, which has a 60 per cent mortality rate among infected humans, according to WHO, has not gone away, but is thought to have mutated.Bird flu has been linked to rapid intensification of the poultry industry, with thousands of birds crowded together indoors and with compromised immune systems.The Independent is campaigning against the wildlife trade at the core of the Covid-19 pandemic.\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Time is therefore of the essence.“Every passing hour, let alone day, increases the danger for them and I have made that clear to Mr Raab consistently throughout.“But frankly, his conduct in the judicial review has been nothing short of disgraceful.“His whole attitude throughout the case so far has been of a school yard bully, making threats to the parents of bankruptcy if they brought the case at all and attempting to harass them at every step along the way refusing to give them the information they are entitled to.”He added: “He has hired four top barristers to run the case for him and there are numerous lawyers in the government legal department behind him too.“Between them all, all they have managed to do so far is to conspire with him to engage in a scandalous attempted cover up of the truth, when the very opposite should be happening.“It has been like trying to extract hen’s teeth.”Lawyers for alleged Harry Dunn killer Anne Sacoolas seek ‘resolution’Harry Dunn’s family urges government to block Assange extraditionHarry Dunn’s alleged killer worked for CIA, report claimsEpstein’s accusers demand Prince Andrew is exchanged for Anne SacoolasThe Foreign Office has strongly refuted the claim that there was a court order or deadline.A spokesperson said in response: “We have deep sympathy for Harry’s family. We have done and will continue to do everything we properly can to ensure that justice is done.“We are responding to legal action in the judicial review in the normal way and have responded to all the court requirements in full.”The Independent understands the disclosure of documents is expected to be handed over to the family in the course of next week.Mr Seiger also called on the Foreign Office to demand the return of Ms Sacoolas, who is alleged to have been a more senior spy than her husband and to have worked for the CIA.Mr Dunn’s parents, Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn, wrote to Donald Trump last week asking him to review a decision to block an extradition request for their son’s alleged killer.In response, the US State Department reiterated its position that at the time of the accident, and for the duration of her time in the UK, the driver had immunity from criminal jurisdiction.However Ms Charles said she was optimistic about receiving a “personal response” from the US president and secretary of state Mike Pompeo.Additional reporting by Press AssociationShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The performance has a full production team working behind the scenes and is directed by the award-winner Sam Yates.Money raised from ticket sales will be given to The Felix Project, The Independent’s campaign partner, and to support out-of-work professionals in the theatre industry including a costume designer and a stage manager.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSir Tom’s play, a comedy set in a private nursing home, follows a seemingly healthy man who attempts to shut himself off from the world. It is the first of the Remote Reads produced by artistic non-profit organisations Platform Presents and Apples and Oranges Arts.Morrissey said: “I’m very excited to be taking part in this live reading. It’s a beautifully written piece by Tom Stoppard and I’m looking forward to performing it.”How to support our campaignThe former Walking Dead villain, who has been volunteering for The Felix Project for about 18 months, praised the charity for “working tirelessly at this very challenging time”.A depot coordinator for The Felix Project commended Morrissey for being “a brilliant ambassador” for the charity.“From his first shift, he was grabbing crates, ing in, just going above and beyond.”\u0026nbspThe Independent launched the Help The Hungry campaign to support the work of The Felix Project in redistributing food to frontline charities, vulnerable iniduals and NHS staff during the coronavirus crisis.Sir Tom said: “It’s a delightful surprise to find that a play that I haven’t really thought about for over half a century is getting a new production, especially with such a stunning cast. It’s about the last thing I expected and I’m quite excited about it.“The play was actually written as one half of a 60-minute slot, the other half of which was a documentary about chess players. The idea was that the film and the play would somehow complement each other. The idea was that the man in the play and the chess players were finding some kind of sanctuary in a closed world.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s extremely disappointing the government have decided to massage the metrics rather than admit they fell short, as this will only undermine public confidence.”He said that “the British public won’t be so easily fooled by manipulation” and that the UK was “still miles off the large-scale testing programme that will be an essential part of any plan to ease out of lockdown through a test, trace and isolate approach”.Created with Sketch.Silence for key workers who lost lives to coronavirus Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Staff react outside Salford Royal

counted once, and you can count tests when they go out or when they come back in, and whichever way you do it we still meet the target,” he said.He added that the use of home testing kids was “very satisfactory” despite concern that results from the self-swab kits may not be as accurate.Professor Newton had previously stated: “For any tests which go outside of the control of the programme, they are counted as soon as they leave the programme. That’s for the tests that go out to people home and in satellite centres.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

bid to achieve 100,000 daily coronavirus tests by the end of April, with official figures released at Downing Street showing 122,347 tests in the UK on Thursday.But there were accusations that the government had moved the goalposts to achieve the ambitious deadline, by including more than 27,000 home-testing kits at the point they were sent out to members of the public rather than waiting until\u0026nbspthe test has\u0026nbspbeen completed.Thursday’s figure - on the final day of the deadline - represented a leap of more than 18,000 from the previous day’s tally of 81,611.Sharing the

though the UK\u0027s\u0026nbsp1,023,824 remains well behind\u0026nbspGermany, where 50,000 were being tested a day as early as\u0026nbspthe start of April.Mr Hancock also announced that he aims to have an army of 18,000 contact tracers in place by mid-May to track down contacts of those shown by tests to be positive for Covid-19.Speaking at the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing, Mr Hancock revealed that the total UK\u0026nbspdeath toll has risen to 27,510 over the course of the outbreak, with 739 fatalities in all settings on Thursday.Created with Sketch.Silence for key workers

“incredible achievement”.He said: “I knew that it was an audacious goal, but we needed an audacious goal, because testing is so important for getting Britain back on her feet.”He praised his team for working “tirelessly… with grit and determination” to reach the goal.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But many would have expected the 100,000 promise to have been met by actually carrying out testing, not simply because 39,000 kits had been mailed out. Tonight’s headline figure shouldn’t count tests that hadn’t been used -\u0026nbspor indeed, might never be used - as a completed test. Ministers promised transparency - the public and NHS staff deserve clarity.“In any event, this figure was never a strategy. We need a fully resourced testing, isolation and tracing programme and ministers should be using this lockdown time to put the fundamentals of infectious disease control in place.”Mr Hancock said that the testing capacity now available was “crucial to suppress the virus” and would “help us to unlock the lockdown”.It would be backed up by an initial 18,000 contact-tracers to be in place by the middle of May, with more to be recruited if required.“The combination of contact tracers and new technology, through our new Covid-19 NHS app, will help tell us where the virus is spreading and help everyone to control new infections,” he said.Speaking a day after prime minister Boris Johnson promised a “roadmap” out of lockdown, Mr Hancock said: “In recent weeks we’ve had to impinge on historic liberties to protect our NHS and our loved ones and yet our goal must be freedom.“Freedom from the virus, yes - and we will not lift measures until it is safe to do so - but also we care about the restoration of social freedom and economic freedom too – each citizen’s right to do as they please.“For now, we’re working together to stay home, we’re impinging on the freedom of all for the safety of all.“With this next mission of test, track and trace, I’m seeking a solution that allows us, by each of us participating, to target the measures that are needed with much more precision and so to reassert, as much as is safely possible, the liberty of us all.”Prof Newton rejected suggestions that the UK’s slow adoption of mass testing had “kept us in lockdown a day longer”.Stay-at-home measures were introduced in March not because of a lack of tests but because of the wide circulation of the Covid-19 virus in the population, he said.“Cases were popping up with no obvious connection to other cases and the infection was entering the exponential growth phase and at that point access to limitless testing even if we had had it would’ve made no difference,” he said.“The decision to enter into lockdown would have been the same and would’ve been taken at the same time.“In the same way the route out of lockdown has not been blocked by low levels of testing. We can relax social distancing only when the Government’s five tests are met, and that means particularly getting the infection rate right down.“Testing will help to keep it out of control once we’re out of lockdown but our levels of testing have not kept us in lockdown a day longer.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

So far the app has been downloaded around 50 million times through the Google Play Store.However with few privacy laws enshrined by India’s legislature and an increasingly authoritarian bent to the leadership of Mr Modi’s ruling BJP party, privacy advocates have warned there is little to prevent the system being abused.Before the lockdown the Indian government was criticised for growing dependence on surveillance networks during outcry over controversial citizenship legislation - including the use of cameras and drones used to track protestors and the curtailing of mobile networks in areas of widespread dissent.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We are constantly thinking about this… What can we do better and what else can we add on?” Mr Tegnell said.“I think the most important thing all the time is to try to do it as well as you can, with the knowledge we have and the tools you have in place. And to be humble all the time because you may have to change.”The country has primarily relied on voluntary measures to fight Covid-19, with Swedes asked to keep distance from each other, work from home where possible and avoid travel.Is Sweden having second thoughts on lockdown?Stefan Lofven, the Swedish prime minister, said last week he was “confident” that the overall strategy was working, despite some scientists accusing the government of running a dangerous experiment on people’s lives.“One reason that we have chosen this strategy, and where we have supported the agencies, is that all measures have to be sustainable over time,” he said.Sweden’s outbreak has so far killed 2,669 people, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centre, which puts the country’s death toll at a much higher number compared to neighbouring countries Norway and Finland, where strict measures have been introduced.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastHowever, Sweden has seen a much lower number of deaths than France, Spain, Italy and the UK, where lockdowns have been used.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Below are the times for London:Muslims must fast between sunrise and sunset every day in Ramadan.However, they are able to enjoy one meal pre-dawn and one after sunset each day.Iftar is the meal eaten after the fourth prayer of the day, the Maghrib, which happens just after sunset.In Arabic, tar means break of a fast, and fatoor means breakfast.It is the second meal of the day during Ramadan as those taking part in the fast must not eat or drink anything during daylight hours.The Suhur is consumed in the morning and can be as early as .am.The Iftar is considered a blessing, often enjoyed as a community.It is thought not eating during daylight hours, as well as not drinking, smoking or indulging in sex will lead to greater taqwa or consciousness of God.The time of spiritual reflection, improvement and increased devotion and worship is thought to teach followers how to be more self-disciplined and have empathy for those less fortunate.But with lockdown measures in place, gatherings will need to be kept according to government guidelines.This year, Ramadan began on Thursday, April  and is set to end on Saturday, May .The fast is  days long and the beginning and end are determined by the lunar Islamic calendar – meaning it depends on when the new moon is sighted.Hilal, the crescent, is usually a day or more after the astronomical new moon.The night of power or night of decree is considered the holiest night of the year, as Muslims believe the first revelation of the Koran was sent down to Muhammad on this night.Its thought to have occurred on an odd-numbered night during the last ten days of Ramadan - the st, rd, th, th or th.The first day of fasting began on April, ,  and the final Iftar should take place on the evening of May .The holiday of Eid al-Fitr marks the end of Ramadan and the beginning of the next lunar month.This annual observance is regarded as one of the Five Pillars of Islam.A common greeting is Ramadan Mubarak, which means have a blessed Ramadan."},{"url":null,"title":"lockdown time think about freedom","story":"LONDON’S Millennium Bridge connecting the busy South Bank with the busier City on Monday, April , .There was not a soul in sight at .pm on my daily Government-sanctioned walk home from the talkRADIO studio.It was the same scene in the once-bustling theatre district of Covent Garden and as I wandered past the usually-heaving Holborn Station on to Fleet Street, where the pubs are now boarded up and there’s an eerie still in the air made more  Days Later-like by the unusually loud seagulls craving food.Our unrivalled capital city, which survived the great fire, the Blitz, the IRA, al-Qaeda and IS, has been temporarily silenced for the greater good.So why is it that any time I switch on the internet or social media I’m bombarded with negativity about how the UK — and London in particular — has failed during lockdown I’ve had it with this untrue, unfair and frankly offensive narrative being spewed by out-of-touch, Government-hating journalists and publicity-hungry Twitter commentators.Their only evidence  Harmless pictures showing families sitting down in the middle of a park enjoying an ice cream, folk going for a bike ride on a sunny day and even police officers gathering to clap for the NHS on Westminster Bridge in a show of national unity.The reality, of course, is that the vast majority of us are respecting the rules, at great personal and financial cost. After days of hysterical commentary about increased car usage, the official slides at the Government briefing this week showed it had actually gone down.Is it any wonder that trust in telly journalists, with their constant gotcha questions of ministers and desire to do down our national effort, is plummeting So let me say this in Britain’s biggest newspaper that has maintained the loyalty of our brilliant army of readers with hysteria-free coverage: We have done so well and all deserve to be applauded for our stoic efforts to flatten the curve.Even at the start of March, nobody could have imagined that the UK would spend six weeks without the Premier League, McDonald’s or nightclubs Let alone losing those joys of our national le at a time when everyone other than key workers had to stay at home.You’ve missed weddings, births, signicant birthdays, important operations and even funerals. That’s why I am so proud of the citizens of this country.Do not let anyone tell you that the UK didn’t take this evil disease seriously. We did. Unquestionably.But that doesn’t mean we should now stay silent and accept a continued loss of our freedom and liberties. Our first goal is achieved: We avoided the NHS being overrun.Demanding answers from our leaders about what’s next and how we reopen our country does not for a single second make you disloyal — it makes you even more of a patriot.THE Greatest Dancer has been axed by the BBC.Which is bad news for star judge Cheryl Tweedy, who doesn’t seem to enjoy the same bankability she did at the height of her X Factor glory days .But good news for Girls Aloud fans like me as every solo flop just makes the reunion even more inevitable.lIn other exciting girl band news, the Spice Girls are in talks to do another world reunion tour.SADIQ KHAN has done so alarm-ingly little to help Londoners during this crisis – no masks, no sanitisers or PPE on public transport – that it might be time for the London Mayor to consider changing his name to Sadiq Can’t.MY love letter to the things I never thought I’d miss living in London . . .ONCE upon a time there lived a celebrity journalist called Omid Scobie.He revelled in the sort of nonsense that used to fill the pages of Star Magazine, one of the UK’s most downmarket celeb titles.For many years, until very recently, Mr Scobie also flogged story after story to popular newspapers about celebs and the royals, including the Mail on Sunday.Nothing wrong with that so far.

Heres everything you need to know.No, but they will be.The majority of councils closed refuse facilities due to staff absences and to comply with social distancing guidelines as part of lockdown in March, but were ordered to reopen this week.Councils acted without any formal instruction from the Government, which deem dumps an essential service.Announcing the dumps order to the Commons on Monday, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said: “Our binmen and women have done a fantastic job maintaining the vast majority of collections.”But he added: “I am asking councils to plan the organised reopening of household waste collection sites. I expect this to happen over the coming weeks.”Parts of the country were left with household waste collection services only, triggering a  per cent rise in fly-tipping.The first reopenings of dumps in Bolton and Manchester caused massive tailbacks of over  cars.A spokesperson for the County Councils Network - representative of England’s  county councils - said: “Councils would like to have kept recycling centres open during this period.“However, government guidance was clear that a journey to a household waste recycling centre was not considered essential travel.However,  per cent of bin collections have been continuing to collect recyclable waste during this time.Robert Jenrick, the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government has asked councils to plan the reopening of tips and recycling centres.Hes asked them to be reopened within the coming weeks, amid worries there has been a rise in fly-tipping since they closed.He said: Our bin men and women have done a fantastic job maintaining the vast majority of collections.“I’m asking councils to plan the organised re-opening of household waste collection sites. I expect this to happen over the coming weeks and will be publishing amended guidance shortly.”Officials are issuing advice to councils to ensure they can safely operate amid the coronavirus pandemic.Sites in Greater Manchester and Bolton opened again on May , but with social distancing measures in place - including a one-in-one-out policy.However, Derbyshire County Council said it was unable to say when services would resume.And North Yorkshire County Council said sites will remain closed for public safety and to cut non-essential travel.The Greater Manchester Combined Authority says an odd and even number plate system is in place to reduce the number of vehicles on site, reports the BBC.Hampshire County Council suggested daily cleaning and a reduction in the number of vehicles on-site.Lancashire County Council and Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council have plans to implement an online booking system, where households can choose a slot to drop off their rubbish.Similarly, Wirral Council suggested a one-way system and a reduction of vehicles to just three at a time.Northumberland County Council will also be reducing the number of vehicles and advise people to remain in their cars when queuing.Surrey County Council said fewer types of waste will be accepted.All workers will also require PPE.Find out whether your local recycling centre is open by heading to your councils website.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Especially when you are dealing with a government like China’s.As viewers of the series Chernobyl know, non-democratic governments have a history of covering up their errors.In that case, the Soviets did everything they could to stop the world learning about the meltdown at their nuclear reactor.Today the Communist Party of China has done everything it can to hide what happened in Wuhan. Especially the origins of the disease which has shut down the world.Yesterday President Trump broke one of the taboos in all this. Which is needed.The question is: What is the likelihood the coronavirus originated in the exact part of China that has a laboratory looking into just such viruses To date the Chinese authorities have allowed the world to believe in the bat-eating, wet-market theory on the origins of the epidemic.They prefer embarrassment over suspicion.But all along, people have wondered whether something less “accidental” is at play.Now the US President has told reporters he has seen strong evidence that Covid- originated from the laboratory in Wuhan. The President’s remarks change the game.China should be in enough trouble as it is. Evenit was true that the virus is an accident caused by a strange food custom, the Chinese Communist Party has a lot to answer for.Why did it keep the news of the virus to itself for so many weeks  Why did it pretend it is not lethal as we now know it is Or pretend that it was hard to transmit  Why did they refuse to allow in inspectors from the World Health Organisation And why have the WHO now been refused inclusion in China’s own investigation into the origins of Covid- Questions also remain over the WHO’s seeming collusion with China over the crisis.The CCP’s actions would be bad enoughthe virus came from a wet market. But it must know that it is in a whole dferent realm of troublethe virus turns out to have come from its lab.If the CCP knew all along the virus had leaked from there then its cover-up is even more appalling. Because it means they knew exactly what they — and soon the world — were dealing with.But in the absence of trust-worthy information, darker and wilder theories take shape in the shadows. For example, could the virus have come from the Wuhan lab and been released deliberately To those deeply skeptical of the CCP, it’s not hard to believe it might have done that.They are in a trade war with America with a President who was making them lose. Now the CCP has managed to shut down the entire US economy with a virus.The question for the rest of the world will soon be simple: What to do about this There are several steps. The first is to try to determine exactly how this virus came about. To have an international  look into every possible cause. With no area of inquiry ruled out.That  should also investigate how the communist regime lied their way through this virus. We need to learn just how they managed to make a local problem into a global one.Then there is the question of what price they should pay. For accidental or not, there is no way that the CCP should be allowed to get away with this.Goodness knows they have tried. Throughout this crisis there have been a set of PR gestures by the Chinese authorities.The government and government-linked firms such as Huawei have made a big show of donating masks and other equipment.It is dismal. Like watching somebody who has just burned down your house offering you a watering can.Last month, German newspaper Bild infuriated China by suggesting Beijing should pay reparations for the coronavirus pandemic.It printed an “invoice’ for nearly billion eurosleading the Chinese embassy in Berlin to accuse the paper of stirring up prejudice.But once the engine of the other global economies — including ours — roars back into motion, we must make China pay.We must re-think our relationship with them. We should recognise the country is not just a competitor but a liability.We must punish them for the large-scale theft of information from British and American businesses it has engaged in for years.We must do whatever we can to disrupt their “belt-and-road” empire-building, which the CCP has worked its way into, and “bought up” small and poor countries.But it is not only such countries that are at the mercy of China and its President Xi Jinping. We may be in Britain too.Before this Wuhan disaster kicked off, our Government approved Huawei to provide part of our G capability.All of our allies warned against this. Our intelligence-sharing partners in the Five Eyes networkall strongly warned the British Government against allowing a firm that is indistinguishable from the CCP from having such access.Experience shows Chinese firms cannot be trusted to provide such sensitive — and strategic — technology.The Huawei decision was a rare misstep by the Johnson government. Now is the time to correct it.We do not need to provoke China. But nor do we need to pander to it. And we should not be putting our future security in their hands.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

Living by the sea, in paradise, with a triangular- torsoed Hollywood hunk.But thenyou take a glance at your social media, you’ll notice that absolutely everyone  is living the Hemsworth dream.It’s an endless parade of people’s perfect sourdough baking and of jolly board games with the kids.This morning, my Instagram feed featured a young family doing a fancy dress dinner, a girl on an enormous horse, a woman sprawled on the bonnet of a Mercedes SL, a man with a cute dog, doing exercises, and a shot of some cows taken through a wisteria bush.On Instagram, no one is ever bored, it never rains and everyone’s breasts are perfect. Especially Chris Hemsworth’s.This is having an effect on the nation’s teenagers. They have been told there will be no exams this year and that all their school work was for nothing. They’ve been told they have to stay indoors and that they can’t see their friends.And it’s driving them mad because they do not read newspapers. They do not listen to the BBC news. And they replaced Radio  with Spoty five years ago.This means they never hear any actual news. So they don’t know what’s going on.Instead they look at their phonesand all they can see are pretty girls with swimsuits up their a*** cheeks, and Chris Hemsworth, and parents who have turned the cellar into a nightclub and lots of cute ducklings.And they’re thinking, as they watch the rain trickle down the windows at their house: “Why can’t I have some of that ”But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

So I’ve come up with another idea . . .If you are an old person stuck in a tower block, waiting for Covid- to stick its warty little head through the letterbox, post a picture of your surroundings on Instagram. Don’t hold back. Show us the overflowing cat litter and the photograph of your husband, alone in his hospital bed.Show us also pictures of your sister who is in a care home and hasn’t had a visitor for five weeks.And your food cupboard which has nothing in it any more. And your empty bottle of Senokot.In fact, we should all get in on the act. Don’t wait for a joyous moment to photograph and share. Send us instead pictures of stuff you didn’t enjoy.The particularly gruesome bit of wax you’ve just pulled out of your left ear. The turd your dog just did on the mat. Your fat other half slobbing out in front of the TV.Your kids throwing Monopoly pieces at one another after a row over Fenchurch Street station.Instead of sharing your perfect loaf, send pictures of the charred wreck that went wrong, the scarf full of dropped stitches, the wonky self-assembly garden furniture that broke the first time you sat on it.Hit us with the reality of lockdown. Admit that it’s one part happiness and nine parts ditch water.And then maybe teenagers will start to understand that le is bookended by the lucky and the not so lucky. At one end you’ve got the Hemsworths. At the other you’ve got a frightened old man in a tenement block in Bermondsey.Maybe then they will understand they are somewhere in the middle, and stop bloody complaining.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.There is much debate about what increases your chances of dying from Covid-.Well, I don’t know about you but I’ve addressed the issue by sitting on a sofa for six hours a day, eating slabs of Cadbury’s Fruit  Nut chocolate and getting up only to go to the fridge for another bottle of wine.I guess I’m working on the principle that soon I’ll be so fat, there won’t be room in the house for me and the virus as well.But there is one problem.There are now so many empty bottles sitting by the bins at the bottom of the drive I just know my neighbours will assume I’ve been throwing illegal parties, and call the police.A nurse made headlines this week after moaning about the cramped conditions on a London Tube train at .am.She said she was risking her le at work and pointed out that she shouldn’t have to risk it even more while commuting. Fair point, you might think. But hang on.In the olden days – before March – people may well have been on a Tube train at that time because they were coming home from a club.But these days, nobody on a Tube train at quarter to six in the morning is there for fun. They’re ALL going to work.There’s nothing wrong with that. It’s what most of us have been told to do all along. But I do agree that commuting on a cramped Tube is bloody dangerous.So I ask once again for parking restrictions to be lted immediately, as this would allow people to go to work in the blissful self-isolation of their own cars.I WAS told this week, by The Times newspaper no less, that this summer’s must-have accessory is a straw handbag. No it isn’t.As no one’s looking and no one’s going out, this year’s must-have accessory is the pyjama bottom teamed with odd socks.An aerial photograph of Portsmouth taken this week showed that the colour of the sea has turned from the usual mud brown to a shimmering, aquamarine blue.It’s the sort of colour you usually associate with the Caribbean, and it is genuinely amazing.Naturally, green people are saying it happened because the lockdown means less traffic. And they may be right.Or, let me just lob this one in . . .  it happened because the photographer was experimenting with some of the filters on his new phone.My phone’s got so many thatyou gave me long enough, I could take a selfie and make me look like Chris Hemsworth. Or his we. A MINISTER in the South African government an ounced this week that his country has plenty of PPE for front-line health workers and that all patients with Covid- will be given “vibrators”.I think he meant “ventilators”.If he didn’t, well, I guess they’ll die happy.For the past couple of years, farmers have not been allowed to spray their bright yellow oil seed rape with insecticides called neonicotinoids.As a result, a lot of my crop is dead.But on the upside, I’m now seeing more bumble bees than I have in years.

If the current measures start to erode, unforeseen dangers could arise.Yet, move too quickly and you risk being blamed for getting it wrong.In some form continuing to isolate without isolation will be necessary, but avoiding great damage to the most disadvantaged children, many of whom are receiving no schooling at all, is vital for our future.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

Many studies show women are more focused on building community and teams.They are more likely than men to cultivate a erse set of advisers to help them succeed. They are also more likely to follow advice.A study by management consulting firm McKinsey found that women are more people- orientated and spend more time developing and coaching other leaders in their organisation. In other words, they don’t need to reserve all the glory for themselves.There is something  at play too, though. Female leaders are more likely to be blameddecisions are unpopular or ineffective. They are questioned and second-guessed more often than men.But then Covid- entered the equation and presented world leaders with a new challenge — an invisible enemy that is highly contagious, unpredictable and deadly.This pandemic has been an unprecedented test for all concerned.And guess what  A disproportionate number of those who have passed this test — countries such as Germany, New Zealand, Iceland and Finland — have women at the helm.It is not exclusively female-led countries that are doing well, of course. But bearing in mind only seven per cent of all world leaders are women, about  per cent of countries led by women are doing well when it comes to containing Covid-. Global health experts have concluded that one thing that has led to success in tackling coronavirus is — speed.Prof Tom Bollyky, director of global health programme at US think-tank the Council on Foreign Relations, said: “Countries that have not dithered in their response, that have mobilised quickly, have done well.”New Zealand’s PM Jacinda Ardern put it simply: “Go hard and go early.”The number of Covid--related deaths is predicted to be substantially lower in areas where leaders acted sooner, even by a week, because they flattened the curve and prevented new cases.Many women acted first and made the brave decision to shut down le as we knew it, even though that was an unpopular thing to do.But it seems women leaders are listening to World Health Organisation advice and also looking at other countries for guidance.They don’t think they have all the answers but women are able to put their ego to one side and let experts guide them — something which cannot be said of Donald Trump.Incidentally, I have not seen any women leaders making unfounded or dangerous suggestions about possible cures. Can you imagine a woman leader suggesting that people inject Dettol into themselves, as dingbat Trump recently suggested Or can you imagine a woman suggesting to people that they can fight coronavirus and winthey are strong enough This pandemic is not a battle to be fought and won. It is a virus, which can affect literally anyone.No one knows how they will be affected and that bullish “fight it” approach is, in my experience, very male. Conversely, the decision to protect everyone, putting the most at risk first, is more female.It’s interesting that some male leaders seem more interested in covering up the problems. Like Donald Trump, who thinks he is an expert on everything and more fixated on garnering praise for what he has done than fixing and getting right what has not gone so well.I know I am talking in generalisations here but my experience of women is that we want to understand the mistakes and fix them, not cover them up.This pandemic has been full of dficulty and tragedy for everyone.But perhaps one good thing that will come out of it is that the world will acknowledge women deserve an equal  when it comes to leadership.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

Marketplace sales offer goods supplied by so-called secondary sellers - rather than Amazon itself. The world’s biggest retail site hosts their listings.

Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, , and husband Prince William, , decided not to find out the gender of their firstborn, whom would become third in line to the throne. Instead they had a list of potential names lined up depending on whether they welcomed a baby girl or boy. And although we know the couple went on to call their son George Alexander Louis, there was another boyaposs name Kate is said to have been particularly fond of. Royal expert Katie Nicholl previously revealed in Vanity Fair: “Courtiers insisted the pair had not found out the sex of their unborn baby, and friends close to the couple claim William wanted a surprise. “Although Kate apparently suspected it was a boy and had set her heart on the name Alexander, they had not yet decided what to call their firstborn.” Ms Nicholl continued: “Kate was reported to have affectionately referred to her bump as ‘our little grape’ while she was pregnant, and there was a flurry of betting on possible names.”  A friend of the couple also told the author: ”When I saw William a few weeks before the birth he said they didnapost know [the babyaposs gender] and didnapost want to find out. He said there are so few surprises in le — this was one he wanted to keep. “Kate said she thought it was a boy because the baby kicked so much. The couple eventually settled on George for their little boy, which hails back to the Queen’s father, King George VI. The Duke and Duchess did however retain Kate’s favourite name as one of George’s middle names.  The little prince is now affectionately known to pals by his nicknames, which include PG, or PG Tips, after his initials. Meanwhile, Kate admitted it ”slightly terrying” becoming a first-time mum in  and standing on the steps of the Lindo Wing hours after giving birth. As she clutched her new baby boy in her arms the clicking of dozens of photographers and their flashing cameras went off.  Speaking about Georgeaposs debut, she told Giovanna Fletcheraposs Happy Mum, Happy Baby podcast: [It was] slightly terrying, slightly terrying, Iaposm not going to lie. Everyone had been so supportive and both William and I were really conscious that this was something that everyone was excited about and, you know, weaposre hugely grateful for the support that the public had shown us. And actually for us to be able to share that joy and appreciation with the public, I felt was really important. But equally it was coupled with a newborn baby, and inexperienced parents, and the uncertainty of what that held, so there were all sorts of mixed emotions.  Asked what it was like holding her son for the first time, she said: Amazing, amazing. It is extraordinary as I’ve said. How can the human body do that  It is utterly extraordinary actually. And he was very sweet. And also sort of relieved that he was a happy, healthy boy.

Business couple Mike and Jules Keen own Tindale Towers, an award-winning Art Deco mansion featured on Channel ’s I Own Britain’s Best Home. But it could just as easily appear on another C favourite – Rich House, Poor House. It has five bedrooms, a pool, a sauna, a gym, a badminton court, a dance floor, a bar for  people and a six-car garage.

By contrast, a pebble-dashed two-up, two-down next to it in Bishop Auckland, Co Durham is worth barely more than the UK’s average yearly salary and is said to need “cosmetic upgrading”. The modest home has stood empty for some time and is thought to be owned by a London-based investment firm.   Now Mike and Jules, who own a furniture business but admit they need the money from the house sale, canapost wait to see which property goes first. Tindale Towers was put up for sale in  for £,, but the couple took it off the market.  Its new lower price tag is still well over three times the cost of the next dearest house currently listed by the same estate agents – and  times the £, average value of local homes.The agents’ blurb says all floors can be reached via an airy spiral staircase – or a lt. Mike, who says he is “skint”, said: “We’re still paying the bills but we’ve needed the money for a while. It’s a beautul house, it gives the town a good image.” The Keens built Tindale Towers  years ago on the site of their bungalow after buying an adjoining plot of land.  It was inspired by beach villas seen in France and Florida and named after Tindale Mill, where their business was first based. Major selling points of the house next door, which is described by agents as “an ideal investment opportunity”, include a feature fireplace and heat-resistant worktops.

The tea pot kept moving and her boob kept getting in the photo. We just couldn’t stop laughing - it was absolute havoc. One of the June ladies had also had a mastectomy and she put a post it note on her chest saying ‘hands off’ so it was moments like this that helped us get through it. We had such a laugh.The calendar has now raised more than £, for Breast Cancer Care - and its caused a few raised eyebrows across the caravan sites. Kay added: ‘After we had done the calendar, I was walking our dog around our caravan site and a couple of the other caravaners called out to me as I went past, saying they didn’t recognise me with my clothes on.’"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus lockdown exit could see","story":"NewsLe after lockdown could see m distancing cut and Brits back to work within weeksPrime Minister Boris Johnson has claimed Britain is past the peak of its coronavirus outbreak, and is set to reveal a comprehensive plan on how the lockdown will be eased next week - but some reports have already begun to emergeShareCommentsByAnna MacSwan:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video coronavirus-numbers-uk-death-toll-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news coronavirus-lockdown-exit-could-see-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

At the Downing Street briefing on Thursday, the Prime Minister claimed Britain is past the peak of its coronavirus outbreak and that he will reveal a comprehensive plan on how the nation will get back to work and school next week. However preventing a second wave of deadly infections is vital and professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, has warned that We are nowhere near the end of this epidemic. In order to keep the aposRapos - the number of people each Covid- patient infects - below one, any relaxing of restrictions will be gradual. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here  The details wonapost be confirmed until next week at the earliest, but initial reports have given ideas of what le after lockdown could involve. Below we look at some of the major changes that could be headed our way. Back to work by May  Brits couldto work on May  under the Prime Ministeraposs plan to ease lockdown measures. The Tuesday following the late May bank holiday has been highlighted as a possible date for offices, factories and some shops to re-open, according to the Sun. This would allow businesses to get ready to bring in new social distancing measures for workers, such as screens and spaces between desks, designed to prevent any further spread of coronavirus. However, the date could be pushed backthe number of infections has not fallen to a manageable level by this point, the newspaper claims. A Downing Street source told the paper last night that the exact timing is very much a live conversation. Two-metre rule relaxation  Government advice requiring people to stay two metres apart to prevent the spread of coronavirus is being reviewed, according to reports. The Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencieshas been asked to consider the evidence for asking people to stay so far away from each other, thestates. Although current advice in the UK is to remain two metres from other people, the World Health Organisation advises a lesser distance of one metre. The paper claims that the social distancing rule is now a topic of live discussion as ministers map out a plan to ease lockdown restrictions. Fever tests for commuters  It is understood that commuters may have to take their temperatures before boarding public transport when the coronavirus lockdown is eased. The Department for Transport and Public Health England are considering the measure to prevent the highly infectious virus from spreading on crowded trains when the UK begins toto work, The Times reports. Rail operators are also considering requiring passengers to book ahead for busy services, the paper adds, adding that to reduce overcrowding, commuters would reserve a -minute slot online before boarding. First-class carriages may also be scrapped with passengers no longer allowed to get off at some stations, the paper goes on to claim. Under the proposals anyone with a high temperature - a telltale symptom of Covid- - would be required to stay at home. Other measures which have been adopted by other countries include providing hand sanitiser, asking passengers to wear face masks and signs asking people not to use busy services. Premier league proposals  The Premier League has set a target date to restart the football season on June . If its proposals for Project Restart are approved by the government, games would take place behind closed doors so that the current season can be finished, the Sun reports. Clubs are hoping to restart training in mid-May. No timeframe has been given for when fans will be allowed to attend games again, but they will be banned until at least next season. Matches are likely to take place in a small number of stadiums, such as the Emirates in north London or Etihad in Manchester, with no clubs allowed to play in their home ground. Air travel Heathrow Airport boss John Holland-Kaye told PA it would be physically impossible to maintain social distancing measures at airports and that there will need to be better health checks of passengers. He said UK airports should follow countries in Asia which have introduced screening measures, temperature checks and improved hygiene procedures. Passengers may also be required to wear masks during flights. Mr Holland Kaye added: The constraint is not about how many people you can fit on a plane, it will be how many people you can get through an airport safely. Low cost airline WizzAir has resumed flights overseas from Luton Airport - but British Airways is culling , jobs and Ryanair , as other airlines struggle with the impact of the crisis. Rail travel The Rail Delivery Group is coordinating the rail industryaposs response to the pandemic. It said services will continue to run on a reduced timetable and passengers will be given clear advice about how to stay two metres apart. Changes to travel will be made following the Governmentaposs advice and train companies will remind customers of the action they need to take while using their services.  Great Western Railway has said it is looking to increase services from mid-May, with further increases when the Government starts to ease the lockdown. Elsewhere, the Rail, Maritime and Transportunion warned there was zero chance of increasing transport services soon, amid speculation of a rise in journeys on May  or May  when a new rail timetable is due. Industry sources said last week no dates have yet been agreed or announced. More working from home Many companies are set to keep in place changes they have made to deal with the coronavirus crisis, such as staff working from home, a new study suggests. Research by the Institute of Directorsindicated there will also be a greater focus on digital services when the current lockdown ends. Businesses have been innovating in response to the lockdown, with almost one in six of  firms polled reporting they had launched a new product or service, usually involving hand gel or protective equipment. Property services provider CBRE has said British firms should look to Asia as a guide on how offices might approach reopening in the future. It advises against a full throttleto work, with social-distancing measures needing to be reduced gradually and in line with public health guidance. Pubs and restaurants Major takeaway chains such as KFC, Burger King and Pret A Manger started reopening a few branches this week. They have introduced strict safety and social distancing measures including regular handwashing and sanitising every  minutes. There are also restrictions on the amount of customers allowed in a store at the same time.  Costa Coffee is reopening some branches - only for delivery or drive-thru - and has put in place measures to protect staff and customers - such as new social distancing guidelines, enhanced hygiene procedures and personal protective equipment for team members. Meanwhile, pubs are braced for large numbers of people eager to visit their locals when they reopen again.Wetherspoons boss Tim Martin this week voiced an intention to reopen the chain in or around June.But decreased turnover from having far fewer tables to adhere to social distancing may make opening some bars and restaurants unviable. Shopping In the coming weeks, some non-essential businesses will be allowed to open, it is believed. This includes garden centres and car showrooms, provided social distancing can be maintained. Lobby group the British Retail Consortium has guidelines on ensuring the safe reopening of non-essential firms. Suggestions include limiting entry and exit points, using floor markings to outline social distancing and keeping changing rooms closed.  The guidance also suggests installing cleaning stations with hand sanitiser and disinfectant wipes at the front of stores. Contactless payments would be encouraged and self-checkout stations cleaned regularly. Staff who serve customers are to be protected with screens, visors and gloves. Other measures may include one-way systems through stores, a cap on how many people are allowed in at any given time and security guards at the door.

What they didn’t know is that they’d both strike a chord with each other’s partners. Both couples then split up before the newly-single partners got together in a karaoke love swap. Heather Whiteley, , had been with Darren Smith, , for two years before they went along to the event at their local bowls club.Heather said: “I met Darren through Facebook. He was sweet, understanding and easy to talk to.“We were always up for a laugh so when we saw there was a karaoke evening being held at the bowls club, we agreed to go together. “I love a bit of karaoke and it sounded like fun.” While there they got talking to another couple – Peter Brettell, , and Susie Spencer, . Heather said: “We kind of knew Peter and Susie through the local community anyway. “They were involved in running a few karaoke nights and events locally. We had a great time that night, enjoying a sing-song and a few drinks together.” From that meeting in February last year, the two couples became friends, meeting a few times a week for a drink or a singalong session. Heather said: “We added each other on Facebook too and would chat on there. Susie and Peter seemed like a great couple. We weren’t super close, but we all got on well. “But in time, my relationship with Darren hit the rocks. We’d been ­having problems for some time but it took us a while to admit it.  “We were arguing all the time and eventually, in May , we split. “It was a really sad, dficult time, and I was still reeling from the break-up when I found out that Peter and Susie had ended their own relationship, too.” With both couples having split, Heather reached out to Susie’s former partner Peter. “I thought he might need someone to talk to,” she said. It turned out Heather had hit the right note.  “Peter wasn’t the type to talk about his feelings but he admitted he was ­struggling after his split from Susie.“And, as we got ­chatting, it ­became apparent wehad more in ­common than we thought.“We confided in each other. We realised we were the only ones who truly understood what we were both going through.” The pair became a shoulder for each other to cry on and soon began spending more time together. Peter said: “Susie and I had been together for two years but we were arguing a lot before we broke up. We just weren’t a team any more. “Darren knew Susie’s family through the karaoke nights. “We weren’t really close with Darren and Heather but we saw them in the pub quite often and would also chat on Facebook. “When all this happened, I turned to Heather for support.  “I don’t have many friends I can talk to about emotional stuff so when Heather asked meI wanted to talk, I opened up and it went from there. “She really listened to what I had to say and I wasn’t used to that. I felt I hadn’t been able to talk to Susie properly for months.” Heather added: “In time, Peter and I started to get close. I started to feel butterflies in my stomach for the first time in years. “It wasn’t long before we became a couple.”  Love Both pairs have since found lasting love after the karaoke carry-on. Darren and Susie are still together and Heather, who works as a home carer, and Peter, an events organiser, got engaged in September.  Heather, who lives in Winterton, near Scunthorpe, said: “It’s been a bit of a roller coaster but I don’t regret a thing because it led me to Peter, my true love.” And Peter added: “Heather and I got together around the same time as Darren and Susie. It was fast, but it felt right. “It was odd that we ended up ­together and so did they but, to be honest, they are welcome to each other because we are happier than ever.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dad teen who took life","story":"NewsDad of teen who took her own le after watching Instagram issues online pleaIan Russell has urged parents to talk to their children about social media after his daughter watched graphic self-harm content on InstagramShareCommentsByMirror:,  MAY NewsIan Russell is urging parents to start open conversations with their children \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Kate, who has a keen ­interest in early years development, spoke to parents Rebecca Atwood and John Gill about what it was like to have a baby during the lockdown. The Duchess, , cooed at baby Max, who was just  hours old, and said: “Hello! Very nice to meet you! This is ­definitely a first, I think!” After sending “huge congratulations” to his parents, Kate added: “He is so sweet. When did you have him ” When told he had arrived at pm the previous night, she replied: “My goodness, you must be exhausted! Kate’s surprise ‘bedside visit’ came during a call to staff at Kingston Hospital’s Maternity Unit on April . She did a two-day work placement at the south west London hospital last November, and this time heard from staff about their experiences during the pandemic. Six midwives took it in turns to join the chat, while one pulled on personal protective equipment and took a ­laptop to introduce mum-of-three Kate to baby Max and his parents. The Duchess dialled in from Anmer Hall in Norfolk – where the Cambridges have been staying during the lockdown – and heard that the hospital had dealt with a rise in referrals for anxiety. Jo Doumouchtsi, perinatal mental health midwe, said: “The main issues women are having are around coming into hospital and catching Covid, but also about the isolation after the baby is born.  “They have to self-isolate, so they are having limited support from their other family members.” And midwe Jenner Tshibamba added: “We want women to know we’re here, we’re still open. “Even with what’s ­going on, we’re here to listen to you, we’re still here to make sure we provide you with the best care for your pregnancy, for your baby and support your family.”  The hospital’s perinatal mental health team – which includes psychiatrists and mental health nurses – sends out a weekly newsletter that gives mums advice for coping during the pandemic and lists what ­services are available. Kate said: “That’s probably such a valuable tool for them now. To you all there, you do an amazing job, ­honestly, as you say, ­babies come all the time. “The fact you’re having to work in these dficult times… well done.”  Kate told the midwives how she and husband William had spoken to NHS staff about the importance of reaching outthey were feeling low. She said: “They don’t feel they can reach out because they feel guilty for doing it, which is extraordinary. “With new mums and parents and families, they don’t want to feel like they’re overburdening but it is so ­important to reach out and ask for help when you do need it.” As part of their work to support people during the pandemic, the Duke and Duchess have created a new text service dedicated to key workers.  Leading mental health charities will work together to provide -hour ­support to those under pressure while millions of us stay at home to save lives. Mind, Samaritans, Shout, Hospice UK and the Cambridges’ Royal Foundation will provide support and online resources to the key workers keeping Britain ­moving through the crisis. William, , said the text service would be their “top priority” in the coming months. And ahead of Maternal Mental Health Awareness Week – which starts tomorrow – Kate said new mums should also speak upthey need help. Typically, around one in  women experience a mental illness during ­pregnancy or in the first year after giving birth. Kate said that in her experience, talking to other mums helped.  She said: “You realise you are going through the same thing. Before that, you’re worried that actually, what you’re experiencing, you’re the only one going through it. “To be able to share it in whatever way, whether it’s on the phone, through social media – in any form – ­it does ­normalise some of these anxieties.” Using a video call to ­connect with others was exactly what Princess Charlotte did on her fth birthday on Saturday. Kate and William threw a party for their daughter at home, with lots of fun and games for her and brothers, George, six and Louis, two.

The facilities in Manchester were open for the first time since the start of lockdown today, with social distancing measures put in place. It follows a surge in flytipping since Brits were told they must stay at home. Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick has said councils should be confident to reopen tips as soon as possible - although there have been warnings that protective equipment for waste workers needs to be provided. At the waste centre on Reliance Street in Manchester a queue of cars was already waiting by .am, half an hour before it was scheduled to open. On Saturday only vehicles with number plates ending in even numbers were allowed in, as part of a system to control the number of visitors, meaning some people were turned away. Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said: While we are reopening centres, this is not ato normal. We would ask the public to limit their journeys and only travel to a household waste and recycling centreit is absolutely essential to do so.  Centres are only accepting bagged general waste and Greater Manchester residents need to show proof of address to use the sites, which are limiting the number of cars allowed in. Mr Jenrick said reopening tips in a staged manner was sensible and the right thing to do. He said: The longer we delay it, the longer those queues are going to be when the waste sites reopen. He said visiting a tip is a perfectly legal thing for people to do, but warned people obviously donapost abuse it.  The minister added: There is no reason why you cannot travel to a tip to put household waste there or do recycling. Councils should have the confidence to reopen them as soon as possible. Councillor David Renard, environment spokesman for the Local Government Associationsaid police would be needed to manage inevitable traffic queues at tips.  He said: HWRCscan only reopen when they have sufficient staffing and social distancing measures are in place to protect staff and members of the public, which remains paramount. To safely manage visitor flow and pent-up demand, the police will need to manage inevitable traffic queues at the sites, with consideration needing to be given to whether supportive measures, such as a permit system and longer opening hours might be needed.  He said it is crucial that staff are given PPE and said re-openings will be decided locally based on risk assessments taken in each local authority area. New research this week showed fly-tipping had increased by % in rural communities during the lockdown. Researchers from the universities of Southampton and Portsmouth said the increase in illegal waste dumping followed the closure of almost all tips, while at the same time the number of DIY projects has increased by householders stuck at home.

He told the under-fire minister: “Do not let my father’s death be in vain.” Intisar, whose dad worked at Homerton hospital in Hackney, east London, also backed the Sunday Mirror’s campaign to reward our healthcare heroes. We are calling for a special daily allowance to be paid immediately to nurses, doctors, support staff and care workers who are putting their lives on the line. Intisar added: “Nurses, doctors, care workers and so many others put their lives on the line every day to save the British public. “My father would be proud to support the campaign for a special daily allowance.” Open letter to Matt Hancock in full Dear Matt Hancock, My father, Dr Abdul Mabud Chowdhury, was an NHS hero who gave his le for this country. He saw at first hand the shortages of PPE for workers treating coronavirus patients. While my father was unwell, he wrote an open letter to the Prime Minister appealing for more PPE. His request went ignored and two weeks later he passed away. He was only .  Today, I write an open letter to you in the hope that you might learn from my father’s tragic death. My family cannot rule out that a lack of PPE caused my father’s death. For many other frontline workers, the relationship between inadequate protection and death is even more evident. Yet in , you were warned that the NHS would be overwhelmeda pandemic hit. Exercise Cygnus was the government’s opportunity to prepare for the global crisis we see today. While PPE does expire, making it more dficult to stockpile, why did you wait for the death toll to rise before taking action  Having never worked as a medical professional yourself, you also had no right to imply NHS workers had misused PPE. There is a shortage of PPE – it is not being overused. To say otherwise shows complete disrespect to my father’s death.  Other workers in hospitals, such as cleaners and technicians, also require protection. As do staff in care homes. What are you doing to ensure that they cansafely to their families at night  I am not expecting perfection, but I do expect that your mistakes are admitted and learned from.

The source claimed that Harry and Meghan’s initial move to Frogmore Cottage in Windsor was triggered when Meghan shouted at a member of Kate’s staff. And the Duchess of Cambridge was said to be horried at Meghan’s approach. The source claimed: “Like many people not used to dealing with servants, Meghan overdoes the imperiousness so on the one hand she wants to be like Diana, a peopleaposs princess, and on the other she wants people to stand to attention when she clicks her fingers.” It’s believed the incident prompted the beginning of discussions about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex leaving Kensington Palace. Meghan’s attitude towards staff soon led to a crop of unflattering nicknames, including Me-Gainapos, the aposDuchess of Dficultapos and even aposDi apos or aposDi Liteapos, it is claimed. Many of the staff, who didn’t know what to make of the American duchess, seemed relieved when she and Harry moved away, Mr Quinnaposs book claims. It meant that a fully refurbished home at Kensington Palace went completely unused.

When it became a go-to shop for the Royal Family, they ended up with a worldwide business and a special invitation. In their own words, they tell their story... One day my we Beatrice went to a little shop on our high street that does personalised presents. They didn’t have what she wanted, so the next day, when she decided to have a go at making it herself, our lives changed for ever. Born in France, we moved to London in . We were struggling to manage the work-le balance as I was in banking, a heavy-going job, and Beatrice had just had our second child. She wanted to go part-time in her office job, but the company refused. She was considering a career change, so when she made her first necklace, it got her thinking. The day after that trip to the high street, she ordered a gold charm and chain from the internet as well as a handheld ‘graver’ . By the end of the day she’d engraved the necklace with the names of our children and was proudly wearing it. Initially, it was a bit of a hobby. She sat at the kitchen table and began engraving pieces to sell at Christmas fairs and local events. Word of mouth spread in the village and soon she was making jewellery for friends, family and anyone who needed something special to mark an occasion. We decided to set up a website for her creations rather than open a shop and, after a few weeks, her orders slowly grew. She’d started buying the charms and chains and engraving them herself, but once we went online as a unique company, called Merci Maman, she had to design and make the charms herself. I used to help out in evenings and at the weekends and knew we were on to a good thing. It was a slow, old-fashioned process though, and we did it all by hand. As orders grew, we hired a few people to help and, in , I left my job to join the company. At this point we had seven people working for us and opened a small office a stone’s throw from our house. I too saw the benefits of this kind of work. We had four kids by then and I could take them to school and be home for supper, which was a whole new world for me. I was determined for Merci Maman to be a success. Our USP became the personalisation angle. You can have absolutely anything. Children’s names, love notes, GPS coordinates of where people met or live, you name it, we can do it. We were published in a few magazines and Pippa Middleton ended up buying something from us for a friend. She was so pleased with it, she sent us a thank you letter afterwards! She went on to buy a few more pieces from us for presents. We were thrilled, and it got us thinking of our dream customers.  When Kate Middleton was pregnant with her first child in  my we and I both said, ‘Wow, imagineshe had a necklace with the name of the future prince or princess on it ’. She is an icon across the whole world and an inspiration to so many women. So, when George was born, we made her a necklace with his name on and a little ‘W’ charm on it also for William. We sent it to Pippa so she could gt it to her sister from herself. Well, you can imagine how we felt when we saw a picture of Kate wearing it. The excitement was sky high! Sure enough, all over the newspapers were pictures of Kate wearing the necklace we’d made for her. What happened next was a big article about Kate’s jewellery, which went viral. And there was our necklace. The effect was instant. We had , hits on the website in three days – equivalent to all of the traffic we normally get in December, our busiest month. We had to focus on production, getting stock in and we had to recruit to cope. It was very demanding, but extremely exciting!  We had to act fast to get the staff so we could meet the demands of the orders and within weeks we’d expanded to a team of . The necklace had created a buzz worldwide so we had to start shipping all over the world and make sure some of our staff were bilingual so we could translate the website into dferent languages. What followed was three offices – in London, Paris and Berlin – to make sure we could reach everyone. Business went insane and six months on we were a dferent company in terms of figures. We even gained a few more royal customers. Mike Tindall has bought a few pieces for his we, the Queen’s granddaughter Zara, and whenever Royals order they use the website, just like normal customers. After , we had such a huge burst internationally that we applied for The Queens Award, which is an honour awarded to a few select UK businesses every year. We won for our contribution to exports and my we and I were invited to Buckingham Palace. After mingling with the guests someone asked us to head to a private room with them. We followed and there sat the Queen, who wanted to have a private chat with us. We were in the room for quite a long time and she asked us all sorts of questions. When we’d moved to England, how the business started. She was interested in all the ins and outs! She didn’t even realise Kate had a necklace when we told her. It was amazing and I’ll never forget it.  An hour later we were drinking champagne in the Palace and a lady came up to us and said, ‘Oh you’re the French couple who set up the jewellery company – the Queen told me all about you!’ She had remembered all the details. Even that we have four children. It was incredible how she absorbed the information. It’s  years since the company started and we now do rings, bracelets, earrings, accessories and a full men’s range. Working with my we has been great – Beatrice is good at the designing side of things, and I stick to e-commerce. Plus we parent together well as we split work and family time evenly. The kids are between seven and  so they’re too young to get involved, but they do love to help us package up parcels and to go on set at photoshoots. The necklace Kate has is called the Duchess and it’s the same price it always was, £. It’s important for us it’s affordable for everyone. We also practise our work-le balance ethos. Everyone who works for us can create their own schedule to make sure they have enough family time.

Under the UKaposs current lockdown rules, you must stay at home unless shopping for food, travelling to a medical appointment or job that cannot be done from home or taking exercise once a day. This has led to police forces up and down the country ordering sunbathers to clear out of public parks and green spaces. However, some experts believe the risk of transmitting coronavirus from one person to another is much lower outside. Professor Robert Dingwall, who sits on the Governmentaposs New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, has previously argued there is no evidence to suggest that sunbathers can infect other park users with the virus eventhey remained less than two metres apart.

The app will aim to reduce transmission of Covid- by alerting people who may have been exposed so they can take action to protect themselves. Speaking at todayaposs Downing Street briefing, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick described plans for contact tracing going forward as a multi-faceted strategy with theapp at its heart. Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England Jenny Harries added tracing the spread of the virus will only be possible when there are fewer infected people in the UK, and it will be carried out in hospitals and social care environments first. A surveillance programme which looks at the spread of the virus within families is also being developed by the Office for National Statistics. Dr Harries said: This whole combination of digital apps, contact tracing, and understanding where pockets of transmission are that can be contained, potentially, as we go forward to get us out of the social distancing measures, is really important. On how the new track and trace system for coronavirus will work, Dr Harries said: If somebody has symptoms they take themselves out of society as they would now, but anybody who has been in contact with them - in a very anonymised and safe data-managed way using a phone app - will be alerted.  She added: To get this up and running at scale and effectively is another signicant task but lots of preparation under way. On how long the system will take to be up and running, Dr Harries said: We need the whole population to work with us on this, itaposs quite an exciting adventure itaposs a bit like social distancing, everybody has to do it together to get it to work. She added: We need to be trialling it and we will be doing that very soon. It comes as the UKaposs coronavirus death toll rose to , after another  fatalities.

And Dr Doug Brown, head of the British Society for Immunology, said similar drugs had helped severely ill patients in Spain. He added: “Immunotherapies are a viable option and could save lives.” Prof Kevin Harrington, biological therapies expert at the Institute of Cancer Research, agreed: “There is the real possibility this could save the lives of coronavirus patients who would otherwise die. “Also, the hope is those people who would have survived the virus will come through it quicker – meaning less time on a ventilator and less time in intensive care.” And top UK virologist Prof Will Irving, of Nottingham University, added: “You’d probably use this in patients with the most severe disease. It’s a perfectly reasonable idea.” The drug attacks small proteins called cytokines that over-stimulate the immune system and produce an inflammatory effect in arthritis patients, which is exaggerated in Covid- sufferers’ lung tissue and other organs. It is believed tocilizumab could give seriously ill virus victims a better chance of recovery – vital after a study this week revealed a THIRD of UK patients admitted to hospital with coronavirus symptoms died.  At present doctors could legally use tocilizumab on a coronavirus patient but they would have to accept personal liability. Dr Brown said: “These treatments don’t have a licence for Covid, but some clinicians have tried to repurpose tocilizumab and it seems to have had some effect.” Urging more research, he added: “As soon as data on it has been collected on a large scale, there’ll be more ­confidence. It’s really important we publish the data and give clinicians the information they need to make the right decisions.” Tocilizumab could also be licensed specically for coronavirusit went through traditional trials. Dr Brown said: “The UK is leading the world in speeding up the trial process for ­treatments for Covid.  “In some cases this could be a matter of six months to a year.” The breakthrough comes as the US has authorised emergency use of the Ebola antiviral drug remdesivir for treating Covid-. A recent clinical trial showed the drug helped shorten recovery time for the seriously ill, although it did not signicantly improve survival rates. Another potential treatment to be trialled at Guy’s and St Thomas’ ­hospitals in London involves transfusions with blood from recovered sufferers in the hope the donor’s ­antibodies will help other patients. If successful, the NHS is set to deliver , units of plasma a week to hospitals – enough to treat , patients.

The announcement of Germany’s surrender on May ,  brought millions on to the streets in celebration. There were parties, parades and concerts. The Prime Minister Winston Churchill was carried aloft down Whitehall by cheering crowds. It won’t be like that on this May  – Friday. This time the nation will be in lockdown, fighting a dferent enemy. The coronavirus is testing the country’s resilience as it has been tested before. As we remember those who gave their lives in a struggle to ensure our freedom from tyranny, our thoughts turn to those who now have given, and still risk, their lives so that we may live free from the tyranny of disease. As Churchill said in those dferent times: “To those have given so much, we thank you.” It is the spirit of that day in  that spans the generations and gives hope today that we will, as they did, see it through. Resilience VE Day marks the end of a struggle in which the nation’s spirit was tested to the limit. There were setbacks – major ones – horric mistakes, many, many doubts along the way.  So it is with coronavirus. The UK has recorded one of the highest death tolls from Covid- in the developed world. The delay in recognising the plight of those in care homes is unforgivable. We have had one of the lowest testing rates. Despite the Government’s questionable boast of having reached , a day, we are still far short of what is need to provide an exit route from lockdown.

You can unsubscribe at any time.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailIn these crazy uncertain times, it can somehow help to find yourself in a place that’s, well, not of this world. And many may say the time-warped town of Cassadaga – between Daytona and Orlando in the hot, swampy heartland of Florida – is certainly a tad off the planet. But it also draws a multitude of curious earthly visitors who flock here to be reconnected with the past, have incurable ailments cured, and see into their future. Because when it comes to mediums, Cassadaga goes large.And, shortly before the state’s coronavirus lockdown, I found myself sitting in front of one of its other-worldly inhabitants.“I’m getting the word Apple,” says Gypsy Phoenix mysteriously, her trance-like eyes rolling back from the tarot cards and crystals spread across the table. Then she says I needed more lavender in my le, which was being guarded by a group of spirit guides – and told me I was already looking forward to retirement. The spirits, she added, were very strong during my “reading”… And so they should be in a town billed as the Psychic Capital of the World – with its  or so rickety painted wooden houses home to more than  mediums, healers and psychics. Since , Cassadaga has been a sanctuary to the mystic – and, some would argue, the downright crazy. It’s Spiritualist Camp was founded then by a New Yorker who had been instructed by his Native American spirit guide Seneca to start a spiritual centre.  So George Colby made the long trek south and found the ideal spot in Florida’s wilderness, buying up  acres. After a bout of tuberculosis, he claimed the area’s spring water healed him. The legend goes that when he died in , the waters started to dry up, which many saw as an omen. But that only made it a bigger draw – and it’s been on the US National Register of Historic Places since . Now holidaymakers who forgo the delights of Mickey and Minnie  miles further south are free to wander around its attractions, such as the Spirit Lake and Fairy Trail, and sit on the Devil’s Chair – in the local cemetery, of course.  Cassadaga is split in two, separated by a single street and around  years. On one side sits the town’s church maintaining the traditional spiritualist belief system Colby established in the s. On the other, s New Agers have their centre of worship in and around the Cassadaga Hotel which, as you’d expect, is haunted with “friendly” spirits – one an Irish tenor called Arthur who leaves a scent trail of cigars and gin. Most rooms have no phones or TVs so as to not interfere with “spiritual pathways” and there’s no hot water after pm.  But step beyond its doors and visitors are promised they’ll “embrace the energy of the many spirits who reside in this enchanted inn”. They’re also told: “Don’t forget to bring your camera. Many of our guests have gotten unbelievable pictures of Spirit Energies in and around the hotel.” The owners claim it is a “respected Spiritual Sanctuary” and add: “It is our mission to help those who are seeking guidance from the Highest Angelic Realms, and it’s truths.”  Walking into the foyer, visitors are welcomed by a board naming the mediums on sht – Gypsy, Misty, Doreen, Inez, Kat and Ron – and their price list, cash only. African voodoo dolls and handmade potions “starting from  bucks” can be bought from hotel receptionist DJ. When I arrived and askedshe had sensed I was going to turn up, she looked at me blankly – clearly not a possessor of the pricey psychic powers.  But any unsurprising hints of mockery or cynicism simply wash over Cassadaga’s inhabitants. Clairvoyant Jotte ‘the ine unicorn’ Schaffer,  – who works in the Psychic Shop – assured me the “positive vortexes” in the town only brought good energy. “People need to come with no expectations and an open mind,” she said. “What I do with my readings is plant seeds and harvest guidance.” Usually, up to  people a day visit the shop, but coronavirus has seen numbers plummet.  “We have been predicting ‘the great awakening’ for many years, and it is finally here,” she said. “It is an amazing time to seek spiritualism. We hope this helps recalibrate humanity.” The shop offers a crystal healing bed treatment – it costs a dollar a minute and is said to relieve stress, soothe anxiety, and reconnect people to themselves. For  you get an “aura report” which found I had a blue-indigo air about me indicating a “communicative, loving, loyal, sensitive and helpful” person – yet one who was suffering stress and read asI may be on my way out. Which brings me back to that table in the hotel with Gypsy.  I handed over a wallet-recalibrating  bucks for a half-hour consultation in a room decked out with crystals, trinkets, pictures and ious dolls. The smell of incense hit me like a train. She dealt the tarot cards quicker than a Las Vegas croupier. Within seconds she was on the scent of the inner self I didn’t know. “We want you to work with things like lavender and get a lavender pillow,” she said, adding that I loved ice cream. Before I could reply: “Doesn’t everybody ” she revealed I have five spirit guides in my le. Most people only have two, apparently. “There is one Irish and one’s Welsh. They’re cousins,” she said. “Like they’re sort of jokesters, but you know, sometimes you’re just sort of closed off to it, and you’re, like, focused on the serious.  “And they’re like, ‘Come on man, open up, you know, you know, be happy’.  “There is also an older woman somewhere, like in her nineties. Almost like a grandmother’s spirit guide. Not your grandmother. She helps calm you and soothe you when you are feeling overwhelmed.” Apple Then she told me the other two were a brother and sister both under  “helping balance the male and female aspects of your inner child”. Her best advice was about my financial future – and that “on your way out” verdict I’d had. “I hear you’re looking forward to retirement. You’re not quite there yet,” she said. Phew! “You’re still sort of very young, but spirit guides recently have been really on at people about saving money and the stock market.  “So wait until this panic is sort of over and about a month or two and start sort of buying the cheaper stocks, all the stocks that have fallen watch them bounce.” All this time I’d been wondering just what she meant by her trance-like uttering of the word “Apple”. Now, the big reveal.

The advert reads: During these hard times Covid- has thrown many in a tail spin... If you are a submissive femaleyears old and into the SM lestyle on a moderate to extreme level... and wanting to barter session playtime once per week in lieu of rent we should talk. A producer for Inside Edition then responded to the advert, posing as a potential renter. The publication reports that the landlord replied,  saying he wanted to try the arrangement first at a hotel room and gave bizarre instructions that left no doubt about his intentions.Alycia Powers, who posed as the potential renter, said: He says to wear my hair down, no jewelry and minimal makeup. And then meet him in the room, undress and put on a pair of stilettos he got me. She agreed to meet aposEddieapos at a Days Inn hotel in Long Island, whilst being wired with a hidden camera.  The landlord text Alycia to say he had checked into the hotel, but the producer asked him to meet her at her car, when she and her team revealed who they were to him. When askedhe was trying to take advantage of women in the middle of the pandemic, Eddie responded No. She had the choice to take up on the offer and denied the arrangement was for sex. It is thought that many landlords in the US are trying to take advantage of tenantsapos struggles with rent payments.  In April, a third of tenants across the country were unable to pay their landlords, with a higher number expected in May. Last month, Khara Jabola-Carolus, Executive Director of the  Hawaii State Commission on the Status of Women, said sexual harassment by landlords is making lives from women extremely dficult. There was no plan upfront to prepare for the physical and sexual violence from the combination of shelter-in-place, lost income and systemic sexism, Ms Jabola-Carolus said.  In February it was reported that desperate tenants are sleeping with landlords instead of paying rent in a growing “sex for rent” epidemic. A national survey Shelter Scotland recently found that , women nationally said they’d been asked for sex for their tenancies. The Aberdeen Law Project, based at Aberdeen University, invited MSP Kevin Stewart, Detective Sergeant Craig Currie, Mark Thomson from homeless charity Shelter Scotland and Marsha Scott of Scottish Women’s Aid as part of the workshop.  Mr Thomson said there is a “vast amount of under-reporting” on the growing issue, where tenants are asked by landlords to offer sex in exchange for rent. He added: “We are aware anecdotally that it does happen in Aberdeen. Earlier this year a woman urged others to be safe after sharing her messages with a aposlandlordapos who offered to lower rent in exchange for nude photos. Georgia Linehan took to social media to expose aposhow dangerous some people on the internet can beapos in a tweet which has since gained almost , likes. Posting a screenshot of their worrying Whatsapp conversation, she wrote: Thataposs the last time I try and buy a house on Gumtree. She is told it costs £ per month, and she replies to say that sheaposll have a think and let them know her decision in a couple of days.

The four-bedroom home in Louisiana, US, was built in the s and has gained a spooky reputation, meaning no one has dared to move in despite not having to spend a penny to make it theirs. One former resident claims the home is haunted by her great grandmother, who is aposwell knownapos to stir cooking left unattended in the kitchen and move the pots around.Sylvia McLain, a co-owner of McLain Investments, took to Facebook to share snaps of the home in a bid to convince someone to move and restore the home so they could build new property on the land.However, it appears potential suitors were put off by a flood of comments below from ex-residents and visitors who reported the creepy goings-on they claim to have experienced. Sylvia admitted sheaposs heard aposall the storiesapos about it being haunted by an old woman and said former owners had even had ghost hunters in to banish her. But she remains hopeful the aposhistory of the homeapos can be saved, and itaposs free for anyone to take on to aposmove to another location for restorationapos. Former resident Dawn Vallot DeClout claims the house is occupied by the spirit of her great grandmother Adele, a ft in woman who lived until about  and was known for meddling in the kitchen. Dawnaposs family owned the -acre plot the house was built on from , and her great grandmother died in the front room in .  Dawn, whose family moved out in the s, said: We believe [Adele] is the ghost, but sheaposs not menacing at all. She was probably like ft in and weighed about lb. She lived to be almost  and she was always digging in the pots, like when you have something on the stove and someone goes and looks in the pot and stirs it around. She was well-known for that, and so when we lived there, we used to hear her all the time jangling the pots when we had something on the stove. You could hear somebody picking up the lid but there was nobody in the kitchen.  Sylvia said there is a lot of rumours surrounding the house, with apossome really cute stories about it being hauntedapos. One suitor had offered to take the home, but had a change of heart when they discovered it would cost about £, to move and reassemble. Sylvia believesthe two-storey, , square foot property was kept close by, it would only cost about half of that. However, locals comparing it to a notorious house in Amityville, where a man shot and killed six members of his family, isnapost making it any easier.  The post on Facebook got hundreds of responses with one writing: Yes it is [haunted]. I experienced three things there that could not be explained and my friend that lived there had more than that. We actually experienced one together and we still talk about it. Another replied: Most likely the haunting will stay attached to the land and whoever lives in the new home they build will deal with it. A third said they visited the home and reported aposa lot of weird noises in the ceilings and wallsapos. Sylvia is worried she may not be able to find someone to take on the project due to the costs after any interest following the Facebook post quickly fell away.

We are always correct, even though we contradict ourselves, the statue replies.Thataposs what I love about you Americans, your consistency, says the warrior. Washington and Beijing have been locked in a war of words over the origins of Covid-, which emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of last year. Since then, the deadly virus has swept across the world and the US now has more cases than any other country by far, with more than .m. More than , Americans have now lost their lives to the killer bug, a death toll greater than that suffered during the Vietnam War. China has suffered , deaths from the virus, and has officially recorded , cases. It is widely believed that the coronavirus first jumped from animals to humans at a live animal market in Wuhan, a transport hub in Hubei province. However, alternative theories have begun to surface and Trump said on Thursday that he is confident Covid- may have in fact originated in a Chinese virology lab. The US President declined, however, to describe the evidence behind his claim. China has been accused of misleading the world about the severity of the outbreak, and there are growing calls for an international inquiry into the origins of the virus.

The despot is likely to order a “wave of public executions” and fresh nuclear threats against the West to re-establish credibility after being off grid for weeks. Insiders believe the dynastic Supreme Leader of the world’s most secretive country fled the Covid- outbreak sweeping his country – or was taken ill. Kim, , was even rumoured to have died of heart issues after he last appeared in public on April . But he has now appeared in public for the first time in  days, according to the country’s state media. KCNA news agency reported the despot cutting the ribbon at the opening of a fertiliser factory on Friday. It added people “broke into thunderous cheers of hurrah” when he appeared, with his younger sister Kim Yo-jong, , alongside him. South Korean intelligence – usually the most reliable source on Pyongyang-related rumours – had earlier confirmed he was alive and well.  And satellite images showed the dictator’s personal train at the coastal retreat of Wonsan. In the past, women have joined Kim on his train – while sex slaves forcibly taken from universities await at his lair. But this is no ordinary vacation. Rumours of Kim’s death were triggered when the fatty food-loving heavy drinker missed celebrations marking the founding of North Korea on April .  There were also suggestions that Kim Yo-jong would grab power. Now experts warn her brother’scould herald a spate of killings of members of the Pyongyang old-guard in order to reinforce his position. In  Kim ordered the murder of his -year-old uncle and several loyal officers, and imprisoned  officials for alleged treachery.  Professor Natasha Lindstaedt, an author and global expert on despot-led regimes said: “He’s always had this very vindictive pattern of showing his strength by killing people. It sends a clear message.“The military has to keep him happy. The smallest thing is perceived as disloyalty. I think he may have sheltered from coronavirus and any fear of a coup plot would mean he’d come back with a vengeance.”Prof Lindstaedt, Deputy Dean at the University of Essex, added that Kim’s sister is now in a highly “precarious position”.  A western security source echoed the risk of a Kim backlash, saying: “I believe we could expect a violent taking out of any perceived threat amongst Kim’s inner-circle. “Any imagined slight against him would be regarded as dissent – and could result in a public execution or being sent to a jail camp. “Inevitably, this will end in bloodshed and more threats.” Kim has jailed thousands of innocent civilians in his brutal work camps during his eight-year rule of horror, killing many in street executions and public murders.

Rumours circulated about the supreme leaderaposs whereabouts after he was last seen on April . He missed the birth anniversary celebrations of state founder Kim Il Sung on April . This led to speculation over his health, before he made his first public appearance in  days on Friday. However, state media released footage of the -year-old riding an electric cart around a factory with a new, mysterious mark on his right wrist. Speaking to NK News, a US medical professional said the small mark might signal a aposrecent cardiovascular procedure, possibly a right, radial artery punctureapos. Eariler today, North Koreaaposs state news agency KCNA said leader Kim Jong-un attended the completion of a fertilizer plant in a region north of the capital,  Pyongyang, but reuters could not independently very the KCNA report.  KCNA reported that Kim cut a ribbon at the ceremony on Friday and those attending the event burst into thunderous cheers of aposhurrah!apos for the Supreme Leader who is commanding the all-people general march for accomplishing the great cause of prosperity. Kim expressed satisfaction about the production system of the fertilizer factory, saying the plant made signicant contribution for the progress of the countryaposs chemical industry and food production, KCNA said. Kim was accompanied by several senior North Korean officials, including his younger sister Kim Yo Jong, KCNA said.US President Donald Trump  said after the KCNA report - but before the publication of the photos - that he will have something to say about Kim at the aposappropriate timeapos. Iaposd rather not comment on it yet, Trump told reporters at the White House. Weaposll have something to say about it at the appropriate time.

For me, the club was on its knees.“Not financially or anything like that but morale, the place was at rock bottom.“Everybody was trying to do everything to liven the place up and get us going and get it back to being a happy place for people to come to work.“I think now we are back in a situation where everybody feels part of it. At the minute it is a really good professional environment but there is more we can do to get better.”Despite taking caretaker charge of the final match of the previous season at home to St Mirren, McPake admits his first game as full-time boss at Raith Rovers, a - win in the Betfred Cup, was a big moment.“I was very nervous. It was my first real taste ofmy team – the St Mirren game wasn’t my team,” he said.“This was my first game, our new team’s first game and a lot of new ideas had went into that pre-season.“I was very nervous and probably only settled when the third goal went in.”The Dens boss would go on to miss a home stalemate with Peterhead a week later due to the birth of his daughter.Although it was tough to have to watch from afar, McPake knew he’d left the team in good hands with assistant Jimmy Nicholl and first-team coach Dave Mackay.“I watched the full game from the labour suite,” revealed McPake.“It wasn’t too dficult in the sense that I wasn’t there because, I’ll be honest, family is everything – whether it was a Dundee United game or anything, I was going to be at the birth of my child.“My worry was the baby would arrive when we were up at Coveand I would struggle to be there.“I watched the Peterhead game and I did try to get messages across to the staff, without being too intrusive.“We had picked the team before and for me to be texting from a labour ward and they are seeing the game in real time would’ve been wrong.“The messages I sent were very simple and we had Jimmy Nicholl # he’s played in two World Cups, managed a team that’s won our league and managed a team to a major trophy # and Dave Mackay had managed against teams in that league so we were in capable hands.“We just weren’t good enough on the day, simple as that, and were very flat. That gave us an early indication of what was to come – teams just came, let us have the ball and sit in.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee fc john nelms lifts lid spfl vote u turn","story":"Ever since his deciding ballot ended the lower-league season, John Nelms has been cast, by some, as a sinner in the SPFL vote saga.The Dens Park supremo was front and centre of the crisis that engulfed Scottish football this month after his ‘no’ vote failed to reach the SPFL’s email account and left him with the fate of the game in his hands.Five days later, he switched Dundee’s vote to a ‘yes’, passing the resolution that ended the   campaign in the bottom three isions.Speculation over what sparked Nelms’ change of heart has raged ever since, but the Dundee chief has remained silent.Until today.Finally, in a sit down interview with Tele Sport, Nelms has lted the lid on the events of the last month, and on his hopes for Scottish football’s future – and we are giving his story to you exactly as he gave it to us.George Cran: You stated at the start you were going to vote ‘no’ to the SPFL’s resolution, what were your thoughts on it to begin with John Nelms: From the beginning, I didn’t want anything to go out that would hurt anybody at all. We had very limited time to look at things. The document itself didn’t give much hope for reconstruction and didn’t do a lot of things. For me, I wasn’t just thinking of Dundee Football Club but other clubs who would be hurt in all of this. That was my main focus – I didn’t want anybody to get hurt.The change came after a lot of conversations with a lot of clubs and the appetite for reconstruction was greater than I first thought. There are other things, which I don’t want to get into, but we were trying to help these clubs who were going to be hurting. I was trying to soften the blow for everybody but also trying to use the time [between the deadline and submitting the ‘yes’ vote] to make Scottish football, through reconstruction, a better overall product that has more value going forward. That’s something we have been discussing for a long time, but we have the time now to really dig in and look at it. Getting to that stage, we had over % of the clubs vote a certain way so, in order to get going, so to speak, I changed my vote so we could get on to the next phase.As far as the Premiership goes, all we did was vote to put it into the hands of the board. They now have in their hands the chance to say what they want to do with it. They can try to play [the remaining matches] later. There are options they will have to weigh. We weren’t weighing those options.GC: What went through your mind when you saw the incomplete vote had been published JN: I wasn’t best pleased. I know there was a statement saying: “We had to put something out because we had a board meeting,” but the statement could have been as simple as: “We have an incomplete vote, there is a statutory  days and we have not received every vote.” By the way, it wasn’t just our vote, there were others that weren’t received either. They could have said it was an incomplete vote without any detail and that would have been more appropriate in my opinion.GC: At that point, you have said you weren’t aware it was your vote that was missing, what did you think then JN: I don’t know what happened, I have no idea. What they say is it got caught in the spam folder, which you have to believe. We did intend to vote a certain way and then changed it after I had more information. I talked with a lot of people. I pace when I talk on the phone. The Saturday, I walked . miles while on the phone, mostly inside my house. I averaged over the period before I voted over  miles a day, just on the phone.GC: What was the major part of changing your vote JN: The biggest thing was, the only way I could see, once we knew what was happening, that we could help anybody – it’s not just helping people but a longer-term, bigger picture – is reconstruction. Speaking with a lot of clubs, there was much more of an appetite for reconstruction than I understood going into this. That was the main thing.GC: Can you understand why other people saw Dundee as the bad guy JN: Obviously, people think we have handed United the league, Rangers think we have handed Celtic the league, although that is in the hands of the board, which they have a representative on. Over % voted for it and it was going to happen one way or the other – we represent % of that vote, total. The only way going forward would be league reconstruction. Yeah, I can see why I am the bad guy, but  or % of the league are also that same bad guy. The league did, in putting it out there, put us in a bad position.GC: The WhatsApp messages . Did that influence your thought process JN: It’s unbelievable. The way that was handled was not businesslike and was very poor. It has caused a lot of bad blood throughout the league, the way that was done, taking private messages and putting them out there. Of course, they have been taken out of context at some levels because you don’t know exactly what was going on and what the conversations were. There were a lot of conversations going on at that time, loads of them, so you don’t get the full context of it but you do get one view and that’s what they wanted.GC: You mentioned ‘handing’ Dundee United the Championship. Did that come into the thinking at any point JN: Obviously as Dundee Football Club, we don’t want to hand our rivals anything but, at the end of the day, it was inevitable that was going to happen. I had several conversations with Mal [Brannigan, Dundee United managing director] throughout this, several conversations with Rangers, with Celtic, with Hearts, I’ve had conversations with quite a few people. You could tell early on that there would be promotion relegation and there was no way around it because over % of the clubs wanted that to happen. Whether or not we wanted that to happen, it was going to happen. I’m not going to make a decision based on what happens to United – I have to make the decision on what’s best for Dundee Football Club and what’s best for Scottish football.GC: To make it clear, what was the benefit to Dundee in changing your vote JN: We were in the worst position possible – we were in third place. There’s not much benefit one way or the other that we could get out of this. When people ask me that – I ask what do you think we could we have gotten out of this  So, the best thing we could possibly get out of this is a proper conversation about reconstruction. That might not benefit us in the short-term, but in the long-term, it would benefit Dundee FC and all of Scottish football. That, for me, was the best thing we could get out of this. Does that do anything for us right now  No. But we need to look at it in a much bigger, broader picture as opposed to: “What does it do for me right now ”GC: After the whole process, are you happy with the end result JN: I’m not happy with the overall process, I’m not happy with where we are, I’m not happy football clubs are losing money, I’m certainly not happy people are dying of coronavirus in the wider world. We still don’t know what is actually going to happen. All of this might be for nought, we might be shut down for a long, long time and be having much dferent conversations in the future. You can never be happy in these situations, just be pragmatic and get through it as best as we can.GC: Are you confident reconstruction is going to happen and benefit the game in the long-term JN: We are having good conversations. We have to jump through a load of hoops and we have  clubs we have to satisfy, on some level. For me, the most important thing in this is that Scottish football – and, in turn, Dundee Football Club – comes out with a product that is better than we currently have. Sky Sports and our media partners need to be a part of this, too, and help us understand exactly what it is going to take in order for us to be a more attractive product, a more saleable product. We want to be on TV, we want more people to come to games, we need to make games have more meaning, we have to do things that might be outside of the box to bring viewers to the table – that’s the angle I come at it from. I can’t talk to you about the specics of what the group is talking about because we are trying to work through all of these things but the principle, from my point of view, is we have to absolutely make it a more attractive proposition for fans and for viewers. There are ways of doing it.What I want to get out of it all is a product that is better that, in turn, brings more money in that, in turn, makes the product even better and it turns full circle. For me, that’s the goal. It’s a long-term vision but we have the time right now to pay attention to that and work through these things. It might end up this scenario ends up being a change-stage process, whenever we get started again, for  , and then reconstruction might start in  .GC: Do you have a preference for which way the league might be set up JN: I really can’t talk about that because of the [reconstruction working] group I am in. A lot of the setups have merits, a lot have issues but as long as whatever format is setup makes it more valuable, more interesting, then I would be open to just about any type of system. At the end of the day, the top tier brings in the most money and that’s where the eyes are but we have to be conscious of down the leagues, they rely more on gate than TV money, and we have to make sure those games are maintained or even enhanced in some way. It is a balancing act, it’s not as simple as just I like this one or that one.GC: How confident are you we might get consensus at the end of this JN: I don’t know. We have only had two meetings so far. There has been a lot of work gone into those meetings. I thinkwe get to a proposition where all clubs benefit financially, the pie actually grows rather than just cutting it up in dferent ways, you’d have a better chance of getting a consensus. If the goal makes the product better and eventually the product is worth more, that makes more sense –you just change for the sake of it, it doesn’t make much sense to me.GC: Do you see it being better to make a permanent change or a temporary one like was suggested in Hearts’ first statement after the reconstruction talks were announced JN: I don’t know, that’s the problem. I don’t think it’s as simple as we can make one big change right away. I think it might be something that phases in over time. But like I said, we have to have all the stakeholders talking in order to see what that means. We have to make sure all the contracts are being satisfied and these conversations take time. It might be that we have a staged-process but at this point, we are so early in the process, I don’t know what that would % look like. We are still working through all the iterations.GC: Getting all the stakeholders talking – has that been made more dficult by the way things have happened over the past few weeks JN: I think within the group, it’s been fine. Everybody is professional. Honestly, there has been no animosity on the phone calls. Any time we run through anything like this, tensions run high and people say things and do things. For the most part, it’s just business and forgivable and off you go. There may have been one or two things that were done that will be more dficult for people to let go but, hopefully, we can all focus for the proper greater good of the game. If we have a proposition that is best for everybody, I would hope we look at the proposition and not really consider anything ."},{"url":null,"title":"new figures show 54 of all coronavirus cases in tayside were in dundee","story":"New figures show that a total of  people have now tested positive for coronavirus in Dundee # % of all the cases in Tayside.According to the latest figures uploaded to the NHS Scotland Open Data website on Saturday, there have now been  confirmed Covid- cases across Tayside.Of this local figure,  were in the Dundee local authority area,  were in Angus, and  across Perth and Kinross.That means % of all Tayside coronavirus cases were in the City of Discovery.As of Saturday, a total of  people have tested positive for Covid- in Fe.Comparatively, on Friday there were a total of  Covid- cases in Tayside and  in the kingdom.It comes as the number of confirmed Scottish deaths from the virus rose by  to ,.On Friday there were , positive Covid- cases in the UK, , of them in Scotland.Also as of Friday, a total of , people had died as a result of the virus in the UK."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"screen-siren-mae-west-stopped-traffic-glasgow-visit","story":"ldquoCHILDREN adore me, cooed screen siren Mae West when she met a young fan in Glasgow during the heyday of her career."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-woman-discovered-first-human-coronavirus","story":" June Almeida, who discovered the first human coronavirus, was the daughter of a bus driver from Glasgow.

They were keen to learn and kept me on my toes with a range of questions.#I am a qualied outdoor and first aid instructor and have been working with community and sports groups throughout Argyll and Bute and their enthusiasm and desire to develop skills to look after members of their community in the event of something going wrong never ceases to impress me.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air , usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in some of the towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing in early-mid August, to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates that the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for this decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, contact the Argyll bird recorder Jim Dickson by email at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-golf-club-asks-donations-ensure-survival","story":"A BORDERS golf club fighting to survive the coronavirus pandemic has raised thousands of pounds in the coursersquos th anniversary year.Torwoodlee Golf Club, near Galashiels, has launched an online fundraising page in a bid to stay afloat.Club chairman Robin Brydon told the Borderthat generous donors gave a total of pound, within seven days.Mr Brydon said: ldquoItrsquos been amazing and wersquore all totally humbled by the donations so far.The JustGiving pagedescribes the parkland course as one of the ldquofinest in Scotland, but goes on to outline the challenges faced by the club, which closed last month.A statement reads: ldquoDue to the devastating COVID- pandemic crisis affecting us all, the club now faces an uncertain future and we therefore need as much money as possible to survive the pandemic and beyond.Speaking to this newspaper, Mr Brydon revealed that the original aim was to generate pound,, but a wave of donations has prompted the target to be raised to pound,.Mr Brydon said: ldquoFor people who are not going to the golf club at the moment and spending money on teas and coffees and entry fees and who are maybe financially better off as theyrsquore not spending money, wersquod be gratefulthey could donate a little bit every week to the club.Asked what the money will be spent on, Mr Brydon said: ldquoIt all goes into the pot and itrsquos just to ensure survival.

outbreak.It is estimated that the public is collectively owed about pound billion from travel firms.Forced instead to turn to their banks for help, many customers have now been told they are not eligible for a refund.Heres what you need to know.Why arenrsquot travel firms giving refunds Consumer watchdog Which  recently revealed that  of the UKrsquos largest airlines and travel firms are illegally withholding refunds which should be paid to customers within  days.Instead, most customers have been offered vouchers or credit notes, with many complaining that they have been unable to claim a refund online, or get through to customer services on the phone to ask for their money back.Should I ask my bank for a refund Customers who have been refused a refund by travel firms and paid for their trip using a credit card can claim the money back from their provider under Section  of the Consumer Rights Act.Credit card providers are jointly liable with the retailer or trader for any breach of contract for misrepresentation, providing the value is more than pound and less than pound,.However, Which  has warned that some credit card customers have been told by their provider that theyre not eligible for a refund through the scheme.Others have been informed that their claim wonrsquot be processed until they have tried to claim the cash from the travel firm first, even though this is not a legal requirement.Customers are also able to claim through a process known as chargeback, which allows a transaction to be reversedyou are unable to resolve a dispute, including services not delivered.This covers all card payments and is a process agreed between financial institutions and the relevant card scheme, such as Mastercard and Visa.What are Mastercard and Visarsquos chargeback rights Mastercard said there is a chargeback right where firms have cancelled goods or services, even where this is due to government restrictions, insolvency or other exceptional circumstances.It is also validthe cardholder doesnrsquot wish to accept the firmrsquos offer to rebook or claim a voucher, but the issue should first be attempted to be resolved with the firm.Visarsquos guidance also states that firms should process a refund promptlycustomers decline a credit note or voucher, and cardholders do have a right to complain when goods or services are not provided.However, Visa does make an exception where firms have failed to provide a service due to a government-imposed travel ban, stating that this ldquosupersedes Visa rules on dispute rights.For this reason, Mastercard customers are likely to be more successful when making chargeback claims for coronavirus-related cancellations.If flights are cancelled due to closed borders, customers will still have a dispute right under both Mastercard and Visa, as EU-wide rules around refunds override the government travel ban, according to Which .Which banks will refund under Section  and chargeback Banks have said that they will assess each case inidually when it comes to refunds from firms only offering credit notes or rebooking a cancelled trip.This is what the major banks told Which  about issuing refunds:Where a provider has not met their legal obligations to the customer, Barclays will consider both chargeback and Section  claims, provided the relevant criteria are met.HSBC, including First Directand MS Bank, will allow a chargeback or Section  claim to be made for goods or services not received, but customers are encouraged to contact their airline first.Lloyds Group, including Halaxand Bank of Scotlandsay thata refund is not offered by the travel firm and a customer has proof of this, the bank can pursue a disputed transaction claim under scheme rules.Bankrsquos position is that every chargeback and dispute is dferent, and each claim will need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis with the customer to work out the best solution.Nationwidealso says each case will be looked at on a case-by-case basis because it depends on the type of good services being purchased and what the terms of the agreement are with the merchant.Similarly, RBS, including Natwestand Ulster Bank, said cases would be considered on an inidual basis.If a claim made with the merchant in the first instance is not satisfactory, customers can contact Santanderto raise a claim.,params: .pushWhere the merchant has offered the chance to rebook for free and or provide vouchers and the customer is not satisfied with this then Starling Banksays it would initiate a chargeback.If a merchant is not offering a refund, or are asking customers to contact their card issuers to process a refund, Tesco Bankcustomers can raise a dispute.The Co-operative Banksays thatcustomers tried to resolve the issue with the merchant first but there was no refund or resolution, the bank would look at each case inidually to verya dispute chargeback right existed. If a chargeback right existed but the cardholder accepted a credit voucher, this would not affect the cardholderrsquos original dispute rights. The bank would also not reject a Section  claim outright in these circumstances.If customers are offered a voucher or a chance to rebook, TSBwould typically accept the claims and each case will be considered inidually.If the customer is unhappy with the solution offered by the merchant, Virgin Moneywould consider the terms and conditions.

Irsquom sure of it, and took a photo.But there wasnrsquot really anything of much interest to see other than a slab on the ground where I believe the well once stood.It seemed so forgotten, and put me in a melancholy mood for a moment.I reflected on the way something that had been a tradition for so long, and such a part of many peoplersquos lives can just vanish, and be utterly forgotten.I know it was just a well and so might not seem important.But it was a meeting place for ordinary people for generations.The simple shared routines and places in our lives are often the ones we remember with nostalgia.We donrsquot think of them as history or worthy of recording until all memory has gone, and itrsquos too late.I thought about this as we were going on our local family walk this week.I suppose we all know we are living through a time that will be recorded by history.But when all this is over, and things are back to ldquonormal what simple things will you, and your family, remember from this time and what will you want remembered For me, this includes seeing the Greenhills carpeted with wildflowers for the first time that I can remember, watching children cycle on empty streets and deserted car parks, and queuing in shops, keeping our physical distance while also trying to stay social.For sure the toilet roll panic will be part of history.But all of us will have special moments and places that connect to the emotions of this time.There will be stories of peoplersquos wonderful community spirit, what it felt like to be confined in the house for weeks, and how we entertained ourselves.We are all historians of our own time, and we should find ways to record and remember the simple, but important, things we have felt and encountered during this time of crisis.Because memory fades, and as the fate of the Bickers Well shows,memories are not recorded or stories of them not told, they will be forgotten.And so this was why I decided to re-visit the story of the Bickers Well for my column this week.It may have originally seemed there was not much to tell about it.Yet once there was.But the memories and the stories connected to it seemed so simple and obvious at the time that nobody really thought them important enough to record or keep treasured.Now all that remains of those stories is a slab on the pavement.The technology we have makes it easier now to share and record our lives.So letrsquos use it to consciously be historians and storytellers of this dficult time to capture images and feelings, the happenings that may today seem too simple and commonplace to record, but in future will be a fascinating insight to our lives in this historic event.For me, that is the lesson of the Bickers Well."},{"url":null,"title":"winton-brewery-takes-countys-micropub","story":"Steve Holligan and David Mackinnon, from Winton Brewery, stepped behind the bar at Dunbarrsquos Station Yard Micropub at the beginning of the month.Currently, the duo are only allowed to sell off-sales, due to the coronavirus lockdown preventing customers from entering the pub, but they were looking forward to once again welcoming people inside as soon as possible.Steve said: ldquoWersquove been looking for a while to find something like this.ldquoThe Station Yard is unbelievable.ldquoWe looked in Haddington, we looked in Gullane and we wanted to stay in East Lothian, where we are from and where the brewery is based.ldquoIt was one of those things where you were scrolling through Facebook and this popped up.ldquoIt was too good an opportunity and we got in touch with Gerard McPhillips [who had created the pub alongside his late business partner David McGee] and had a really good meeting with him.

They have now been working from home for more than a month and have continued to support vulnerable and disadvantaged young people with ious issues which has brought about some ldquounexpected outcomes.Lynne Anderson, transitions development worker, has noticed that she is able to use her time more wisely by phoning her clients instead of driving up to an hour each way to visit them at their homes.She said: ldquoWe can use this situation to learn how things work dferently. There are opportunities to continue doing some of the activities we are doing remotely when weto normal.She is one of several staff members who have had to change the way they give support over the past weeks but it still focuses on many of the same issues. They provide help with filling out job and college applications, and provide young people with emotional support and tutoring. The response has also generally been very positive, with staff members reporting engagement levels of up to  per cent from their clients.Natasha McInninie, transitions service co-ordinator, said: ldquoI am surprised by how resilient young people are. I thought we would lose a lot of young people through this situation. However, it has actually made them engage more.Emma Scarclfe, acting chief executive, is also very pleased by how both Bridges Project staff and the young people they work with have responded to the current crisis.She said: ldquoBridges Project has adapted quickly to the unexpected situation around Covid-. Engagement continues to be extremely high and the commitment and dedication from staff to change their working practices so quickly to suit each inidual young person has been a complete triumph. Wersquore all very proud of the way young people have adapted and how resilient they are.However, there are also issues which have become ldquomagnied during the lockdown, for example, people who have dficult relationships with their family members struggle with being ldquolocked up together over such a long period. Others are affected by less income and need help with accessing food parcels, Universal Credit and other types of financial support.Many young people also need help to deal with the impact the Covid- crisis is having on their mental health. This is particularly the case for those who were already struggling with social anxiety or social isolation prior to the lockdown.Lynne said: ldquoIn the beginning, the young people thought it was fantastic. Now the reality of the lockdown is settling in and it is starting to become challenging.This trend has also been observed by personal development worker, Chris Nicol, who said: ldquoThe young people were dealing with it well during the first few weeks but have seen a downturn in their mood over the last two weeks. This is due to a combination of boredom and too much time to think but also not seeing their friends. They have realised how important those social anchors really are.He highlighted the importance of keeping young peoplersquos motivation and confidence up during these challenging times.He explained: ldquoI remind them that they need to focus on the fact that this will last for a relatively short period of their lives and things will go back to normal.Thank you for reading this story.

We know local newsagents deliver to many people, but this short-term scheme will ensure that people who donrsquot get a delivery or who canrsquot afford a Courier are kept in touch. It is also important to support the Courier during this periodwe are to see it survive. Newspapers are essential for local democracy and the Courier regularly reports on issues we discuss at the council.One of the volunteers who deliver the newspaper is Susan Taylor ndash in her beloved Dolly CV which goes by the name of Myrtille.Susan, whose day job is working for the Church of Scotland as an executive assistant, is one of the team of resilience group volunteers picking up prescriptions for residents.ldquoI volunteered because I really feel for those people in our community who are at risk and isolated due to the Covid- outbreak, she said. ldquoI have met some lovely people so far and am glad I am in a position to help.The project is paid for through the townrsquos Community Emergency Resilience Fund ndash which comprises public donations, funding from North Berwick Community Council and the North Berwick Trust.Rotary Haddington was always looking for ways to support its community, said club president Malcolm Collins.ldquoOur idea to bulk-buy and distribute copies of the Courier to the elderly and vulnerable originated from one of our members who was quick to realise that a signicant number of such people would soon begin to feel isolated and lose touch with what was happening locallythey were unable to get out and buy a copy, he added.ldquoAs well as providing local news, the initiative shown by the Courier by including pages of extra puzzles in the paper was also thought to be useful to help keep folk entertained during these dficult times.ldquoWe have now taken this idea forward and arranged to bulk-buy copies of the Courier each week in advance, have them delivered to a central hub and then arranged for them to be distributed to other locations where they can be made available to those in need e.g. Our Community Kitchen, those in care homes and other locations as they become known to us.Rotary Haddington members would ensure that the papers were delivered where they were needed, he added.Courier Editor Robbie Scott said: ldquoWersquore so grateful to these groups for supporting our communities during lockdown and the amazing work they do inspires us to produce the best papers that we can.ldquoFor them to also directly support us at a dficult time for all businesses is incredible and we thank them immensely.See pages - for the latest brilliant efforts of the countyrsquos resilience groups during the Covid- lockdown.

A report is expected by mid-May.Pub chain Wetherspoonrsquos has said it plans to reopen its bars and hotels in June and said that due to it having larger than average pubs social distancing measures could be applied.RetailMinisters are thought to be considering allowing some non-essential businesses to open, such as garden centres and car showrooms, provided social-distancing could be maintained.Lobby group the British Retail Consortium has produced guidelines on how stores could prepare for the easing of restrictions.The guidance draws on lessons learned from supermarkets in recent weeks to ensure the re-opening of non-essential firms can be done safely.Advice coverslimiting entry and exit points, using floor markings to outline social distancing and keeping changing rooms closed.The guidance also suggests installing cleaning stations with hand sanitiser and disinfectant wipes at the front of stores.SportIt is understood Culture Secretary Olive Dowden has been working on a plan for major sports to be played behind closed doors when some social-distancing rules are eased.Weekly meetings are to be held between the Government, Public Health England and medical officials from sports bodies, with the issue due to be on the table when ministers review current measures next month.Key questions that need to be tackled include testing requirements, burdens on emergency services and the possible impact on fan behaviour ndash such as impromptu gatherings outside grounds.Sporting bodies are understood to be keen to resume full training safely as soon as possible.TravelLast week, low-cost European carrier Wizz Air announced plans to resume some flights from Luton Airport on May .Cabin crew will be required to wear masks and gloves on all flights and will distribute sanitising wipes for passengers, while new distancing measures will also be introduced during boarding.Mr Raab has indicated that officials are looking at possible checks at air and sea ports, with passengers arriving in the UK required to quarantine for  days.Meanwhile, the Rail, Maritime and Transportunion warned there was ldquozero chance of ramping up transport services soon, amid speculation of an increase on May  or May  when a new rail timetable is due.Last week, industry sources said no dates have yet been agreed or announced."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/11196907.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"gerry-cinnamon-announces-second-glasgow-hydro-gig-popular-demand","story":"The Castlemilk singer recently told how he is to play the SSE Hydro on December  following his insane TRNSMT set.This morning the venue confirmed a second leg of his Glasgow show the next night for December .EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FOR @GerryCinnamon!! #Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW... https:t.co JVHyTY pic yXRWuCIimPosting on social media the Hydro wrote: \"EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FORGerry Cinnamon.\"Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW...\"We told previously howCinnamon, , told fans they had \"lost it\"they didnt think hed soon play in Glasgow and his latest output confirmed two December gigs for lucky punters to get excited about.He will also play Aberdeen in November."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-incredible-moment-karaoke-singer-stuns-hamilton-pub-nessun-dorma-performance","story":"William Boyle had the usually rowdy crowd at Bar West at a hushed silence as he bellowed through Paottis famous tune.The clip was posted on social media by user Ann Robertson who hailed the performer.:Watch boy, , belt out Bohemian Rhapsody on Central Station pianoShe said: \"I love all music but my absolute fave song in the whole world is Nessun Dorma by Luciano Paotti.\"I hope I dont embarass this gentleman but he nailed this in Bar West tonight n should be proud.

Even reputable sightings like the odd darting lights witnessed by several commercial airline pilots over Ireland recentlybarely registered a raised eyebrow.Perhaps, then, UFOs really are just a fading hangover from less informed times, when our species was far more susceptible to vague notions of the supernatural ndash before smartphone addiction stopped our minds from wandering, killing imagination, wonder and creativity stone dead.Perhaps Sir Trevorrsquos new gig chatting to folk with morals lower than snake testicles ndash not celebs, the monsters he salaciously affords the oxygen of publicity on his abhorrent Inside Death Row show ndash is also indicative of todayrsquos anaesthetised indference to anything thatrsquos not taking place within our own culture silos.Perhaps thedying scream of a world quickly spiralling into an uninhabitabledystopia is being deafened by the static of digital isolation. In such a dystopian, self-obsessed reality, it might actually take something as seismic as the sight of a UFO hovering over a major city to dig us out our deep burrows and unite us again as a species.Escape the netTHE smoking gun often held up by cynics dismissing the UFO phenomenon is the distinct lack of any clear photos in this smartphone-dominated era.Certainly, two major online sites for reporting sightings ndash the National UFO Reporting Center and the Mutual UFO Network ndash have both experienced numerical declines parallel to Gary Glitterrsquos royalty cheques.The internet itself can certainly shoulder some of the blame for UFOs fading fame too. Despite the initial promise that free access to information and instant communication could birth a more enlightened, empowered and equal world, a grotesque funfair mirror reflection of reality has instead haemorrhaged.Without gatekeepers, lies are now afforded an equal  to truth, and the ensuing static serves only to discombobulate focus and perception. In the era of spin, reality distortion, Photoshop and Deepfakes, good luck finding credible evidence of your own existence never mind UFOs. The internet is rather like communism ndash wonderful in theory, but the cradle of horror when human nature is added to the formulae.At times, however, some notable events do cut through the noise. Commercial pilots are certainly credible witnesses and that recentincident over the Irish sea proved that very strange things continue to happen in our skies ndash even odder than folk willingly paying pound for a coffee and biscuit.Some of the iniduals now coming forward to tell their stories are actually more plausible witnesses than those we trust to steer us through the clouds in a sky-dart ndash high ranking government employees and military personnel with nothing to gain and everything to lose. Yet, despite waving all manner of prestigious credentials, itrsquos likely they will be taken as seriously as folk who claim to have skinny-dipped with Nessie.Full DisclosureOVER the past few decades, there have been several ldquoofficial movements attempting to find some sort of objective truth on UFOs.The most high profile is lsquoDisclosurersquo, where ufologist Steven Greer herded  whistle-blowers ndash including astronaut Gordon Cooper and a brigadier general ndash for a fascinating press conference held in Washington DC in . The aim  To ldquoestablish the reality of extraterrestrial vehicles, le forms and exotic technologies\".Yet, groups like Disclosure are finding it tough to gain publicity in the mainstream media, where editors have licked a finger and held it to the wind, deeming the public has lost its appetite for such frivolity in an age filled with real clear and present otherworldly dangers.But who needs the media as a conduit when the lying, conspiring governments themselves are now releasing the most intriguing and credible UFO evidence for public consumption Perhaps most jaw-dropping of all the recently declassied military footage released by the US Defence Department is an encounter between Navy F- fighters and several unidentied aircraft. The recording captures several pilots discussing a hovering egg-shaped craft, apparently one of a ldquofleet. Another film trumps that however ndash showing an F-rsquos close encounter with what is clearly, well, an unidentied flying object.More sober mindsets will speculatethis was simply space junk catching the sunrsquos light or even an advanced craft piloted by tiny Russians. Yet, such speculation itself suggests something even more terrying than the existence of UFOs ndash that we might actually be completely alone in the universe.The Pentagon comes cleanIF itrsquos a credible UFO whistleblower yoursquore after, perhaps someone with a lot to lose from being subject to ridicule from his peers, then Christopher Mellon is your man ndash a former deputy assistant Secretary of Defence for Intelligence for the Clinton and George W Bush administrations.Bemoaning the lack of transparent government investigations into valid sightings, Mellon recently told the Washington Post: ldquoI know from numerous discussions with Pentagon officials over the past two years that military departments and agencies treat such incidents as isolated events rather than as part of a pattern requiring serious attention and investigation.He also makes reference to his colleague Luis Elizondo - who used to run a Pentagon intelligence program examining evidence of ldquoanomalous aircraft - resigning in protest at the US governmentrsquos seeming indference to a ldquogrowing body of empirical data.ldquoNobody wants to be lsquothe alien guyrsquo in the national security bureaucracy, Mellon soberly concluded. ldquoNobody wants to be ridiculed or sidelined for drawing attention to the issue. Yet, the current attitude is a serious and recurring impediment to progress.Other declassied documents reveal that the US Air Force recently launched several F- fighters in a failed attempt to intercept an unidentied high-speed aircraft darting over the Pacic. Defence Department officials also confirmed more than a dozen similar incidents taking place off the US East Coast since .Itrsquos perhaps no coincidence that these stories emerged not long after the Pentagon itself publicly acknowledged the existence of a program dedicated to studying unidentied flying objects. The soberly-monikered Advanced Aviation Threat Identication Program ran from  to , but many officials claim its efforts have simply resumed under another name. Either way, admission of its existence has marked one of the most signicant disclosures about UFO government research since the infamous Project Blue Book, a y US Air Force study into thousands of sightings that was shut down in .Officially, Project Blue Book failed to find ldquoany technological developments or principles beyond the range of present-day scientic knowledge, yet a small number of its investigations remain unexplained. And thatrsquos the thing ndasheven one of the millions of UFO sightings is true, then the phenomenon is conclusively proven. Just one.Wharsquos like US FAR from being a spectacle confined to the toothless whispers of banjo prodigies, Scotland is no stranger to wee visits from aliens, interdimentional structures, highly evolved sky dragons and time travellers from the future. Perhaps all fouryoure in Port Glasgow.Just last year, an Airbus A with  people on board which was making its final approach into Glasgow airport, came within  feet of colliding with a ldquoblue, yellow and silver object, which pilots witnessed flying underneath it. The disturbed crew immediately contacted air traffic control, stating: ldquoNot quite sure what it was but itrsquos definitely quite large and itrsquos blue and yellow. Prestwick airport backed up the sighting, with radar detecting an ldquounidentied track history . miles east of the planes position  seconds earlier.However Scotlandrsquos most infamous UFO tale, unique in British history as the only example of a close encounter becoming the subject of a criminal investigation, is known as The Livingston Incident. Forestry worker Robert Taylor claims he saw \"a huge flying dome\" in woodland near Dechmont Law on November , , describing it as seven metres in diameter, and made of a dark metallic material with a rough texture like sandpaper.Taylor claimed to have experienced an acrid smell \"like burning brakes\" and the sensation of being dragged. When police visited the site, they found marks in the soil where the craft was said to have hovered, and further tracks following the path of two ldquomine-like objects. Taylor, who died in , never sought publicity or financial gain ndash and always stood by his account.Perhaps he would have found a more sympathetic audience in Bonnybridge, home of the infamous Falkirk Trianglersquo. This well-kent ndash and henceforth thoroughly monetised ndash phenomenon was first reported in  and the area still continues to register around  sightings a year, more than any other place on Earth ndash even more than the notorious Area  in Nevada. The fact it attracts a lot of UFO tourists who are perhaps inclined to believe in the phenomenon ndash and also want their moneys worth ndash is neither here nor there, of course.Scots UFO expert Ron Halliday says: \"One theory is that there could be a window into another dimension, other worlds, the past or the future. Even Nessie probably thinks thats a bit outlandish. Although where  would you visit but Scotlandthis planet is simply some sort of space zoo for holidaying Zeta Reticulians And finally hellipTemporal lobe epilepsy is an unenviable yet fascinating condition that many doctors deem entirely responsible for all occurances of inexplicable supernatural phenomena, from UFOs to religious communion to the indeterminate forces holding Donald Trumprsquos barnet together.Those afflicted may not be aware of their condition, unwittingly suffering brief seizures, paralysis, vivid hallucinations and ndash notably ndash an overwhelming feeling of something other in their vicinity.If UFOs are indeed a purely internally projected phenomenon, we can then safely assume such stories would likely reflect current sociological, technological and cultural fears and aspirations.Certainly during the Cold War, the beings described in these close encounters were often characterised as benign saviours who wanted to help humans overcome the prospect of nuclear annihilation.And after events such as Watergate and the Vietnam war fuelled mass distrust in government, witnesses came to describe UFOs as a threat to humanity ndash their sinister and all-powerful occupants often rendering abductees powerless and repeatedly probing themagainst their will.

Many of us, myself included, will have come to the conclusion that social contact, time spent with other human beings, is the most precious thing in our lives.This is certainly the case for most of the older folk I speak tonow, especially those who have lost their partner and or live alone. Spending time with children, grandchildren, siblings and pals is what keeps them going. It doesnrsquot take a PhD in psychology to work out that Skype and Zoom will only suffice for so long.I was walking in an empty Glasgow city centre recently and the saddest thing of all was the absence of the cheery bands of elderly ladies and gents that usually frequent Sauchiehall Street on week days, comparing prices and purchases, enjoying a cuppa and a scone, or a pint.

Experts at Dundee University Museum Collections were also involved.The result of their work is a huge online store offering the public free, unrestricted access to hundreds of models through the Sketchfab content-sharing .As well as the Carola, there are images of MV Spartan, the only surviving Scottish-built ldquopuffer, and RNLB Jane Anne, a rare surviving example of a double-ended, self-righting leboat which is hugely important to the Maritime Museumrsquos local community of Irvine.Staff at Dundee University, meanwhile, scanned specimens preserved in its globally famous zoological collection.Among the overseas items featured are the Smithsonianrsquos Apollo  Columbia command module, a Tyrannosaurus Rex skull from the Digital Atlas of Ancient Le and a fourth century BC sculpture held by the Minneapolis Institute of Art.Marta Pilarska, D Digitisation Project Manager at the Maritime Museum, said the models would create an entirely new relationship with members of the public.ldquoAll of a sudden ... we have this digital output that can serve not only as a condition-monitoring tool but is also visually appealing, she explained.ldquoWe can use it to engage with the public and allow online visitors to explore our collection in a new way. One of the benefits of this ndash particularlyyoursquore talking about vessels such as MV Spartan and SY Carola ndash is that while visiting the Museum in Irvine one can view the vessels from the outside, but access to interiors is restricted.ldquoImmersive virtual tours, based on -degree imaging, enabled us to make those areas accessible.However, the technical challenges were signicant.ldquoWersquove had to move quickly through a big but rewarding learning curve, said Ms Pilarska.ldquoD laser scanning and photogrammetry are the two main techniques used in digital recording of heritage sites and objects.\"Photogrammetry is the one used more often in the museum sector, as it is regarded as being easier and more budget-friendly. In short, it comes down to taking hundreds of images from all around the object and processing them in a software capable of recognising distinctive features of these objects and hellip digitally reconstructing the objectrsquos geometry. Based on that, the D model is built.\"Laser scanning, on the other hand, guarantees high accuracy and is considered a standard D surveying method.ldquoWhenever a laser beam sent from the scanner hits the surface of the object and s to the sensor, it is recorded as a precise measurement. Scanners send and record millions of such beams during data capture and all of them are stored as points in D space, or point clouds. Those point clouds are then what underpins the accurate D model.\"Ms Pilarska hopes the scans will become a huge online draw while the Maritime Museum itself is closed under coronavirus lockdown measures.But the project, she stressed, was not solely about boosting interaction with the public. Building up detailed information about the vessels themselves was another key aim.ldquoHaving an accurate record of the museum collection was one of two reasons to have this project happen, she said. ldquoPublic access is the second.ldquoCreating detailed documentation of museum collections has always been one of the fundamentals of curatorsrsquo work, and D documentation feels like the next step that the sector will take with advancements in technology.Over at Dundee University, Dr Caroline Erolin and her students scanned specimens from the world-famous DrsquoArcy Thompson Zoology Museum. Among the more unusual and exotic contributions are a sea turtle carapace, a pencil urchin and a rhinoceros hindfoot.For Ms Erolin, a senior lecturer in medical art, questions over how much of the universityrsquos collection would be posted touched on a growing debate around ensuring that public access to artefacts does not come at the expense of a proper appreciation of their origin.ldquoTherersquos a movement to say that everything should be totally open access and rights-free for the public, she said.ldquoThe counter argument is that objects can then be viewed and shared without anything about their cultural context, where they have come from.ldquoWe wanted to take part but not put the whole collection up online and make the entire thing open access.ldquoSo we put  objects online, totally open access, and around another  more under a lsquonon-commercial, attribution, share-alikersquo licence, although people like members of the general public can still download thosethey want to.ldquoWe will see how that goes and may make more open access in the future.Ms Erolin said the availability of the Sketchfab store felt particularly important as the coronavirus lockdown continues and Scots look for sources of mental stimulation at home.ldquoIt definitely has value terms of public outreach, she added.ldquoMatthew Jarron, the museum curator, was quite keen because [the museum] is campus-based and itrsquos not open to the public that often.ldquoWe thought it would be nice to have certain specimens more accessible on a permanent basis.ldquoMembers of the public can download the scanned images free, then D print them. So there are multiple aspects of it from a public engagement point of view.ldquoOf course, this was before coronavirus and so itrsquos timely to have that dferent means of access.ldquoEven when the museum is open, itrsquos maybe a bit harder for some people ndash the disabled, for example - to access it, so it just widens access in the general sense.It is also possible the store will continue growing.ldquoI donrsquot knowwe will realistically scan everything,\" she said. \"But perhaps, with an internship, we will have someone coming in and doing a few more scans and plan to keep building it up."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11322270.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scientists-discover-scots-witnessed-end-world-werent-fish-time","story":"IN the somewhat fancul plotof Hollywood blockbusterArmageddon, the lsquoworldrsquos greatest deep sea drillerrsquo Harry Stiller ndash played by a stoic, steely-jawed Bruce Willis ndash has his unique skillset procured by NASA and findshimself blasted off to the surface of an incoming asteroid ... to blow it out of the sky with anuclear bomb.Highly dubious science aside, the Box Office success of Armageddon did serve to highlight a very real threat to the human racersquos survival that is perhaps even more sobering than pandemics such as coronavirus ndash huge asteroids on a trajectory to Earth with the potential to wipe out much of the planetrsquos biological le.Certainly, the astral body that flew past this Wednesday ndash Asteroid OR, to give the two mile-long rock its Sunday name - would have wiped out much of the planetrsquos organic matter,it hadnrsquot soared past at a relatively near-miss of  times the Earth-Moon distance.Asteroidwas the biggest fly-by expected this year, with professional and amateur observers watching it pass as a slow-moving lsquostarrsquo. More visible to the naked eye, however -le hadnrsquot been confined to the oceans at the time ndash would have been the huge object that smashed off the north west coast of Scotland . billion years ago, an event recently discoveredby geologists.A team of UK researchers have uncovered signs of a huge asteroid collision in the Stac Fada deposit in the Northwest Highlands, with rocks there containing high levels of chemicals found in asteroids.They also detected quartz crystals which have been subjected to intense pressures and heat - leading researchers to believe they have pinpointed the exact spot where the asteroid hit.Academics from the University of Oxford and the University of Exeter claim the impact crater lies between nine and  miles off the coast in the Minch, which separates the mainland from the Outer Hebrides.Today, the spot is buried beneath water and rocks, rendering it inaccessible - so they pinpointed the possible site bystudying the alignment of magnetic particles and distribution of debris thrown outwards at the time of the collision.ldquoIf you imagine debris flowing out in a big cloud across the landscape, hugging the ground, eventually that material slows down and comes to rest, said study author Kenneth Amor. ldquoBut itrsquos the stuff out in front that stops first while the stuff behind is still pushing forward and it overlaps whatrsquos in front.ldquoThatrsquos what we see and it gives us a strong directional indicator that we can trace backwards.The huge asteroid, estimated to have been between . and . miles wide, is believed to have struck when Scotland was a still a semi-arid environment located near the equator. Amor estimates the crater resulting from the impact spans almost nine miles in , with a depth of around . miles ndash making it the biggest ever astral collision ever discovered in the UK.Experts believe meteorite strikes were relatively common billions of years ago, as Earth and other planets were pelted with debris left over from the formation of the solar system.Amor says the new research marks such an exciting discovery because impact craters typically erode over time.ldquoIt was purely by chance that this one landed in an ancient rt valley where fresh sediment quickly covered the debris to preserve it, he states.Now that the craterrsquos possible location has been discovered, scientists aim to conduct targeted, D geophysical surveys of the Minch Basin.High-resolution surveys could help the research team get a better sense of the dimensions of the crater - and might even have important implications for other celestial bodieswe learn more about their composition and trajectory.ldquoImpact craters on Earth are exceedingly rare, Amor said. ldquoThe better we can understand how they formed the better we can understand observations on the rocky planets and moons of the solar system.--------------------------------------------------Space enthusiasts get ready to rockGlasgow academics call for volunteers to help collect meteorites as part of UK Fireball NetworkSCOTTISH scientists are turning their eyes to the skies to track meteorites ndash smaller, less threatening iations of their asteroid cousins - before they land on UK soil and want volunteers to help recover the space rocks wherever they fall.The UK Fireball Network, led by researchers from the University of Glasgow and Imperial College London is setting out to place  cameras across the country to catch glimpses of the spectacular natural firework displays caused when meteoroids enter the Earthrsquos atmosphere.It is part of a wider network called the Global Fireball Observatory operated by researchers in Australia at Curtin University.Earlier this year in February, the networkrsquos cameras filmed their first fireball, which dropped meteorites into the North Sea.SKYFALL:Volunteers will help scientists search for traces of meteorites which have been tracked on camera.While those are impossible to recover, the network team expect that future sightings that fall on the UK landmass can be properly triangulated to determine a landing area and send out a search party to find future meteorites.Dr Luke Daly, of the University of Glasgowrsquos School of Geographical and Earth Sciences, is one of the leaders of the UK Fireball Network. He said: ldquoMeteorites provide scientists with invaluable insights into other planets and our solar system. A good deal of what we know about the surface of Mars, for example, comes from analysis of chunks of the planet which were blasted off its surface by asteroid impacts millions of years ago and drted in space before falling to Earth.ldquoMeteorites enter our atmosphere all the time, but the UK hasnrsquot had a great track record of finding them ndash in fact, itrsquos been nearly  years since one was last seen dropping into a back garden in Glatton in Cambridgeshire, and more than  since one was observed in Scotland.ldquoCamera networks like ours, and those of partner organisations like UKMON and SCAMP, give us a great chance to capture fireballs on multiple cameras.ldquoTogether we are building an integrated pipeline to use all the data from all the networks to track fireballs called the UK Fireball Alliance.ldquoIt was very exciting to capture our first images of a fireball caught by two of our observatories, although it was obviously disappointing that the material it dropped fell into the sea.ldquoWhen we do catch sight of a fireball dropping meteorites on land, wersquoll need the help of volunteers to help comb the countryside to find them, so anyone interested in making a little bit of history by getting involved can follow us on Twitter at @FireballsUK."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-councils-told-use-reserves-155m-support-withheld","story":"Last month, the UK Government announced an additional pound. billion was being handed over to local authorities - with pound million given to the Scottish Government as part of funding conesquentials.But Finance Secretary Kate Forbes is refusing to hand over the money to Scottish councils until she is satisfied with how much they need.Ms Forbes has written to COSLA, the umbrella organisation representing Scottish councils, suggesting that authorities dip into their reserves instead.Edinburgh City Council has warned it faces increased costs and loss of cash of more than pound millionthe shutdown last for six months, while Highlands Council has also stressed it could see an extra pound million added to its financial pressures.The issue was raised by Conservative MSP, Graham Simpson, who told Ms Forbes that local councils were \"hopping mad\" about the situation.:Coronavirus: Edinburgh Council needs radical action to plug poundm pandemic gapMr Simpson said: \"On April , Robert Jenrick announced that councils in England were to get an extra pound. billion to help in the effort against Covid-.\"Scotland would get pound million in consequentials from that - but councils here havenrsquot yet heardthey are going to receive a penny of that money and to put it mildly, they are hopping mad about that.\"Labour local government spokesperson, Sarah Boyack, said it was \"critical\" that councils are given certainty from the Scottish Government.She added: \"They have already transformed their services for our communities and staff through the pandemic, their incomes have already been reduced and they already had existing budget pressures.

They were also, mostly, people who had kids.Last week, this paper reported that millions of people forced to work from home ldquomay be at risk of burnout as their work-le balance is turned upside down.

He wants to manage it himself, but it seems unmanageable. Work arrives on dferent s ndash via email, Teams, website downloads ndash with assignments often not where you expect them to be.Reports into lockdown delivery of online education are revealing a staggering dference between inidual schools, and crucially between the state and private sector. Neil Mackay, writing in this paper last week, reported that a survey by the Scottish Secondary Teachersrsquo Association before Easter found that less than half of children were engaging with teachers. He described how one teacher had told him she only had four children out of  join an online lesson. I recognise that.

The open spaces, the fresh air and all the things that make the route special havenrsquot changed ndash the seascapes are still there, the landscape is still amazing, the food from sea and land, and the infrastructure is still there.ldquoCovid- has meant we have had to hit the pause button, but all the reasons that made NC the number one route in the world have not changed.The NC winds its way north from Inverness to Dornoch, Wick and Dunnet Head, traversing the roof of Scotland before twisting and turning its way along the west coast and crossing back to its starting point.Travellers could simply plot their own course around the routersquos scenic attractions, but many opt to become paid-up members of the NC travel ldquoclub, giving them precious access to inside information and advice to make their experience more enjoyable.An overwhelming number of tourists who complete the route give it a giant ldquothumbs up ndash % according to the routersquos  visitor survey. What began as an initiative to bring some fresh opportunities to the area was last year estimated to have boosted the economy by pound. million and created around  full-time jobs.For businesses, travellers in their cars, campervans, motorbikes and even cycles have brought unexpected prosperity. Room occupancy for hotels and bed and breakfasts has soared from around % to around % ndash in some places even higher ndash with room rates almost doubling in price.

However,strict lockdown rules are in place, there could be a question of whether even travelling from their Edinburgh home to Sunderland to collect their baby will be outlawed.ldquoEverything depends on what happens with the baby nearer the time, and whether it will have to be a hospital birth, added Chris. ldquoWe will deal with whatever the situation is. We are just looking forward to being parents.NHS trusts across the UK also have strict rules restricting scans, antenatal appointments and classes to just the pregnant woman, leading to concerns that intended parents are missing key moments and information related to their baby.Instead, Chris, , and Kevin, , are relying on videos filmed by their surrogate Linder which show their baby kicking and making recordings of themselves reading stories to be played to the growing baby so it becomes aware of their voices.ldquoThe key thing from day one has been that Linder is healthy and the baby is healthy, added Kevin. ldquoMissing the -week scan was disheartening and we were sad, but also ecstatic. We are just trying to crack on.Under normal circumstances, maternity wards allow intended parents to spend time in hospital after the birth enabling the surrogate ndash although legally the infantrsquos mother ndash to have no role in its care.However, there are fears surrogate mothers may now feel pressured to take over caring responsibilities such as feeding, bathing and nappy changes, and to make decisions over the babyrsquos care while waiting to be discharged.Linder, who has previously delivered surrogate babies to two other couples, said: ldquoI understand the reasons for restrictions, but there is a need to make an exception.ldquoThe baby will have two parents who are willing to look after it. I have no biological link with the baby and Irsquom not prepared to provide care for the baby ongoing, because itrsquos not right for me to do that.She added: ldquoIrsquove heard of surrogates having to look after the baby until they are discharged. Irsquove also heard of hospitals allowing the surrogate to be discharged while a parent goes in to look after the baby until it is ready to leave, which is much better. Itrsquos really important that Chris and Kevin can be there and have those first moments with their baby.There are also concerns that the legal processes which pass on full parental rights may be delayed due to Covid-, potentially leaving families in limbo for months.Olivia Rowlands, , whose womb was damaged by bowel cancer treatment which also sparked early menopause, and husband Sam, , from St Andrews, have also had their hopes of attending their babyrsquos birth thrown into confusion.Ellie Hutchinson, , from Stirling, Oliviarsquos cousin, is due to give birth to the couplersquos daughter by planned caesarean section in July.Olivia said: ldquoWe really donrsquot know what will happen during the birth.ldquoWe had hoped we could both be there ndash I canrsquot imagine not being able to see Samrsquos face when our baby is born. Wersquore not surethat will be possible.ldquoAfter the birth is a really tricky part. Ellie really wants Sam and I to be the ones who look after our daughter as soon as shersquos born and we want this to be as easy as possible for her.ldquoOn paper, Ellie is the legal mum. I canrsquot imagine the doctors saying I canrsquot be there and making Ellie look after the little one.

Stuart said: ldquoWe donrsquot really know how long a delay this will cause, we are at the mercy of the rules stopping all fertility treatment.ldquoSurrogacy is incredibly complicated and complex with rules and regulations that we have had to learn about.ldquoWe had already resigned ourselves to the fact it would take a while.

The tune the bells played was at the very least ambivalent about the newly-forged connection, Why Should I Be Sad On My Wedding Day.Well, maybe, although the hostility to the conjoining is underestimated. However you view the creation of what was to be Great Britain there is no doubt it was vigorously and violently opposed by the majority of Scots.Riots in Edinburgh and other Scottish towns in the months and years leading up to it had become a feature of everyday le. The Duke of Hamilton, who led the nationalist opposition , was cheered along the Royal Mile as he passed each day in his carriage, whereas the Duke of Queensberry, who supported the deal, required round-the-clock protection from hostile mobs chucking not just epithets but anything they could lay their hands on.When Daniel Defoe arrived in the city in  in his day job as an English secret agent, he described ldquoa Scots rabble is the worst of its kind, while conceding that ldquofor every Scot in favour of the union there were  opposed.Scotland had been all but bankrupted by the Darien scheme to build a colony on the plague-afflicted isthmus of Panama although as most of the population had nothing to lose, their level of poverty remained as crushing and deadly as it had before. It was the nobles and rich speculators, who had gambled and lost in the mad venture, who were hustling it through on the promise of a better time, mainly for themselves as they were to receive more than half of their losses ed.The Edinburgh parliament represented Scottish opinion only in a theoretical sense, made up as it was of self-perpetuating noblemen and landowners, but this was true of all parliaments wherever they existed. By the eve of the Union there were  parliamentarians, some  hereditary peers,  \"shire\" or county commissioners, and  burgh commissioners.The rough head count at the time reckoned that the majority of the parliament would be agin the deal, which is where blatant bribery was employed to buy votes and pay spies and agents provocateurs, pound, sterlingof which was distributed by the Earl of Glasgow.As Robert Burns famously put it, ldquoSuch a parcel of rogues in a nation they were ldquobought and sold for English gold.By then, the Scottish and English thrones had been united under one monarch for more than  years, since the Union of the Crowns in , when James Vl also became king of England when Queen Elizabeth died childless.James was Mary, Queen of Scots son, although he hadnrsquot seen her since he was an infant. The doomed Mary, taking advantage of May Day, wassailing and general drunkenness in Lochleven Castle where she was being held a prisoner in , managed to escape and head south. She was heedless of her advisers telling her not to go to London and she ended up, of course, heidless.May , eight years earlier, had seen theof John Knox from exile to lead the Scottish Reformation. And as Gandhi would probably have said had he been around to be asked: ldquoI think that would be a good idea.Knox believed that having a woman ruler ndash as he blasted in his famous tract The First Blast of the Trumpet against the monstrous regiment of women ndash was a violation of the natural order. Following Maryrsquos escape from Lochleven he joined the chorus condemning Mary as an adulteress and murderess and for the rest of his le spoke of her as ldquothat wicked woman.May  in  was also the day the King James Version of the Bible was published in London.There have been monsters throughout Scottish history, usually of the two-legged kind. On May  in  while one of most evil in history was starting a reign of terror on his people by first taking over German trade unions, here we were looking to the north of the country and Loch Ness, not to Hitler, and the legend of the serpentine monster began.There may have been local mutterings and sightings before but when the Inverness Courier ran a story about a large ldquobeast or ldquowhale-like fish it was christened Nessie. The writer was Alex Campbell, a water bailf on the loch and part-time journalist, and the article covered an alleged sighting by Aldie Mackay of an enormous creature writhing about the water as she and her husband drove along the shore.In Campbellrsquos words, ldquoThe creature disported itself, rolling and plunging for fully a minute, its body resembling that of a whale, and the water cascading and churning like a simmering cauldron. Soon, however, it disappeared in a boiling mass of foam.Not for long, however, because it was to reappear with regularity in the years that followed, to be photographed ndash although some of the shots were hoaxes or genuine misinterpretations of innocent logs and waves ndash and see surveys and expeditions camp on the shore for months, and to be written about until this day.The latest \"sighting\" was in  when Apple Maps showed a satellite image of what appeared to be a -metre-long monster, although it might just have been the wake of a boat, ripples caused by seals or floating wood.On that same day in , a monster capable of both destroying the world and powering it opened in southwest Scotland. It was the Chapelcross nuclear station on a former Second World War airfield near Annan, commissioned to produce weapons-grade plutonium for the UKrsquos weapons programme and also to generate power for the National Grid.The plant was decommissioned in  but the final demolition and site clearance wonrsquot be complete until at least , but more likely the new century. Hope yoursquore around for that.On May  in , the first Hillman Imp rolled off the production line at the new Rootes factory at Linwood. It was meant to compete with the highly-successful Mini, but it was hastily designed and badly executed. It was rear-engined and handled badly ndash some customers placed a bag of cement under the front bonnet to keep it stable ndash and it had an inadequate cooling system, gearbox and clutch problems, faulty chokes and a tendency to leak water. No surprise the Imp developed a reputation for unreliability.It wasnrsquot all bad as it provided work in an industry-ravaged area although that was not to last and, in , the company donated  Imps, painted green and white, for Celtic fans to drive to Lisbon to watch their team lt the European Cup.After  years it was over ndash ldquoLinwood no more as the Proclaimers sang in Letter From America ndash when Chrysler, which had taken over from Rootes, closed the factory and, in its words, put an end to that ldquodamned poorly-designed automobile.

review of business rates by former RBS chief Ken Barclay in  argued it was \"unfair\" that private schools benefit from reduced rates while state schools do not.Independent schools argue the rates paid by the state sector are a \"circular paper process\" between them and councils with no impact on school budgets.Nevertheless, measures to strip mainstream private schools of charitable relief were voted through Holyrood earlier this year as part of the Non-Domestic RatesAct.Private special schools and specialist independent music schools will continue to be eligible for charitable relief

in Melrose, Borders, told a Holyrood committee last year that some schools would \"most certainly\" close as a result of the change.He added: \"I think its just another hit thats going to make things very, very dficult for schools to operate.\"The Scottish Government confirmed the relevant part of the Non-Domestic Rates Act has now been delayed until April , , to assist independent schools as they deal with the impact of Covid-.Edward said many schools have furloughed employees such as groundskeepers and support staff.Meanwhile, some boarding pupils from China and where are stranded thousands of miles from home as a result of the lockdown.These students are being looked after by schools orfamilies.By the time the restrictions start to lt, Edward said, some pupils may have been separated from their families for around six months.Elsewhere, students stuck overseas are having to juggle dferent time zones to continue their studies.Edward said the impact on the economy from Covid- would inevitably have an effect on the independent sector.Many schools have reduced fees or moved cash into hardship funds to help families who have experienced a financial hit.\"It really is a case by case thing, because apart from anything  schools are not meant in any way to discuss fees with each other,\" Edward said.He said around two-thirds of the income independent schools generate in fees goes directly into staff salaries, while the fact they operate as charities means cash reserves are tight.Edward suggested many private schools down south, where there is a huge amount of competition, will not survive the coronavirus crisis.However, he said the autonomy of private schools has also allowed them to adapt quickly to the coronavirus lockdown.\"Their autonomy means that they can set up a system that works best for them in relation to their specic pupils,\" said Mr Edward. \"It doesnt have to be a one-size-fits-all system.\"Scottish Conservative education spokesman Jamie Greene said it is vital ministers support schools during the coronavirus crisis.He said: ldquoLike all sectors of our economy independent schools have been hit very hard by the lockdown.ldquoThe delay to the removal of charitable relief on business rates incurred by independent schools is therefore welcome.ldquoHowever, it remains the case that these schools were already facing considerable challenges from this policy change even before Covid-.ldquoIn a few cases, it meant uncertainty about whether the school could be financially viable in future years ndash something which has impact for the state sector as well as for the independent sector.ldquoIt is absolutely vital that the Scottish Government supports all schools when it comes to the damaging effects of Covid-. That includes all the schools in the independent sector.Private schools down south still enjoy at least % relief on their business rates.However in March it was reported the Independent Schools Association had warned its members this could change next year as part of a government review.The Scottish Government has announced extra rates reliefs and grants to help businesses through the coronavirus pandemic.A spokesman said: ldquoHaving considered the financial impact of Covid- and school closures on the independent schoolsrsquo sector in Scotland, we have decided to delay commencement of section  of the Non-Domestic RatesAct  until  April .ldquoThis decision was taken to assist mainstream independent schools as they ndash like all businesses in Scotland ndash deal with the impacts of Covid-.All non-domestic properties including independent schools will benefit from a .% rates relief in   which will be applied automatically by councils.ENDS"},{"url":null,"title":"virtually-perfect-scots-gardeners-turn-new-leaf-online","story":"The camerawork can sometimes be a tad shaky, there may well be occasional interruptions from the cat and the commentary might be a little bit breathless.But, having been denied the chance to show off their gardens for public viewing this spring, some of Scotlandrsquos best amateur gardeners have laid down their trowels and discovered new skills as film makers to showcase the dazzling fruits of their labours for us all to enjoy at home.Using rarely touched cameras, carefully picking their way down their garden steps, tiptoeing across immaculate lawns and zooming in to show off delicate blooms, gardeners across Scotland have created homemade versions of Gardenersrsquo World.As a result, their delightful short films are providing a peek at normally hidden blossoming back gardens, giving locked down viewers with nothing  to do but wonder what to do with their own back yard, much-needed real le inspiration.The private gardens captured on film by proud owners are among hundreds which had been due to throw open their gates to the public this spring and summer under Scotlandrsquos Garden Scheme.Normally the event is a chance for visitors to wander by dazzling floral displays, water features, fruit and vegetable patches and lovingly tended shrubs infor a charity donation.Lockdown, however, has meant the scheme, which has run every year since , had to be cancelled.Faced with hundreds of gardens at their blooming best with no-one but their owners to enjoy them, the organisers of the scheme suggested gardeners might head outside with mobile phones to capture their gardens now and in the weeks to come, both to keep the fundraising going and to bring naturersquos glory to viewers stuck indoors.Now the first efforts have been uploaded each offering a charming insight to the loving care green-fingered owners have poured into their outdoor space, as well as inspiration for anyone with a typical back garden ndash wheelie bins and all - crying out for plants but not sure where to start.ldquoSince  our charity has been successfully running open days every single year, even during WWII, but this stopped in March this year, says Terrill Dobson, the Director of Scotlandrsquos Gardens Scheme.ldquoAnd even though the gardens are looking splendid and people are seeking solace in gardening, our Garden Openers will not be able to welcome visitors for the foreseeable future.The Schemersquos call for videos has seen new videos arriving almost daily.ldquoGarden Openers genuinely want to share whatrsquos happening in their gardens while hoping to support the charities that now need it even more than ever. We ask people who would have come to the gardens to watch the videos and consider a donation.Of course, few watching may feel they can instantly achieve the heights of David Gallacher and Tom Williamson from Bonnyrigg. Their short video takes viewers around their ft by ft garden which is crammed with around  dferent plants,  containers and pots and  hanging baskets in a ft x ft area.Or, on a completely dferent level, the stunning garden at Shepherd House in Inveresk, East Lothian. Filmed by its owner, artist Lady Ann Fraser, viewers are taken on a leisurely stroll past calming water features, sculptures, vibrant flowers spilling over borders, clinging to arches and lining paths.Some gardeners taking part in whatrsquos been dubbed the lsquovirtual gardenrsquo scheme, have revealed expected talent as film makers, offering running commentaries of garden design, plant choices and gardening tips.In the case of Chris and Jerry Gregson of Greenbank Crescent in Edinburgh, filming involved negotiating steep steps and trying to avoid camera shake while chatting about how theyrsquove created terraces of colour.ldquoWe had to learn how to use the camera, says Chris. ldquoWersquove made two films, and now wersquore being asked to make more because people want to see what happens next in the garden.ldquoSometimes I canrsquot even see what Irsquom taking a picture of because the sun is in my eyes, so Irsquom pointing the camera and hoping for the best!In Stirling, Stephen Kellyrsquos short film shows how he has covered the back garden of his home in a typical modern estate with hundreds of jewel-coloured tulips. Standing tall in pots, borders and beds, they create dazzling splashes of colour and earned his home the name, the Tulip House.Best of all for would-be gardeners feeling overwhelmed by the thought of how to create their own floral extravaganza, he points out how simple they are to grow. ldquoIf yoursquove got some pots, fill them with soil, stick in some bulbs and yoursquore pretty much guaranteed to succeed.Meanwhile Jean Knox filmed her garden in Hunterrsquos Tryst, Edinburgh, despite efforts of her black and white cat, Tosh, to photobomb her efforts.ldquoHe likes to be with people, andI donrsquot engage with him, hersquoll just plant himself on the ground and roll over, she says.For would-be gardeners currently contemplating their own wilderness, she confesses her immaculate garden with its herbaceous and shrub beds, fruit, water features and seating areas, was once in chaos too.ldquoEverything in it now, I have done from scratch, she adds. ldquoI suggest people start with a masterplan and try to create their garden around what they want to use it for.For gardeners yet to find their green fingers, there is some comfort: ldquoIrsquove wasted a fortune over the years and I still make random purchases from the garden centre, she adds.ldquoIt often comes down to finding a place where a plant is happy and leaving it there.To watch the videos, visit Scotlandrsquos Garden Scheme at www.scotlandsgardens.org."},{"url":null,"title":"david-pratt-pandemic-press","story":"In the absence of pub quizzes during these days of social distancing, herersquos a question to ponder.In which current global table does Norway come out on top and North Korea find itself in bottom place Most of us hazarding a guess at the answer would likely say it had something to do with human rights, and that assertion wouldnrsquot be far off the mark.The answer is, in fact, the  World Press Freedom Index, compiled by the media watchdog, Reporters Without Borders, better known by its French acronym .As someone who has spent the last four decades of his le working in journalism, every year I examine the data compiled in the index with a degree of trepidation. Its main purpose is to evaluate the situation for journalists in  countries and territories across the globe.In this regard therersquos no doubt the index has become an extremely useful advocacy tool in helping promote free, independent and pluralistic journalism and in defending media workers rights.But vital as such a role is, this serves as little consolation to the fact that the conclusions drawn by the index these past few years have been far from heartening. The current index is no exception, or then again perhaps it is, for rarely in recent times has it portrayed a bleaker picture of the threats facing media freedom worldwide.Those threats, of course, have inevitably been amplied by the coronavirus pandemic, as existing and aspiring autocrats around the world crack down on journalistsrsquo ability to do their jobs at a time when transparency is more vital than ever.In fact, so pressing are those threats that RSF has warned that the next  years will pretty much determine the fate of journalism as we know it. ldquoWe are entering a decisive decade for journalism linked to crises that affect its future, says RSF secretary-general Christophe Deloire. ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic illustrates the negative factors threatening the right to reliable information, and is itself an exacerbating factor, Deloire added in his recent summation of the current index ratings.Questioning what all this means for freedom of information, pluralism and reliability by , Deloire maintains the answer to that is already being determined and as we move through this ldquodecisive decade, five converging crises are having a malign influence and potentially devastating impact on international journalism.The first of these is what RSF says is a ldquogeopolitical crisis due to aggressiveness of authoritarian regimes, which coronavirus has already starkly highlighted.The second is a ldquotechnological crisis resulting from the lack of appropriate regulation of digitalised communication, creating a kind of ldquoinformation chaos blurring the lines between fact, fiction, propaganda and advertising, often putting them in direct competition with mainstream bona fide journalism.The third crisis in this perfect storm facing journalism highlighted by RSF is a growing physical hostility towards journalists globally.Much of this hostility, it concludes, is an offshoot of the hatred towards the press fomented by some political leaders such as US President Donald Trump and his counterpart Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil.ldquoHostility toward journalists and news outlets in the US deepened and intensied, and few attacks were as vitriolic as those that came from the president, the media watchdog concluded.ldquoThe abuse is only getting worse amid the coronavirus pandemic in , as journalists covering the Trump administrationrsquos response to the crisis are subjected to the presidentrsquos attacks during his press briefings, it added.According to the index ratings, the US now ranks th out of  countries. A ldquodangerous anti-press sentiment as well as the arrest, physical assault, public denigration and harassment of journalists had trickled down to the local level in America, the report determined.Related to this open hostility and the last of the five elements in the crises press freedom faces is one of trust, says RSF. Or put another way the public suspects broadcast and print news to have been contaminated by unreliable information.In making its case for this, the media watchdog cites a recent Edelman Trust Barometer conducted by the US-based public relations group that studies public trust in institutions.According to those polled in Edelmanrsquos latest international survey, % of people believed the media they used were contaminated with information they thought untrustworthy. That in itself, most would admit, is cause for serious concern, but combined with the other threats outlined, all five converge into one enormous challenge to the worldwide press of the future.Itrsquos a sobering thought not least today, May , as we mark World Press Freedom Day along with its theme this year of ldquojournalism without fear or favour.In order to understand in real terms just what these threats mean to journalismrsquos future, itrsquos worth drilling down a little deeper into their implications.The obvious place to start is with the impact of the pandemic itself. Having said that, long before the emergence of coronavirus, world press freedoms were recognised as being in decline.For many years journalists have weathered authoritarian regimes and threats to their safety. But where most observers are now in near total agreement is that the pandemic has brought a new dynamic to the media landscape exposing the long-term risks of suppressed press freedomsAs Robert Mahoney, deputy executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalistspoints out, those countries that stle independent news and jail journalists in ldquonormal times have already been hard at work.In what some journalists have called the global ldquoCovid crackdown, China and Iran, th and rd respectively in the Press Freedom Index, tried to quarantine the truth. In Iranrsquos case the leadership there censored news of its spread with devastating consequences for public health.Many media monitoring groups are now concerned that, for the most part, governments have been getting away with their efforts to impede independent journalism without being called out by other countries, all of which are also preoccupied in dealing with the pandemic.ldquoGovernments in Thailand, through Hungary and Egypt to Honduras, are using the cloud cover of the diseases to introduce emergency measures that could roll back basic freedoms, clamp down on the press, or restrict foreign correspondents, warned Mahoney of the CPJ recently on Al azeera.At its worst this manests itself in arrests, detention, intimidation, physical threats and sometimes murder.In terms of Covid--related reporting, human rights group Amnesty International last week highlighted a handful of cases where reporters have been prosecuted or threatened. Among them was that of Russian journalist Elena Milashina whose newspaper Novaya Gazeta on April blished an article in which she criticised the Chechen authoritiesrsquo response to the pandemic.Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov in turn posted an Instagram video in which he threatened Milashina, appealing to the Russian government and Federal Security Serviceto ldquostop those non-humans who are writing and provoking our people. In Egypt, meanwhile, security forces arrested Atef Hasballah, the editor-in-chief of AlkararPress newspaper on March , and subjected him to enforced disappearance for nearly a month, following a post on his Facebook page in which he challenged the official statistics on Covid- cases.In Venezuela, it was journalist Darvinson Rojas who spent  days in detention after reporting on the spread of the virus in the country and was pushed by authorities to reveal his sources.These are only three of many instances globally where reporting on the pandemic brought journalists under threat, but itrsquos not only during the current crisis that such measures have been documentedLast year,  serious threats to press freedom were recorded, including  physical attacks on journalists. A total of  cases of intimidation and direct threat have been listed in a report compiled by several media organisations, among them RSF, the Association of European Journalists and the International Press Institute.Late last year, too,  journalists were imprisoned for their work, primarily in Turkey, Russia, and Azerbaijan.As Otmar Lahodynsky, president of the Association of European Journalistswrote recently in the EU affairs newspaper NewEurope, the takeover of media by oligarchs and governments in Hungary, Poland, and Serbia were also noted and criticised in the report.ldquoMany public-service broadcasters have been turned into uncritical propaganda channels for the government. Abuses of media freedom are also increasing in Western Europe, says Lahodynsky, adding that political influence on the media is increasing in many of the  countries that count themselves as members of the Council of Europe.But beyond these obvious threats to journalism and its future lie others, many economic, with job cuts gutting newsrooms. As RSF makes clear, the digital transformation has brought the media to their knees in many countries.Falling sales, the collapse in advertising revenue and the increase in production and distribution costs have in turn forced news organisations to restructure and lay off journalists.ldquoThe economic crisis has also accentuated the phenomena of ownership concentration and, even more, conflicts of interest, which threaten journalistic pluralism and independence, warns the watchdog.The bottom line here is that global journalism currently faces both old threats and new, raising the inevitable question of how best to protect and nurture its existence in the ldquodecisive decade that lies ahead.According to Farhana Haque Rahman, senior vice-president of the global news agency Inter Press Service, ultimately, just as in a pandemic, the freedom of the press can only be guaranteed by a co-ordinated global effort and a focus on highlighting the long-term advantages of a more critical world.ldquoThis means pressure to reinforce legal frameworks, including prosecuting harassers and killers, perhaps just as the international community would persecute war criminals, while offering a global protection for journalists, says Rahman.ldquoFinding and promoting innovative ways of subsidising independent media, as well as getting big tech companies to pay for the content they share, is also crucial to help a free press to thrive, she says.Just as the response to the coronavirus pandemic has been described as a marathon not a sprint, so must the long-term future of journalism be viewed in the same terms.Ever since the United Nations proclaimed World Press Freedom Day on this date back in , the obstacles facing independent reporting have consistently been immense.Censorship, smear campaigns, harassment, intimidation, arrest and detention, threats of physical assault and murder are the challenges journalists across many parts of the world have had to contend with.These are unprecedented times and, as one colleague recently observed, no working journalist alive has ever covered anything like this story of the pandemic. Even veterans of war reporting or Ebola coverage have had to re-evaluate risk and learn new skills.As we mark World Press Freedom Day itrsquos obvious that many challenges beyond the current one lie in wait. Most likely these will put the very heart of journalistic practice and the ability to carry it out without fear or favour to an unprecedented test.To say we need journalism now more than ever is true. But it also masks a reality worth reiterating, one that makes clear the importance of having a free press each and every day, whether the story is of global or local concern.In either instance, holding power to account and performing a public interest role is fundamental to this. But just as the press holds the powers at be to account, so too do we need reasoned critical consumers of the media, those similarly capable of holding the media to task for any misrepresentations of the truth.It was the great French author and journalist Albert Camus who once observed that: ldquoA free press can of course, be good or bad, but most certainly without freedom, the press will never be anything but bad.If, as the World Press Freedom report suggests, the next  years prove to be an unprecedented test for the media, then good journalism will need all the allies it can muster.As RSF secretary-general Christophe Deloire, rightly pointed out: ldquoFor this decisive decade to not be a disastrous one, people of goodwill, whoever they are, must campaign for journalists to be able to fulfil their role as societyrsquos trusted third parties, which means they must have the capacity to do so.Speaking as someone with a vested interest in that happening, I can only say how welcome that trust would be. But equally, however, those within my profession must realise that in order for that to take place, we too must prove ourselves worthy of that same trust."},{"url":null,"title":"routine-important-right-now","story":"Why having a routine is so important right nowA generic photo of a dad homeschooling.

WARNING: This picture must only be used to accompany PA Feature TOPICAL Family Routine.But in lockdown, everythings changed, and rather than relying on train timetables or school bells to keep our routine in check, we are left to our own devices. And it can be easy to let things slip.However, routine is hugely important, not just to get tasks completed, but for our wellbeing - and that of those we live with, too.Louise Goss, founder of The Homeworker Magazine, an online and print publication focusing on all the aspects of working from home, advises: \"The importance of a routine right now is stronger than ever. While a routine allows you to develop good, healthy habits, it also provides a sense of safety.\"At a time when the outside world can appear quite daunting, and there is so much uncertainty around, those morning rituals can keep us feeling secure and with a sense of normality.\"Its harder to cross things off the to do list, adds Goss. \"When your daily routine is completely changed, it is easy to drt, achieve very little and struggle to find some structure,\" she says.\"If your routine usually involves waking at a certain time, listening to a particular radio station, leaving the house for a daily commute, its useful to keep those things in place while you establish a new structure, and adapt to these new working norms,\" adds Goss.\"Even getting out and using your daily exercise as a form of commute can help youhome, ready to start in work mode.\"Serial entrepreneur and mother-of-two Natasha Courtenay-Smith, has launched free Zoom business classes for children aged - called Bolt Biz Kids, and adds that we are, in many ways, busier than before, even though a lot of our activities and tasks arent happening.\"Most people who are working and have children at home are trying to get more done in a day than they usually would - with homeschooling, entertaining, mealtimes and looking after the home,\" she says.\"Its therefore more important than ever to be organised and add structure to the day, otherwise everything piles up and everyone ends up in tears. Children also are used to having structure to their day, in terms of times of classes and break times, and are not used to occupying themselves for hours on end without it.\"While some of our usual busy-ness has been taken away due to less socialising and travel, we are incredibly busy, due to the combination of the above.\"Goss adds: \"A routine is often praised for being beneficial for productivity and while that is true, right now, its important to think of it as a good way to lower stress levels, and keep you happier and healthier too.\"Working from home demands a bit more thought into creating a routine, because you dont have the visual cues around the office that signal its time to shut down, stop work or take a break.\"Doing things such as timetabling in break times, even setting an alarm to remind you to stop work or scheduling a final end of day meeting or chat that wraps up your working day, can be helpful.\"\"If you can, keeping the weekends free for family and leisure time also helps you not to be tempted to keep working, which is easily done. It helps everybody in the household to have a break and have boundaries between work le and home le,\" adds Goss.Courtenay-Smith, who is running daily Facebook sessions for parents and kids at pm, which can give you a good routine peg for your day, says: \"In his teachings of the six human needs, motivational speaker and author Tony Robbins talks about how one of our strongest needs is for certainty - which is knowing what is going to happen and devising a plan for achievement.\"Certainty can be thought of on a grand scale, i.e. a plan for the next  years of our lives, or a micro scale what to expect from the day ahead. To put it simply, people dont usually like surprises, and evenwe like a surprise, it can still derail what we see as our certainty - our internal plan that we were going to be doing a, b and c.\"Thats why unexpected things, such as having to take the cat to the vet or getting stuck in traffic pre-lockdown, would add so much stress, because it throws our certainty out of the window.\"Give your family and children a degree of certainty by sticking to a routine, says Courtenay-Smith. For example, saying between am and am we do school work, from  -  we occupy ourselves, and at pm we have lunch.\"If this then repeats as a routine, family members know what to expect at what time, and everyone relaxes. Although its not written down, most of us operate to such routines whilst at school and work.\"Many people are saying that every day is the same and the weekend just blends into every other day. Its true we dont have our usual options to travel, see friends and places at the weekend, butthe weekdays operate around a clear routine, then weekends will feel freer,\" adds Courtenay-Smith."},{"url":null,"title":"britain-begin-post-brexit-trade-deal-talks-us-week","story":"The government is looking to strike an ambitious relationship, which will open up new opportunities to businesses in Britain.International Trade Secretary Liz Truss and US trade representative Robert Lighthizer will launch the negotiations via video conference call because of the Covid- crisis.Around  negotiators on each side will take part in the talks, the first round of which are set to last for a fortnight.Further rounds will take place roughly every six weeks, and will continue to be carried out remotely until it is safe to travel.:Refusal to extend Brexit transition period raises chilling prospect of no-deal, warns Ian BlackfordMs Truss said: ldquoThe US is our largest trading partner and increasing transatlantic trade can help our economies bounce back from the economic challenge posed by coronavirus.ldquoWe want to strike an ambitious deal that opens up new opportunities for our businesses, brings in more investment and creates better jobs for people across the whole of the country.ldquoAs we sit down at the negotiating table early next week, be assured that we will drive a hard bargain to secure a deal that benefits iniduals and businesses in every region and nation of the UK.Talks will be led on the UK side by UK-US chief negotiator Oliver Grfiths, while all UK trade negotiations are being overseen by the Department for International Tradersquos chief trade negotiation adviser Crawford Falconer.It comes after the UK blamed Brussels for having made ldquolimited progress during the second round of negotiations on a future trade deal between the European Union and UK.Negotiators have warned their counterparts across the Channel that Britain will ldquonot subordinate its laws to the EU ldquoin any areas and called for more flexibility from the bloc in order to strike a deal.The EUrsquos negotiation mandate stated that the UK must sign up to some Brussels-set regulations to prevent the bloc being undercut on standards once the transition period ends in December.Michel Barnier, the EUrsquos chief negotiator, last month accused the UK of refusing to commit ldquoseriously on numerous fundamental points during the talks, which took place via video-conferencing technology because of the coronavirus pandemic.:Doug Marr: There is an answer to this virus but Brexit is not itShadow international trade secretary Emily Thornberry said: ldquoWith the US election now just six months away, we should all be extremely wary of a president who will do anything to stay in the White House, and a Conservative Government that will do anything to help him.ldquoThat is a recipe for a trade deal designed for the benefit of the major corporations behind American industry, farming and healthcare, which will have very real implications on workersrsquo rights, environmental protections, the food we eat and our beloved NHS.ldquoIf Boris Johnson will not stand up to Donald Trump, then the British Parliament must.

In challenging circumstances, however, they are not helped by supply chains that are simply not operating fairly or equitably.“During a recent conference call with the cabinet secretary and islands minister, I raised concerns about the behaviour of some suppliers towards our island communities. It was a call echoed by MSP and MP colleagues from across the parties.“Unfortunately, two weeks on and shop owners and local wholesalers, who also supply our care homes and hospital, tell me little has changed. If anything, the situation is getting more serious.“I welcome Fergus Ewing’s recognition of the problem and the action he has taken in writing to  of the main suppliers. However, these efforts must now be redoubled as we need to see a dference on the ground.The Orkney MSP added: “At a time of crisis, getting access to food and essential items should not be a postcode lottery. Supply chains should be working in the interests of the entire population, and suppliers should be treating island wholesalers with fairness”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Folk can do this by picking a m stretch of road or path, or by walking through a local greenspace and counting the number of instances of dog fouling in that area.

The academic suggested that the next stages of coronavirus containment could be developed earlier in the islands # but onlya comprehensive testing strategy was in place.Orkney and Shetland’s parliamentarians, Liam McArthur MSP, Alistair Carmichael MP and Beatrice Wishart MSP have called on the Scottish Government to provide assurances that they will engage meaningfully with Professor Pennington’s proposals and be open to considering how they might be implemented safely.Mr McArthur said: “Public safety must be paramount as decisions are taken about how and when the current restrictions might be lted.“In that context, however, Professor Pennington’s suggestions, which have already attracted a great deal of interest in Orkney and other island communities, deserve serious and urgent consideration.“If the Scottish Government genuinely want to treat the Scottish public ‘as grown ups’ then suggestions like these need to be dealt with in a transparent manner.“I have already written to both the Health Secretary and the First Minister to make this point, and to seek clarity on what consideration is being given to a more localised approach for the islands.  It is important that all options to tackling the coronavirus remain on the table during this unprecedented time.”Mr Carmichael added: “I hope that the Scottish Government will engage with these proposals seriously. That engagement must, however, also include close cooperation and discussion with local communities to ensure public confidence in safety.“This is not a plan that can be run centrally. Local input and know-how is key and islanders should be at the heart of how we translate these proposals into action.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr Russell’s comments come in the wake of the First Minister’s announcement of an expansion of testing.Following the exchange, Mr McArthur said: “There is an increasing level of public interest in the proposals put forward by Professor Pennington and Dr Allyson Pollock in recent weeks that the islands could start to ease lockdown restrictions sooner than mainland Scotland.“Such a strategy could only be adopted, however,a rigorous and extensive system of testing, tracing and isolating was firmly established. The First Minister’s announcement today of a further expansion of testing perhaps paves the way for such a system being put in place.“Public safety, of course, remains the priority and must underpin any decision taken in relation to how and when restrictions are eventually lted. That is true of our island communities as it is other parts of the country.“However, ministers must not discount possible options without proper consideration. I therefore welcome Mr Russell’s assurances that the government will engage actively and constructively in the debate about whether and how our islands might safely take the lead.“This is unlikely to lead to any quick decisions, not least as the stakes are so high. It is encouraging, however, that Ministers are prepared to keep an open mind over the coming week.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Until late last year, a suitable vessel proved dficult to source, said the council.It then became known that the Nordic Sea, which operated on a number of passenger routes in the far north of Norway, had become available.Following visits and sea trials involving Orkney Marine Services and Orkney Ferries staff, the vessel was considered as a suitable replacement for the Golden Mariana.As the Nordic Sea was operating under a Norwegian Passenger Certicate, it was known that a number of requirements would have to be met before she was considered ready for a UK passenger certicate.With surveys now completed and a works list developed, the decision to complete the purchase was made and the vessel departed Bergen for Orkney yesterday morning, Thursday.On arrival, the vessel was handed over to Orkney Islands Council, but due to Covid- restrictions and the need for some works to be carried out to bring her up to the full UK Classication and Certication, it will be a while yet before the residents of Papa Westray are able to benefit from their new passenger ferry.The purchase of the new vessel was part funded by the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland.More details in The Orcadian Marine Scene section next week.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This technology exists. If we simply used the electricity to generate hydrogen, and store it just like the old city gas, we can run all our power needs through hydrogen fuel cells. Simple, cheap and clean. Or we could let global heating destroy our children#s future because nobody wants to see a big windmill near their property.

Have a nice evening, do.Love it, thanks JT 🙂No real need for fuel cells. Hydrogen was % of coal gas, can be stored in gasometers and burnt in gas fires and used to power piston engines, gas turbines and most conventional heating systems. A hell of a lot cleaner than burning wood chip. Now forget the windfarms, obsolete technology, use tidal generation and mini modular nuclear.That way we will have a living planet worth saving, not a mass of concrete, steel and fibreglass.I#m not sure windfarms are quite obsolete yet# with the technology that is available at scale onshore wind is the cheapest source of new electricity. Perhaps not on peat bogs though. That#s not to say we can#t do better with other renewables.PS circa Dads Army, I am not that old!!!At  dollars a barrel so called renewables will need to reduce costs by a huge margin to compete with oil. At the current oil price of less that  dollars a barrel wind, tidal and solar no hope.Renewable energy is not produced in barrels. Where did you hear that We continue to burn oil and gas because the infrastructure is there and the investment has been made. But when it comes to investing in new electricity generation, onshore wind is the cheapest. Also # I am not sure how such a low price is beneficial to the oil industry what with their high fixed costs As a patriotic Brit I am all for us standing on our own two feet and generating cheap and reliable energy. Shetland aside, as a nation we are net importers of oil and gas. Why rely on the likes of Russia or our Middle Eastern friends when we can spend that money at home and have jobs for Brits producing clean and plentul energy  Let#s stop living in the s. Let#s have clean, reliable British energy instead.I tend to lean in the direction indicated by John Thomas.For reasons of cheapness , safety and reliability I can’t see why wind and tidal forces should not be the primary options for energy generation. Winds are unlikely to stop blowing and sea tides are unlikely to dry up , so how can they not be major considerations Nuclear power is also in the running provided that the associated risks can be accepted. No matter what the no doubt wellintended may suggest, there ARE risks which do not raise their ugly heads with wind and water. Reliable , sustainable , and non polluting. What more could one ask for in this struggling , changed 🌎 world we occupy for a short time. Now Thorium nuclear is clean, no long half-le isotopes produced and no danger of meltdown.They are also neither cheap or reliable. Back up will also be requiredfor when the sun doesn#t shine or the wind isn#t suitable at more expense. More renewables will inevitably contribute to increased fuel poverty.Michael Moore # Planet of the Humans # a documentaryon the renewable energy scam that the left want banned # who would have thought !The more you look into the problem of energy supply against saving the environment, the more contradictory conclusion one gains. Wind and Solar maybe cleaner, but how much land and natural habitat being destroyedwould be required to power a city of several million##.and this is just  city     What energy source would be required alsothere are days of no sun or no wind. What backup technology would be in place, and would this also be clean energy  It seems ironically disturbing that cleaner energy through wind and solar, would also have a negative impact on the environmentyou take into consideration the polluting processes involved in the manufacturing of such devices.as well as the huge amount of land required , which would also be expanding as the population grows. I would assess cleaner energy via wind and solar would have a larger impact on the natural eco-systems and the environment and would still be reliant on fossil fuels. As far as I can see, disturbing as it may be, the only source for future energy demand is to go nuclear.And no , I am not a pessimistI’m a wary realist.Better than a blinkered optimist..."},{"url":null,"title":"mechanic coxswain at rnli ","story":"Our purpose is simple, to save lives at sea.

Yes. But let#s see Alastair also advocate thoroughly for zero hours workers, for parents living in temporary accommodation, for children who are feed from food banks, for people who are now, and who will shortly be living beyond their means,and for the increasing number of people who cannot meet their basic needs. A Universal Basic Income is fundamentally a liberal idea, in as much as people have entitlemment to be spared unreasonable harm. Sowe were to use existing systems to support iniduals, in a responsive and responsible way, possibly at a lower cost than the support now being offered for businesses, we would secure immediate economic stimulus, prevent unreasonable hardship, rebalance the playing field and limit damage to future generations. A heap of thinking has gone into the idea of what rights we each ought to enjoy, the things we should freely have, like affordable transport, and the things we should have the freedom to escape, like hunger. Now is a useful time to be considering such issues, the better for all.An interesting idea, Peter, and one which it may surprise you to learn was looked atseveral years ago by WIr Shetland as a possible policy option for Shetland autonomy.At the time, no country in the world had adopted it however FInland was planning to run a pilot project which it was decided to monitor. I am no longer involved and cannot comment on the current WS situation or policy.After a short, two year trial, the Finnish government decided to end the scheme last year and was reportedly considering alternatives such as a universal credit scheme, similar to that of the UK .Pleased that our MP was pressing the Chancellor on this within  minutes!Always good to see fellow Liberals backing liberal ideas.It is going to be really important to sustain a discussion on the basic rights and freedoms everyone should be able to access now. People should be free from depending on food banks. People should be able to travel freely to access skills training and broad educational opportunities.The UBI can help stop people falling through the cracks, but other ideas are neededall are to be able to live fulfilling lives of their choosing.This is because the cost of being to be able to exercise basic freedoms ies both across the country and from household to household as people#s inidual circumstances so dfer.The Universal Basic Income would help to kick start the economy and would do do fairly, , as Alistair, suggested, the tax system was used to claw the cash back from those who did not need it. Of course that would involve taxing the rich.Little wonder that the Chancellor dismissed the idea out of hand.Permanent State Fund Dividend of Alaska, the same idea. Not bad for a Trump-voting Republican state. Somewhat predates the liberal idea. Just another Red-Necked, Republican, USA idea.Ian,I value your opinions, some of which I agree with, some I don#t.What I don#t value is your judgemental uttering based on your opinions.Wikipedia # #Redneck is a derogatory term chiefly but not exclusively applied to white Americans perceived to be crass and unsophisticated, closely associated with rural whites of the Southern United States#Alaska is just a tad north on the Southern states and not all Republicans are white.NB , Redneck is a derogatory term chiefly but NOT EXCLUSIVELY applied to white Americans of the Southern States.

But with no likelihood of visitors coming to our place anytime soon, there is something slightly morose and sad about making the buildings and cabins look neat, well maintained and tidy.It all seems a bit soulless and Marie Celeste-like with no guests.While being locked down at home, being busy, fixing and decorating, and even dare I say it, having a good time with family, there is an emerging sense of frustration, even perhaps inadequacy.Others are out there being essential, being key workers and worthwhile, ‘fighting’ the virus, supporting the vulnerable, while I….make a patio.I think for many people, there is a need to feel useful, and it is perhaps why for me the motorbike ride is so important.While there is nothing heroic about delivering a few medicines, it gets me out of the house # we might have a big cabin, but it still induces a fever.Being part of a support network and involved in helping the community works both ways and fulfils a very real need in those helping.Perhaps everybody wants to feel essential.We can laud the NHS staff, care workers, shop assistants and delivery drivers, but no one is going to clap for the furloughed hospitality workers and idle outdoor instructors.As a volunteer, however, we can all feel that we are doing our bit.There is a huge grey area surrounding the concept of key worker and essential.At first glance, it may seem obvious as to who is key # doctors, nurses, carers and the like but then there are the people who support them.Key workers need paid, so require office staff. They need fed, so also use food shops.They need to get to work, so are likely to drive a vehicle, so they need fuel. Andthe car breaks down, they will need a mechanic.They need water and electricity and the internet, and might also need a treat delivered from a mail order company during their well-deserved down time.Then there are the people who support the people who support the people who support…and so on.And so there emerges a whole network of service providers, businesses large and small # a web of commerce and production.In order to provide for the frontline, a whole system of interrelated businesses exists, many which might not appear to be essential, but may provide a key element, a small cog in the big picture.In the short term key workers can perhaps get by, but society shouldn’t allow its critical people to just muddle through, as the lockdown period extends, then the need for this support becomes more evident and relevant, and so the web of essentiality widens.As more roles, jobs and links in society are realised and considered necessary, and indispensability spreads, recreation and tourism won’t get much of a look in.We could argue that people need to visit the Old Man of Storr for our economic well-being as much as for their own health and well-being, but for the time being the beds and hot spots will remain empty.So, in order to be relevant and useful, we should perhaps look to our other skills.If tourism is our only income then we have to be creative, not only to make provision but to keep spirit and self-actualisation alive.Economically,tourism is a second income, the icing on the salaried or pensioned cake, then perhaps we just take the hit, and revert back to a less affluent lestyle.Many tourist providers left skills and talents in a previous le, perhaps now is the time to revisit and reimagine those skills.As I understand it, Skye is still waiting.Perhaps by the time this column is online, the virus will be more evident, during this waiting game now more than ever we need to be physically distant, and careful with how we operate.But it is crucial that we also need to look after our mental health and well-being, and so delivering the prescriptions is really as important to volunteer as it is for the receiver.Humans are a social animal, and we need to be part of a community, because we are all essential.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3098832.jpg--.jpg?1588153113000\n","title":"check your meter advises consumer council","story":"The Consumer Council is advising households and small businesses to ensure their energy bills are accurate and as low as possible during the COVID- lockdown.

And that’s actually the better thing to do.”Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappHe referenced a report by Ulster University captured at the height of the pandemic using thermal imaging cameras in offices, which showed that many people are still not washing their hands.Dr Ackerley said: “There have been some research papers that indicate coronavirus can be shed in faeces so it’s even more important that people wash their hands after going to the toilet as well as all the other key times.She said there needed to be a change in public attitudes when lockdown measures eased in the future.“One of the things we need to change in our opinions is that it’s not just about protecting ourselves from other people but it’s about protecting other people from ourselves.”With food packing, the risk is low but there are steps you can take to put your mind at ease, she said.“It could be contaminated but the contamination isn’t necessarily going to be in the food factory or even in the shop or from the people running the shop. “But a lot of people are going to be touching the packaging in the course of the day when the food is on sale.“If the food is something that has got a long shelf le - like a tin or a bottle of squash - you could just leave it for three days by which time we know that the amount of viable virus will have reduced substantially.“If you have milk or something perishable that needs to go in the fridge or freezer and it concerns you, it isn’t that much effort to disinfect the outside surface of the food packaging.“The most important thing is to go straight to the wash basin and wash your hands for  seconds and that really does help to remove any virus you might have picked up. That’s good common sense practice anyway,” she said.You can hear more on the Belfast ’s Coronavirus podcast on Soundcloud and Spoty.Belfast Related ContentGalleryCoronavirusCoronavirus: As shoppers buy rugs, deck chairs and fake flowers, we ask - what happened to essential items only Ever so slowly they came trundling out of the store, their trolleys so heavily laden that the contents started spilling out.,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Adele Heaney has been working in the Covid- centre at the Mater Hospital in Belfast after being redeployed from the Royal Victoria Hospital to combat the outbreak. The Dungiven native recently featured in a BBC documentary called ‘First Time Doctors’ that revealed the realities of le as a recent graduate on a busy hospital ward. “The purpose of the show was to get an insight to what it’s like being a doctor for the first time and the trials and tribulations of le inside and outside of work,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “So many people just see the doctor and that side of things, so the show was quite nice as it showed a bit of le outside work. “Everyone has had that experience of being the ‘newbie’ in the job and having to learn how to do things in a fast-moving environment. “It was daunting having cameras following you around but the thing that we wanted to show was what it is like for us as doctors.” Coming the end of her second year as a doctor, Adele has found herself thrust onto the frontline of the worst pandemic since the  Spanish Flu which killed an estimated  million people. googletag.cmd.push Adele has pleaded with the public not to become complacent and praised the vocal support that has come from the #ClapForCarers campaign on Thursday nights. “The first week they did that I was very emotional, to be honest,” said Adele. “When you’re in the hospital and you’re doing a dficult job, having tough conversations and seeing people pass away, it’s nice to see people appreciate the sacrices you are making. “The public have been trying to do their best to go by what the guidelines have been telling us – social distancing and staying indoors. We have to keep going with what we’ve been told. “Everybody in the community has their part to play. Your part might just be staying in the house but that is so, so important to flatten the curve and for us to beat this together. “We’ve seen the news reports from Wuhan and Italy, and we’ve seen how devastating the disease can be, so it’s important that we protect ourselves to protect other people.” While tackling the pandemic represents a ‘steep learning curve’ Adele points out that all healthcare staff are coming from a similar position. She said: “Lots of my senior colleagues who have been in the profession for over  years have never experienced anything like this. “I don’t think there is anything in training that really can prepare you. We’ve had to adapt quite quickly to a new style of working. “Coming into work and wearing a mask all the time has been dficult, but we have some amazing senior colleagues who we’ve been able to learn from. “It’s been dficult whenever we’ve had to make phone calls to families about their relatives who are really unwell, you’re not able to have those face-to-face reactions like you normally would. “Learning on the job has been hard, but it’s very humbling to be part of that and to be there for their family members when they aren’t able to be.” Born and bred at the foot of Benbradagh, Adele has already set her sights on a speedywhen the coronavirus threat finally eases. “To be honest, the thing I’m looking forward to the most is being able to come back home to Dungiven and be able to see my family and my boyfriend again,” she said. “It is very dficult when you’re doing this when you are so far from home. We have this persona of doctor but when we come home from work, we like the same things as everyone . “People have made sacrices of moving out of their family homes and not seeing their children or husbands or wives, so people are looking forward to being reunited with their families. “That contact with people is probably the thing I’m looking forward to most, as I’m sure most people are.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Liam Tunney tells the story of the Kilrea man who swapped the cleaver for the canvas and never looked back. Light plays a key role in County Derry artist Conor Larkin’s work, but for years he carried his own talent with such modesty that it seemed destined to remain in the shadows. The self-taught artist has taken the scenic route to turning his passion into a profession and began his working le in McAtamney’s on Kilrea’s Bridge Street. “I didn’t go to art school or anything, I just left school and got a job in the butchers,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I served my time in McAtamney’s and was there until I was  or . After that I did a bit of travelling, went to Australia and America and got that out of my system. “When I came back, I spent some time on building sites and picking fruit. I’ve only really been painting full time for the past five or six years.”  His artistic talent had not gone unnoticed though and was celebrated in the early days by one of his teachers at Crossroads Primary School. “Mrs Magill was the teacher at the time, and she brought my mum in to look at a picture I had painted. I was maybe P or P,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “I remember her telling my mother that the painting was above what I should be doing for my age at that time. “That is my first real memory of somebody picking it up. I even remember what it was – it was a lorry with a sunset behind it. I remember that vividly.” “Even when I was a butcher, I decorated the windows at Christmas and kept painting old milk churns and that to get a few extra pounds. If I could find a smooth surface, I’d paint it. “I would do skateboards and stuff like that when I was at school and I was encouraged by my teachers, but I never took it any further. I was lazy, I suppose. “I ended up getting a job in a glass company and that was the first time I got a job where I was doing something creative.”  Conor’s work at Diamond Glass, in Slaughtneil, involved painting stained glass windows and he began to hone his creative talent, spending more time painting. Even as the shoots of a possible career change were appearing, Conor’s professional radar hadn’t been finely tuned just yet. “Probably the first few I did, I gave them away. It was easy to me, so I just gave them to people,” he said. “The first one I sold was a picture of the Fleadh in Rasharkin. Well, I didn’t actually sell it, I swapped it for an amplier for a guitar. “I had started it, but then realised there were too many people in it and this man approached me and said ‘Look,you finish that, I’ll buy you an amplier for it’. We were playing in a band together. I play a bit of guitar and sing a bit. I still have the amplier, but it probably wasn’t that great a deal when I look at it now!”  Although the talent and ambition were there, there was still the lingering thought that painting was destined only to be a hobby. It took the intervention of a local man to allow Conor to showcase his talent and provided the confidence boost he needed to move things to the next level. He said: “There was a fella in Kilrea called Brendan McAllister, from Edenbane Art. He does a bit of dealing and he askedI’d paint him a few just to see how it went. “I did a few paintings and never really thought much of them, but he came back a week later to say: ‘I’ve sold those, would you do a few more ’ “That made me realise that people were willing to buy them, and it gave me that bit of encouragement.”  If McAllister’s support provided the carrot, the stick came in the form of a conversation with a former butchering colleague, while he was still painting stained glass in Slaughtneil. “It was during that recession when things were getting bad. We were down to a three-day week and the stained glass work was getting less and less. “I got talking to one of the butchers I used to work with. He’s actually a chocolatier now and he said: “If you don’t jump, how are you going to find outyou can do it or not ”  Conor jumped, without looking back. Seven years later there is a -month waiting list for his commissions, requests for which arrive from all over the world. His inspiration though, stems from closer to home. “I live down near the Bann in Kilrea and I’m out on that road a dozen times a day usually,” he said. “There was one day there was a tree and whatever way the sun was shining on it, it got me. I ended up painting it a few times, at dferent times of the year. “Sunsets and autumn light are great. I get fidgety round that time of the evening and I have to get out and get looking at stuff. That’s what I mostly like to paint. “I also love painting old cottages. Sometimes I would drive round the country looking for old, deserted dwellings. I love the way the light plays on the whitewashed walls. “I think everybody has a nostalgic thing for them. Where I grew up, there was an old man who lived across the fields from us and I used to spend time before I went to school over there. “That was the real McCoy, no electricity or anything. There’s a romance about old houses., but there are less of them now. They conjure up memories for many people.”  The Covid- lockdown hasn’t been too taxing for Conor, who doesn’t mind the solitude. It is something to which he has become accustomed. “I’m finding it easy enough because I’m sort of used to it,” he said. “I live out in the sticks anyway so there are days I wouldn’t see a sinner, especially when my we is at work and the weans are at school. “I’m pretty much on my own most of the time anyway, but I do miss being able to jump in the car and head off to the coastI know there is going to be a nice sunset. “I do an online painting demo now every Thursday night from  o’clock. The first painting we did was a few cottages on an old lane and I’m planning to give that away to a key worker. “People are nominating others for it. Somebody on the front line will end up getting that painting. Every wee bit helps.” The Kilrea man carries conversation with the relaxed confidence of a man who has found the holy grail of job satisfaction by turning his hobby into his occupation. “I have done working on building sites, on farms and fruit picking, served my time as a butcher, but while I was doing that, I was always doing the odd wee drawing. “It’s what I’ve always wanted to do. The dream was always to pack in the day job and paint full time, so I suppose I’m living that dream.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The power and panache of Gerry McElhinney would have figured prominently in the Kingdom supremos thoughts. This week, Michael McMullan spoke to the all-star forward and former international soccer star. Thank God for YouTube. Gerry McElhinneys wonder point against the Dubs in  was  seconds of bliss. From his first solo until the ball cannoned off the wall behind the Hill  goals, its impossible not to be energised by watching it. For those who remember him playing, the memories came gushing back of one of the games greatest artists. For the rest, it makes us appreciate what a big game player actually is. googletag.cmd.push It was like the parting of the Red Sea, a Derry version of Maradona . He was just outside his own half, but distance was no obstacle It was All-Ireland semi-final day, but Derrys  year-old secret weapon played with expression. Termed by some as a pop star footballer, three months younger than Bjoumlrn Borg, McElhinney was inspired by the Swedes headband. It wasnt a spice-boy image without substance. Derrys sorcerer could also walk the walk. He was a boxing champion in his youth and his soccer career, as a centre-half, took him to Northern Irelands -  European qualier win over West Germany. googletag.cmd.push “It was the fastest  minutes, it just went past in a flash. It was just a game...all I wanted to do was play football,” McElhinney said of that night in Hamburg. He held captain Karl-Heinz Rummenigge scoreless and on the periphery. McElhinneys shuddering tackle put down a marker early in the game. For all the stages he performed on, he was as modest as he was magical. No airs or graces, just fanatical about playing. Growing up, playing two games every Saturday and Sunday was the grounding that made him. The  All-Ireland semi-final was just an extension and commentator Michael OHehirs exhilarating tones announced Gerry McElhinney to the nation. He took one solo before thundering through a Dublin midfield who were clutching at straws. An explosion of power careered past four Dublin players. Nobody could get a hand on him. He was electrying. He kept the ball under perfect control, while in full flow. As goalkeeper Paddy Cullen came into view, Gerry squeezed a shot through two helpless defenders before it went over the bar. It wasnt enough to prise Sam Maguire away from the Dubs, but unbeknownst to him, it was another reason for the all-stars to select him in his debut season. “I was fit and I just went out and enjoyed myself,” McElhinney said, from his home in Draycott – between Nottingham and Derby - where he has lived with his second we Val for the last  years. “I was training about six nights a week. When I say it was easy...it just came to me. I learned a lot from experienced men around me, about what to do and where to go. I was no longer a baby, I was coming .” He teased opponents as much as he did the Derry fans, who had to be satisfied with four seasons at senior level. As his soccer career tapered to a conclusion, Fr Sean Hegarty recalled him for the  Ulster championship. He was sent on as a sub to try and save a lost cause in the semi-final with a rampant Donegal. With his head stitched up from colliding into a goalpost, he drove away from Clones that day, heading for Dublin to catch a boat. He was Peterborough bound, where he played his last years under manager Mark Lawrenson. “He was a big loss to Derry, he was talented and as tough as they come. He was a great player, even from a young age – a man before his time,” remembers former Derry manager Paddy Crozier, who played with McElhinney on the  Derry minor team beaten by Cavan in the Ulster final. Another Derry all-star, Johnny McGurk, was inspired by him and mesmerised by his dummy, calling it the McElhinney tip – one Owen Mulligan would later tease defences with. Gerry would win his only club championship in the colours of Craigbane. Their  winning goalkeeper Gerard McLaughlin, who would have been directing kick-outs to him, made the comparison to Anthony Tohill. “He was the most complete player I remember, he had everything...until big Tohill came along.” Much water would pass under the bridge first. *** The late Mickey and Annie McElhinney raised their family in the townland of Dreen, outside Park, under the shadow of Sawel Mountain. Gerry is the oldest of , with five brothers , Colm, Kieran and five sisters . “We always played football in the field,” he recalls of his childhood. “The girls were the goalkeepers and the boys were playing out the field. We got neighbours over to play and it was always great craic.”  The family home outside Park Gerry would walk half a mile across the fields to attend Moneyhaughan Primary School, a typical country school with limited facilities, an outside toilet and no football pitch. “There was an old field beside it, but you wouldnt have put cows in it, never mind play football on it.” His early footballing days stem back to his time at secondary school in St Patricks and St Brigids Claudy. “Gerry Burns was the PE teacher and there was a guy Hugh Doherty,” McElhinney states. “He was a teacher, but most of the time he spent playing football in the gym.” Doherty pointed him in the direction of Dungiven Celtic, which started his soccer career. Gerry also mentions his former French teacher Seamus Mullan, who was also a local GAA reporter. “Sometimes he wrote good things about me and sometimes he wrote bad things about me,” Gerry laughs. “Seamus wrote about me because I think he wanted me to stay and play for Derry until the day I died. “Hughiewould take us to the hall. Wed play football and basketball there after school. My mother thought I was never coming home, I was never home to about six oclock at night.” There was no electric at home until Gerrys early teens. The first game he remembers watching on television was the replay of the  FA Cup Final. Having received a full blue kit as a present, he began to support Cha and after drawing with Leeds in the final, the replay at Old Trafford went to extra time. David Webb headed in at the far post from Ian Hutchinsons throw-in to win the cup for the blues. It lit a fire in McElhinney. “I thought I want to play at Wembley and I fulfilled my dreams,” he said, having later played at the famous stadium in Northern Irelands - defeat to England. He could have turned his hand to any sport. A natural, but his Gaelic football career would come first. *** Every Saturday morning in his teenage years, Gerry McElhinney would play for Derry City, before turning out for Dungiven Celtic in the afternoon. He played for Banagher on Sunday and hed squeeze in a game for Dungivens Sunday league team in the morning. “Banagher came first, butI could I would playin the morning. In the evening, we would maybe even have went off somewhere to a carnival and play a seven-a-side game,” McElhinney explains. “That was our weekend and during the week we trained. A lot of players did that. Mickey Lynch and Laurence OKane would have played for Derry City after they left the Irish League.” On the GAA front, Banagher knocked on the door of county finals, but never managed to squeeze into the winners enclosure. McElhinney had signed for Bolton by the time their  defeat to Ballinderry came around and an ankle injury in a soccer game the week before the  decider hampered his progress.  The Banagher squad pictured before the  Derry SFC Final.Gerry is fth from the left in the back row. “I ended up playing corner-back,” he remembers of the decision to start him, in the hope he would run it off. “I borrowed big Liam Hinpheys boots. He wore the rugby boots and I thought it would give my ankle some support.” He didnt last the game and Ballinderry edged home. In McElhinneys opinion, their best chance was against Magherafelt in the  final. “I remember both finals, it pissed down with rain. The Magherafelt game was in Swatragh and we definitely shouldve won that one. “We had three county players – Mickey Lynch, Fintan McCloskey and myself.Seamus Hasson had just retired from playing for Derry. SeamusStevenson was a dual player and played for Derry, so basically Banagher had five county players.” By the time his next championship run came around, he had crossed the county border. His first we hailed from Gortin and he played with the club for four seasons, during his time with Bolton. He wasnt the only newcomer. Liam Reilly – who also played in the  final - also moved to Tyrone and joined Gortin. Gortin reached the senior final in  against Augher, who had brothers Eugene and Dessie McKenna in their ranks and were champions three years earlier. It was Gortins first decider and McElhinneys absence was colossal. He had been known for getting the ball at midfield and rampaging all the way forward before hammering to the net. “I was with Bolton at the time and our pre-season had started, so I couldnt get over,” he said of their five-point defeat. It was time to head back to his roots and his brothers who had joined the emerging Craigbane. In  they beat Loup to win the first of seven intermediate titles, the record in the county. In , they were back in the final. This time it was against neighbours Claudy and Gerry McElhinney was in the team. “I was playing soccer and in the summer, at that time, I came home to visit my family and would stay for six or seven weeks. I played during championship time and won a few Dr Kerlin Cups,” he remembers. Craigbane were seven points down with seven minutes remaining and missed a first half penalty. The title was slipping away, but Conrad McGuigan found the net before player coach Paul Dixon hit a second goal to salvage a draw, - to -. “Tommy White and Charlie Kerrigan were playing, Claudy had a good side,” McElhinney explains.  Craigbanes winning team of . Gerry has his head bowed on the back row Dixon trained them like dogs for the two weeks before the replay. Six or seven sessions were combined with a challenge game with Donemana to sharpen their attacking game. The replay was a dferent story, with Craigbane in control, winning - to -. Gerry scored a point in the game. He later pulled his hamstring, but played on and later went to full-forward, as he picked up his only club championship medal. *** When Derry came knocking in the early s, McElhinney was in his prime. On top of an already bulging schedule, he boxed off and on for two years with Draperstown, under Jim Noonan. He holds a Mid Ulster title and was balancing the spinning plates. He had a spell in Glasgow Celtics reserves while playing at home with Derry minor footballers. Celtic was fitted in around his work, on a semi-professional deal. He failed to break into the first team, but would come for the weekend to play for the reserves. While Noonan urged him to keep his weight down, Jock Stein wanted him to bulk up. “My diet, every other night, was four pints of Guinness in the hotel,” McElhinney recalls of his time in Glasgow. “I was only  stone  and boxing welterweight, by the time I came back from Celtic to play for Derry, I was  stone ...I went from welterweight to middleweight.” In , his first year out of minor, Frankie Kearney called him up to a Derry senior team gearing up for one of of the most successful eras in the countys history. “My Dad lted me at the airport on my way back from Celtic and took me straight to Magherafelt for a McKenna Cup game with Antrim and Gerry Armstrong was playing for them.” The season snowballed into a march to Croke Park. In Ulster, Derry needed a replay to see off Monaghan in the semi-final. They were staring defeat in the face when Eugene Laverty won a penalty that Peter Stevenson scored to give the Oakleafers a second chance. Five McElhinney points and his influence at midfield tamed the Farney men in the replay. In the final with Down, Gerrys early goal set Derry on their way to the first of their back to back titles. Man of the match was his Banagher teammate Mickey Lynch with - to his name. The Dubs ended their All-Ireland dreams, but the following year they retained the Ulster title and were humbled in the All-Ireland semi-final by the Kerry team at the beginning of their golden years. Mickey ODwyer rated Derry as the best team never to have won an All-Ireland. Did McElhinney think they were serious contenders  “We knew we were close when we ran Dublin to a point in the  league final. If we had won that  national league, we wouldve given the All-Ireland a run for it,” he remembers. “It is hard to pick it up after being beat by a point, especially in Croke Park on their home patch. “We had some great players on that team. Anthony McGurk was an all-star by that time. Sean OConnell and Seamus Lagan, sadly not with us anymore, they were all big guns then. “Tom McGuinness, Johnny OLeary and Mickey Lynch...Mickey was my team mate and we travelled everywhere together.” Eight points from Brendan Kelly and a man of the match performance from Anthony McGurk helped Derry to an extra time win over Cavan in the  Ulster final. Derry led by four points after  minutes of the All-Ireland semi-final final, with McElhinney in fine fettle at midfield, against Jack OShea. The Ulster champions led Kerry until early in the second half when super sub Seanie Walsh found the net. The wheels fell off the wagon as the Munster men rattled - in the second half. *** Wins over Tyrone and Donegal took Derry back to an Ulster final in . On the cusp of a third Ulster title and with the Connacht champions to come in the All-Ireland semi-final, they would avoid the Dubs and Kerry until the final. Armagh had other ideas. “Paddy Moriarty destroyed us and we just ran out of steam...that was a bad result.” said McElhinney of their - to - drubbing. He wouldfor the  season. Barring his late cameo in , he bowed away from the county scene. All too early, but his soccer career came calling. Also at that time, Mickey John Forbes ran charity football weekends and players from all over Ulster would play. “They came up from Kerry. It was a couple of times a year and you were getting as many at it, as youd get any many club finals. “There was a hooley after with singers like Susan McCann, Eileen Keane and Philomena Begley. All the top names turned out, it was almost like two all-star selects.” McElhinneys passport was well-stamped and he has been to USA over a dozen times during his career. “If Derry were ever knocked out of anything, I used to just go to America to play Gaelic. I played in New York for Sligo. A Banagher man, Martin Murphy, was manager there and he put me up. “They would fly me over for the weekend to play in Gaelic Park. I always remember the trains going past every ten minutes, alongside the pitch almost. “I played with Cavan in Philadelphia after Armagh beat us. Tom Farrelly was heavily involved in the GAA out there and I worked for him as a landscape gardener. “Tyrone were a big team out there most years with Frankie McGuigan and boys like Brendan Donnelly and Dominic Daly. We played against each other, but all met up and were the best of friends.” The summer of  was his last footballing foray across the Atlantic. “We won the championship in Chicago for Connemara Gaels. I worked out there and played out there. “There wasnt much training involved. They got you work on building sites and there were plenty of contractors out there, Irish guys who were trying to make a buck. “I remember having a car, it only cost me . I parked it up in the car park at OHare Airport and home I went.” Is the wagon still here, I ponder  “It might be,” McElhinney says with a laugh. With the s around the corner, it was soccer time. In part two, McElhinney rolls the clock back on Billy Bingham handing him his debut against the Germans and the trials and tribulations of transferring to the English leagues.

Sport Psychologist Dr Noel Brick is currently involved with Slaughtneil hurlers and has worked with Derry senior footballers. Michael McMullan asked him how athletes should approach lock-down. Its been  days since Leo Varadkar stood on the steps of Washingtons Blair House and insisted that all outdoor mass gatherings of more than  people be cancelled. Our world, has we knew it, has changed. Within hours of the announcement, sporting bodies put their wheels in motion to cancel games and clubs closed their gates to collective training. googletag.cmd.push While Brick, a Kerry man living in Ballycastle, accepts most athletes are driven by the desire to compete and beat others, they often have a dference psyche. He is a lecturer in Sport and Exercise Psychology at the Coleraine campus of Ulster University, has studied to PhD level at University of Limerick and holds a Masters from Staffordshire University. Brick has a background in long-distance running and has managed his own fitness testing business. He is well-placed to assess the needs of the sporting world, albeit in very surreal circumstances. “A lot of athletes are self-driven in the goals that they set for themselves,” he said. “A lot of those goals are not just about competition, they are about improving themselves by getting fitter, getting stronger or improving their skills.” googletag.cmd.push The important thing now, Brick feels, is to reset any goals. Special consideration should be made to aspects an athlete can measure. “Even though competition is very important, through the normal training cycle, there is that competition with themselves and it is about getting better. It is those type of goals that become really important now. These are things that are under your own control and you can reference yourself.” WHAT NEXT  So much of sport planning is about tapering down and peaking at the business end of competition. Coaches often have plans broken down into weeks and even days. Thats all up in the air, but any work done will be worth it, as Brick explains. “Itwill pass and we will come to a time when we do get back to competition. Normal might be dferent for a while, but eventually we will get back. It is recognising that too. Whatever training athletes are doing right now, it will become beneficial.” “Through a normal season you dont always have the time to improve on the things you might get better at. Now, you can reframe it as an opportunity to work on something to get better at and when we do get backyou are a better player.” Inidual work would be aerobic fitness, increasing strength and acceleration, as well as working on technical skills. Its about getting your weak side up to a level you can use under pressure and speeding up the execution of skills. It could be something as simple as rehabbing an injury. What that target is, is irrelevant, but Bricks message is consistent. “It is that competition with yourself and looking at your own improvement. It is something you can control and work on and measure. “There are so many things about this situation at the minute, and this is le in general, that we dont have control over. We dont know when it will end. “We have control over the small things, like washing our hands, but we have no control over when sport happens again and le gets back to normal. “It is about the things you can control right now...working on things like your touch, on your acceleration – you have complete control over these things.” “It is hugely important as we manage our emotions, as we go through this. If you are focussing on things you cant control...you are going to feel anxious, down and all those negative things.” CONNECTIONS Aside from the competitive streak, the sporting environment is one of inclusion. Dressing room banter and the slagging around training breeds a team spirit. After a stressful day at work, exercise and collective training is a welcome release. Without the regular bond, it presents a mental strain. “For our own mental health, it is so important to stay connected to people we normally connect with,” Brick stresses. It is important for team environments to still foster that togetherness, evenit is an articial way, via video conferencing. “You are apart from each other, you are doing a bit of training together but separately. That connection is massively important. “We all take part in sport because we love taking part, but we also enjoy the company of the people we take part with. Keeping that companionship and connectivity is so important. “We are physically distancing and socially isolating, but through that, it is important that we dont completely socially disconnect from other people. It only has benefits and one is for our own mental health.” To conclude, Brick highlighted an non-sport theme he has noticed with many of his students and clients. “People are taking the time to slow down to a certain extent, to reconnect with what is important in le and spend time with family. “That is a positive. We get wrapped up in our work bubble or our sport bubble, we forget about the important things.” RELATED - Derry GAA doctor on the importance of exercise. Click here...

Most of the club football I have watched over the past decade has been senior league matches my own club Ballinascreen have been involved in or the club championship, when I try to attend all the games as I love watching them. So apologies to some of the great players out there who have been outstanding at intermediate and junior level, I’ve kept it to the senior club  here. Michael Conlan Dedication and a serious quest for goalkeeping excellence were his traits, a key part of the three in a row Ballinderry side in -. The final of , in particular, Mickey C’s width and accuracy in his kick outs to his teams ‘four in midfield’ tactic was key to their victory that day. Fine shot stopper too, made his body big, gave the forward less to shoot at.

Loved to win ball out in front of his opponent and destroyed many a forward’s resolve by racing forward repeatedly, often up the right hand side of the pitch. Loved the wide open space at Owenbeg, in particular, where his pace was there for all to see. Brendan Rogers With serious pace and raw talent, Brendan transforms the way we think about modern full backs. His forays up the pitch often veered over to the sidelines and racing - yards up the pitch and nobody could catch him. Instrumental in Slaughtneils four in a row and his importance to the team was illustrated last year when he was hampered by injury. Incredible dual player. googletag.cmd.push Karl McKaigue Best man marker in the county, his one on one stats are astonishing against star opponents. Can play a bit too, but tends to keep it simple and save his energies for his defensive duties. Keeps it clean too, quiet, no-nonsense, great reader, interceptions, timing of the tackle superb these are his main traits. Ciaran McFaulBetter known for playing at midfield for Glen, or even in the forward line, but he is as complete a player as there is in Derry club football at present. Great ball carrier, his pinpoint passes often put it on a plate for his full forwards. Great long range scorer as well, but it’s his ‘lead by example’ attitude with Glen that impresses me. Chrissy McKaigue Undoubtedly the driving force behind Slaughtneil’s phenomenal run to four county and three Ulster titles. Fierce will to win, excellent athlete, a ball carrier, dictates the play, his tour de force against Diarmuid Connolly and St Vincents in the  All-Ireland semi final was as good an inidual display as I have seen, racing forward to score four outstanding long range points. Sean Leo McGoldrick Another great ball carrier, an orchestrator, extremely comfortable and elusive on the ball, plays almost like a quarter back at times for his club. Part of the famous McGoldrick clan that have played a huge part in putting Eoghan Rua on the footballing map with an incredible two county titles in  and . Enda Muldoon Big Enda had it all, great fielder, outstanding passer, long range points of either foot, excellent free taker. Played well over two decades with Ballinderry winning eight county titles and, of course two Ulster’s and an All-Ireland club. Always did the business when it counted most as well. One of the all time greats of Derry football, and modest with it. Privileged to have been a team mate for several years. Patsy Bradley The most spectacular sight in Derry football was Patsy taking off and ‘leppin’ above and across several opponents, attempting a miraculous catch. You never knew where, or even how, he was going to land, but more often than not, he either emerged with the ball or got a big fist to it. A fierce competitor, and tremendous athlete, he was the Slaughtneil folk hero that got the crowd roaring and inspired his team every match without fail. Danny Heavron Danny has been a shining example for his club right throughout this decade. Has played effectively in defence as a sweeper, at midfield, or anywhere in the forward line. A great athlete, a playmaker, a great score taker from play and frees, Danny came back from several career threatening injuries to lead Magherafelt to a memorable county title win in . Mark Lynch Extremely powerful runner with the ball, two great feet, fine fielder, accurate free taker often putting up a big scoring total. Could play equally effectively at midfield, number  or full forward. Another player who has combined an outstanding county career whilst giving his all for his club, Banagher. I chose Mark just ahead of Christopher Bradley who was majestic at number  in Slaughtneil’s run to their first Ulster Club title in . Conleith Gilligan Along with Enda, he was the outstanding club player in the county for at least  years from  until his seventh county medal in . Extremely hard to dispossess , evasive, some absolutely outstanding scores of either foot. Brushed off a lot of crap from opponents and just got on with the football. Infectious character who was an outstanding servant for Ballinderry. Paddy Bradley Paddy was still a seriously good forward for Glenullin in the first six or so years of the past decade. His first touch was outstanding. Raced out to the ball, sometimes double marked, controlled it first go either with a catch or palm down to himself, then literally fired it over, straight as an arrow, with unerring accuracy, often from - yards out. Derry’s best ever forward in my letime. If it was a team of the last four years alone, young Shane McGuigan of Slaughtneil would undoubtedly have been chosen, a class act. Colm McGoldrickDeceptively languid style, but Colm has been a consistently top club player for Eoghan Rua right throughout the past decade since their vivacious first county title in . Always finds space against even the tightest opponent, the target man, wins serious ball down the channel, good in the air and has scored umpteen goals for his team over the years. A real pity he was never tempted to give the county team a proper rattle as I believe he would have been a huge asset. Just ahead of Emmett McGuckin. Benny Heron Outstanding player for Ballinascreen over the past decade, a fantastic ’turn on a sixpence’ style has destroyed many an opponent. Great finisher, goals and points, he has rattled up some serious tallies. If I was managing Benny I’d have him up top close to goal every time, where he is a deadly assassin. However, a sublime playmaker further out the field as well, with great stamina.Eoghan Brown, another great club forward, was also considered here. RELATED - Michael McMullans selection.

Most of the club football I have watched over the past decade has been senior league matches my own club Ballinascreen have been involved in or the club championship, when I try to attend all the games as I love watching them. So apologies to some of the great players out there who have been outstanding at intermediate and junior level, I’ve kept it to the senior club  here. Michael Conlan Dedication and a serious quest for goalkeeping excellence were his traits, a key part of the three in a row Ballinderry side in -. The final of , in particular, Mickey C’s width and accuracy in his kick outs to his teams ‘four in midfield’ tactic was key to their victory that day. Fine shot stopper too, made his body big, gave the forward less to shoot at. Edges out Antoacutein McMullan and Thomas Mallon. googletag.cmd.push Ciaran Mullan Selected not so much for his defensive skills, as his attacking runs from the full back line for Eoghan Rua, playing a key part in their two county titles of  and . Loved to win ball out in front of his opponent and destroyed many a forward’s resolve by racing forward repeatedly, often up the right hand side of the pitch. Loved the wide open space at Owenbeg, in particular, where his pace was there for all to see. Brendan Rogers With serious pace and raw talent, Brendan transforms the way we think about modern full backs. His forays up the pitch often veered over to the sidelines and racing - yards up the pitch and nobody could catch him.

The smiling photograph of the little girl in a First Communion dress was taken by former Derry Journal photographerLarry Doherty in the s. It lay uncollected in a box for many years until Larrys daughter, Moira Doherty, discovered it recently and posted it on Facebook in the hope of reuniting it with its owner. Tracy Morroi, who is a teacher at St Patricks Primary School in Pennyburn, was contacted by a friend who noticed the striking resemblance to her, but at first she thought it was just a coincidence. googletag.cmd.push I said Im not old enough to be in a black and white photograph, said Mrs Morroi. As time went on more and more people contacted her who suggested it was her mum, Maura Wade nee Doherty, who passed away almost seven years ago. At first Mrs Morroiwas unsureit wasdefinitely her, and she didnt want to collect the picture in case it belonged to another family. However, she was inundated with calls and messages from people who remembered her mother as a young girl and confirmed it was indeed her in the picture. Maura Dohertywas born in  the front room of her grandparentshome in  Bishops Street, which is now the Oakgrove Bar. googletag.cmd.push Her parents Maureen and George Doherty then moved to  Long Tower STreet where she grew up and attended the Wee Nuns school. My mammy worked in all the factories so everybody knew her, explained Mrs Morroi. She was a really bubbly person and would have chatted to anyone. Its been really nice to hear from people who remember her. I picked up the picture and it really made day. It was so emotional. Its so special to get it because I only have two other pictures of my mother as a child.  Mrs Morroisaid the whole experience has been very emotional. I had been doing a redding out the house this week and I had come across a lot of my mothers things so I was just having wavesof emotion anyway and this happened. Ive just been crying my eyes out.

The news was outlined in a statement from the companys chief executive officer, Damian McGloughlin. In March, Homebase was classied as an essential retailer by the Government, meaning that our stores could continue trading.

Following a successful trial across  stores, we will be fully reopening an additional  stores across the UK on Wednesday th April, with strict controls in place to ensure shopping is safe for everyone. Our remaining UK stores will all be reopened for customers to browse and shop from Saturday nd May. It has taken a tremendous amount of hard work and commitment from our teams across all parts of the business, to ensure we are ready to safely welcome customers back through our doors. googletag.cmd.push Im extremely grateful for the dedication shown by every single team member, and to our customers, for the huge support and understanding.

The -strong group managed to raise pound, after abseiling down the Tower Museum building in Derry in the inaugural charity event at the beginning of March. Money raised from the event will go towards the pound million per year cost associated with running the le-saving Helicopter Emergency Medical Service . HEMS paramedic Jason Rosborough was among those who took part in the event and said the funds were vital to the running of the service. “As a service we rely heavily on charitable donations to keep us in the air, delivering critical care to patients who have suffered trauma throughout Northern Ireland,” said the Eglinton native. googletag.cmd.push “With the sponsorship raised for taking on this exciting challenge, we have all done our bit to raise much needed funds for Air Ambulance NI.” Earlier this year Jason told the County Derry Post why the HEMS service was so important. He said: “The helicopter means we can deliver critical care interventions to patients that they wouldn’t get unless they were in a hospital department. “We bring the hospital department to the patient and deliver those interventions that have the potential to save le.” The service operates for  hours per day,  days a week and aims to reach anywhere in Northern Ireland within  minutes. googletag.cmd.push Regular donations allow AANI to better predict income levels to keep the helicopter flying and public support for the service is vital. Deputy Chair of AANI, Ian Crowe, has encouraged people to support their membership scheme. He said: “We are so grateful to everyone who took part in the Tower Museum Abseil, I put my fear of heights aside to join in. “The event was a brilliant success for the charity and something we will run again when the time is right. As a charity we rely on the support of local people to keep our helicopter flying. “With the current absence of fundraising events such as this one, I urge anyone who can to donate online or sign up to become a Club AANI member.” Anyone interested in becoming a member can contact AANI via email at info@airambulance.org or visit the website for more information.

He sat down with Michael McMullan to talk about how he almost missed out on Derry’s greatest hour. When Brian McGilligan shakes your hand, it stays shook. Locked, like a wench. It reminds you of the toughness of a man who turned the midfield battlegrounds of Ireland upside down. A man who Ireland manager Kevin Heffernan took one glance at and knew he would not need baby-sitting when faced with any form thuggery the Australians could heave at him. The man that, alongside Anthony Tohill, formed the perfect midfield partnership. A duo that dozed all before it. googletag.cmd.push He is one of six players to start and finish all five games on the way to the historic summit of . It is put to him that he played a central part in something that has never been equalled. “Do you think so sur ” came the instant reply. With  minutes of the All-Ireland Final gone Niall Cahalane’s mis-directed fist pass is too high and squirms through the fingers of Teddy McCarthy. McGilligan laps up the gt before slotting over his third score of the campaign. Four minutes previous, with Cork - to - ahead, he was involved in the move that led to Johnny McGurk’s point - Derry’s first of a jittery start. googletag.cmd.push The midfield warrior’s input didn’t end there. Wing-forward Barry Coffey had a height advantage over Johnny McGurk. The pre-game chat suggested that goalkeeper John Kerins was expected to exploit it. Kerins’ th minute kick-out was angled towards Coffey, who was hugging the Cusack Stand sideline. McGilligan scampered across - effortlessly almost - before thundering through Coffey for the breaking ball. His physique didn’t suggest he was fast. He was deceptive. “Over  metres nobody could touch me,” McGilligan states. “Tony Scullion would be close, Joe Brolly over the first  or  yards would have been fast but I would have stuffed them after that. “Every evening after school you were running and feeding sheep. I was naturally fit and was carrying no weight.” In Coffey’s wake and with the leather in his grasp, McGilligan thumped the ball goalwards. It was the days when you had to fight your own corner. He had done his bit. Now the forwards needed to man up. Enda Gormley nipped ahead of Cahalane to flick the wet ball into the path of Damian Cassidy. Cassidy’s left-footed kick evaded Cahalane’s intended block and hung in the air above full-back Mark O’Connor before Seamus Downey punched to the net and Derry were two points ahead. The measure of a leader is how they respond to adversity. As Derry’s landmark Sunday flirted with failure, before it had left the starting blocks, McGilligan was involved in three of the game’s key moments. The craved All-Ireland title would follow, but it so nearly passed him by. *** It’s a Wednesday night in the McGilligan household. Like a scene from game day in any corner of Ireland. Brian Oacuteg and Fiontan are gathering their gear for a game. Cathair points me in the direction of the farmyard. After a day on the site, Brian senior is out feeding the stock. In full view below, through the open side of the shed, is the Benedy. We head up to the house. Traversing back through the living room is like walking through a museum. The walls are scarcely visible, around framed pictures of Dungiven, Derry and Ulster teams. Charting the career of one of the Derry’s most famous sons. But hurling was his first love. He was reared in the cottages at Owenbeg and went to Dernaflaw school which, despite its small size, also produced Joe Brolly to Derry’s winning team. “The Damperwas there and we had a pretty good hurling team and won a couple of Feacuteiles,” McGilligan recalled. It was pre-Kevin Lynch’s and Dernaflaw would always be beating Dungiven at underage. McGilligan’s football career began as a goalkeeper at U and U. The genuine interest wasn’t there but with flailing numbers, he played almost out of necessity. Now at ‘the big school’ in Dungiven, the oldest of a family of six was now needed on the farm. Spare time was a limited commodity. “You had to go and look sheep and feed them. That was every evening. My fatherwas working and it was up to me. My motherwould lt me at the school gates.” An U title in  was followed two years later by U glory but it wasn’t until the minor grade, under George Murphy, that he made the breakthrough. A championship game with Magherafelt came around the corner and his dual with Joe Beattie, who had a huge reputation at the time, changed the direction of McGilligan’s career. “They threw me out at centre-half back to mark him,” he outlined. Dungiven went on to win two minor championships, but he never was able to break into the mould at county level. In his final year, , he watched on as an unused substitute as Cork beat Derry in the All-Ireland Minor Final. “They put on every Tom, Dick and Harry. It was all about who you were, who your father was and what pedigree you had. They weren’t going to put a rahery like me on,” McGilligan said. As he admits himself, there is a stubbornness. He stuck at it and took his chances when they came. One Sunday, Dungiven reserve manager Liam Harrycoaxed McGilligan from a corn field to make up the numbers for a trip to Ballinderry. Never an easy place to go to. “It was like something from a ‘Carry on’ film,” McGilligan described. “A boy was going to hit a penalty and somebody would run up behind him and trip him. It was the Wild West - there is no other way to say it.” The experience of the reserve and senior games on a Sunday was a lesson for a decorated career that would follow. Andy Murphy came in as manager in . He saw something in McGilligan and pushed him towards the team. His instincts paid off. A year later at Ballinascreen, a star-studded Magherafelt side led Dungiven - to -, as the county final ticked into the final moments. Liam McElhinney’s kick hung in the air. It was the last hurrah. Out of nowhere, McGilligan got a fist to the ball – punching to the net. It lives long in Dungiven folklore and that winning goal helped him to the first of five county medals. His career began to take root. *** It was Sunday, June   at Omagh’s Healy Park. Derry were trailing Tyrone by ‘five or six points’ and Jim McKeever called Brian McGilligan from the dug-out. There was no warm up required. “I was mad keen to get on. I thought I should have started,” McGilligan recalls of his debut. “I went on and I won a couple of balls and we turned it, but Noel McGinn hit a wonder strike.” The goal ended Derry’s hopes but Tyrone would later have a major part to play in McGilligan’s summer. The Kevin Barry’s club in Philadelphia came calling and he headed across the pond. As time went by, he felt he may never . “I wasn’t for coming back. I had work and plenty of money...everything…and the weather was favourable. I was playing football and hurling – it was a home away from home.” With no mobile phones, communication wasn’t as it is now. The weekly phone call kept tabs on how everyone was back home. “Every time I would ring, my mother would say ‘that boy Heffernanwas ringing again’ you would need to ring him.” If the Ireland manager wasn’t ringing the McGilligan household, ‘Heffo’ was ringing then Derry official Patsy Mulholland. The calls continued. Homesickness began to creep in ‘a wee bit’ and with the chance to represent his country, it eventually swayed McGilligan and he dialled Heffernan’s number. Still in Philadelphia, would he be guaranteed a seat on the plane to Oz  Onlyhe was playing the football he was before be left, insisted Heffernan. “You know yourself - boys go outand go off the rails and are messing about. I wasn’t at that. Yes, I enjoyed a beer but I was working hard every day,” McGilligan continues. The football was a good work out, ‘a couple of’ evenings a week. The system wasn’t abused. After a weekend of thinking and a Mondayhome, Heffo booked McGilligan and Dermot McNicholl, who had also spent the summer in Philadelphia, into Tyrone training on the Tuesday night. Art McRory was putting the finishing touches to their  All-Ireland Final with Kerry and had a savage routine in place for McGilligan. “It was strange because we were two Derry men. There was no love lost but we were well looked after – we were treated as part of the .” McGilligan battled with Plunkett Donaghy, Audi Hamilton and Harry McClure in the training games. “The only dference was -we were doing  sprints, I was made do five or six more. If there was half a dozen sI would be doing  of them.” It was the same in the gym sessions. The first set was fine, the second and third set had McGilligan going around on his knees. “I got a lot of abuse. It was bordering on brutality. I remember Art talking to Fr Brian D’Arcy, who was down watching training. “Art said ‘look at the big Derry b*****d, that’s the place for him – on his knees’ and I felt like getting up and striking him.” As the Tyrone sessions were tapering down, McNicholl and McGilligan’s time was up. They thanked Tyrone for having them there and wished them well for the final. McRory was appreciative of the bite the two Derry men brought to their preparations but had a final word of apology for big Brian. The extra training was ‘preferential treatment’ at the request of Heffernan. “The whole thing was pre-planned but it worked,” added McGilligan. He was on the trip to Australia, where he played at full-back as Ireland recovered from a first test defeat to win the series -. Playing in front of average attendances of ,, McGilligan was now an icon. Home for good, he was midfield in Derry’s Ulster winning team. The seeds for Sam were sown. *** The summer of  was his first time playing in the mecca of GAA. It was ‘a privilege’ but age wasn’t on their side. “We had an old team. Plunkett Murphy and Joe Irwin – boys like that. They were all good footballers but there was no youth coming in. “I quite honestly thought we’d never be back in an All-Ireland semi-final even. Holy Jesus, to get playing in Croke Park, this is unreal. “Ulster was very hard to win. It wasn’t like Munster, where it was down to two teams.” Following his All-Star and a trip to America, rubbing shoulders with the best Ireland had to offer, McGilligan began thinking. “They were no better than you, but they were in a better set-up – a better oiled machine,” he offered, referring to the players from other counties. “They weren’t superhumans, when you were playing with them, you were every bit as fast as them.” Back home, it was a lot dferent. “Derry was in turmoil. You were going to matches and counting to seeyou had enough men to play. We played Down at Drumsurn and we were down to the bare bones. “We hadn’t even a manager. Mickey Moran had to step in to take the team. There was  or  out at training.” Fr Sean Hegarty, a confidant of Eamonn Coleman, managed Armagh against Derry in  would act as an intermediary of sorts. “Wee Hegarty came in and I honestly think he steadied the ship. I didn’t know a lot about him but he was a gas man. He was the sort of man I would go to give my confessions to – he was a shrewd man.” With minor teams beginning to produce players, the recipe began to thicken. But like most of his career, McGilligan had to wait. Down and Donegal would feast at the top table first. “Tohill and these boys were coming in at the start of the s but by  they were starting to come of age.” Handing Down an  point hammering in the first round was the perfect tonic. “You start to believe in yourself but it could have gone pear-shaped. We rode our luck in a couple of games.” “Even the bad dayin Clones, it could’ve went either way. There was a ball that went down the field and I went like mad after it. Martin McHugh passed it and I got my hand to it and it came out again.” The small margins where games were won and lost. In the All-Ireland semi-final, Derry were in arrears against Dublin and McGilligan’s  doubts raised their head again. “It was the same auld story. It’s not going to be back again,” he recalled thinking. In the lead-up to the game, he had asked his fatherhe was going to the game. He wasn’t. It wasn’t a surprise. “My mother was dferent,” McGilligan outlined. “But he was never at a match in his le. He didn’t have an interest. He was a typical workaholic and farmer, but he said he’d go to the final.” Whatthey didn’t get there  His father’s answer was the perfect comeback. “He said ‘well,that’s your attitude, then don’t you go either’ – it was as quick as that,” McGilligan added. His son did show up alright. Few can forget the thunderous shoulder on Jack Sheedy. The two met later in the year, by chance, and the Dubliner told McGilligan he was still sore. That’s the brute strength he brought. The Dubs couldn’t move it and neither could Cork. So Gerard McGilligan would get a chance to see his son play. And on the biggest day of them all. “My wewent down,” Brian recalled. “Our young girlwas only a year and Brian Oacuteg was only born. She had more bother with the auld boy than the two weans.” Following the final whistle McGilligan still recalls heading towards the Hogan Stand, where there was a cordon of Gardai surrounding the steps. “I mind crawling on my hands and knees, in between somebody’s legs. I wasn’t fit to walk, I was beat black and had people jumping on me.” The celebration banquet in the Shelbourne Hotel was similar. It couldn’t cope. McGilligan, Tony Scullion and Kieran McKeever – with their partners – were among those unable to get a seat in the mainroom. “It was like something out of a Monty Python sketch - it was hilarious. There were no seats for us. It wasn’t big enough to hold thefor starters. I actually saw somebody move name pieces and sit on the Bishop’s seat.” Seated in dferent room, upstairs, they began to tuck into their soup, one of the RTE staff came upstairs. The Sunday Game was about to go on air but McGilligan was reluctant to go downstairs. He was ‘embarrassed’ as others were forced to give up their seat in the middle of the . Even back at the Airport Hotel, later that night, where Derry were staying, there was only a ‘wee hatch’ open to serve up to  people, including Henry Downey and a certain Sam Maguire. With the cup needing filled, McGilligan issued a ‘bit of advice’ to the night porter and eventually two shutters opened on the bar. It was Monday before the occasion began to seep fully into the mind. Now it was real. *** The Moy was packed and when Derry bus-driver Benny Vincent opened the door - in came Plunkett Donaghy. The previous season, he spilled Anthony Tohill’s ‘’ into the net in the league final to start the ball rolling on Derry’s odyssey. This was dferent. This was a tribute to the sons of Ulster bringing home the Sam. “You had the Garda escort coming out of Dublin and you were stopping in every town,” McGilligan recalls. “There were thousands of people waiting on us on a lorry in every town on the way up.” In Cookstown there was a Loyalist road block. Plan B was to ert via Coalisland. But McGilligan instructed Vincent to head on up the town – as far as they could go. There were thousands of Tyrone people wanting a glance at Sam. “It was unheard of for a team from the North. Down had done it before and it wasn’t new to them - it was new to Derry.” The homecoming seemed to go on forever. In every town, before they were greeted by the huge crowd in Maghera, outside Glen club, before the cup was taken to the four corners of the county. When it was McGilligan’s turn to have the cup, he paraded it around the homes of the Benedy. Back to the days when Liam Harry came rounding him up to make up the numbers. His career had now come full circle. He hosted a night in his house. It was packed, with cars strewn alongside the road. “There was a death up in the Benedy,” added McGilligan, remembering the night vividly. A stranger to the area saw the commotion and stopped off. “He said to somebody ‘where’s the remains at’ – he saw all the cars and thought it was the wake house. He laughed and away he went.” *** The glory days ended abruptly. With Ciaran McCabe’s winning goal for Down in , Derry’s world came crashing down. There was no back door and Derry’s All-Ireland dreams were in tatters. McGilligan laments the  years since meeting Sam. “Any other county would have got their act together. Too many boys partied, lived the high le and thought it was only matter of turning up. “We definitely should have won another one. The players were good enough, you can’t pinpoint any one thing. It was the perfect storm. There was a whole lot of things going on behind. You see where things have gone,” he continued. “We are still as far away from winning another one. We are starting from the bottom again – we are in ision four.” That aside, McGilligan is content on how his GAA career panned out. “It kept me on the straight and narrow. Everybody has their vices and the GAA was a vice for me. If it wasn’t football it was hurling.” Nulling the impact of Joe Beattie, punching home a county final winning goal and answering Kevin Heffernan’s call tofrom America. The important markers in the career of one of Derry’s famous sons. RELATED - Gerry McElhinney - the greatest showman. Click here...

He was reared in the cottages at Owenbeg and went to Dernaflaw school which, despite its small size, also produced Joe Brolly to Derry’s winning team. “The Damperwas there and we had a pretty good hurling team and won a couple of Feacuteiles,” McGilligan recalled. It was pre-Kevin Lynch’s and Dernaflaw would always be beating Dungiven at underage. McGilligan’s football career began as a goalkeeper at U and U. The genuine interest wasn’t there but with flailing numbers, he played almost out of necessity. Now at ‘the big school’ in Dungiven, the oldest of a family of six was now needed on the farm. Spare time was a limited commodity. “You had to go and look sheep and feed them. That was every evening. My fatherwas working and it was up to me. My motherwould lt me at the school gates.” An U title in  was followed two years later by U glory but it wasn’t until the minor grade, under George Murphy, that he made the breakthrough. A championship game with Magherafelt came around the corner and his dual with Joe Beattie, who had a huge reputation at the time, changed the direction of McGilligan’s career. “They threw me out at centre-half back to mark him,” he outlined. Dungiven went on to win two minor championships, but he never was able to break into the mould at county level. In his final year, , he watched on as an unused substitute as Cork beat Derry in the All-Ireland Minor Final. “They put on every Tom, Dick and Harry. It was all about who you were, who your father was and what pedigree you had. They weren’t going to put a rahery like me on,” McGilligan said. As he admits himself, there is a stubbornness. He stuck at it and took his chances when they came. One Sunday, Dungiven reserve manager Liam Harrycoaxed McGilligan from a corn field to make up the numbers for a trip to Ballinderry. Never an easy place to go to. “It was like something from a ‘Carry on’ film,” McGilligan described. “A boy was going to hit a penalty and somebody would run up behind him and trip him. It was the Wild West - there is no other way to say it.” The experience of the reserve and senior games on a Sunday was a lesson for a decorated career that would follow. Andy Murphy came in as manager in . He saw something in McGilligan and pushed him towards the team. His instincts paid off. A year later at Ballinascreen, a star-studded Magherafelt side led Dungiven - to -, as the county final ticked into the final moments. Liam McElhinney’s kick hung in the air. It was the last hurrah. Out of nowhere, McGilligan got a fist to the ball – punching to the net. It lives long in Dungiven folklore and that winning goal helped him to the first of five county medals. His career began to take root. *** It was Sunday, June   at Omagh’s Healy Park. Derry were trailing Tyrone by ‘five or six points’ and Jim McKeever called Brian McGilligan from the dug-out. There was no warm up required. “I was mad keen to get on. I thought I should have started,” McGilligan recalls of his debut. “I went on and I won a couple of balls and we turned it, but Noel McGinn hit a wonder strike.” The goal ended Derry’s hopes but Tyrone would later have a major part to play in McGilligan’s summer. The Kevin Barry’s club in Philadelphia came calling and he headed across the pond. As time went by, he felt he may never . “I wasn’t for coming back. I had work and plenty of money...everything…and the weather was favourable. I was playing football and hurling – it was a home away from home.” With no mobile phones, communication wasn’t as it is now. The weekly phone call kept tabs on how everyone was back home. “Every time I would ring, my mother would say ‘that boy Heffernanwas ringing again’ you would need to ring him.” If the Ireland manager wasn’t ringing the McGilligan household, ‘Heffo’ was ringing then Derry official Patsy Mulholland. The calls continued. Homesickness began to creep in ‘a wee bit’ and with the chance to represent his country, it eventually swayed McGilligan and he dialled Heffernan’s number. Still in Philadelphia, would he be guaranteed a seat on the plane to Oz  Onlyhe was playing the football he was before be left, insisted Heffernan. “You know yourself - boys go outand go off the rails and are messing about. I wasn’t at that. Yes, I enjoyed a beer but I was working hard every day,” McGilligan continues. The football was a good work out, ‘a couple of’ evenings a week. The system wasn’t abused. After a weekend of thinking and a Mondayhome, Heffo booked McGilligan and Dermot McNicholl, who had also spent the summer in Philadelphia, into Tyrone training on the Tuesday night. Art McRory was putting the finishing touches to their  All-Ireland Final with Kerry and had a savage routine in place for McGilligan. “It was strange because we were two Derry men. There was no love lost but we were well looked after – we were treated as part of the .” McGilligan battled with Plunkett Donaghy, Audi Hamilton and Harry McClure in the training games. “The only dference was -we were doing  sprints, I was made do five or six more. If there was half a dozen sI would be doing  of them.” It was the same in the gym sessions. The first set was fine, the second and third set had McGilligan going around on his knees. “I got a lot of abuse. It was bordering on brutality. I remember Art talking to Fr Brian D’Arcy, who was down watching training. “Art said ‘look at the big Derry b*****d, that’s the place for him – on his knees’ and I felt like getting up and striking him.” As the Tyrone sessions were tapering down, McNicholl and McGilligan’s time was up. They thanked Tyrone for having them there and wished them well for the final. McRory was appreciative of the bite the two Derry men brought to their preparations but had a final word of apology for big Brian. The extra training was ‘preferential treatment’ at the request of Heffernan. “The whole thing was pre-planned but it worked,” added McGilligan. He was on the trip to Australia, where he played at full-back as Ireland recovered from a first test defeat to win the series -. Playing in front of average attendances of ,, McGilligan was now an icon. Home for good, he was midfield in Derry’s Ulster winning team. The seeds for Sam were sown. *** The summer of  was his first time playing in the mecca of GAA. It was ‘a privilege’ but age wasn’t on their side. “We had an old team. Plunkett Murphy and Joe Irwin – boys like that. They were all good footballers but there was no youth coming in. “I quite honestly thought we’d never be back in an All-Ireland semi-final even. Holy Jesus, to get playing in Croke Park, this is unreal. “Ulster was very hard to win. It wasn’t like Munster, where it was down to two teams.” Following his All-Star and a trip to America, rubbing shoulders with the best Ireland had to offer, McGilligan began thinking. “They were no better than you, but they were in a better set-up – a better oiled machine,” he offered, referring to the players from other counties. “They weren’t superhumans, when you were playing with them, you were every bit as fast as them.” Back home, it was a lot dferent. “Derry was in turmoil. You were going to matches and counting to seeyou had enough men to play. We played Down at Drumsurn and we were down to the bare bones. “We hadn’t even a manager. Mickey Moran had to step in to take the team. There was  or  out at training.” Fr Sean Hegarty, a confidant of Eamonn Coleman, managed Armagh against Derry in  would act as an intermediary of sorts. “Wee Hegarty came in and I honestly think he steadied the ship. I didn’t know a lot about him but he was a gas man. He was the sort of man I would go to give my confessions to – he was a shrewd man.” With minor teams beginning to produce players, the recipe began to thicken. But like most of his career, McGilligan had to wait. Down and Donegal would feast at the top table first. “Tohill and these boys were coming in at the start of the s but by  they were starting to come of age.” Handing Down an  point hammering in the first round was the perfect tonic. “You start to believe in yourself but it could have gone pear-shaped. We rode our luck in a couple of games.” “Even the bad dayin Clones, it could’ve went either way. There was a ball that went down the field and I went like mad after it. Martin McHugh passed it and I got my hand to it and it came out again.” The small margins where games were won and lost. In the All-Ireland semi-final, Derry were in arrears against Dublin and McGilligan’s  doubts raised their head again. “It was the same auld story. It’s not going to be back again,” he recalled thinking. In the lead-up to the game, he had asked his fatherhe was going to the game. He wasn’t. It wasn’t a surprise. “My mother was dferent,” McGilligan outlined. “But he was never at a match in his le. He didn’t have an interest. He was a typical workaholic and farmer, but he said he’d go to the final.” Whatthey didn’t get there  His father’s answer was the perfect comeback. “He said ‘well,that’s your attitude, then don’t you go either’ – it was as quick as that,” McGilligan added. His son did show up alright. Few can forget the thunderous shoulder on Jack Sheedy. The two met later in the year, by chance, and the Dubliner told McGilligan he was still sore. That’s the brute strength he brought. The Dubs couldn’t move it and neither could Cork. So Gerard McGilligan would get a chance to see his son play. And on the biggest day of them all. “My wewent down,” Brian recalled. “Our young girlwas only a year and Brian Oacuteg was only born. She had more bother with the auld boy than the two weans.” Following the final whistle McGilligan still recalls heading towards the Hogan Stand, where there was a cordon of Gardai surrounding the steps. “I mind crawling on my hands and knees, in between somebody’s legs. I wasn’t fit to walk, I was beat black and had people jumping on me.” The celebration banquet in the Shelbourne Hotel was similar. It couldn’t cope. McGilligan, Tony Scullion and Kieran McKeever – with their partners – were among those unable to get a seat in the mainroom. “It was like something out of a Monty Python sketch - it was hilarious. There were no seats for us. It wasn’t big enough to hold thefor starters. I actually saw somebody move name pieces and sit on the Bishop’s seat.” Seated in dferent room, upstairs, they began to tuck into their soup, one of the RTE staff came upstairs. The Sunday Game was about to go on air but McGilligan was reluctant to go downstairs. He was ‘embarrassed’ as others were forced to give up their seat in the middle of the . Even back at the Airport Hotel, later that night, where Derry were staying, there was only a ‘wee hatch’ open to serve up to  people, including Henry Downey and a certain Sam Maguire. With the cup needing filled, McGilligan issued a ‘bit of advice’ to the night porter and eventually two shutters opened on the bar. It was Monday before the occasion began to seep fully into the mind. Now it was real. *** The Moy was packed and when Derry bus-driver Benny Vincent opened the door - in came Plunkett Donaghy. The previous season, he spilled Anthony Tohill’s ‘’ into the net in the league final to start the ball rolling on Derry’s odyssey. This was dferent. This was a tribute to the sons of Ulster bringing home the Sam. “You had the Garda escort coming out of Dublin and you were stopping in every town,” McGilligan recalls. “There were thousands of people waiting on us on a lorry in every town on the way up.” In Cookstown there was a Loyalist road block. Plan B was to ert via Coalisland. But McGilligan instructed Vincent to head on up the town – as far as they could go. There were thousands of Tyrone people wanting a glance at Sam. “It was unheard of for a team from the North. Down had done it before and it wasn’t new to them - it was new to Derry.” The homecoming seemed to go on forever. In every town, before they were greeted by the huge crowd in Maghera, outside Glen club, before the cup was taken to the four corners of the county. When it was McGilligan’s turn to have the cup, he paraded it around the homes of the Benedy. Back to the days when Liam Harry came rounding him up to make up the numbers. His career had now come full circle. He hosted a night in his house. It was packed, with cars strewn alongside the road. “There was a death up in the Benedy,” added McGilligan, remembering the night vividly. A stranger to the area saw the commotion and stopped off. “He said to somebody ‘where’s the remains at’ – he saw all the cars and thought it was the wake house. He laughed and away he went.” *** The glory days ended abruptly. With Ciaran McCabe’s winning goal for Down in , Derry’s world came crashing down. There was no back door and Derry’s All-Ireland dreams were in tatters. McGilligan laments the  years since meeting Sam. “Any other county would have got their act together. Too many boys partied, lived the high le and thought it was only matter of turning up. “We definitely should have won another one. The players were good enough, you can’t pinpoint any one thing. It was the perfect storm. There was a whole lot of things going on behind. You see where things have gone,” he continued. “We are still as far away from winning another one. We are starting from the bottom again – we are in ision four.” That aside, McGilligan is content on how his GAA career panned out. “It kept me on the straight and narrow. Everybody has their vices and the GAA was a vice for me. If it wasn’t football it was hurling.” Nulling the impact of Joe Beattie, punching home a county final winning goal and answering Kevin Heffernan’s call tofrom America. The important markers in the career of one of Derry’s famous sons. RELATED - Gerry McElhinney - the greatest showman. Click here...

Leo addressed the nation on Friday evening after his plans were approved by Cabinet. The measures were earlier discussed by the National Public Health Emergency Team. There has been a very slight lting of measures announced on March .Over s cocooning can exercise outdoors within km of their homes from May . The general population can take exercise within km of their homes instead of km from next Tuesday, May . The government have also included, in their road map for reopening society and business a plan for the phasedof sporting activities on the island. googletag.cmd.push The roll back on restrictions will be done over five phases. Phase one begins on May  and there are three weeks between each roll back.  In phase one, the government plan to open tennis courts, golf courses and sports pitches, as long as social distancing is still observed. A maximum of four people will be allowed to participate in an activity at the one time. Phase two will permit training, in small groups, but no matches. Phase three promises behind closed doors activities where arrangements are made to maintain social distance, while in Phase four, soccer and GAA canwith a limited number of spectators. This would hopefully mean, from a local perspective, that the Desmond and Limerick District soccer leagues could , while in GAA the football and hurling, club championships, could make a welcometo the playing pitches too. Phase four also allows for swimming pools to open. googletag.cmd.push Phase five, August , will allow gyms, contact sports such as boxing, wrestling and rugby to . There too will be restrictions on large sport gatherings, but it seems that inter county matches in the GAA could be back on the cards in August. It is vital to remember however, that should the virus resurface or one of the phases sees an increase in Covid- cases, there is the possibility that the government would roll back a phase and start from there once more. However, there does seem to be light at the end of the tunnel for sports fans and bodies at this time.

Leo addressed the nation on Friday evening after his plans were approved by Cabinet. The measures were earlier discussed by the National Public Health Emergency Team. There has been a very slight lting of measures announced on March .Over s cocooning can exercise outdoors within km of their homes from May . The general population can take exercise within km of their homes instead of km from next Tuesday, May . The government have also included, in their road map for reopening society and business a plan for the phasedof sporting activities on the island. googletag.cmd.push The roll back on restrictions will be done over five phases. Phase one begins on May  and there are three weeks between each roll back.  In phase one, the government plan to open tennis courts, golf courses and sports pitches, as long as social distancing is still observed. A maximum of four people will be allowed to participate in an activity at the one time. Phase two will permit training, in small groups, but no matches. Phase three promises behind closed doors activities where arrangements are made to maintain social distance, while in Phase four, soccer and GAA canwith a limited number of spectators. This would hopefully mean, from a local perspective, that the Desmond and Limerick District soccer leagues could , while in GAA the football and hurling, club championships, could make a welcometo the playing pitches too. Phase four also allows for swimming pools to open. googletag.cmd.push Phase five, August , will allow gyms, contact sports such as boxing, wrestling and rugby to . There too will be restrictions on large sport gatherings, but it seems that inter county matches in the GAA could be back on the cards in August. It is vital to remember however, that should the virus resurface or one of the phases sees an increase in Covid- cases, there is the possibility that the government would roll back a phase and start from there once more. However, there does seem to be light at the end of the tunnel for sports fans and bodies at this time.

The response to the classes has been brilliant and I have kept it on, even though I am teaching PE full-time in Assumption Grammar in Ballynahinch.ldquoObviously with COVID- I am off work now and with no GAA or fitness classes I have more time on my hands.ldquoI put out the idea on social media on Friday morning and then spent the weekend putting together the first class to upload Monday morning.ldquoI honestly didnrsquot know what to expect really. I was thinking maybeI managed to pull in a hundred people at pound each, pound would be a reasonable target.But I have really been overwhelmed by the response.Members of her usual weekly classes in Pilates for Paula responded immediately, but her school quickly weighed in behind the effort and her many acquaintances in GAA and camogie.Despite her organisation of the fundraiser, in her words being ldquoa bit last minute, her target was realised eight-fold and she presented a cheque for pound, last week.ldquoI couldnrsquot believe it really. When I saw Instagram stories of Sophie Colgan in New York taking part, Eiliacutes Niacute Chaiside [the Slaughtneil camog], who has been in New Zealand for the past year, signing up, and Sarah Donnelly, the Tyrone footballer in Australia, it just shows you that the people you meet through the GAA will always support each other.Paula last year captained Clonduff to the All-Ireland club title and she has played for Down and Ulster over many years, while her husband Darren is the Down football captain.ldquoThe GAA camogie community is absolutely fabulous. They rallied around my family after Christmas and provided a lot of comfort and again the response has been phenomenal.ldquoCOVID- has challenged the family once more. Clodaghrsquos parents, my brother Darren and his we Carol, live in Coleraine and it has been very dficult for us as a family to support them. What has happened over Easter week has given us all a huge lt and we are very thankful for all that support from our GAA family.ldquoI have got a lot of messages since the last class on Friday and everyone seems to have enjoyed them. A lot had never done exercise like that and now want me to provide more classes online and keep it going for as long as we are all prevented from going back to work.ldquoI think plenty of people are finding the lockdown very tough mentally and I got that back in the messages too, about how they felt a lot more positive after doing the exercise, a lot fresher and ready to face the day.She added: ldquoThe people who supported the fundraiser have helped themselves, helped Leukaemia  Lymphoma NI Research and really supported the Gribben family.You can still contribute to Leukaemia Lymphonania Research by searching for Carol and Darren Gribbenrsquos fundraiser in aid of Leukaemia  Lymphoma NI on Facebook or follow this link https:www.facebook donate  .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Delamont.jpg","title":"Delamont remains closed in lockdown  ","story":"DELAMONT Country Park outside Killyleagh is to remain closed to visitors.Newry, Mourne and Down Council has confirmed that the gates to the stunning park on the shores of Strangford Lough will not reopen, despite last weekrsquos decision by Stormont agriculture minister Edwin Poots to reopen Tollymore and Castlewellan forest parks.The decision not to allow visitors into Delamont was taken by the leaders of the local councilrsquos main parties during a meeting held via Skype last week and has been welcomed by local councillors Billy Walker and Dermot Curran.Cllr Walker said all the party leaders agreed that is it too soon to reopen Delamont, confirming that the closure decision will be reviewed next month.ldquoThere are real concerns that allowing the public to access the country park could lead to a major surge in visitors which is not what anyone wants at this particular time. The last thing we need is for family picnics and hundreds of other visitors arriving at a time when coronavirus remains a very real and present danger, continued the Rowallane councillor.Cllr Walker described the decision to reopen forest parks as ldquopremature and said Newry, Mourne and Down Council deserved praise for keeping all its country parks closed for the time being.He added: ldquoThe closure decision is being kept under review and I believe that there is still some way to go before council-owned parks will be open to the public.ldquoThere will be people upset that Delamont remains closed, but we all have to adhere to the public advice we have been given in relation to social distancing and, where possible, to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.Cllr Curran said he supports the decision to keep Delamont closed and praised what he described as the local authorityrsquos ldquocourageous decision.He argued that the big danger with warmer weather and clearer evenings now here is that reopening the country park could lead to a major influx of visitors and that enforcing social distancing measures would be particularly dficult,not impossible.ldquoThere was perhaps a temptation to reopen Delamont given the decision to allow people to access Tollymore and Castlewellan forest parks, but the local council has stood firm, putting the safety of people front and centre and is to be applauded for doing so, said Cllr Curran.ldquoErring on the side of caution is the right thing to do at this time. It would be an awful situation to reopen the park and for someone to contract coronavirus as a result. The park will reopen at some stage, but not just now. Peoplersquos health and safety must come first.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman said despite the decision by Mr Poots to reopen parks managed by the Forest Service all those that the local authority is responsible for, including Delamont, will remain closed.Council officials say that the decision to close Delamont taken on March  remains in place for the time being, but will be reviewed as public health advice guidance develops.ldquoMembers decided that it was too soon to consider reopening parks at this time, said a council spokesman.In addition, he said it was felt that reopening local authority-owned country park would encourageresidents from outside the district to make a non-essential journey to these facilities for exercise, thus increasing the volume of traffic and congestion at these locations and increasing the risk of further spread of COVID- across the district.ldquoThe focus of the council at this time must be the safety of our citizens and implementing measures to reduce the spread of the virus, said the spokesman.ldquoThe council continues to advise our citizens that the single most important action they can take is to stay at home in order to protect the NHS and save lives..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Doreen.jpg","title":"Doreen to step down after 20 years as leader at Leitrim playgroup  ","story":"A LEITRIM woman, who has been the driving force behind a local playgroup for almost  years, is stepping down.Doreen Shahmohammadi is a familiar face around the village, especially to young people as the leader of Leitrim Community Playgroup.Doreen, her Iranian husband, Reza, and twin sons, Michael and Colm, settled in Leitrim a few years before she began the playgroup in January . She soon experienced a strong sense of community and friendship that has kept them there ever since.She started the playgroup with the support of the local GAA club, Liatroim Fontenoys, which offered her use of their premises to begin with.ldquoIn the first year we went from having five children to  children, she said. ldquoWe had no funding in the first year, but the Fontenoys were very good to us by covering the cost of heating and telephone charges.ldquoBy the second year funding was made available by the Southern Education and Library Board for  pre-school places and it wasnrsquot long before we secured funding to build a purpose-built playgroup which sits within the boundary of the Fontenoys club.ldquoWithin a few years and thanks to additional funding enrolment rose to  places. Depending on the birth rate it has usually remains around the same number each year.Doreen loves to have children around her. In fact, Reza reminds her all the time that she is a magnet in attracting them wherever she goes.Doreen is a very proud mother. Her sons, now , graduated as doctors five years ago and both are working on the frontline during the COVID- pandemic. Colm is working in intensive care, while Michael works between cardiology and intensive care.ldquoOver the years, I have loved, cared for and educated every child that has come to the playgroup as though they were my own children, he says.ldquoI am going to miss them all very much, more than you can ever imagine. I hope Irsquom not to be a stranger to the playgroup after my retirement.Doreen says the current playgroup team, made up of deputy leader Michelle McCabe and temporary assistant, Danielle Clarke, have worked well together over the past few years. Other long term members of staff were Janet King, Tina Owens and Diane Baxter.ldquoThe playgroup has been my le and I have enjoyed welcoming hundreds of children to their pre-school year experience. It is a lovely learning environment to be part of, she continued.ldquoWe are blessed with the children and their families in the community who have entered our setting and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the staff and committees past and present, children, grandparents, childminders and, of course, the wider community who have supported me and who have been so generous over the years.ldquoMost of all, I would like to thank the trustees who have supported me for all these years and provided me with the opportunity to establish an excellent learning environment for pre-school children, not forgetting my sincere thanks to the Fontenoys for all their support and encouragement.She added: ldquoI wish my successor every success and I hope they will enjoy and appreciate every single minute they spend with the children as I have done..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Life.jpg","title":"Ex Drumaness man praises Kiwis as country comes out of lockdown  ","story":"A FORMER Drumaness man who has been living in New Zealand for the past  years has this week revealed what le in lockdown has been like Down Under.Barry Brennanrsquos adopted homeland has been praised for its response to the coronavirus pandemic, with the country this week emerging from a strict five-week quarantine which included the strictest constraints paced on New Zealanders in modern history.The countryrsquos prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, hailed New Zealanders for their incredible work to ldquobreak the virusrsquos chain of transmission which has allowed the country to downgrade its highest alert level from four to three, with amendedrestrictions expected to be in place for around two more weeks.The move means that many shops have reopened while public gatherings of  people are now permissible for weddings and funerals, with schools also set to reopen. In addition, Kiwis can now fish, hunt, surf, swim and play golf.New Zealand has suffered only , confirmed coronavirus cases and  deaths after moving quickly to impose a lockdown last month, with the easing of quarantine measures paving the way for around , people toto work under a more relaxed regime.Barry mdash who specialises in home renovations and employs several people mdash has not ed to work yet, but is more than happy in the idyllic rural setting of Mangawhai in the North Island just five minutes from the beach, where he lives with his we, Sian, and children Sean, Danny and Liam.The New Zealand government is still asking citizens to stay at home and to practise social distancing, with Barry hoping that it wonrsquot be long before the country again enjoys some sense of normality.And he has the praised prime minister for her approach to COVID-, with Arden arguing that a drastic short-term action would benefit the countryrsquos economy in the long run.On Monday, it was confirmed that there is no widespread underlying community transmission in New Zealand, with Ms Arden warning that the country was not yet out of the woods.ldquoWhen you look at what happened where in the world in relation to coronavirus, the prime minister did a good job, said Barry, who headed to New Zealand with his friend Barry Armstrong in .ldquoI was a qualied carpenter and Barry, who lived just up the road from me, was a bricklayer who had a contact in New Zealand so we headed off on a -month visa to Auckland. Barry stayed for  months before heading home but I am still here, married with three boys.ldquoThe coronavirus has had a worldwide impact and while many people were wondering what would happen in New Zealand, I always had a feeling that the prime minister would go at the pandemic hard and fast and that is exactly what she did.Barry revealed that New Zealanders were told to prepare for lockdown on March  and that two days later a series of strict measures were introduced.ldquoClearly the prime minister had a look at what was happening in other parts of the world before the virus got a hold here and she moved to minimise its impact. I think that she has done an amazing job to be quite honest.ldquoFour and a half weeks after the lockdown measures were implemented, there was only one confirmed coronavirus case in New Zealand at the start of this week. Indeed, the government knows exactly where every case is in the country.Barry said anyone arriving in the country and is suspected of having the virus is quarantined and believes thatthere was ever to be another pandemic in the future, countries would do well to take a close look at what New Zealand did to halt its deadly spread.ldquoEverything really happened so fast here and we did not have that much time to think about what was going in, he continued.ldquoI played golf with the principal of the school my youngest boy attends and he said he did not think NewZealand would go into lockdown. Forty eight hours later we were told it was happening.Barry said the country rightly decided that it wasnrsquot taking any chances and locked everything down, apart from supermarkets, with strict social distancing rules in place.ldquoWe have gone from a level four alert to level three but I am still not back at work as there a lot of iables that I need to consider, explained the former Drumaness man. ldquoIn my line of work I would be close to homeowners so I will just wait until the restrictions ease a bit more.Barry relocated from Auckland to Mangawhai six years ago and home is now a three and a half acre plot where he built a shooting gallery and what he describes as a ldquobit of a golf course. He also looks after a few animals.With no immediateto work on the horizon, Barry is keeping busy mowing lawns and feeding his animals, with a little help from his sons.With his parents, Sean and Mary, still living at the family home at the Cumber Road in Drumaness, Barry says he is in regular contact with them. He said his dad is good with Whatsapp and regularly tells him that New Zealand lamb is cheaper in Ireland than down under.ldquoWe have lots of contact with my parents and are in touch once or twice a week. I also have an older brother, Seamus who lives in Auckland. We both played for Loughinisland GAC. I also keep up-to-date with what is going there via social media and stuff, he continued.ldquoMy brother, Mark, is a former Loughinisland club chairman who was involved in the plans for building the new clubhouse. I also keep tabs on Down GAArsquos fortunes.As Barry waits for the right time toto work, he said that during the lockdown, New Zealanders mostly did what they were told.He added: ldquoThey were sensible and the approach has worked as things are slowly ing to normal, but we know that we have a little way to go yet..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C April 29%2C 1980  ","story":"NEWCASTLE ndash A new library for Newcastle is to be given priority soon by the South Eastern Education Board, it was claimed this week.The claim came from Castlewellan councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, a Board member, who said she believed that Board members realised they had made a bad mistake and are now prepared to reverse their attitude.Mrs Smyth, addressing a meeting of Down councillors on Monday, explained that she had recently asked the Board for an undertaking that the Newcastle Library project would be given a priority rating for new capital schemes.ldquoI think the whole Board realised they made a bad mistake and they are quite willing to go ahead and get something done quickly, said Mrs Smyth.Mrs Smyth made her surprise announcement after Newcastle councillor Mr Paddy OrsquoDonoghue attacked the Boardrsquos attitude over a new library for the seaside town.Mr OrsquoDonoghue claimed that an original Board decision to put Newcastle on a low priority rating was taken without consulting the Boardrsquos chief librarian who was in favour of early attention for Newcastle.He called the lack of consultation and criticised the Board for not responding fully to points raised by a council deputation several months ago.BALLYNAHINCH ndash Ballynahinch Chamber of Commerce is beginning to draw up plans for another trade week ndash and such was the success of the last venture that itrsquos been decided to extend this yearrsquos event to ten days.The dates being set aside for the trade week are Thursday, June th to Saturday, June st, and it is hoped that the townrsquos traders will offer many bargains to help attract business.Last yearrsquos trade week was a major success and most businesses in the town have reaped the benefit since. New customers were attracted to the town and quality goods and competitive prices have encouraged many toon a regular basis.The growing stature of the town as a shopping centre has been helped by the introduction of new shops, particularly in the Dromore Street area, and by the good car parking facilities on offer.Market Day every Thursday brings hundreds of people from the surrounding district flooding into the town ndash and with two Market Days cropping up in the new extended trade week this year, the Chamber is hopeful that shopping will hit a new peak in June.QUOILE ndash A concerted effort is being made by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Down District Council to make the -mile stretch of the Quoile River into a fishing paradise.Regarded as one of the best fishing waters in the province, the Quoile is hardly known nationally, and itrsquos the aim of the Tourist Board and the council to make it as popular as the Fermanagh Lakelands, the current number one fishing haven.The joint effort to put the Quoile on the fishing map is being spearheaded by Ian Heaps, the former inidual world champion angler and current member of the English international team, who has been carrying out a survey over the past ten days.And his report could influence the Tourist Board to pump more money into publicising the Quoile to world-wide anglers.Already Heaps has spent ten days fishing the Quoile and its ancillary waters ndash and his expert opinion is that itrsquos one of the best that Northern Ireland has to offer.KILLYLEAGH ndash The Vikings ed to invade Killyleagh this week ndash but this time it was a more peaceful visit.The invaders, instead of arriving by longship to pillage and plunder, came to look over youth provision in the area and they left totally impressed by the friendly reception they received.The unlikely invaders were a group of youth workers from Norway and Spain, who visited the area as part of a five-day study of youth work and facilities in the province.Local stops were at the Seaboard Sailing Centre in Killyleagh, Ardnabannon Outdoor Pursuits Centre in Castlewellan and Downpatrick Folk Club.Tuesday afternoon and night was spent in the area, with the first stop for the Norwegians being at the Seaboard centre.STRANGFORD ndash The recently formed Strangford Village Improvement Committee is to seek public support to have an order enforcing the one-way system in the village revoked.The committee discussed the system at their monthly meeting on Thursday and, after hearing of the failure of a meeting between the Department of Environment officials, traffic police and RUC representatives to have something done about it, they decided that the support of the public is needed.The committee chairman told members that the top level meeting had fallen on deaf ears and that nothing could be done about the situation.They had discussed the possibility of altering the system, the ious proposals which the committee had made as alternatives to it, and the fact that the majority of residents did not want the system.Unfortunately the Department rejected all the committeersquos proposals and insisted that the system, in its present form, would have to remain, said the chairman.The chairman had askedthe one-way system would not be made permanent until all attempts to accommodate the residentrsquos wishes had been made but the Department replied that the systemis already permanentand had been made so by Government order. Nothing could be done about it unless the order was revoked.KILLINCHY ndash The st Killinchy Company of the Boys Brigade held its th annual display in the Church Hall on Friday evening.Chairman for the evening was the Rev R A McKee, the inspecting officer was Mr C T Johnston, of st Cargycreevy, and the presentation of prizes was made by Mrs M Moles.The company gave the usual high standard display, with a ied programme of drill, games and sketches, before captain, Raymond Finlay, gave his annual report.Three boys received their Queens Badges, the highest award in the BB, namely Alistair Davidson, Robin Thompson and Samuel Dines.Three had also received their presidentrsquos badges, namely Bill Dunlop, Wesley Blythe and Andrew Bishop, and four had received their Duke of Edinburgh bronze awards, namely David Morrow, Mark Davidson, Robin Thompson and Robert McBurney.DOWNPATRICK ndash A breathtaking two-hour pageant is being drawn up as the centrepiece of this yearrsquos St Patrickrsquos Festival in Downpatrick.An outdoor site has already been chosen and plans are well advanced to produce a startling display of battle scenes, comedy scenes, music and games.And to show they mean business the organisers have appointed one of the countryrsquos leading stage producers, Mr Michael Poynor, to act as a full-time director.The site, which is near the Quoile, will resemble a giant film set with authentic costumes and props depicting the time of the earliest settlers in Lecale to the arrival of the Normans.CASTLEWELLAN ndash Kilmegan Youth Club, Castlewellan, triumphed in the final of the South Eastern Education and Library Board Youth Club quiz held in Downpatrick on Monday night.

The online sales are set to continue as marts across the province begin to reopen.Cllr Lewis said the marts have a crucial role to play, allowing farmers to buy and sell livestock, at what is a traditionally a busy time of the year for them. Crucially, he said reopening marts will help with their respective incomes.He said there was ldquosignicant concern when the marts closed last month, with farmers expressing concern that they could find themselves overstocked with animals, particularly store cattle and ped calves.ldquoNews of the gradual reopening of local marts is an important development and will be widely welcomed across the agricultural sector at this time, said Cllr Lewis.The Slieve Croob councillor said DAERA was to be applauded for its decision, particularly given the key role farmers play in supplying the local food chain.ldquoIt is essential that in these uncertain times that farm production continues and that the local supply chain of quality food products can be available to the public, he continued.ldquoAt this time of year, many farmers are seeking to purchase stock for the grazing season and obviously others are selling their stock through the marts. Dairy farms will also find themselves overstocked with dropped calves that they would normally be selling.Cllr Lewis said there were farmers wishing to sell and buy livestock and it was ldquovital in these uncertain times that farm production continues and that the local supply chain of quality food products can be available to the public.A DAERA spokesman said farmers were key workers and were continuing to provide food for everyone in ldquovery challenging circumstances with part of the food supply chain the ability to trade and sell animals.ldquoStaff within the department have maintained regular contact with livestock mart operators over recent weeks and have been reassured that robust operational protocols, developed by the marts in conjunction with other stakeholders, will enable them to conduct business in a manner that is safe for staff, farmers and buyers and adheres to social distancing requirements, he continued.ldquoFarmers, like all businesses, are facing financial dficulties as a result of COVID-. Being able to trade again at the marts will provide much needed cash flow..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd April 2020 Into.jpg","title":"Into the Blues   Jake signs pro contract with Linfield  ","story":"A TEENAGE local footballer says hersquos ldquoover the moon after signing professional terms with Linfield.Eighteen year-old Jake Corbett, from Dromara, has signed his first professional contract with the Blues after some stellar performances for Linfield Swts.The exciting young player has scored around  goals this season, despite playing in midfield.And he also helped the Swts lt the Steel  Sons Cup as they beat Newington - in the Christmas Day showdown.Jake, who joined the Windsor Park outfit three years ago, has been football mad since the age of ten.He played youth football for Dromore Amateurs, then broke his way into the clubrsquos first team and played in the Amateur League.After spells with Banbridge Town, Lisburn Distillery and Crusaders he joined Linfield at the age of .An attacking central midfielder, he made an immediate impact and firmly established himself in the Swts set-up.His prowess has also earned international honours.

In many ways, itrsquos strange to think that by staying home I can save a le.My sister, Martina, loved le, but she was only  when she passed away in . Seasonal flu was the culprit which overwhelmed her body. COVID- is a frightening virus for the world to contend with. But it is especially frightening for people like me.Martina and I were born with spinal muscular atrophy , a genetic muscle wasting condition which robs people of the ability to walk, eat and breathe.I now live an active, productive le, thanks to many interventions that started in my childhood. I had a tube ed into my stomach to ensure that I could get the nutrients I could no longer eat as half of the muscles I use to swallow became paralysed. I also began using a non-invasive ventilator.COVID- has been on our radar since the beginning of January. I could do little but watch and wait. The plans would not be much dferent than my usual flu-time plans which ensure that I am in protective bubble, which allows my family to do everything it can to maintain an infection-free environment around me.Sure enough, almost  days ago, it was time to take action, with the Hollywood lockdown coming almost two weeks before it was implemented for everyone . And within a few days of the official lockdown beginning, I was also furloughed from work at a leading charity for people with conditions like mine.This has been one of the most emotionally and mentally dficult parts of the pandemic for me personally. Since I was  I have been working with and for this charity to improve lives. But within a few short days my le had drastically changed.Last September, I took eight flights in three weeks as I was selected for an Emerging Leaders programme by the US State Department for my work with disabled people and for a national conference for people with conditions like mine in London.Now, I have to stay within the bounds of my driveway. I can only go outside because my neighbours are all so far away. A small mercy.It quickly became obvious that getting food and other essential supplies was not going to be easy. Large supermarkets only started offering registration to extremely vulnerable customers a few weeks in to the lockdown.Before lockdown began few,any supermarkets offered a dedicated shopping time to extremely vulnerable customers, making getting food dficult during a time when it was flying off the shelves in panic buying.Crossgarrsquos SuperValu store got us through those first few weeks as it was able to deliver some essentials, while Gordons Pharmacy in Downpatrick has been delivering to us for some time now. But the pharmacyrsquos willingness to collect our preions has been a huge weight off our shoulders.I have now been able to register the family with Sainsburyrsquos for deliveries of other items we need to keep us ticking over, while Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos food delivery package service has been much more successful than those in other parts of the UK.The one that we have received included food that I could eat ndash something many of my friends in the rest of the UK are not so lucky with. The parcel is one small, yet very important part of the support our government is offering that it has got right, even though it has only been in place for us for three weeks.It took us several weeks to set up everything we needed, but I know that many others are still trying and are having to take drastic, le-endangering measures to keep it going.However, COVID- is not just a negative in the lives of disabled people.Virtual concerts, musicals on YouTube for all and even online quiz nights have become the new normal of socialising.Many jobs and educational institutions have moved staff to work from home and online, something that some disabled people were often refused when they asked for it. Even the community spirit and volunteering has left us feeling overwhelmed with offers of help.It is my hope that we can use this opportunity to see what our future can be.A more accepting and inclusive society, where disabled people can fully take part.

Unfortunately after all of the hard work of labour, I had to have a C-section and James Patrick was born at .pm on Tuesday. Ryan was allowed into the recovery room with me for two hours, but after that he didnrsquot see me or the baby until Thursday afternoon when we were allowed home.Prospective parents have been told that only one birth partner is currently allowed into the delivery ward, but onlythey are well and show no signs of coronavirus.Mrs Lawlor said: ldquoApart from the labour and the C-section, it was a positive experience. I think I was more anxious in the days coming up to the birth as I didnrsquot know what the restrictions would mean. In hindsight, it wasnrsquot that bad and it was probably worse for Ryan sitting at home. He rang his sister who has four children and asked when she thought he could do and she said clean the house.Baby James Patrick was only one day overdue, but Mrs Lawlor was delighted that he decided to make an appearance when he did. A clue to his birth weight may be due to his mother being ft  inches tall, while dad Ryanis ft  inches.While Mrs Lawlor did not have to wear a face mask during her labour, but the midwives who attended her afterwards were masked.She said: ldquoI suppose as this was an all-new experience for both Ryan and I we have nothing to compare it to.ldquoI remember waking up the next day, not that I slept that much in the night, and thought, lsquoOh no, I have a whole day by myself in here with this brand new babyrsquo. But the nurses and midwives are coming that often to do a iety of checks that the days went quite fast.ldquoHowever, I remember that I felt the second night in hospital was awfully long and I really struggled with dealing with James. Normally,you have a bit of help during the day and night, you can manage better to get a bit of sleep.ldquoThe strangest thing was seeing quite a few of the staff with masks and visors on. While they were all lovely, you lost a bit of the personal touch and connection with them because of the masks. Sometimesthey were maintaining social distancing and werenrsquot close to you, you couldnrsquot actually see who it was. The staff were all wonderful but you didnrsquot know what they looked like.As a sportswoman, who used to play for Loughinisland GACrsquos senior ladies and at county level, Mrs Lawlor is recovering well after the birth. Her husband is also well-known in local sporting circles as hersquos on the executive committee of Loughinisland GAC.They are becoming accustomed to the lsquonewrsquo normal at home of being first-time parents amid the lockdown.Mrs Lawlor said: ldquoWe have had visitors to the house looking through the window at the baby. Itrsquos still hard for everyone as my sister is itching to get a wee cuddle and all our family members want to hold him. That canrsquot happen for very good reasons and I donrsquot know when that will change. Thatrsquos one of the strange things about having a baby in the lockdown.ldquoHowever, the simplicity of le today is quite nice. I think itrsquos possibly the best time to have a baby. We have plenty to keep ourselves busy with James Patrick in the lockdown and therersquos nothing  to distract us.

In a glittering playing career, the Ballykinlar man went on to win two more All-Ireland medals and established himself as one of the legends of the Gaelic football. Here, he selects his greatest Down team of all timeHIS name alone is enough to rekindle treasured memories of a time when Down football reigned supreme.Paddy lsquoMorsquo Doherty had the deadliest left foot in Ireland and he used it to maximum effect as Down swept all before them.Incredibly, itrsquos  years ago that Down took the sporting world by storm when they defeated Kerry to win the All-Ireland senior football title for the first time. It was also the first time that a team north of the border had won the Sam Maguire Cup.To reinforce their emergence as a new power in Gaelic football, Down retained their title the following year with Paddy as captain of the side which defeated Offaly and he was also a member of the Down team which won a third All-Ireland for the county in , Kerry again falling victim to the Red and Black machine in the final.As well as his three All-Ireland medals, Paddy won seven Ulster Championship, seven Railway Cup and three National League medals. He was the leading scorer in Ulster for eight seasons and in Ireland for three years.Now in his s, hersquos followed Downrsquos fluctuating fortunes ever since, relishing in theof the glory days in the early s, sharing in the disappointment of the barren times and casting a critical eye from the sidelines, though always with the optimistic outlook of the true fan.So what does he believe is the greatest Down team of all time Not surprisingly, given their accomplishments, hersquos largely selected his choice from his team-mates from the Sixties mdash though with typical modesty, he has not picked himself for the starting .ldquoYou have to remember that the Down team of s was the first to bring the Sam Maguire over the border, he says.ldquoThat was a really big achievement and we had beaten Kerry in the final. We had shown we were the best team in Ireland and we proved that again the following year in the final against Offaly after beating Kerry in the semi-final. We also beat Kerry in the  final, which meant that we had beaten them three times.ldquoKerry have always been the benchmark. If we had not beaten them, they would have won another three All-Irelands.Asked how his Down team would fare against present day sides ldquoItrsquos a dferent game now, what with the blanket defence and other things, but the Down teams of the s would have won in any era. Well, thatrsquos what I think, though Irsquom sure there are many people who would disagree. Eddie McKay Eddie won two All-Ireland medals with me in  and . He was a very good goalkeeper believe me, always safe, dependable and brave. He was an excellent shot stopper and made many excellent saves. I also played against him many times when Ballykinlar took on Dundrum. These were local parish derbies and everyone was trying to kill each other, but somehow Dundrum never managed to beat us. George Lavery George also won two All-Irelands in  and . He was the quiet man on the team, but there were few better man markers in the game and he would have been a star in any era. He had played a match of two for Antrim, but Maurice Hayes, who was secretary of the Down county board, persuaded him to sign for Down. He played as sweeper and was a good, tight marker. Leo Murphy Leo was a terric full back, tough and reliable. Not too many players could get past him and he could kick the ball a long distance. He also won two All-Irelands in  and . Pat Rice There was no one better than Pat Rice at catching a ball. His high fielding was magnicent and he was quick at clearing the ball. He gave away few chances and often kicked the ball out for Eddie McKay. He missed little and he wasnrsquot a dirty player at all. Dan McCartan One of only three Down players to win three All-Ireland senior medals along with Sean OrsquoNeill, Joe Lennon and myself, Dan is one of the all-time greats of Down football. He had outstanding ability, tackled hard and always looked for the quick clearance up to the front men. He could play anywhere as he showed when he moved to full back in the  final. Joe Lennon He was our captain in , though he did not play in the second after getting injured. He was a great captain and a terric leader. Joe placed a great emphasis on fitness and pioneered new coaching practices. He thought greatly about the game and was possibly ahead of his time. He was a very talented player. Tom OrsquoHare Tom played in the  team, but was good enough to get his place on any team. He was probably one of our best players that year. He was always steady and was great at delivering a ground ball. Jarlath Carey Jarlath won two All-Irelands in  and . He was a tireless worker, who was at home either in midfield or in attack. He was always forcing his way into the forward line and would wag his finger at me to go back into midfield to cover for him. I didnrsquot mind one bit, because he was good enough and I was fit enough to do what he asked. Colm McAlarney They called Colm lsquoThe Mighty Arklersquo after the famous racehorse because of his long strides up the field. Colm and Tom OrsquoHare were our two outstanding players in  and Colm was definitely one of the best midfielders in Ireland at that time, or any other time. Tony Hadden Tony won two All-Irelands in  and . He could fist the ball further than many players could kick it and he could also move into midfieldthings were going bad. He was tall and well built and could score a point as well as anyone. James McCartan A very strong player. Down would not have won anything without him because he took a lot of the abuse which would otherwise have been directed at me or Sean OrsquoNeill. He played a critical role in the  final against Offaly. We were two goals down in the first half and getting beaten. I crossed the ball to James who turned in mid air and put into the back of the net. Two more goals from Sean OrsquoNeill and Breen Morgan had us a goal up at half time, but it was his goal that turned things around. Sean OrsquoNeill You would have to say that Sean was the greatest Down footballer of them all. He was named in the GAA Team of the Century which says it all. We played well together, wherever I kicked the ball, Sean was there to get it. He had a wonderful sidestep and took a lot of abuse, but he never retaliated. He went on to become a successful manager and won the Sigerson Cup with Queenrsquos University. Mickey Linden Mickey was a flying machine and one of Downrsquos best ever forwards. He could blow defences away with his pace and score with either foot. He was also very versatile. You could play him anywhere and he would still be a threat. Perhaps his only failing was that he was too nice a player. He rarely made a foul. Won two All-Irelands in  and . Patsy OrsquoHagan Full forward and winner of two All-Irelands in  and . He could have played full forward, full back, or just about anywhere . He was that good. One of his best performances was Wembley Stadium during one of the Wembley Cup tournaments when he scored four goals against Galway. Breen Morgan They made them tough in Annaclone and for his size Breen was one of the hardest men on the field. He had broken his jaw before the  All-Ireland final, but went to the field without the protector which was made specially for him. He just threw it on to a chair. He was marked by Offalyrsquos Paddy McCormick, who was made of iron, but Breen was afraid of no one.Paddyrsquos substitutesDanny Kelly , Greg Blaney , Barry Breen , James Milligan , Ross Carr , Paddy OrsquoRourke , DJ Kane , Dan Gordon , Benny Coulter , Paddy Doherty ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Ciara.jpg","title":"Portaferry athlete takes lockdown in her stride  ","story":"CIARA Mageeanrsquos Olympic ambitions may have been put on hold owing to coronavirus, but shersquos taking the lockdown in her stride mdash almost.The  year-old Portaferry runner, who is currently holed up in Manchester, says the current restrictions arenrsquot that far removed from her normal training regime.Even so, she says there are days when she does not want to run and she also misses her family and friends back at home.ldquoWersquore all struggling mdash therersquos days I donrsquot even want to go out and run now, and that the thing I have to do and the thingI always look forward to, she said.ldquoTherersquos days Irsquove cried and been like, lsquoWhat the hell is this rsquo Irsquove chatted to my team-mates about that and you justhave to find little methods ad mechanisms to try and help yourself.Last Thursday, Ciara was one of a number of leading sportsmen and women at the virtual launch of Sport NIrsquos Wellbeing Hub in response to the COVID- challengeThe hub provides instant access to helpful information, guidance and screening that is tailored specically to help care for wellbeing needs.It offers a range of innovative tools and resources, including guided self-assessment via lsquoChatbotrsquo, self-help programmes and digital intervention tools, a searchable five ways to wellbeingrsquo map and a wellbeing information library.Ciara said: ldquoOur mental health is so vital and right now is a challenging time for all of us.A full-time athlete and a member of Team New Balance, Ciara lives in Manchester in the same house with fellow athletes Jip Vastenburg and Adam Craig.

I do know my limits though so I stay away from the plumbing... luckily in Portaferry my dad has a lot of friends who are alsotradesmen so they all help each other out.Q Have you a favourite pre-training meal to help you through a tough session A We usually train in the morning so I tend to eat an OTE DuoBar, the vanilla flavour in my favourite, and a cup of tea.

My le is basically train, eat, sleep. For me therersquos a few things I enjoy. I love chatting with my family, Irsquom usually on WhatsApp most of the day chatting or messaging and keeping in touch. I also love arts and crafts, Irsquoll be making postcards to post to my boyfriend and siblings to make them laugh, and currently my little cousin is teaching me the guitar via WhatsApp. She is a tough taskmaster, I have a lesson every Thursday and Monday and homework in between so that keeps me busy Q Have you any tips for training at home A Set yourself some goals that you can realistically achieve from home. We are allowed out for our daily exercise so you can get some cardio in outside, find a route that works for you and follow the guidelines. When it comes to working out inside, have fun. Find new alternatives, there are so many exercises we can do with body weight, or with stuff we have about the house so be creative and have a bit of craic. If you need any ideas check out social media, so many people are sharing home workouts. Give yourself a plan or schedule and try to stick to it. Being home means we can fall into the habit of sitting about and it can be hard to feel motivated. At the beginning of each week set out your plan for the week, what day, what time, and what exercise. Write it down and stick it somewhere you can see. Creating a routineduring these strange times means we can take back a little control.Q Name one documentary you want to see.A Anything with David Attenborough, I absolutely love animals and nature, and could listen to his voice all day.Q Have you discovered any new music or podcasts A My music taste is so ied but my wee sis and cousin Tara introduced me to Beoga and I absolutely love it. A lad from my hometown, Ryan McMullan also features in some of their songs, always a nice surprise hearing a weePortaferry accent as Irsquom listening.Q Is there one piece of housework you can no longer avoid A My own room! I actually enjoy housework, everywhere but my own bedroom. Irsquoll clean all day but canrsquot be bothered with my own mess!Q Favourite room of the house to spend time in A We are lucky that the Team NB Manchester athlete house is lovely and has lots of space so my favourite room ies depending in the time of day. In the morning my bedroom gets lovely light, it makes me smile sitting there chilling. Then when I want a bit of company the front room or kitchen is where we chill as a team and have the craic... andthe sun shines, which it does on the odd occasion over here, we have a lovely garden.Both Jip and Adam are enjoying learning how to puck about with my hurl..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Railway.jpg","title":"Railway vandals condemned  ","story":"VANDALS have struck at the heritage steam railway in Downpatrick.The window of a railway carriage was smashed with a concrete block some time over the weekend.The damage was discovered by a volunteer at the Downpatrick and County Down Railway premises on Monday morning.Part of a concrete block was found inside the carriage along with evidence that the vandals had been smoking.

The reality is we will look at the medical evidence. The Northern Ireland Executive will have its own flexibility and we may see across the country some iations we saw some iations going into lockdown as well. Itrsquoll be a decision that all four nations take together based on the evidence, he said.Mr. Lewis said he was aware of the complexities of Northern Irelandrsquos Border with the Republic of Ireland amid the pandemic, explaining that he has been meeting with First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle OrsquoNeill and Taacutenaiste Simon Coveney.ldquoEven where there are dferences in the approach between the Republic and the North,there are,we know that we can make sure we are clear with residents why those dferences are there.ldquoThe challenge of having iations within Northern Ireland is how we manage that.An investigation in The Sunday Times at the weekend featured a Whitehall source claiming the government ldquomissed the boat on testing and PPEand ldquojust watched as the death toll mounted in Wuhan, China.The report also claimed that Prime Minister Boris Johnson missed five crucial COBRA meetings in the Cabinet Office in London.When asked to respond to these serious allegations, Mr. Lewis said: ldquoI didnrsquot recognise some of what I saw in the Times.ldquoI was in the Cobra meetings in January and February COBRA meetings are chaired by the Secretary of State in the Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms. Itrsquos a place, not a thing.ldquoWe were making decisions the scientists and medical experts were making decisions at that time and planning was going on. This is the point to judge it now when we have two months more evidence is dangerous and a misleading thing to do.Turning to PPE which has been an issue in Fermanagh, Mr. Lewis used his own constituency of Great Yarmouth as an example of where there has been ldquono problems with accessing equipment.He added: ldquoWersquove had gowns sent over to the UK, OrsquoNeills [sportswear] converted to gowns, there is gin distillery in your part of the world producing sanitisers.ldquoWersquore shting five and a half million pieces of PPE across to Northern Ireland. Wersquove been able to supply that itrsquos in good order. I am talking to the first minster every day that.Mr. Lewis said the priority of the United Kingdom government is to make sure ldquowe donrsquot hit the second peak of the virus.ldquoOne of the most damaging things economically would be, as well as health wise, to start coming out of lockdown ndash restaurants, pubs, whatever start opening again ndash and suddenly you have to close down again and thatrsquos not viable.ldquoI think itrsquos right to be cautious about this wersquoll make that decision in a few weeks.ldquoThe science is shting on this the experience is changing. I am cautious about predicting what will be in a few weeksrsquo time.He believes the government could ldquoflatten the curve of Covid-people continue to stay at home, adding: ldquoWe want to see past the peak, you donrsquot want to see a downward trend and ease up as all you do is let it shoot back up again.ldquoIf you think back to the beginning there were some quite scary numbers being put about by some experts about what the deaths might be. Now any death is too many and we have sadly lost people, friends and family who have gone through tragic experiences recently, and the figures are nowhere near those numbers we saw at the beginning.ldquoThatrsquos because the public across Northern Ireland and the UK have done a good job generally of following the guidelines which means we can flatten that curve, he said.Mr. Lewis explained that he had personal experience of people close to him who had been diagnosed with Covid-, including his parliamentary private secretary.ldquoSomeone I know lost a member of their family this week, I have a few people in family who had the disease.

There is a transition period where you are not really the Archbishop of Armagh but you want to be as helpful as you can and you are also I suppose trying to work out what and how you are going to approach the task.The Archbishop-Elect explained the three facets to the roleHe said there was the appointment of Bishop of the Diocese of Armagh, which has a larger population with a great number of large towns in it than Clogher Diocese.In addition, there is the role of Primacy of All Ireland, considered lsquoFirst among equalsrsquo acknowledging there is another Primate in the southern province but to some degree to be an ambassador for the Church of Ireland.He added: ldquoThe third element is your place within the wider Anglican Communion which I have relatively little experience of. You become a member of the Primatersquos Meeting which is one of the instruments of communion within Anglicanism. There are a number of ways we hold ourselves together, the Lambeth Conference, the office of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Anglican Consultative Council and more recently, the Primatersquos Meeting.So what type of church do you see under your leadership ldquoItrsquos dficult to speak for the church as the Church of Ireland General Synod is the body which has that authority. There is a saying that the Church of Ireland is synodically governed and episcopally led. What the Archbishop of Armagh can do is to speak to the Church and suggest can concern itself with. It sets a bit of a tone as well. Itrsquos about its spiritual le and its own governance and the need to acknowledge that like probably all institutions and all bodies some bits of it do well and some do not do well some bits are growing and some bits are shrinking some bitsvery well and some bitsnot so well and to maybe try to discover that the bits that do not do well could do a bit better, in terms of spiritual le and acknowledging there is a huge ersity within Anglicanism and to remember that thatrsquos all part of the Anglican heritage.ldquoThere are obviously particularly challenges at the moment, what the church says to society and what it does for the society in which it is placed. You cannot pretend it doesnrsquot live in a political context. Politics is not something that just happens in Parliament. Democracies are places where political discussion or dialogue are about what we can do together or decisions which are deeply embedded. There are institutions which are recognisable bodies in civil society such as the business community, trade unions, voluntary sector and churches are one of those. I think they have their particular things to say and its perfectly legitimate for them to say it.ldquoThe big imponderable at the moment is coronavirus and we have no idea how deeply that will affect the patterns of society. We could come out the other side of that challenge a changed society, with maybe small changes and maybe some very profound changes. Of course the other big external issue is Brexit which involves the relationships between the dferent regions within Ireland and the United Kingdom.ldquoI could be in both parts of that jurisdiction in one day praying for good governance for both of them and for their leaders, he said.In terms of reaching out to people in the Church of Ireland, the Archbishop-Elect recalled how a Northern Ireland Le and Times survey revealed around  per cent of people in Northern Ireland attend church at some point. He said the heyday for attending church was in the period from the late th Century to the period to the middle of the s. But he thinks current attendance is ldquoback to the old norm with fewer people committed to regular churchgoing.He rightly points out that churches are among the very few inter-generational bodies with people of dferent ages attending.The Archdeacon-Elect says people in very small rural parishes are committed to their churches in the sense that they are contributing to their community who feel it is being enriched with their presence. He said the church finds its place in the community.ldquoThe second challenge is what we are for ourselves as a group, as a faith community, how we build up the church, which canrsquot live in isolation but we have our particular family traditions - how we contribute to the ersity of Ireland, how we build up the church to be confident communities of faith and not hesitant or fearful or invisible communities of faith.He said for the Church of Ireland, there was tremendous heritage from Anglicanism.ldquoThe Church of Ireland has a particular way of doing things, liturgically. Liturgy is both the expression and source of our belief. Our vocation may be to hold together what on the face of it appear to be contradictory things is maybe one of our roles in religious and spiritual le. I have no ideait is the best way to be a Christian but it is our way and it seems to contribute something to the catholic church, the wider church.ldquoHarry McAdoo, a well-known Archbishop of Dublin and a great scholar, once said, lsquoIf I hadnrsquot been born an Anglican, I would have had to become one.rsquoThe Archbishop-Elect leaves Clogher Diocese after forging and maintaining good relations with other denominations.He said: ldquoI think the vast majority of committed Christian people see more in common with other Christian traditions than separating us. There is a very long history of ecumenism in the diocese of Armagh as well. There is a long association and friendship with Archbishop Eamon Martin and I hope we can continue to build relationships and friendships.The Archbishop-Elect trained for Church of Ireland ministry after a career in industry in which he held a senior role in Shorts and was for a time, Assistant Director of the CBI in Northern Ireland.ldquoThat probably give me some skills in organisation and about leadership. Irsquove been very lucky here. Irsquom not very fond of the word lsquoleaderrsquo in the ecclesiastical world but one of the things a leader does is to build a team around him. It is almost a contradiction in terms to be involved in a leadership role in Christianity, to do it on your own.ldquoThere are certain things as a bishop that end with you. There are plenty of lonely moments in that sense where you have to make decisions. But by and large business acclimatised me to working with all sorts of dferent people from all sorts of dferent backgrounds in dferent ways and to experience what every parishioner experiences, normal working le with those pressures.As Bishop of Clogher the new Archbishop-Elect held a number of positions nationally and internationally representing the Church.He was the Church of Ireland contact person to the Churches of the Porvoo Communion which represents the Scandanavian and Baltic Lutherans as well as the Spanish and Portuguese Anglicans and other Anglican churches and provinces from these islands making contact at senior level travelling with them.He has also held senior roles on the Irish Council of Churches, the national ecumenical instrument and also the Irish Inter-Church meeting, the latter which includes the Roman Catholic church.He said those bodies were important especially as ecumenism was becoming bland and it was important to keep going and keep talking.These inter-church bodies contribute to providing resources for churches around Brexit, homelessness, welfare reform and subjects churches would be expected to have a voice in.ldquoI enjoyed that hugely, I am coming to the end of that, six years in total two years as vice-President, two years as President and two years as outgoing Vice President. I will be involved again as a member of the Church Leadersrsquo Meeting.The Archbishop-Elect says of his time in Clogher Diocese ldquoItrsquos always been an aim of mine wherever I have worked to try to create a family atmosphere where there are degrees of mutual respect and degrees of mutual accountability. I remember saying that the diocese of Clogher is big enough to do thingswe all pull together in the same direction and small enough for everybody to be necessary for that to happen and to be accountable for what the contribution is. If you treat people with respect, then relationships are easier.ldquoBy and large I felt people were for me rather than against me. It helpsyou are reasonably interested in people and their families and what they do and acknowledge that as an important factor in their faith. Whoever the next Bishop of Clogher is theyshould allow him or her to be his or her own bishop of Clogher and not that they should be like me, Brian Hannon or Michael Jackson or like St. Macartan.The Archbishop-Elect says he enjoys reading history and poetry and in terms of music, takes particular pleasure in the tradition of Anglican anthems . He does admit to particularly enjoying the Psalms which are poetry.The Archbishop-Elect acknowledges that his mother who had a profound influence on his le, reciting the Daily Office at home and was happily committed to God and His Church and would have sung the Te Deum while washing the dishes. One of her favourite biblical phrases was from the Gospel of St. John, Chapter  ldquoI come that you would have le and that you might have it more abundantly.Relaxation for the Archdeacon-Elect is visiting one of his favourite places, the Ulster Museum to see the collection of Irish Art and reading.ldquoThe thing I am looking to reading most is I took possession of the third volume of Hilary Mantelrsquos Wolf Hall trilogy about Thomas Cromwell, lsquoThe Mirror and Light,rsquo an historical novel, he adds.The Archbishop-Electrsquos we Mary teaches in Enniskillen Royal Grammar School and his daughter, Dorothy, is at the University of Oxford.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I recognised that one right away.Sandra Chapman column : JPIMedia \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...I like to think that family le in the wider sense in Northern Ireland is treasured. Being of the baby boomer generation I do remember – just about – those years after the World War Two when my mother’s greatest treasure was her ration books or a visit from a spinster aunt who brought the treats we couldn’t otherwise afford. My aunt, , may have longed for a family of her own but we never knew or asked why she hadn’t married. I wish she was around today because her attention to us taught me, even though I was very young, the value of close family connections and the fact that our parents weren’t the only ones who loved us.I have several nephews and nieces now and I’ve tried to be a caring aunt, but it’s been dficult since I was a full time working mum and had to concentrate on my own children whilst not at work. By the time my children had taken up careers in other countries I tried to concentrate on the nephews and nieces but time was still always against me and they too were scattered to the winds.I have had to wait to what I call my ageing period to make any inroads into my relationships with them and being able to see them even only occasionally is a pleasure. But not now, with this lockdown thwarting me all the way. Family visits are out of the question as my sister reminded me in the early lockdown days when I was sure the odd visit wouldn’t matter. I’ve been fully in lockdown now for what seems an age.I’m certain that is what has revived my old back pain, my occasional bouts of insomnia and has left me looking much older than I should. Definitely. You see it’s not entirely family I’m missing - it’s the hairdresser, the chiropodist, the dentist, the dog groomer , my friends who live near and far, going to the shops and the prospect of not being able to pay a visit to my children and grandchildren - all of whom live in Europe. Boat or plane, it doesn’t matter, neither is available to take me there and equally they can’t come here. I think loneliness may be setting in.Himself is showing signs of impatience – that’s not how I describe myself – because, at this time of year, he would be preparing his boat for the summer sailing season. It sits, alongside a few dozen other boats, wonderingit will get it’s bottom scrubbed and anti-fouled this year before being released into the water amidst cheers of ship-ahoy and back slapping from the launching team.Being deprived of this ritual as, at the time of writing, marinas and harbours throughout the United Kingdom and Ireland - north and south, are closed, is seriously bad for the old-salts brigade. All they can do is look out to sea and pray.We are well warned not to rush out of lockdown but a surprising number of people have run out of patience – not my generation I’m certain – with a sense of entitlement that puts everyone  at risk.One newspaper headline this week declared that ‘lockdown for a year would be a crippling economic blow’. The experts tell us it could cause a second ‘large and deadly peak’. Not attractive choices at all. We can do without those scenarios.Maybe it’s lethargy setting in, but I haven’t got round to ordering food on line as I’m happy enough with our corner shop, I’ll have to leave my hair to grow in its own unwieldly fashion and I don’t intend to fall out with the dog over grooming. The gypsy look will have to do.--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Amid myriad allegations against the DUP and evidence that huge sums were being paid to many claimants, the then DUP minister Simon Hamilton rushed through temporary cuts to the subsidy. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Those January  regulations were immediately taken to court by boiler owners. In autumn  they lost their challenge in the High Court and, more than two years later, their appeal has still not been heard.In the meantime and during the three-year governance vacuum at Stormont, civil servants in the Department for the Economywere left to find a long-term solution.They decided on far deeper cuts than Mr Hamilton, eviscerating what had once been ‘cash for ash’ and making it far less generous than comparable schemes in GB and the Republic.Unsurprisingly, few members of the public were outraged that what had once been an uncapped scheme paying a notional £, a year to the few people running their boilers around the clock had been cut to a maximum of £, by Mr Hamilton and now chopped down to £, – a % drop.But by this stage the stories of genuine claimants who had entered the scheme in good faith at the urging of Stormont had become too loud to be ignored entirely.As the hapless Secretary of State Karen Bradley – who had agreed to rush Stormont civil servants’ changes to the scheme through Westminster – brought the proposals before Parliament, there were awkward questions from MPs and peers.By then it was clear that this was not an attempt to address what had once been a huge overspend – instead, the cuts were so deep that they led to a massive underspend of the money available from the Treasury.Officials insisted that their hands were tied by EU State Aid rules and anything more generous would be illegal under EU law. Yet they had no coherent explanation as to why schemes in other parts of Europe remain jaw-droppingly more lucrative than what they claim is the absolute maximum subsidy.In a concession to the House of Lords, officials agreed thatWestminster would pass their cuts then they would bring in an independent figure to examinetheir actions had unfairly left claimants in financial distress.The man assigned that task was Andrew Buglass, an energy expert from England. For reasons which remain unclear, his report was only published on Wednesday – five months late.Its  pages of findings will have made deeply uncomfortable reading for DfE’s energy ision. Mr Buglass set out multiple examples of how their actions had led to iniduals – who entered the scheme at Stormont’s urging – not only failing to receive any real incentive, but instead suffering signicant hardship.At the heart of the problem is that civil servants and – infamously – the then minister Arlene Foster had given cast iron guarantees that the subsidy rate was unalterable for  years.On the back of those firmest of guarantees, huge loans were taken out to finance the installation of boilers. Many claimants remain deeply in debt – but suddenly found that the supposedly guaranteed income which would repay those loans had evaporated.Mr Buglass found that one claimant had liquidated their pension fund to keep the bank from the door, another had sold a home, another had sold land, others had taken out overdrafts to keep up their repayments – and there has also been a signicant impact on mental health.He said he had been told of “knock-on effects in relationships and families, with recriminations among family members or heated disagreements on what action should be taken as a result” and one man said that “his children had faced bullying in school” as a result of him being a claimant.The evidence which he has collated tallies with that which this newspaper has been reporting for two and a half years.Unquestionably, some of those who entered the scheme were chancers and there is prima facie evidence that some were crooks.But one of the striking things about Mr Buglass’s report is that it records – as I have heard from several claimants – that it is claimants themselves who are pressing for crooks to be found and prosecuted, something which DfE has been exceptionally slow to do.Mr Buglass’s work is doubly embarrassing for DfE’s civil servants because not only does it show that their actions have led to hardship, but it also disproves one of their key claims last year.At the time, DfE confidently said that those with RHI boilers would not revert to fossil fuels because wood pellets are the cheapest form of fuel and therefore it would not make sense.But Mr Buglass’s report – consistent with what this newspaper has reported from claimants and other industry sources – found that contrary to civil servants’ claims, a signicant percentage of RHI claimants to whom he spoke have either reverted to gas or are considering doing so, in many cases because they can bulk buy lpg gas through massive poultry processor Moy Park.Read in context with everything  which we now know about RHI, Mr Buglass’s report suggests that the department which set up RHI and has repeatedly bungled the incentive since that point is still – to this day – unable to adequately run this scheme, despite putting huge civil service resources into putting it right.The day before it released Mr Buglass’s report, DfE released another report which recommended a % increase in the main tarf.That sounds like a lot, but a high percentage of a small figure is still a small figure. EvenDUP minister Diane Dodds agrees to that it would not address the scale of the hardship identied by Mr Buglass.There are only about , RHI claimants and they are easy to ignore. Many of the public will instinctively feel that they were overcompensated at such a high level that they deserve little sympathy now.That ignores the plight of those who entered the scheme because they were environmentalists or they believed Stormont’s promises, and ignores the fact that many of them were running their boilers at a low level. In fact, those who got in early and received vast sums will be fine – they will have in many cases made enough to pay off their loans. Those who claimed the least are now facing the harshest punishment.But this doesn’t just matter for them – it matters for us. At the outset of this scheme some lavishly-paid civil servants blinded themselves with complex explanations around what would have been obvious to the man in the street – paying an uncapped subsidy which is higher than the cost of fuel is disastrous.Eight years on and after all the scrutiny of RHI,common sense and basic fairness are still absent from these calculations, what hope can we have that they are present where in Stormont How RHI is managed is one of several tests of whether this new devolved regime has really changed or whether it’s the same old Stormont with a new face.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It was so emotional being able to see the nurses on the Covid ward.ldquoFor me and Charlotte it was very humbling because those guys are putting their lives at risk and theyrsquore asking for stuff for patients, not for themselves.ldquoWe were quite tearful because we didnrsquot want to leave them there ndash but theyrsquore doing it day in-day out without batting an eyelid. Amazing people.Alongside their charitable work, Matthew and Charlotte have adapted to the challenging economic climate by introducing a delivery service for their customers.The pair have been working without the support of their staff who they had to furlough after the government closed all non-essential shops.ldquoWersquove started doing take-out because we canrsquot afford to do nothing for three months. Wersquoll lose the shop, said Matthew.ldquoWersquoll continue to do these drop offs for the hospital as long as people fund it, and wersquoll continue to do our take-out service.ldquoBecause for shops and restaurants I think its going to be long term.ldquoWe might be in this for six months before we can open to the public.ldquoAs long as we get the support and people keep shopping locally, then yes we can get through it.ldquoRunning a business is a constant challenge and you donrsquot ever stop having to adapt. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His family was incredibly important to him and was one of the things that distinguished him and helped define who he was as a man. He loved his we Mary, his children and his grandchildren. There is nothing he wouldn’t do for them. The pain upon us is real but so is the joy.“Each one of you here and each one of you watching online have a story to tell about Tony. “We can look back at the times when Tony was so kind to so many, brightened and enriched lives.“We can see in him love through his love for others. We can see in him compassion, honesty, integrity and courtesy and how everyone was special to him. We can see in him his wonderful sense of humour. his smile and infectious laugh which lted all our spirits.”He spoke of how fondly people spoke of Tony on Facebook, describing him as ‘an absolute gentleman’.“He always had time for everbody. He was generous to a fault, always the first to give. He was a superb neighbour. He was one of le’s real gems. He was one of le’s good guys. He was always fun-loving. He was a great man to know.

Comments from so many who will feel his loss keenly because of the person he was and with his unique gts he touched all our lives.“Tony was indeed a person who had a great abundance of humanity. He cared about people all his le.“He was born in Shankill in Lurgan whre he grew up but he would spend most of his le living in Craigavon.“He started his working career with Farrens then went to work in the Goodyear factory when it opened in  til its closure.“He was one of the founding members of the Goodyear Sports and Social Club and he will be remembered by many as the ‘Captain of the Ship’ at the Goodyear SSC where he facilitated s that raised thousands of pounds for charities.“He loved and enjoyed the craic and banter with all the people who came through the door over the years.“Tony had a great love for young people and when he was younger he worked as a volunteer youth leader for many years.“He was also a keen supporter of Armagh, Clan na Gael and Eire Og.
