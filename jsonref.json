On Wednesday those remains were identified as that of his father George Carroll, who disappeared in 1961 without a trace           The remains were dug up in Carroll\u0027s Lake Grove home where he grew up in and purchased from his mother before her death in 1998. Family members always shared rumors that his father George was buried in the basement           The autopsy revealed the George Carroll died of blunt force trauma to the skull, something psychic had already told Mike Carroll\u0027How does something like this happen? How do you dispose of someone and bury them in the basement and pour concrete over them and nobody knows about it?\u0027 his brother Steven Carroll, 61, said.  The veteran\u0027s death is being now probed as a homicide. But cops say they may never know just who was behind his death. Mike\u0027s mother Dorothy, provided vague details about how his father just left one day for a pack of cigarettes and never returned. Mike says his family never filed a missing persons report and moved on with their lives. If she had any secrets, she took them to the grave with her when she passed away in 1998. Mike said a person who could have known something about his father\u0027s death would have been Richard Darress, his mother\u0027s second husband who moved in not long after George Carroll died. However Darress later moved to Nuevo Laredo, Mexico and passed away in June at the age of 77. Mike said: \u0027I\u0027m trying to avoid pointing a finger at this point\u0027.     Cops ruled George Carroll\u0027s death a homicide. Mike\u0027s mother Dorothy told her four kids that George went out for cigarettes then never returned home. If she had any secrets on his death, she took them to the grave when she passed away in 1998           Police and Mike Carroll say that Dorothy\u0027s second husband Richard Darress, who moved in not long after George Carroll died, would have been a good person to question. He passed away earlier this year Mike purchased the Suffolk County home before his mother died and employed the help of ghost hunters and psychics to see if the mystery of his father could be solved. They pointed to an energy sensed in the basement of the Lake Grove home.

How do you dispose of someone and bury them in the basement and pour concrete over them and nobody knows about it,\u0027 Steven  Carroll, 61, said after the bones were identified as his father\u0027sAccording to the autopsy, the cause of death was \u0027blunt force trauma\u0027, something a psychic had already predicted to Carroll. Officials say the trauma could have been inflicted after death, according to NBC. \u0027I was told by the psychic it was blunt force trauma. She actually said to me that it was a pipe, that he got hit in the head by a pipe and he was buried alive,\u0027 Mike said to the New York Post. \u0027We were able to determine that the cause of death included blunt impacts to the head with fractures of the skull and brain injury, although there may be other injuries that are no longer detectable,\u0027 Suffolk County Medical Examiner Michael Caplan said.\u0027The DNA was extremely well-preserved within the skeletal remains, even after almost 60 years,\u0027 he added.  But now the mystery remains as to how he got there - buried six to seven feet under the earth and covered in concrete.                 Mike Carroll dug up the bones with his two adult sons Michael Jr (right) and Christopher (left)George would have been in his 20s at the time of his death. His children were also very young at the time of his disappearance. His daughter Patricia was nine, Jean, seven, and sons Steven, five, and Mike eight months.   Police say that Dorothy Carroll never have a straight answer about what happened to her husband to her four children.She also never alerted police about her missing husband. Suffolk County police confirmed no one ever filed a missing-persons report for George Carroll. But for Mike, finding his father\u0027s remains is enough closure. \u0027There will be no justice.

The royal Christmas dinner traditions include young princes and princesses eating away from the adults and being cared for by nannies, a tradition which means Markle\u0027s newborn will be in a separate room from her next year.In an essay on her humanitarian work, Markle once wrote: \u0027My parents came from little so they made a choice to give a lot: buying turkeys for homeless shelters at Thanksgiving, delivering meals to people in hospices, giving spare change to those asking for it.\u0027It\u0027s what I grew up seeing, so it\u0027s what I grew up being: a young adult with a social consciousness to do what I could and speak up when I knew something was wrong.\u0027What a difference from the opulent surroundings of Sandringham House, in Norfolk, where the royals have been enjoying the Yuletide every year since 1988.When the Queen and her relatives open presents on Christmas Eve, Markle, 37, will be able to tell her new family the story behind one of her father\u0027s first gifts, which made her proud of growing up in a mixed race household - Thomas is white, Doria black.According to Andrew Morton\u0027s biography, Meghan Markle: A Hollywood Princess, her father bought two sets of Heart dolls containing the traditional nuclear family unit of mother, father and two children. \u0027He bought one with black dolls, one with white, and mixed them together to represent Meghan\u0027s own family. Then he wrapped them in sparkly Christmas paper and placed the box under the tree,\u0027 Morton writes.While the duchess has been praised for her past and present charity work, it\u0027s also been noted that she has a sense of entitlement and it\u0027s not a recently acquired trait. Harry was quoted as saying: \u0027What Meghan wants, Meghan gets\u0027 - but apparently her father also doted on the duchess.

Four years later, while going through her possessions, Ukrainetz discovered a letter hidden inside a music program that revealed the truth about her parentage. Pictured: Ukrainetz with her mother Evelyn and her three children           Ukrainetz says she believes Maurice, 4th Baron Fermoy (pictured) first saw her actress mother on stage in 1943 and fell hopelessly in love before beginning an affair that lasted until his death in 1955          The 75-year-old wants to dig up the remains of Maurice\u0027s twin brother Francis, who is buried in New York, and compare his DNA to hers to prove she really is Princess Diana\u0027s aunt   Ukrainetz says she has attempted to contact the Fermoy family, Princess Diana\u0027s brother Charles, Earl Spencer and the Dukes of Cambridge and Sussex but has been largely ignored.She told DailyMailTV: \u0027I am their flesh and blood. Why can\u0027t they accept me? They accept Meghan who is a orcee.\u0027The royals have come a long way in that they have accepted others. Yet myself, who is blood related, they want nothing to do with. It makes me angry.\u0027Ukrainetz was born Ann Rudderforth in Kings Lynn, England, on November 22, 1943 to Evelyn – an actress who was the leading light of the local theater company.Ukrainetz says she believes Maurice, 4th Baron Fermoy first saw her mother on stage the same year and fell hopelessly in love before beginning an affair that lasted until his death in 1955.Growing up, she says there were regular Friday visits from the \u0027insurance man\u0027, who she says she later realized was Maurice.She said: \u0027He was introduced to me as the insurance man and he would come quite often on a Friday and we would have to get all dolled up.\u0027My grandmother would take a walk because she lived with my mom and dad – she was bombed out during the war – and I would sit on his knee.\u0027I thought that was a little strange when I got older – why am I bouncing around on this man\u0027s lap when he\u0027s the insurance man? But it seemed that my mom and he had a very close relationship and so I felt it was OK.\u0027He would always bring some little toy. I remember he bought me a bicycle for my birthday. I think it was blue - a blue Raleigh bicycle. I just loved it.\u0027           Ukrainetz says she loved growing up in rural England but that changed in 1955 when Maurice died and her family relocated to Canada. There, her actress mother Evelyn (left)  became a book keeper and raised her only daughter away from the rest of their English family           In 1995, her mother Evelyn died. Four years later, while going through her possessions, Ukrainetz discovered a letter hidden inside a music program that revealed the truth about her parentage (pictured)          A portion of the letter reads: \u0027My dearest, darling Ann, I know one day you will have this letter in your possession, maybe after I have passed from this world. Please try to understand. I just have to get this off my chest. Charlie was not your biological father. I fell in love with Lord Fermoy and we had you as a result. He was married and I was just a commoner\u0027But her mother, Evelyn, was married - to Charles, a foreman at a local timber mill - and so was Maurice: to Ruth Roche, a confidante and lady-in-waiting to the Queen Mother, and the mother of his son Edmund and daughters Mary and Frances.Frances – who Ukrainetz believes is her half-sister – later went on to marry John Spencer, Viscount Althorp, with whom she had a son Charles and three daughters, including Princess Diana.          Evelyn was married at the time of the affair to Charles, a foreman at a local timber mill According to Ukrainetz, her family appeared to be of modest means but always had money – given to them, she believes, by her aristocratic biological father.She also attended events at Sandringham – the royal family\u0027s Norfolk home – and the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, at the behest, she claims, of Maurice, who had a house on the estate.But although she says she loved growing up in rural England all that changed in 1955 when Maurice died and her family relocated to Canada.There, her actress mother Evelyn became a book keeper and raised her only daughter away from the rest of their English family, including Ukrainetz\u0027s grandmother who had to be left behind.In 1964, Ukrainetz met and married her husband Len, with whom she went on to have three children, although the couple are now orced.A year later, the pair left Canada for Detroit, Michigan, before moving briefly to Los Angeles and then Escondido, a small city 30 miles north of San Diego, where the family still live.In 1995, her mother Evelyn died. Four years later, while going through her possessions, Ukrainetz discovered a letter hidden inside a music program that revealed the truth about her parentage.           While Ann\u0027s mother Evelyn was having an affair with Maurice, he was married to Ruth Roche (pictured together in 1933)           Another find was a series of letters from Maurice to Evelyn, including one that referenced her birth and commiserated with her mother over the pain. It said: \u0027I am so sorry the birth of our Ann caused you so much pain. I feel it too. I love you so very much\u0027          Another note addressed to \u0027my precious Rose, Evelyn\u0027 asked if she could bring Ann to a house party and that his driver could take them home afterwards   Evelyn also revealed how Maurice had been able to secretly snatch moments with his illegitimate daughter          Ukrainetz said: \u0027He would always bring some little toy. I remember he bought me a bicycle for my birthday. I think it was blue - a blue Raleigh bicycle. I just loved it\u0027          The confession read in part: \u0027I fell in love with Lord Fermoy and we had you as a result. He was married and I was just a commoner. There was nothing we could do. We stayed in close touch and he loved you very much\u0027 (pictured Ann Ukrainetz) It said: \u0027My dearest, darling Ann, I know one day you will have this letter in your possession, maybe after I have passed from this world.\u0027Please try to understand.

I wanted you to know because this makes you a \u0027\u0027lady\u0027\u0027.\u0027I wanted to tell you so much in person, but I lacked the courage.\u0027Another find was a series of letters from Maurice to Evelyn, including one that referenced her birth and commiserated with her mother over the pain.It said: \u0027I am so sorry the birth of our Ann caused you so much pain.

So an opportunity to take pictures of the two together is always interesting and this is why I decided to stand in front of Verhofstadt in the plenary room, waiting for Juncker to come over. Juncker is a character, always breaking the rules and ready to laugh and especially at himself.

Reuters photographer Leah Millis said: \u0027After about seven hours of waiting, Hicks suddenly appeared at the end of the hallway. I grabbed my backpack and broke into a sprint towards the northern exit with a videographer and no other photographers. We then backpedalled with Hicks for the long walk up the stairs that lead to First Street from the Capitol. I noticed the lit-up Capitol building behind her as we climbed the stairs and had the presence of mind to get it in the background of the photograph. Seven hours of waiting had culminated in a few minutes-long feverish dash and climb up the stairs.\u0027 Millis added: \u0027Hicks and myself were the only women at the scene. One of the videographers made a comment about her looks as we were walking, and I felt the need to show that she held her own, never stumbled or looked like a victim in that situation.

Reuters photographer Carlos Garcia Rawlins said: \u0027There was a desperate atmosphere as a crowd of several hundred people waited for news of their loved ones. Earlier in the day there had been clashes and the police had used teargas to disperse the families. Police officers were trying to update people, but no official statements had been made, and as people heard news of their relatives in the detention centre, a reaction would spread through the crowd. People were crying, fainting and shouting throughout the street. I was standing on the other side of the street when I heard a woman\u0027s scream pierce the air. I rushed through the crowd and saw this woman. She was overwhelmed by grief and people cleared a space around her and tried to comfort her. This was a really difficult moment to photograph because her pain was so intense, I don\u0027t think she even really noticed I was there.\u0027 Later, authorities said 68 people died in the fire, including two women who were visiting inmates          Adult-film actress Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, puts her shoe back on after passing though a security screening, as she arrives at federal court in New York City on April 16, 2018. Reuters photographer Shannon Stapleton said: \u0027This kind of assignment is hectic and intensely competitive. It was total chaos as everyone scrambled to get a picture of her. I ran to a window and tried to place myself by the metal detector that anyone entering the courthouse has to go through. I pinned my camera upon the glass, hoping Daniels would pass by me. She was wearing pastel pink and I knew that if I kept the focus on her, I would be able to get a clean shot. As Daniels made her way through the metal detector, I noticed she had to take off her high-heel shoes and sit down to put them back on. I knew in that moment that was the money shot: Daniels with her leg held up as she put her heels back on\u0027           Supporters of the National Socialist Movement, a white nationalist political group, give Nazi salutes while taking part in a swastika burning at an undisclosed location in Georgia, US, on April 21, 2018. Reuters photographer Go Nakamura said: \u0027I never fathomed capturing this image.\u0027 He said he had been covering a \u0027very uneventful white supremacy rally\u0027 in Newnan, Georgia, early that day run by the National Socialist Movement when colleagues said they may be holding a secret ritual outside of the town later. He got permission to photograph the event. \u0027We reached the backyard of a bar in the middle of nowhere where we saw a big wooden swastika and cross set up on the ground. Then, a group of some 15 neo-Nazis lit up their torches as they encircled the swastika and performed a Nazi salute. It was surreal. Adrenalin was rushing through my body, but I remained focused on capturing what was unfolding in front of my eyes.\u0027 He added: \u0027As we drove away, I set about unravelling the tangle of emotions I experienced that day that led to this photo\u0027           A wounded Palestinian demonstrator, Haitham Abu Sabla, 23, is hit in the face with a tear gas canister fired by Israeli troops during a protest marking al-Quds Day, (Jerusalem Day), at the Israel-Gaza border in the southern Gaza Strip on June 8, 2018. Reuters photographer Ibraheem Abu Mustafa said: \u0027Demonstrators began hurling stones at the soldiers, and one soldier got off a jeep and began firing tear gas bombs at the protesters. Usually protesters would begin fleeing because those canisters can be dangerous and hit people in the head. I was surprised to see a man with gas coming out of his face. I was the first to notice it, and at the beginning I thought he might have put it inside his mouth kind of for fun, or out of defiance. Then I realised the gas bomb had penetrated his face and lodged inside it. Everything was happening in seconds. I began taking images of him as he ran, as he fell to the ground and as medics rushed to help him.\u0027 He added: \u0027It was shocking and horrifying for me, but I felt I had a responsibility to cover the event while keeping myself together. Especially during such a surprising incident\u0027           Immigrant children are led by staff in single file between tents at a detention facility next to the Mexican border in Tornillo, Texas, on June 18, 2018. Reuters photographer Mike Blake said: \u0027It was a lot of teamwork that made this picture happen, from finding the location to hunting down an aircraft for aerials while I flew into Texas on a commercial flight. The Trump administration\u0027s new policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the border had begun, but no one really understood until these images were transmitted out to the world the scale and reality of what was going on.\u0027 He added: \u0027Reuters was the first to show such aerial images of the camp and, in the next morning when both the New York Times and Washington Post fronted their print editions with what I had photographed, President Trump signed an order ending the separation policy\u0027           A ballerina watches the broadcast of the World Cup quarter-final match between Russia and Croatia at the Mikhailovsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg, Russia, on July 7, 2018. Reuters photographer Anton Vaganov said: \u0027It was a truly international summer in St Petersburg - the city was buzzing and thousands of soccer fans were milling around Nevsky Prospect singing and celebrating. I had been covering the fans in the city and was always looking for new ways to document the World Cup tournament. On the eve of the quarter-final between Russia and Croatia, the Russia Chief Photographer asked me to look for artists watching the match in the theatre. Ballet is closely identified with St Petersburg, so it makes a great combination.\u0027 He added: \u0027My editor had made a tight crop on the image and transformed it into this excellent picture. Photographers might work alone in the field, but we have a great team of colleagues who help make a great image possible\u0027           Croatia players celebrate next to an AFP photographer Yuri Cortez after Mario Mandzukic scores their second goal against England during the World Cup at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, Russia, on July 11, 2018. Reuters photographer Carl Recine said: \u0027It was the 2018 World Cup semi-final - England and Croatia were facing off.  Mandzukic was running right towards me. Suddenly he was right in front of me, filling the frame of my 70-200mm lens. I always try to keep a wider 16-35mm lens close by for moments like this, though they rarely happen. In fact, I had never found myself in a similar situation before. As his teammates stormed towards him to celebrate, I jumped off my seat to avoid being swept up by the whole Croatian team. But another photographer who was sitting next to me was accidentally knocked to the floor. I kept photographing the celebrations, which now engulfed my colleague. The Croatian players then picked the photographer up, made sure he was okay, found his glasses on the floor and placed them back on his head. It was a special and unique moment, and I was delighted to be part of it\u0027           A crew member of NGO Proactiva Open Arms rescue boat embraces Josepha from Cameroon in the central Mediterranean Sea, on July 17, 2018. Reuters photographer Juan Medina said: \u0027As our rescue boat sighted the wreck of a raft, we saw a woman making an effort to wave, so we knew at least there was life there. It soon became clear she was the only survivor. Face down amid a bunch of loose planks and deflated rubber lay the corpse of a woman in a striped T-shirt and trousers. She had been dead for some time. And there was a four-year-old boy who the boat\u0027s doctors said had died just hours before. The survivor was brought aboard in a state of deep shock and treated by doctors. She gave only her first name, Josepha, and said she was from Cameroon. She told doctors she had spent the previous night clinging to the wreckage, singing hymns and praying for deliverance. She would not tell us anything else about herself or the other passengers on the raft, nor did she say how it wrecked. The crew lifted the two dead bodies onto the deck, covered and put them on ice. There was general sadness and the feeling of powerlessness, but also joy at having found Josepha alive. Had we arrived a few hours later, she could have been dead\u0027          A police officer pepper sprays a protester as another protester stands in front of the race director\u0027s car at the 218-km Stage 16 from Carcassonne to Bagneres-de-Luchon of the Tour de France, on July 24, 2018. Reuters photographer Stephane Mahe said: \u0027The Tour security asked me to leave but I decided to stay as something more than a sporting episode was unfolding. Just before the arrival of the peleton, I saw two young women rush onto the road, shouting and blocking an official Tour car as farmers cheered them on. The gendarmes immediately sprayed tear gas at the two protesters, who screamed and struggled. I took my picture. The two women were quickly removed from the road and the peleton arrived. The cyclists slowed and then stopped, troubled by the tear gas in the air. They struggled to breathe, wiped their eyes. One even asked me if someone had thrown acid in his face. It was chaos. The race was held up for 17 minutes -  very unusual. I thought of the two protesters, I knew it was a striking image. That evening, after this stage of Tour was over, I discovered that the photo had gone viral. The protesters had an audience for their fight against the loss of local farming subsidies. But the Tour went on\u0027           Ayah, 37, a niqab wearer, weeps as she is embraced by a police officer during a demonstration against the Danish face veil ban in Copenhagen, Denmark, on August 1, 2018. Reuters photographer Andrew Kelly said he was following a large demonstration in Copenhagen protesting against the ban when he came across a scene that was \u0027emblematic of the polarizing issue.\u0027 He said: \u0027I wasn\u0027t sure whether the police officer was going to fine them, but I quickly realized she was being very friendly. She spoke with one of veiled women, Ayah, who was visibly emotional. The officer reassured her, and the two women hugged as Ayah wept.\u0027 He said the photo was widely picked up and sparked a heated debate on the ban. \u0027People were ided: Many praised the officer, while others called for her suspension,\u0027 he added. It also created huge interest in Ayah, who have interviews about how the ban affected her life but sudden notoriety also brought a lot of negative attention and Ayah has since retreated to a life away from the spotlight\u0027            Ethiopian Federal Police officers detain a woman suspected of carrying explosives during the welcoming ceremony of Jawar Mohammed, a US-based Oromo activist and leader of the Oromo Protests, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on August 5, 2018. Reuters photographer Tiksa Negeri said people were dancing and chanting slogans in front of Addis Ababa\u0027s Bole Airport as \u0027they waited for their hero to land there.\u0027 He said: \u0027Some youths were assigned as security guards to check people arriving for the celebration and accompanying concert. I was out on the street to shoot the event. The atmosphere was joyous, everybody enjoying themselves, holding up Jawar portraits. About 30 minutes later, however, I bumped into some angry youths beating a young woman who apparently had refused to be checked and was suspected of carrying explosives. I followed them as they hustled her towards police. I was glad she was finally handed to police custody in one piece and she was taken away for investigation. I never heard of reports about her after that. I felt like I was in the right place to get the handover of the young woman, with her regretful expression, and I immediately got on my knees and took this picture\u0027          A Honduran migrant protects his child after fellow migrants, part of a caravan trying to reach the US, stormed a border checkpoint in Guatemala, in Ciudad Hidalgo, Mexico, on October 19, 2018. Reuters photographer Ueslei Marcelino said: \u0027The migrants had already broken through the first police barricade on the Guatemalan side of the bridge. After a while, they moved towards the second barricade on the Mexican side. The push by the migrants to enter Mexico had eased and suddenly women and children formed a line and started to walk towards the police. There was a bit of pushing and shoving, and then things started to get increasingly chaotic. It was a march that turned into a protest and ended up in confusion. Of course, it affected me. I\u0027m also a father of a nine-year-old girl. It was impossible not to think about being that father caught up in that panicked situation\u0027          Honduran mother Maria Meza grabs the arms of her five-year-old twin daughters Cheili and Saira as they frantically run from a tear gas canister next to the U.S-Mexico border barrier in Tijuana, Mexico, on November 25, 2018. Reuters photographer Kim Kyung-Hoon said: \u0027After nearly two weeks of documenting the harrowing journey of a caravan of mostly Central American migrants headed towards the U.S.-Mexican border, I snapped a picture I will never forget.\u0027 She added: \u0027Cheili is in diapers, Saira barefoot. Their mother is wearing a T-shirt from the Disney hit \u0027Frozen,\u0027 a movie I\u0027ve seen many times with my own daughter. In the frantic moments after tear gas canisters hit the ground, the acrid smell engulfed the area. Children were crying, their eyes stung by the gas.  I did not see who fired the canister, but I heard the sound come from the direction of the border fence as I, too, broke into a run. It was one of the first of several tear gas canisters I saw being used by border agents. I did not witness migrants behaving violently, but we were in a large area and I could not see everything that was happening. It is not my place to say who is right and who is wrong. I just took a photo of what I saw happening\u0027  Hurricane Florence from Space, Harry and Meghan\u0027s royal wedding and a hand-shake to end decade-long stand-off: AFP unveils its Pictures of the Yearby AFP and George MartinThis collection of images is taken from Agence France Presse, or AFP\u0027s \u0027Pictures of the Year 2018\u0027 - a selection of the press agency\u0027s most important and powerful photographs from the past year.Every year AFP, which has photographers around the globe, chooses a selection of their most powerful, moving, shocking or fascinating images, offering a look back at the highlights - and lowlights - of the last 12 months.Some of the photographs capture the most important events of the year, while others have been chosen because they encapsulate a particularly poignant, touching, or even funny moment.The pictures  the worlds of news, politics, entertainment, and sport, covering events ranging from the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, to the World Cup in Russia.All of the photographs from around the world have been taken by AFP photographers, and these are some of the best images.

Thousands of mostly Honduran migrants rose at dawn on Sunday from the shores of a river between Guatemala and Mexico and continued their trek northward, overwhelming Mexican government attempts to stop them at the border. Their numbers swelled from 2,000 to about 5,000 overnight and at first light they set out walking toward the Mexican town of Tapachula, 10 abreast in a line stretching approximately a mile. That number has now reportedly risen to 7,000. Several hundred more already had applied for refugee status in Mexico and an estimated 1,500 were still on the Guatemalan side of the Suchiate River, hoping to enter legally.

There was no hidden message. After today\u0027s important visit to Texas, I hope the media isn\u0027t going to choose to focus on her wardrobe.\u0027 However, a tweet from President Trump later suggested that there was meaning behind the jacket, saying his wife\u0027s coat was referencing the media rather than traumatised children. He tweeted: \u0027I REALLY DON\u0027T CARE, DO U?\u0027 written on the back of Melania\u0027s jacket, refers to the Fake News Media.

Asked about Macron\u0027s comments, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders stressed that Trump\u0027s plans for the region have not changed. In a statement, she said: \u0027The U.S. mission has not changed - the President has been clear that he wants U.S. forces to come home as quickly as possible.\u0027 Macron sought to clarify the comments, saying he \u0027never said\u0027 either the United States or France would stay engaged long term in Syria in a military sense, and spoke of a \u0027humanitarian responsibility\u0027 in the country.          Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg arrives to testify before a joint hearing of the US Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee and Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill in April. Mark Zuckerberg lost nearly $20billion in just two hours in July. The Facebook CEO saw his net worth tumble by $18.8billion, a record drop, in after-hours trading, taking him down four spots in Forbes\u0027 World Billionaires List. Zuckerberg woke up as the fourth richest person in the world with an $82.4billion net worth on Wednesday but was in the eighth spot by the end of the day.

Florence dropped a maximum total of 35.93 inches (913 mm) of rain in Elizabethtown, North Carolina, becoming the wettest tropical cyclone recorded in the Carolinas, and also the eighth-wettest overall in the contiguous United States. The sixth named storm, third hurricane, and the first major hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, Florence originated from a strong tropical wave that emerged off the west coast of Africa on August 30, 2018.

Family members always shared rumors that his father George was buried in the basement           The autopsy revealed the George Carroll died of blunt force trauma to the skull, something psychic had already told Mike Carroll\u0027How does something like this happen? How do you dispose of someone and bury them in the basement and pour concrete over them and nobody knows about it?\u0027 his brother Steven Carroll, 61, said.  The veteran\u0027s death is being now probed as a homicide.

John Steinbeck was given Sir Thomas Malory’s Le Morte d’Arthur (1485) as a nine-year-old and it became his “magic book”, sparking a life-long love of Arthurian literature and of storytelling. Raymond Chandler tipped his hat to the Arthurian age of valiant knights by naming Philip Marlowe’s forerunner Mallory. A week after her husband’s assassination in 1963, Jackie Kennedy used Camelot as a metaphor for the White House under JFK. The knights of the Round Table, as well as Guinevere, Merlin and the sword in the stone have all become cultural memes deeply rooted not just in the British consciousness but around the world, generating new books, films, operas and computer games in which the stories are constantly renewed.Despite his fame, Arthur is “something of a nightmare from the historian’s perspective”. As Nicholas Higham shows, practically everything about him is disputed, even down to “when and where he belongs”. In this fascinating, authoritative analysis of the many Arthurian texts and theories, Higham asks: “Was he a fiction, right from the start?”Since the 19th century, Arthur has been viewed as a historical figure who lived around AD500. But the lack of reliable contemporary accounts of his life poses a problem. His name does not appear until some 300 years later, in the Historia Brittonum. But despite its title, this is not history in the modern sense. “Britain’s foremost Dark Age hero” was, Higham concludes, “made up by one imaginative clerk”, who was anxious to please his master, a Welsh kinglet, by creating a historical tradition of resistance to foreign invaders.Higham weighs the evidence and ultimately finds it all wanting, from mythological explanations (“clutching at straws”), and apparent references to Arthur in Old Welsh texts that predate the Historia (“no evidence”), to the intriguing theory that he was a Roman soldier, L Artorius Castus, who served in Britain and is buried in modern-day Croatia (“entirely unconvincing”). He even casts doubt on the existence of Camelot, which is first mentioned in “a highly imaginative” 12th-century French romance. Higham remains sceptical All we are left with are poems and stories in which the life and exploits of King Arthur have been written and rewritten. They are testament to his enduring mythic power. Perhaps the true value of this elusive leader lies in what he can tell us about ourselves rather than the long forgotten past. • King Arthur by Nicholas J Higham (Yale, £25).

There were price rises in Northern Ireland, Scotland, West Midlands, Wales, Yorkshire and Humber and the north-west.Simon Rubinsohn, Rics’ chief economist, said: “It is evident … that the ongoing uncertainties surrounding how the Brexit process plays out is taking its toll on the housing market. I can’t recall a previous survey when a single issue has been highlighted by quite so many contributors.“Caution is visible among both buyers and vendors and where deals are being done they are taking longer to get over the line. The forward-looking indicators reflect the suspicion that the political machinations are unlikely to be resolved anytime soon.”He said a weakening property market could prompt a slowdown in housebuilding: “The bigger risk is that this now spills over into development plans, making it even harder to secure the uplift in the building pipeline to address the housing crisis.”Many surveyors and agents said the seasonal slowdown before Christmas had started earlier than usual. Mark Duckworth, of Martin \u0026amp Mortimer in Ely, said: “The Brexit effect is best described as a cold and wet blanket which is depressing appetite for property.”In the rental market, demand from tenants was holding steady, while the flow of rental homes on to the market continued to slow, Rics said.

Investors are piling into Italian debt, sending prices rising.The gap between Italian and German borrowing costs has also fallen to its lowest level in over two months, suggesting that Italy is seen as a less risky investment.The European Central Bank’s governing council is meeting today, and is expected to turn off the taps on its asset purchase stimulus scheme. That would bring an end to three and a half years of bond-buying that has swelled its balance sheet by €2.6trn.The pound is steady this morning around $1.264, after Theresa May won her confidence vote last night - but not with a landslide majority (just 200 votes vs 117).The PM is now jetting to Brussels today for an EU summit, for further talks on Brexit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c11a0baabdcf48711d74d02fc240d56ff42ed08/241_221_4476_2685/master/4476.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bed8b8bc5b27942f246fd569fd436195","title":"a different type of housing spreads manchester urban comic ben tallon","story":"Manchester’s relentless growth is leaving some people behind.

Theresa May survives as our prime minister! Pop the corks, punch the air, thank our lucky stars! Really? Pinch yourself, but yes indeed. Though she is the worst occupant of No 10 in living memory (bar David Cameron), though she lacks any quality to make her even tolerably competent as prime minister, her fall would have brought the rise of something far darker.But compared with her enemies, she’s a strategic genius. Blinded by fury, the intemperates couldn’t restrain their urge to post those 48 letters without waiting until they had the votes to bring her down. What idiots! The boneheaded led by the numbskulls – Iain Duncan Smith, Owen Patterson, Andrea Jenkyns – oh, the list is as long as the 117 who voted against her. Jacob Rees‑Mogg and Boris Johnson are brought low, so let’s see less of them on our screens now.Look how their stupidity has revived the moribund May, infusing her with new credibility. All the old gentlemanly conventions have long vanished from our demented remnant of a government: losing votes in the Commons or failing to win overwhelming support of your own MPs counts for nothing. Our unwritten constitution is a flexible beast and she can go on and on and on. And so can disgraced MPs who used to resign in shame, but now they only lose the whip for a little while until their votes are required to save their leader.The only way the stupids can remove her now is to pull down their own government, by voting no confidence in themselves. Well, this rabid pack might just be mad enough to do it, Brextremists voting with all the opposition parties to force her out from sheer vindictiveness, never mind near certainty of a Corbyn government if they tried.But for now, not only May but her Brexit plan gets a new lease of life. With the fanatics seen off as a weak force, tails between their legs, her party faces exactly the stark choice she laid out – her plan, no Brexit, no deal – referendum or not. Last weekend the Brexiteers were instructing her to go back and handbag Europe, Thatcher-style: well, she went, she gripped-and-grinned, got stuck in her car and came back apparently empty-handed – but despite European obduracy, her enemies still lost this vote. She has shown them that there is no alternative. Elect who they like in her place, the facts would not alter.Had they defenestrated her, months would have been consumed by the awful spectacle of a rogues gallery of unspeakable candidates out-Brexiting one another for the votes of their Europhobic old-shire membership. No moderate stood a chance, so the winner would have promised the impossible, a no-deal crash-out the Commons would struggle to prevent. I am – just about – confident enough in the ultimate sanity of a majority of MPs to think they would find a procedure, whatever it takes, to ensure there is no kamikaze Brexit finale. But you could never be sure.I am reasonably sure that Theresa May will not let that happen. Be grateful for that mercy. Otherwise, there is nothing whatever to celebrate in finding ourselves still trapped inside the austerity-stricken hostile environment created by this maladroit impersonation of a leader.She survived by pledging not to stand again – and indeed that was unthinkable, even to her. But Brexit may not be resolved by the time a 2022 election comes around and her successor may be surrounded by the same interminable cries of “betrayal” ricocheting around the ongoing grind of EU trade negotiations as time runs out for her despicable government. Nothing may have changed.This Tory era, her government and Cameron’s, marks a historic nadir. Where there was harmony, (well, up to a point), they brought discord. How wretchedly bad can these times be, that we needed her to stay?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a86b47ed89d97f3d3e82ac08f205707c9ed0acee/94_324_3276_1965/master/3276.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0ce1b2d11c04c3868bf41f6d4f3c729","title":"may eu second referendum brexit","story":"It’s Thursday, and so the crisis of the day for Theresa May is a make-or-break meeting with her European Union counterparts in Brussels.Having achieved what can only be described as a humiliating victory last night – 117 of her own MPs voted to get rid of her – the prime minister now seeks concessions from the EU that she hopes will make her 585-page withdrawal agreement more palatable to hardline Brexiteers and the 10 Democratic Unionist MPs who prop up her government.Last night, her cabinet supporters – “allies” is too strong a word – expressed a frankly mysterious level of confidence that she will squeeze from Brussels “legally binding reassurances” on the proposed backstop mechanism: the device that would keep the UK in the customs union while the apparently intractable Irish border issue is resolved.I am sure that the EU will indeed make clear (yet again) that it sees the backstop as an insurance policy rather than an institutional objective that it has no desire to use the mechanism any longer than is necessary and that it will do everything that could be reasonably expected to ensure that the arrangement (if it is used at all) is short-lived. What Brussels cannot deliver is precisely what the Brexiters insist upon: a means by which the UK can terminate the backstop unilaterally or impose a clear time limit upon its operation.So, barring a pretty extraordinary lapin being pulled from the European chapeau tonight, May’s Brexit deal will be no more palatable to the Commons tomorrow than it was on Monday when she postponed the “meaningful vote” that had been scheduled for the following day.Though the battle ahead has long been framed primarily as a choice between May’s deal and a no deal exit, I think the prime minister now believes otherwise. Having defined her premiership as a mission to implement the 2016 referendum result, the real threat to her legacy is not Britain crashing out without a deal (much less likely since Tory MP Dominic Grieve’s amendment gave the Commons the right to modify government proposals) but, as she increasingly puts it, “no Brexit at all”.This was the phrase she started using as long ago as her October party conference speech, just as the People’s Vote campaign began to gather pace. “Think for a moment what it would do to faith in our democracy,” she said on that occasion, “if – having asked the people of this country to take this decision – politicians tried to overturn it.” It is another referendum, not a no-deal shambles, that she sees as the clear and present danger.She is right, too. None of the myriad variants of Brexit – her own deal, Norway-for-now, Canada-plus-plus – would command a Commons majority.Any dispassionate analysis yields the conclusion that the only sure way to break this horrendous parliamentary impasse is to go back to the electorate for new instructions. And this, for a prime minister who has gone through two and a half years of hell to deliver her unloved deal, is the worst prospect of all – worse, even, than being sacked by her own MPs.The last referendum destroyed her predecessor, ided the nation and condemned it to the constitutional limbo in which it still languishes. May’s true message to her EU colleagues this evening will be: in the name of all that is holy, please don’t put us through that again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ee6c196ee5090dcfbbc0ec973c41384a726a143/0_312_4836_2901/master/4836.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e321c0f8583ec8af65da9acf8e234c58","title":"message europe britain stay brexit eu","story":"Leaders across Europe might want to get Brexit over the line. But in the long term the EU would be weaker without the UKWe are fast approaching a critical period in Britain’s Brexit drama. Incredible though it may seem, there is now a serious chance of the British voting in a second referendum to stay in the European Union. What an extraordinary boost that would be to the whole post-1945 project of building a better Europe!To get there, we need a little help from our friends. I can well understand why many Europeans just want to get the whole thing over and usher the UK out of the door. We have now had 900 days of the British government either not being able to articulate a negotiating position, or making unrealistic demands, or, as this week, being unable to deliver parliamentary approval for the deal it has negotiated.As the clock ticks down towards B-day, 29 March 2019 – bringing the danger of a chaotic no-deal Brexit – I can see why, at the European council in Brussels this week, leaders such as the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, might want to help the British government just to “get over the line”. For then the EU could get back to confronting all its other major challenges, including populism and gilets jaunes (yellow vests), the continued problems of the Eurozone, immigration, Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump.But that would be short-sighted. Yes, in the short term, helping the British government over the Brexit line would bring some certainty, enabling the EU to get back to other business. But in the long term Brexit would create a festering British ulcer, hurting and weakening the body of the European Union.The ulceration would begin soon after B-day. Britain would then have to negotiate its actual future relationship with the EU, on the basis of a vague and non-binding political declaration, and from an exceptionally weak negotiating position. Those negotiations would take years, and be very difficult. The false promises of the Brexiteers would soon be exposed. To avoid taking the blame themselves, the Brexiteers and Britain’s Eurosceptic press (no sticklers for truth, to put it mildly) would blame the country’s misfortunes on “the Europeans”, and especially on the French – something the English have been practising for 700 years.Even if we were to get beyond this toxic blame-game, it is a dangerous illusion to believe that Britain would go on happily, constructively cooperating with the rest of Europe on foreign policy, defence, counter-terrorism (one thinks of the latest victims in Strasbourg) and intelligence-sharing and all the other areas in which the UK substantially contributes to Europe, while being mired in unhappiness about the rest of the relationship. That’s not how politics works, especially in an age of populism. It is also a delusion to think that within a few years the British would come back, with their tails between their legs, begging to rejoin. That’s a serious misreading of the British character. In short, there would be a dynamic of ergence, not of convergence.So the only good Brexit is no Brexit. The chances of that – what May charmingly calls the “risk of no Brexit” – have soared in recent weeks. Whereas elsewhere nationalist populism has seriously impaired the workings of democracy, in Britain it is working. I have spent a lot of time with British MPs recently, and seen how seriously they are treating their role as elected representatives in a critical moment. As a result, the mother of parliaments is now taking back control. Nobody knows what will emerge from its often arcane and operatic procedures. A new election? A government of national unity? A vote for Norway plus (British membership in the EFTA pillar of the EEA, plus a customs union)? No deal by accident rather than design? Anything is possible. Nothing is certain – except that there will be several more weeks of fireworks, smoke and confusion. But the option quietly gaining support among MPs is a second referendum.It is ridiculous to suggest it would be undemocratic for Britain’s sovereign parliament to take the question back to the people. The resulting referendum campaign could be angry and isive. But one has to weigh that short-term risk against the much larger long-term risks to both Britain and Europe. A referendum would be short-term pain for long-term gain.Of course we might lose the referendum vote again. Even then, the country would be in no worse a position than it is now, and arguably in a better one: no one could then argue that people did not know what they were voting for. What is certainly true is that, to ensure a Britain that constructively re-engages, helping to bring the EU the reforms it badly needs, we need to achieve a decisive margin for staying in. Recent opinion polls are pointing in that direction, but we must make a much better pro-European campaign than we had in 2016.If and when the parliamentary vote for a second referendum comes, we will need just a few things from our EU partners. Article 50 would have to be extended for a few months. A report by constitutional experts at University College London suggests a referendum could be done properly in 24 weeks. That points to an article 50 extension into the summer of 2019, which would entail addressing a tricky issue around British participation in the European elections in May. The ruling this week of the European court of justice establishes that, following a vote to remain, the UK could unilaterally revoke article 50 and stay as a member of the EU on its current terms. Apart from that, all we need from you, my friends, is a clear, simple, positive message, without ifs or buts: “We want you to stay!”If you are persuaded that building a stronger Europe in a dangerous world needs the UK to be pulling its weight inside the EU if you regard any blow struck against the dark forces of nationalist populism as a good thing if what the UK has contributed to Europe over the centuries means anything to you if you place any value on what Britain did for European freedom in the second world war, for postwar reconstruction and for helping to throw off the yoke of communist dictatorships then let us have this chance. If you have worked with British colleagues, spent time at a British university, enjoyed some aspect of British sport or culture, or have British friends if anything the British have ever done has touched your heart then give us your solidarity and support. In helping Britain you will also be helping Europe.• Timothy Garton Ash is a historian, political writer and  columnist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a2ec459138a3ffcaf920dddc63d2bd4d5f4c470/252_0_3141_1885/master/3141.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d7b32205fe73b7cef3182e98882fcfa","title":"secret volunteers welfare state biscuit fund","story":"Jemima dreams of winning the EuroMillions so that the Biscuit Fund can help even more people next yearIn bed in west Wales, with a laptop propped up on the sheets, Jemima is patching up Britain’s welfare state.The 39-year-old has never been elected or even been paid a wage – in fact, she’s more likely to give out her own money than receive it – but amid Brexit cabinet infighting, Jemima offers something few ministers can: she knows what it’s like to struggle to pay the bills.Jemima has ME and fibromyalgia – a mix of extreme fatigue and daily pain – and is raising two children on her disability benefits. Heating is severely rationed. “I’m used to seeing my breath in my house,” she says.In the Christmas of 2012, only a few months after the coalition launched the first wave of cuts, Jemima found herself skipping meals to feed her son and daughter. “I was so ashamed of it,” she says. “And I thought it was just me. Then I realised it wasn’t.”It was a eureka moment that inspired her and friends to launch the Biscuit Fund – a charity gifting service named after the rumour that, while austerity hit the country, one Tory minister was spending £10,000 a year on biscuits. Jemima knows all too well that one of the worst parts of poverty is the shame of asking for help. The Biscuit Fund turns this on its head: instead of people in need having to turn up to a charity, Jemima and volunteers scour the internet – anything from benefit forums to cries for help on Facebook – and come to them.The premise was simple: no judgment, no fixed criteria – just a helping hand for people when times are tough, whether that’s a washing machine when the old one packs in and you’ve no savings to replace it, or a food hamper to get through a benefit sanction. As Jemima puts it: “This is a chance to gain some breath before you go back under.”Six years on, instead of the need for the Biscuit Fund fading, it’s swelled. For millions of people, work is paying poverty wages and benefits have been cut or stopped entirely, all while food prices and rent soar. Worse, at a time when more and more families are being pushed into crisis, the emergency local welfare funds that may previously have caught them are vanishing.I’ve spoken to Jemima on and off since 2014, usually when she’s saving my bacon. If I reported on, say, a disabled gran in a freezing flat, more often then not the local council or social security could do nothing to help. But if I went to the Biscuit Fund, they would have £30 for the meter by the end of the day.While the fund’s founding members have remained, the team has grown to 52, including a nurse, benefits experts and a tax specialist. Like Jemima, many of the volunteers are ill or disabled – or, as Jemima puts it, “they experience hardship themselves”. (Every volunteer is anonymous, even Jemima, who uses a pseudonym.)What’s striking is that, as the Biscuit Fund has expanded to meet the growing need, the number of people it helps each year has stayed roughly the same: around 250. Because people’s situations are largely getting worse, and the fund only exists on public donations, Jemima explains the team actually now has to say no more often.They recently had to vote to bring in the rule that they could no longer help pay off people’s arrears. There are simply too many requests. “That broke my heart,” Jemima says.I ask Jemima who the fund helps nowadays, and she sums it up: “poor and desperate people”. A 19-year-old with learning disabilities whose mum had just died they paid for flowers for the funeral. A homeless man given a hotel for a few nights it was freezing out, and the room kept him safe while his care worker looked for accommodation. The mum with kids escaping domestic violence her new flat was unfurnished, and the fund gave her £100 for a fridge. A vulnerable man about to give up his cat because he couldn’t buy flea treatment until the fund paid it, he was going to have to give his companion away.As new Tory governments have come and gone, as austerity has gone on, Jemima has seen these human causalities first-hand. She finds it hard to contain her anger, most recently watching the “disaster” of universal credit unfold. “The brutal incompetence of this country ...” she starts, before pausing. “It feels like people are being left to die.”Charities such as the Biscuit Fund, she says, are the only thing helping them survive. In addition to finding people online, the fund now also works on referrals from social workers, welfare rights advisers and housing workers – in other words, the state now comes to her charity for help.To date, the small team has raised and given away £100,000. I tell her it’s incredible, but Jemima is having none of it. “It’s a drop in the ocean, really,” she says. “It doesn’t feel like it’s enough.” She dreams of winning the EuroMillions, she laughs quietly, because she knows she could do so much good with it.That’s never more the case than at Christmas. December is typically the Biscuit Fund’s busiest time of year as families struggle to afford gifts and food on top of the rent and bills. “You can’t explain to a child that Santa can’t bring presents because we need the gas on,” Jemima says. “It’s heartbreaking.”Over the next couple of weeks, the Biscuit Fund will try to spread as much festive joy as they can – say, £50 for a turkey joint for Christmas dinner and a small present for a child who otherwise wouldn’t get one. Jemima admits that, when things can seem so bleak, it’s a shot of hope for her as much as for the families themselves. “It’s small but important,” she says. “It’s saying ‘someone cares.’”You can donate to the Biscuit Fund here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a50683d3e84295e27f7f0660e6471ee683c6e8da/521_114_5057_3035/master/5057.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4889eba24aa3e96f64cc80afd18ad730","title":"windrush mbe queen empire ms dynamite mbe","story":"Honouring my Windrush grandparents and their sacrifices they made trumps my long-held negative feelings about empireI never thought I’d be someone who would accept an honour from the Queen. As an artist, I’ve been outspoken. My music has been honest and challenging, and I’ve never shied away from writing songs about hardship, inequality and injustice. And when I was younger and saw well-known people of colour collecting MBEs and OBEs, I’d be thinking: why would you want that? No, I told myself, I’d never accept one.So when I found out I was being offered an MBE in the Queen’s birthday honours, my initial reaction was – no way. I had long-held, deep, negative feelings about empire, establishment, colonisation, the suffering it caused and the suffering that continues today.So why, on Thursday, will I be at Buckingham Palace receiving that MBE for my services to music? What changed? The invitation coincided with the Windrush scandal, where it emerged that people who had come to the UK from the Caribbean as British subjects before 1973 – as part of the effort to rebuild after the second world war – were wrongly detained, denied access to medical care and benefits to which they were entitled, and were in some cases deported.Everything I heard and read about the shocking way the government had been treating this generation seemed to reinforce my decision to reject the honour.But as I read and listened to the stories, something changed in me. My grandmother Millie came to England in the late 1950s, part of the Windrush generation. She was in her early 20s. She arrived alone, with no coat in the freezing cold – she couldn’t believe how cold it was – and a mix-up meant she didn’t meet up with her two sisters who had come before her, so she was on her own for a while. She encountered a country that was openly hostile, that wouldn’t let her into certain premises because of the colour of her skin, and which let her know from every angle that she wasn’t welcome. I can’t begin to know how she felt, or what it did to her self-esteem.However, she was determined to stick it out and lay the foundations for what she hoped would be a brighter future for her children, grandchildren and generations to follow. What she, my grandfather, my step-grandparents and thousands of other people like her went through is unimaginable and often overlooked.So as I sat, torn over my decision, it became clear and very simple. I would accept the MBE – not because I want to be part of the establishment, or had suddenly stopped caring about the damaging legacy of empire and colonialism, or that it was suddenly all OK, but because I wanted to honour my grandparents, and all of their generation, and the extraordinary sacrifices they made.Nothing I have achieved would have been possible without them. I may get the recognition but the legwork was done for my generation by people like my grandparents, who don’t get the recognition. It is important to me that their journey and everything they faced isn’t forgotten.I’ve spent a lot of my life angry about how people’s choices affect others. However, I’ve come to a place of understanding, where I want to bridge gaps rather than contribute to fear and negativity. Nothing and no one is my enemy.I have to do what feels right in my heart, and now nothing feels more important than honouring my grandparents Millie, Anastacia, Brinsley and George.Making music was never about getting awards or acknowledgement. If my music has resonated with people, or helped them with something they’ve been going through, that is a blessing. And not many people get to do things their way, challenge inequality or the status quo, express themselves freely, and still get recognised in this way.Millie is in her 80s now and in a nursing home. She has Alzheimer’s and doesn’t communicate much. But when I went to see her and I told her, “Nan, I’m going to accept this honour from the Queen, for you, because I wouldn’t be who I am without you”, her face lit up and she smiled, and I knew she understood. It felt like a huge honour to do this for her now, when a lot of life isn’t making much sense to her.I know there are people who disagree with the honours system, and I respect that. But awards can be whatever you want them to be and, for me, my MBE means My Beloved Elders. I dedicate it to all of you.• Niomi McLean-Daley, aka Ms Dynamite, is a rapper, singer, songwriter and producer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5a956f55e08040b7639f5d536773713bcfdc977/0_2_941_565/master/941.jpg?width=940\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45e903a898d69a2092d77de6cc4cecfb 940w","title":"bradford music teacher shortlisted for 1m global education prize","story":"Jimmy Rotheram one of three teachers from England in running for international awardA music teacher who helped turn around a once-failing primary school in Bradford with a radical programme of music and creative education is one of three teachers from England shortlisted for a $1m global prize.Jimmy Rotheram, of Feversham primary academy, is one of 50 teachers from around the world on the shortlist for the Varkey Foundation “best teacher” prize, selected out of more than 10,000 nominations from 179 countries. The winner will be announced next March.His nomination for the high-profile award comes as concerns increase that music is being squeezed out of the national curriculum in England. Rotheram has gone in the opposite direction, providing his pupils with up to seven hours of music tuition a week. His work is based on the Kodály method, which is nurturing rather than critical and helps children to learn through singing and playing musical games.Rotheram, whose pioneering work was featured in the  last year, was delighted to be shortlisted. “It’s a tremendous honour,” he said. “What I’m most happy about is that music is being recognised as a globally important subject. Music is often a subject that is swept under the carpet.”Andrew Moffat, an assistant headteacher from a primary school in Birmingham who developed an education programme to teach children about equality and tolerance, is also shortlisted for the prize.Moffat, who works at Parkfield community school, developed his No Outsiders policy – which has since been published as a handbook – to teach inclusiveness and promote tolerance of ersity. It grew out of his own experience of being forced to leave his previous school after a backlash over his sexuality.The third UK teacher on the shortlist is Emma Russo, a physics and science teacher at South Hampstead high, a private girls’ school in north London, who has worked to break down the barriers which prevent girls from pursuing a career in science.Sunny Varkey, the founder of the Varkey education foundation and the Global Teacher prize, said: “Congratulations to Emma, Andrew and Jimmy for reaching the final 50. I hope their stories inspire those looking to enter the teaching profession and highlights the incredible work teachers do all over the world every day.”Last year’s winner, Andria Zafirakou, an arts and textiles teacher from Alperton community school in Brent, north-west London, was the first UK teacher to win the award since its inception five years ago.

One its most distinctive features is how our students are far more likely to move away from home to attend university – and not solely for the most prestigious institutions.Many of our university campuses, courses, and activities are based on the assumption that students will live on or close to campus, and co-habit with other students. But this is no longer the case for at least a quarter of UK university undergraduates. In my research with the vice-chancellor of the University of Greenwich, Prof David Maguire, we found that at ten universities, students living in the parental or  home make up the majority of full-time undergraduates, including City University London, the University of Wolverhampton and the University of Bradford. Universities in post-industrial towns and large, erse cities where living costs are increasing - particularly London - are most likely to have large numbers of commuter students.Commuter students are also more likely to be from a disadvantaged or underrepresented group: they tend to be first-in-family students, to come from a lower-income household, to be mature students and to have an ethnic minority background.Commuters are also more likely to struggle whilst studying. Universities with higher proportions of commuter students are more likely to have lower student satisfaction rates, and almost one in ten commuter students say they wouldn’t have gone to university if they could make their decision again, which is higher than for any other group.The challenges faced by commuters who do not live with their fellow students or must travel long distances are many and varied. They can include financial difficulties, given the high costs of public transport and motoring, and many commuters may choose not to live in increasingly expensive halls of residence for financial reasons in the first place. Travel has been proven to cause stress and challenges for all workers, and students are no different. Delays, cancellations and traffic can lead to missed classes and waste precious available study time, particularly if students are working part-time to make ends meet.University courses and social environments may also not be best suited to the pace and rhythms of life for commuter students. Inconvenient timetabling of taught sessions is more disruptive to commuters. A lack of adequate common rooms and locker facilities can leave commuters feel they lack a “home” on campus. And not living in halls can make socialising difficult, taking part in extra-curricular activities, or making connections for group work and studying.The importance of ensuring that all students have an equally fulfilling and enriching time, regardless of where they live, will become even more pressing if the sector is to continue widening access beyond the middle classes. The greatest increase in commuter student numbers came during the last significant acceleration in university participation during the mid-1990s, not long after the creation of new universities out of the former polytechnics.Tim Blackman, vice-chancellor of Middlesex University, has also argued that growing the number of students studying locally could have wider benefits. “It is less costly to students and taxpayers, greener in transport terms and would take pressure off many local housing markets,” writes Blackman, who notes that such an approach could pave the way to a return of “free” higher education and the abolition of tuition fees.If governments of either party are serious about opening up the opportunities of university to all, and also reducing the overall costs to both students and taxpayers, then commuting will become an even more common option. The challenge is to avoid creating a two-tiered university experience, with only the more privileged moving away from home and enjoying the benefits that geographical mobility can bring, while their less privileged peers stay at home for a less rewarding experience."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f815cf6f7f93b41108e541e898d4104e93f569d9/36_0_3427_2057/master/3427.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af947a579704788e00dbcb010412b3ac","title":"university acceptance rates for students with lower grades on the rise","story":"Ucas figures show increase in proportion of 18-year-olds with three Cs or lower at A-level University acceptance rates among students who achieve C and D grades at A-level are on the increase, according to the latest official statistics, revealing that record proportions of English and Scottish 18-year-olds were accepted into university this year.The figures, published by the university admissions service Ucas, would fuel fears of a bums-on-seats approach to recruitment by some institutions, as they struggle to fill courses due to a decline in the number of 18-year-olds.The proportion of those missing their predicted grades by three or more grades has increased by 3.3 percentage points since 2017, and 11.5 percentage points since 2013. Clare Marchant, the Ucas chief, said universities should be “mindful” of accepting applicants with lower grades.She said: “We’re working with schools and universities to improve the accuracy of predicted grades, exploring the different ways teachers make predictions, and how they are used by admissions teams when making offers. Our good practice guide will be published in the new year.”The Ucas figures were released as the new universities’ regulator, the Office for Students, published what it described as “ambitious” targets, challenging universities “to eliminate the gaps in access and student success within 20 years”.The targets aim to eliminate gaps in entry rates at the most selective universities between the most and least represented groups drop-out rates between the most and least represented groups degree outcomes between white and black students, and degree outcomes between disabled and non-disabled students.Damian Hinds, the education secretary, called for specific action to improve access for white working-class children, and to ensure that groups of students who were currently less likely to complete their courses, such as black students, stay on until the end of their studies.He said: “I see no reason why race or background should be a factor in whether a student can access and benefit from the opportunities that higher education provides – and we must all share a collective endeavour to tear down these barriers where they exist.”Sarah Stevens, the head of policy at the Russell group of universities, said an average of £1,100 was spent per student per year on programmes to widen participation at institutions in the Russell group, adding: “We strongly urge the government to protect this level of investment through its current review of university funding”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/749df71f2f36fa864ab8da4bb04bf46018e35920/0_300_6266_3760/master/6266.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfc6307e00703d14de7dc6b2b84f256f","title":"we could smell the boat approaching grim truth animal exports israel haifa","story":"Broken bones and other injuries are common for sheep and cattle held on ships for weeks in cramped pens. Photojournalist  Jo-Anne McArthur tracked the 22,000 arrivals on one boat in Israel’s Haifa portHundreds of thousands of live animals are transported each year on ships from Australia and Europe to the Middle East. The route from Australia to Israel is particularly long – the journey is three weeks at sea, where cattle and sheep are often kept in cramped pens for the duration.It’s estimated this year Israel will import 114,040 animals (cattle and sheep) from Australia, and 409,123 sheep and 169,991 cattle from Europe. Though these figures are lower than the previous year, in general live imports have been on the rise. Israel is expected to import 700,000 live animals this year – up from 200,000 in 2012.In July, I went to Israel to photograph the Australian ships coming into port in Haifa. One of the boats, the Bahijah, was carrying an estimated 22,000 animals.I spent a week monitoring the ships at port, waiting for news of one of the live imports. When we heard the Bahijah was coming in, we managed to rent a yacht that morning and meet the ship at sea. I was able to photograph the ship and the animals from a distance.The ship completely dwarfed us. I was struck by the smell. Even from further away we could smell the boat approaching. At almost every window you could see animals crowded together. The ones at the windows are lucky because they’re getting fresh air.The movement from the sea is really unsteady, and the animals are not used to that: in some cases they suffer injuries and broken bones. In April, a whistleblower employed on a live export ship worked with Animals Australia to reveal the situation on board a vessel. Footage from five shipments from Australia to the Middle East appeared to show sheep covered in faeces and severely decomposed bodies left in pens with living sheep. In one particular journey, more than 880 animals died during the course of the voyage.The story doesn’t end when the ships arrive at port.From here, the animals are unloaded on to trucks. This can take up to 12 and even 16 hours because there are thousands of animals on board.The cattle and sheep are then transported cross-country. I trailed trucks for hours to feedlots near Eilat, and to quarantine in a settlement in the West Bank. The feedlots were dusty and crowded. The animals in quarantine were lethargic.Dead farm animals are routinely washing up on Tel Avivian public beaches. Due to the distressing conditions animals are in, many don’t survive the journey at sea and it’s believed their corpses are just thrown overboard. The washed-up animals often have the ears or heads missing, so their ear tags can’t be traced to identify the ships.The dead and dying in feedlots are also often disposed in the desert. I witnessed football field-sized parcels of land with mounds of manure and decomposing animal bodies that must have been there for decades. The images can’t convey the stench, or the flies. The future of the controversial live imports trade is uncertain. A bill has been proposed in the Israeli Knesset to phase out live imports of animals from Australia and Europe for slaughter because of the suffering it causes the animals. The bill would reduce the transportation of live animals while increasing tax-free imports of fresh meat, and encourage local production."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb383dabad3cef91dcbdbe483d02a0ad0015fa74/0_56_4476_2686/master/4476.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53d7bbcbdb7608e27f1762d7201d436c","title":"butterfly sanctuary border wall mission texas","story":"More than 200 species make their homes at America’s most erse sanctuary, but construction through the reserve could begin in FebruaryOn any given day at the National Butterfly Center in Mission, Texas, visitors can to see more than 60 varieties of butterflies. In the spring and fall, monarchs and other species can blanket the center’s 100 acres of subtropical bushlands that extend from the visitor center to to the banks of the Rio Grande river, where their property, and US sovereignty, end.“It’s like something from Fantasia,” said the center’s director, Marianna Wright. “When you walk you have to cover your mouth so you don’t suck in a butterfly.”Today the most erse butterfly sanctuary in the country, and other protected areas in the lower Rio Grande Valley along the US-Mexico border, are under threat. Last week, the US supreme court issued a ruling allowing the Trump administration to waive  28 federal laws, including the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Air Act, and begin construction on 33 new miles of border wall in the heart of the valley – and right through the butterfly center.“Environmental tourism contributes more than $450m to Hidalgo and Starr counties,” said Wright, referring to the adjacent counties in the valley. “Many of the properties people choose to visit to see birds, butterflies and threatened and endangered species are all going to be behind the border wall. For us, the economic impact is potentially catastrophic.”“Walls have fragmented our habitat,” said Scott Nicol, co-chair of the Sierra Club Borderland team. The various patches of land that provide refuge for these animals will become “less viable, with less and less places for them to go”.A July letter sent from US Customs and Border Protection to a not-for-profit environmental group and seen by the  describes the route and possible components of the project as including a 30ft-tall concrete and steel wall, roads, and a 150ft “enforcement zone” where all vegetation will be cleared.With construction of the wall due to begin in February, people like Nicol fear that the barrier will not only destroy habitat and undermine ecotourism but also lead to an increasingly deadly border as undocumented immigrants are pushed further and further into marginal and dangerous areas.“This is not just they will drive ocelots to extinction,” said Nicol, referring to the critically endangered wild cat found in the Rio Grande Valley. “Families trying to come into this country will be pushed into the desert to die.”“Border walls are death sentences for wildlife and humans alike,” said Amanda Munro of the Southwest Environmental Center, an organization that works to restore and protect native wildlife and habitats. “They block wild animals from accessing the food, water, and mates they need to survive. They weaken genetic ersity, fragment habitat, and trap animals in deadly floods. At the same time, they drive desperate asylum-seekers to risk their lives in the unforgiving desert.”For Donald Trump, the new section of the barrier is making good on a campaign promise to build a “big beautiful wall”. A barrier that will add to the nearly 700 miles of walls and fences that already exist on or near the border.More than 200 species of resident or migrating butterflies make homes at the butterfly center over the course of the year, including the vibrant Mexican bluewing, the tiny vicroy’s ministreak and the black swallowtail, all three of which carpet the wild dill at the property with their eggs each spring. The center opened in 2003 and is the flagship project of the North American Butterfly Association.Trump has expansive federal powers to construct the border wall on both private and public land. Since 2005, the Department of Homeland Security has had the power to waive numerous environmental laws in the name of national security.And the federal government can, and has, used eminent domain law to acquire privately owned land for public use.“We fully anticipate that they will seize the land by quick take,” said Wright, referring to a Depression-era provision of the eminent domain law that gives federal agencies the right to take property without compensation or adjudication. “Legal claims are not addressed or settled. You don’t get your day in court. You don’t get to negotiate appraisals or offers. Nothing,” said Wright.On Tuesday, the president threatened to use defense spending if his plans to build the wall were challenged. “If the Democrats do not give us the votes to secure our Country, the Military will build the remaining sections of the Wall,” Trump said in a tweet.For Wright, this threat could mean the end of the butterfly center and enormous harm to its dozens of butterfly species and the threatened Texas tortoise, Texas indigo snake, and Texas horned lizard that are also found there.“It is truly a sight to behold,” said Wright, looking out from the bank of the Rio Grande river.“They are violating our constitutionally protected rights, and that should terrify everyone,” she said. “Even if you don’t care about butterflies, you should care about this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db53008aa81e3dfa164ed96c72ff1e9c88604f73/0_65_1973_1184/master/1973.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c38cd1b2aad73c61671080b03d22cd45","title":"if beale street could talk barry jenkins shows that more is less","story":"In his follow-up to best picture winner Moonlight, the director’s mixed adaptation of a James Baldwin classic boasts lush visuals but a flawed scriptFrom a lush opening shot designed to astound to costume choices that aim for awe, Barry Jenkins’ If Beale Street Could Talk, his much-anticipated follow-up to game-changing best picture winner Moonlight, shows a world suffused with glamour.At its best, the director’s adaptation of James Baldwin’s 70s-set Harlem romance recalls the work of Wong Kar Wai (a film-maker Jenkins has often referenced) with its unbroken shots of hands touching and gazing lovers set to crackly soul records.

Her urgent voiceover dominates both Baldwin’s text and Jenkins’ film, supplying the tale with sinew for a series of vignettes, presented to us out of order. Jenkins’ obsessive fealty to these words, presented almost verbatim on screen, is admirable, given how rare it is to see Baldwin on the big screen, but it creates a peculiar distance for the viewer. Too often we hear what’s happening as it occurs. In the first scene where Tish visits Fonny in jail, she states “I hope that nobody has ever had to look at anybody they love through glass”. Yet, through Jenkins’ trademark close-ups and the powerful performances of the pair, this sentiment is already perfectly expressed and the words end up muting the visuals.Too often, Jenkins seems more comfortable elegantly moving beautifully dressed and coiffed innocents through Baldwin’s text than expressing the spirit of the work itself. Tish is the primary victim of this, deprived of the agency she has in the novel. Her childhood ambivalence towards Fonny – in the book she stabs him with a rusty nail when he hits her – is erased in favor of Malickian shots of them taking bubble baths together. It’s one of many minor erasures of Baldwin’s perceptive feminine portrait that leaves only a stereotypical naif in her place.One can’t ignore that Tish is a black woman living in 70s New York and so there needs to be consideration of who can act freely in a world where choice is constricted by class, race and gender. Yet in Moonlight, the protagonist Chiron’s identity as a queer black man living in a housing project in Miami didn’t make it as difficult for us to identify agency, subtly conveyed by how he chose to speak and act to protect himself from the difficulties waiting for him at home or at school. His attempts to strain against the waves crashing against him make for some of the film’s most effective scenes and what’s confounding is that in Moonlight, dialogue is mostly kept at a minimum, especially from Chiron. Conversely, Beale Street to its detriment cages its characters in the often stuffy, untouched dialogue of a prestige literary adaptation.The precedent for this situation Barry Jenkins has found himself in is that there’s really no precedent for Barry Jenkins. Moonlight was the first best picture with a black gay protagonist with the second smallest budget of any winner. The film’s refusal to compromise was part of its DNA – not just with its blackness or its queerness but with its artfulness, not always a quality that’s highly rewarded by the stiff Academy. With his follow-up, the playing field has suddenly transformed. This was a passion project in the most earnest terms. Jenkins had already started the conversation with Baldwin’s estate before Moonlight’s release and the faithfulness of his adaptation helped to calm any of their concerns.While Moonlight went on to win best picture and Jenkins picked up the Oscar for best screenplay, along with playwright Tarell Alvin McCraney, best director that year went to Damien Chazelle for La La Land. It was a colorful musical with ambitious production design, showcasing the work of a film-maker who the Academy would more typically reward over something as lo-fi as Moonlight. But that could change with Jenkins’ slicker, more Oscar-friendly follow-up. That particular honor has yet to be awarded to a black film-maker and Jenkins is only the second black director of a best picture winner – Steve McQueen was the first for Twelve Years A Slave. This year, he’s competing in a category unusually stacked with other contenders of color with a film that ticks more of the Academy’s more obvious boxes.It might give him the edge over Boots Riley’s capitalist satire Sorry To Bother You, Ryan Coogler’s afro-futurist adventure Black Panther, and Spike Lee’s anti-racist crowd-pleaser BlacKkKlansman. Jenkins stands out in his pursuit of something completely, refreshingly different, he’s a craftsman of epic poem-like films, an arthouse auteur – a designation that’s often only given to a black director once dead, such as Kathleen Collins, or far outside of the mainstream, like Charles Burnett.But with Beale Street, Jenkins clumsily navigates between two worlds. His attempt to represent Baldwin’s work with vibrant and artfully over-designed black excellence has led to a cleansing of the racist, sullied New York of the novel. Unlike the grounded specificity one saw in Moonlight, with Beale Street, the audience is given a stage-managed Harlem in all its studio-made beauty. This extends to the characters as well. Fonny and Tish are portrayed as victims of extreme oppression, understandable at the time, but by pushing them as angelic flawless creatures, it creates a film without much central conflict. For much of the film, Jenkins seems comfortable with holding us from his characters at a distance, as if they were museum exhibits, carefully constructed but straining to come alive.There are flashes of life. The one scene that’s been universally adored by critics is a family confrontation near the beginning, that’s also been used in the most effective trailer (Anthony Lane of The New Yorker called it the film’s “fizzing” highlight). It’s a rare moment of immersion and Jenkins also manages to convey love’s fretful early glances and a sculptor’s gentle work with a balanced gravity. Yet, the balance too often tips and one could argue that Jenkins’s attempts to imitate a master of a different form has led to a leaden creation. Baldwin’s pressing work somehow becomes a relic of 70s nostalgia that lacks the ability to contemporize their struggle in a still racist America. The novel never struggled with this. It’s hard not to read the following description of the forces ready to assault the black working class, “they know exactly when the flesh is ready, when the spirit cannot fight back”, and not think of the recent case of a woman whose child was ripped from her at a benefit office in Brooklyn by the police. The nasty New York Baldwin presents is still extant even if Jenkins is unable to portray it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d1541f841eed8ce45d0516da9aca9c8af1641c1/0_40_1280_767/master/1280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e30aa964a1cf4a0baa2b379b02b943d","title":"les miserables with contemporary relevance to air on bbc","story":"Victor Hugo’s historical novel brought up to date in Andrew Davies adaptationWith social unrest brewing in France and Emmanuel Macron accused by protesters of being the “president of the rich”, the BBC is to air an adaptation of Victor Hugo’s historical novel Les Misérables, which the writer Andrew Davies says has been given a timely “contemporary relevance” by the injustices and isions within society today.The BBC has brought Hugo’s novel “right into the 21st century”, according to its director general, Tony Hall, with one of its most “inclusive casts” ever.But Davies (who penned the famous BBC adaptations of Pride and Prejudice and War \u0026amp Peace, and true to form has a scene in Les Misérables in which Dominic West’s character, Jean Valjean, bares his bottom) has also highlighted the isions laid out in Hugo’s epic story about revolutionary France in the 19th century, which he says reflect the current alarming gap between rich and poor. “It’s got a kind of obvious contemporary relevance,” said Davies during a preview screening of the BBC One drama in London.With the BBC keen to ensure more erse cast and crew are used, Les Misérables has colour-blind casting and features the Silent Witness actor Liz Carr, who is disabled.David Oyelowo, who stars as Valjean’s pursuer, Javert, said: “The really radical thing that we’ve been doing is to take a 150-year-old novel and transpose it on to English life. The reason to do that is to make that relevant to the wide audience we want to speak to. So in relation to the casting it’s just an extension of that. We live in a society that looks like this, so therefore to make a 150-year-old novel feel like it’s relevant to everyone here you want to see yourself in it.”Although the BBC’s adaptation features background artists speaking in French, to highlight class ision the stars speak in various British accents, with West adopting a northern twang.The director, Tom Shankland, explained the reasoning: “The novel is … about a very ided society in France, so as we were making this for an English-language audience I think you’re missing a trick if you don’t speak to that audience in a language they understand.“There are class isions which we perceive on the basis of accents, so the simplest rule that we found was really to nod towards those rules that we have in our own ided society.”Although many viewers will know Les Misérables from the West End musical and Hollywood’s version starring Russell Crowe, the BBC’s adaptation features no musical numbers and instead goes back to Hugo’s classic.Davies – who adapted the acclaimed original BBC version of House of Cards and shot to fame after featuring Colin Firth as a dripping Mr Darcy emerging from a lake in Pride and Prejudice – is known for highlighting nuances in classical literature to give his dramas new appeal.In addition to the appearance of West’s bottom, which Shankland confirmed was the actor’s and not a body double’s, Davies said he thought Javert pursued his former captor and “he may possibly even be in love with him in a strange way”.Les Miséables starts on BBC One on 30 December."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0eadbe3f6fd4ee0e20382a213506b44ce587433a/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9df93e8df85cb2bea9b7de0ad945848d","title":"champions league last 16 draw who plays who team guide","story":"Liverpool, Spurs and Manchester United face the prospect of daunting ties after the cream rose to the top in the groupsThe Premier League will supply a quarter of the teams in the Champions League last-16 draw, which will take place at 11am on Monday.

Group winners will be drawn against second-placed teams, with the top seed enjoying home advantage in the second leg. VAR will be used for the rest of the competition.Borussia Dortmund Beat a poor Monaco side to top Group A. Lucien Favre’s team thumped second-placed Atlético 4-0 in Germany but lost 2-0 in Madrid – their only defeat so far this season. BVB lead the Bundesliga by seven points after beating their Ruhr derby rivals Schalke at the weekend.Barcelona Have reached the last 16 for a record 12th season in a row, clinching first place in Group B with a 2-1 success at PSV Eindhoven before the 1-1 draw with Tottenham at the Camp Nou. The La Liga frontrunners remain unbeaten at home in 29 Champions League ties, a run that started way back in September 2013.Paris Saint-Germain Have qualified for the knockout stages for the past seven seasons and are having a prolific campaign. Their 70 goals in all competitions are more than any other team in Europe’s big five leagues. Manchester City rank next on 68.Porto The current Primeira Liga leaders won five Champions League games in a row to top Group D and are victorious in their last 12 matches in all competitions.

Domestically the Bavarians have been poor under Niko Kovac and sit third in the Bundesliga table, nine points behind Borussia Dortmund.Manchester City Had a poor start, losing 2-1 at home to Lyon, but quickly gained momentum and sealed their place in the last 16 with a game to spare with the 2-2 draw in France.

Santiago Solari’s side still topped Group B with a game to spare, though, and a 2-0 victory at Roma showed they remain a force to be reckoned with. Their record is formidable: they have lost only six of their last 38 European matches.Juventus Manchester United’s 2-1 win in Turin meant Juve had to wait until their penultimate fixture to progress. A 1-0 win at home to Valencia ensured the Italians have not failed to reach the last 16 since 2013-14 and they lead Serie A by eight points but they lost their final group game at Young Boys.Atlético Madrid Sealed their place in the round of 16 with a match to spare by beating Monaco but missed the chance to top their group after drawing 0-0 at Club Brugge on Tuesday. Diego Simeone’s side have reached two Champions League and three Europa League finals in the last nine seasons and sit third in La Liga.Tottenham Spurs would be the first to admit their good fortune in reaching the last 16 after a poor start, losing 2-1 at Internazionale and being thumped 4-2 by Barcelona at Wembley. But PSV and Inter were beaten at home and then came that 1-1 draw at Barça.

By then Mourinho had introduced Ashley Young, Jesse Lingard and Marcus Rashford, all of whom he had not wanted to play, confirming they would be starters against Liverpool on Sunday by saying “you have to find eight more”. He felt that the opportunity he had handed others here, Paul Pogba among them, had been passed up. Instead, he suggested they had merely confirmed that he was right to have harboured doubts.“Did you learn anything?” the United manager was asked. “No, maybe you did, not me,” he said. “I didn’t learn anything from this game – at all. Nothing that happened surprised me at all.“I expect more from my players, especially players that, week in, week out, they ask why they don’t play, why they don’t start,” he continued. “It was a good match to play, without any kind of pressure, in a competition that everyone likes to play in. And in the end my team improved really when I made changes I didn’t want to make, which is frustrating because I didn’t want to play the three players that I played in the second half.”Asked if the performance from his players was good enough, Mourinho first shot the question back. When it was reformulated and he was asked if he was pleased with them, his response was short. “No, I am not pleased,” he eventually said. And when he was asked how he felt about United going behind for a 10th time in 15 games, he replied: “What do you think my answer is?”“That it drives you mad,” came the response, to which Mourinho shrugged and smiled."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a893f9a47e6518d2e467da7c2499648c78df0a8f/0_486_4903_2942/master/4903.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52c1d5ac590d8d8ff1fa936fd400d0b7","title":"bury new owner steve dale financial misery historic club","story":"Little is known about ‘very successful businessman’ Steve Dale, who has taken over League Two club paddling to stay afloatBury football club announced a takeover on Tuesday, saying the owner, the Lancashire‑based property developer Stewart Day, had handed control to Steve Dale, about whom the club statement said little, beyond that he is “a very successful businessman”.More details about Dale and his businesses are promised imminently a club spokesperson told the  that Dale had been retired in recent years because of a severe illness, from which he has been given the all clear.“Mr Dale decided to return to business in a more philanthropic way, helping younger people and others who have lost hope,” a spokesperson said. “Having heard about Bury, he felt he could bring business acumen to the club … and resolve the problems the club has been facing.”Bury’s announcement acknowledged that last season’s relegation from League One “hit the club hard”, causing “cash flow issues” at a club that periodically skidded towards financial difficulties since Day’s ownership began in May 2013.Ryan Lowe’s team secured a 2-0 win over Exeter City on Saturday to stay in solid contention for League Two promotion, which was a spirited achievement for his players considering that many had not yet been paid their November wages. A source close to the players told the  that up to 11 had not been paid by then the club said Day settled the wages owed before he left.The Pensions Regulator is also understood to have been in contact with Bury after money deducted from players’ wages for contributions were not in fact paid into their pensions. In a letter from the pension provider, seen by the , one player was informed that five months’ contributions, between last December and April this year, were not fully paid into his pension.A spokesperson for the Pensions Regulator said its policy was not to comment on inidual cases but explained that such situations were not exceptional. More than 6,000 unpaid contribution notices were sent to employers between July and September this year, she said.The Professional Footballers’ Association’s assistant chief executive, the former Blackburn Rovers and Queens Park Rangers midfield player Simon Barker, is understood to have been negotiating on behalf of the Bury players for the late wage payments.Some suppliers are also said to have not been paid on time. The club spokesperson said following the takeover: “It is early days but lettersemails are going out to the creditors this week and a thorough audit is being carried out by our accountants, MGR Weston Kay. Once the information is collated a plan will be implemented and all creditors paid in full.”Bury is a club of deep football heritage which now paddles doggedly to stay afloat, having long been absorbed into the Manchester United and City catchment areas, since the double FA Cup-winning heyday in the early years of the 20th century. Day took over during another downturn of financial trouble and has kept the club going, promoted to League One in 2015 then down again last season, while taking out high-interest loans and in 2016 being repeatedly hit with winding-up petitions for unpaid tax by HM Revenue and Customs, which were ultimately settled.The current position had begun to look difficult again, for the 3,000 loyal souls who huddled into Gigg Lane to support Bury at the victory over Exeter. Just last month the club borrowed an unspecified amount of money secured on the lounge and sports bar at the entrance to the ground, from Express Loan Corporation, which is registered in the tax haven of Monaco. Another mortgage was secured on Gigg Lane itself last October, when the club borrowed £1.6m from a Liverpool-based loan company, Capital Bridging Finance Solutions. The interest rates for these loans are not stated on the public documents.In 2016 Day and his co-director, Glenn Thomas, had stated that Day’s company, SG Sports Management, had been supporting the club with credit but after that company was dissolved they said the facility was now being provided by a different company, Mederco (BFC) Ltd. Companies House records show Mederco (BFC) Ltd to be a year and three months late filing its 2015-16 accounts, and it was in April subject to a notice of being struck off the company register that action was discontinued on Tuesday.The most recently published accounts for Bury FC itself, for the year to 31 May 2017, when the club survived in League One, show a loss made of £2.8m. A different Day company, Mederco Ltd, was stated to have loaned the club £4.2m, and the accounts said that Day was prepared to transfer that debt into shares, effectively writing off repayment, if necessary. Mederco Ltd’s Companies House filings show that it has twice been given notice of compulsory strike off for failure to file required information, and the 2016-17 accounts are now three months overdue. The 2016 accounts show that Mederco had loaned £5m to five associated Day companies. The club spokesperson suggested that Day’s loans would be repaid in full, along with the club’s other creditors.Day, announcing his departure on Tuesday, hailed the boost to the club’s youth development operation from the move in 2015 – on a five-year lease – to the Carrington training complex, which Manchester City vacated for their £200m Etihad campus academy.“I feel I have left the club in a stronger position than it was in when I arrived,” he said, explaining that he was leaving the club “with a heavy heart”, to spend more time with his family."},{"url":null,"title":"tell us what was your favourite game of 2018","story":"As we publish the ’s top 20 video games of 2018, we want to hear what you’ve been playingThe year in video games has truly brought something for everyone, whether you’re into cute stories about anthropomorphic mice, psychedelic Tetris, or unnervingly detailed historical role-play in the Old West.

SylviaWhat is the best gaming PC I can buy for around £500? JeanI am on the point of finally getting a gaming console for my children, but I must admit to being a bit stumped as to whether I should be getting a PS4, PS4 Pro, Xbox One, Xbox One S or Xbox One X? My kids will mainly want to play new-ish games, and watch TV shows through streaming. Do you have any advice? PatrickIt’s only three months since I answered the question Sylvia read – What’s the best gaming PC for under £1,000? – but some readers are looking for cheaper options in the run-up to Christmas.The HP Omen 880-100na has a solid specification: a 6-core Intel Core i5-8400 with 8GB of memory, an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 graphics card, a 128GB SSD and a 1TB hard drive. To save money, you’d have to lower one or more specifications, meaning performance would take a hit.To get the price under £500, you might have to drop down to a Core i3-8100 processor, downgrade the graphics card, and give up the SSD. Just don’t reduce the memory to 4GB.This doesn’t mean a RyzenVega chip will perform as well as GeForce 1060. It does mean that you will be able to play decent games on a budget while you save up for a good graphics card, if you find you need one. That’s the great thing about desktop PCs: you can add more memory, bigger drives and faster graphics cards for many years after you have bought them.The choice generally comes down to a Ryzen 3 2200G with Vega 8 graphics or the more expensive Ryzen 5 2400G with Vega 11 graphics. While both are quad-core processors, the Ryzen 5 supports twice as many threads, so should have better performance. However, side-by-side comparisons on YouTube suggest there’s not a massive difference, and for budget PC gaming, the Ryzen 3 2200G looks unbeatable value for money.The opportunity to sell cheap RyzenVega games PCs was immediately clear to small British PC manufacturers, and there may be dozens of models available. UK suppliers include Chillblast, Cyberpower, Falcon, Fierce, Gladiator, Mesh, Novatech, Overclockers, PC Specialist, Punch Technology, Scan, Stormforce, Utopia and Zoostorm. I haven’t checked all their websites, but I expect most of them offer at least a couple of models. The problem is that I have no way of knowing which is best, or even if there is a best.All these companies are assembling the same types of PC from similar parts, and they often build them to order, so you can vary the specifications to suit your own preferences. It would take a long time to research all the options and compare possible builds on PC Partpicker, which is what a real PC gamer would do. The best motherboards really do cost more.One point to watch out for is that not all the headline prices include an operating system. “Windows 10 Compatible” may well mean it’s not provided. I assume they can’t get the same volume discounts as Lenovo, Dell and HP, which sell tens of millions of PCs every year.The Chillblast Fusion Imp would do the job for £499.99. It has a Ryzen 3 2200G with 8GB of memory and a 1TB Seagate FireCuda – a sort of hybrid hard drive that includes a small SSD.Fierce PC’s version, the Ironwing Savage, has the same spec for £439.95, so you can add a 240GB SSD for £29.95, making the final price £469.90. (Remember to make the SSD the boot drive.)The alternative from Scan – by Royal Appointment – already includes a 240GB SSD for £499.98, and comes in a more sober case.Bear in mind that I have not seen or tested any of these machines. Your final purchasing decision should be based on your own research.The list of games consoles is mercifully short, and the final choice isn’t particularly important, unless your kids require some specific games or want to play with friends online. While some games can be played online across different brands of consoles, many can’t, so it’s often best to just match the brand used by your children’s friends.For most of this century, it’s been a two-horse race between Microsoft’s Xbox and Sony’s PlayStation, notwithstanding some oddball entries from Nintendo including the recent Switch, which is proving popular.If money is no object, the best hardware is the Xbox One X (£449.99), followed by the cheaper PS4 Pro (£349), but you’d need a 4K TV set to get the best out of either. For most buyers, the best buys are the Xbox One S (£249.99) and the PS4 Slim (£259). All four have 8GB of memory and custom 8-core AMD processors, though the graphics and storage vary somewhat. They can all run apps for streaming, including BBC iPlayer, something the Nintendo Switch cannot.These are suggested prices but there are plenty of cheap bundles with various games.One thing that ides the two ranges is access to exclusive games. The Xbox offers long-running franchises such as Halo, Gears of War and Forza Motorsport, plus this year’s Sea of Thieves. The PlayStation has God of War, Gran Turismo, The Last , Street Fighter 5 and this year’s classic, Spider-Man. You can tell Sony has been edging it on exclusives because this year Microsoft bought another seven games studios.One difference is that Xbox “exclusives” often appear on PCs as well. This means (a) you should buy an Xbox because you can play some of the same games on your PC, or (b) you should buy a PlayStation because it has games you can’t play on a PC.If the main criterion is that your kids “want to play new-ish games”, that points towards the PS4. The volumes are about the same but the PlayStation exclusives swing it all other things being equal.However, bear in mind that we are approaching the end of the current console cycle and we can expect an Xbox Two and a PS5 – or whatever they might be called – in 2020. My guess is that both of them will be AMD-based and compatible with today’s games, but at this point, a second-hand console might be the most cost-effective option.Have you got a question?

From the coolest new clubs to harder-to-find watering holes, places to eat and green spaces, only a Londoner can show you the best of what the city has to offerThere are many Londons to explore. From the bustle of Soho’s labyrinthine streets to the vertigo-inducing skyscrapers of the City, the capital has almost as many unique enclaves as its 8 million residents. With so much choice, and so much ground to cover, deciding what to do in 24 hours can be a daunting task. Even for myself, a lifelong Londoner, there are always new places to find and old favourites to rediscover. With TripAdvisor at hand though, a healthy appetite for all things cultural, and a topped-up Oyster card, you’d be surprised just how much you can fit in and how quickly you’ll find yourself an honorary Londoner.One of London’s great virtues is its ersity walk through pretty much any part of town and you’ll see different communities living side-by-side and sharing the best of what their cultures have to offer. If you’re arriving by rail into Euston, you can do no wrong with a traditional fry-up breakfast from the quaint bistro Cappadocia. Sit on its garden furniture and stuff yourself with fried delicacies and all the trimmings. Just a short walk away, there’s Drummond Street – famed for its community of Indian restaurants. If a fry-up doesn’t tickle the tastebuds, then try a masala dosa, a traditional south Indian breakfast of thin rice pancakes stuffed with potato curry.You’ll no doubt need a walk after all of that, so hop on the tube for a few stops to the Barbican Centre, one of London’s most iconic brutalist buildings and cultural centres. Grab a coffee and take a seat in the courtyard by the fountains and then wander into the centre and explore the free art displays at the Curve gallery (recent displays have included the films of John Akomfrah and the startling photography of Richard Mosse). Or, check out the main gallery for larger exhibitions, including the stunning recent retrospective of painter Jean-Michel Basquiat.If you’re visiting with a family, on Sundays the Barbican conservatory is open – the second largest in London after Kew Gardens – and there you can take a stroll among more than 2,000 tropical plants and trees. Resident gardeners are on hand, holding bi-weekly tours to keep the kids entertained. The ground-level atrium also hosts regular free concerts and talks, encompassing everything from women in jazz to Indian percussion performances.If the tropical plants have fired the kids up for more exploration, it’s only a short walk from the Barbican to Postman’s Park – a hidden green gem. Throughout London you’ll find enclaves of natural space but none have quite the history or charm of Postman’s Park. Built in 1900 by the artist, philanthropist and radical socialist GF Watts, the secluded park is home to the Watts memorial, which was erected in honour of all of those among the Victorian working class who had given their lives in attempts to save others. Amid the hectic noise of the city, sit on the park’s benches and take in Watts’s plaques commemorating the acts of bravery that defined these heroic London lives.Ready for lunch yet? Jump on the bus, or take a walk through Farringdon to Exmouth Market where you can eat at food stalls serving everything from shawarma to risotto, pizza, and tapas. If you’re a sports fan, though, there’s no better place than the retro-themed Cafe Kick to grab a doorstop sandwich and then take on an unwitting opponent at a game of table football on the cafe’s French tables. Or if you’d rather something more sedate, down the road is Briki – home to deliciously strong Greek and third-wave coffee and a favourite of the local expat community.London has some of the best bookshops in the country, from the antiquarian booksellers in Mayfair, such as Sotheran’s – the oldest rare bookshop in the world – to the secondhand shops in Bloomsbury, such as the Dickens-named Jarndyce. But many of these titles will set you back hundreds, if not thousands, of pounds. Better for browsing is magCulture, a few minutes’ walk from Exmouth Market. Stocking thousands of coffee-table tomes and pocket-sized zines, covering everything from high fashion to slow journalism and interior design, there’s reading material for all tastes, and it definitely won’t break the bank.If you’ve nabbed yourself something you can’t wait to get stuck into, there’s no better setting than St Dunstan in the East for a spot of afternoon reading and relaxing. A few stops along on the Northern Line, St Dunstan is a 12th-century church near London Bridge which was largely destroyed in the second world war. Its remains now border a breathtaking public garden where you can sit among the medieval architecture and while away the hours.If it’s raining though (as London is wont to do), you could head into the Globe theatre on the South Bank instead. Here, Shakespeare’s theatre is recreated in all its rotund glory, and you can watch the Royal Shakespeare Company perform the Bard’s greats for only £5 if you stand in the pit, or go inside to the candlelit Sam Wanamaker Playhouse for a more intimate experience. And if you’re with children, don’t worry, the Globe’s child-friendly workshops and family tours will keep the kids awake and entertained. From the South Bank outside the Globe, you can also take in London’s skyline as dusk approaches.Stroll farther west down the south side of the Thames and then back over the river (take your choice of bridge – either Waterloo or Golden Jubilee) and on to Soho, where you can saunter through some of the most well-stocked record shops in the country: Sounds of the Universe and Phonica, both of which regularly hold in-store performances from DJs.For dinner, the Tardis-like Brasserie Zedel is unbeatable if you want inexpensive French fare surrounded by marble fixtures and the buzz of punters’ conversations. Or, head to one of Soho’s many specialty eateries, such as Taiwanese burger joint Bao or Japanese ramen specialists Bone Daddies. You’ll have to queue but it’s definitely worth the wait.If the neon glare of Soho has enthused you, the evening might take a debauched turn. And if there’s one thing Soho has in abundance, it’s bars. For an upmarket choice, there’s the Hotel Cafe Royal bar on Air Street, as well as the Hawksmoor bar across the road, otherwise there’s the cavernous Brewdog for artisanal ales and Milk and Honey for low-lit, strong cocktails.If you’re in the mood to dance off the cocktails afterwards, London has a cornucopia of forward-thinking clubs. A short ride up the Victoria Line is Seven Sisters, a rapidly-gentrifying suburb home to Five Miles – one of the best small venues for electronic music, with an impressive selection of beers on tap, too. One stop further up the line is Tottenham Hale and the newly-opened club The Cause. Here’s one for fans of darkened rooms and rattling bass, where the DJs perform behind a cage until 5am. And, as the name suggests, the crowdfunded space operates for a good cause – to raise money for local mental health charities.If electronic music isn’t your thing, there’s the Jazz Cafe in Camden, which (ironically) hosts funk, soul and hip-hop nights on the weekends, or if you actually wanted jazz, there’s the intimate Vortex Jazz Club in Dalston.If music isn’t on the cards, there’s the option of a late-night screening at one of London’s independent cinemas. The Close-Up in Shoreditch has a large and eclectic film library for avant-garde film buffs, while the Prince Charles Cinema in Leicester Square hosts cheap, all-night marathons and movie-themed quizzes in its bar.You might want a final snack before you crawl into bed. Many people will talk about Duck and Waffle as the best 24-hour eatery in London, but queueing times can be absurd and I find the food overpriced and underwhelming. Instead, the area by Smithfields market is full of 24-hour pubs and restaurants, frequented by the market sellers themselves. La Forchetta is a highlight for enormous portions of homemade pasta – enough carbs to send anyone to sleep.After such a jam-packed tour, you’ll be ready to rest your weary limbs, so curl up on a London Northwestern Railway train and enjoy the free online entertainment as you float on home. With stops at major cities from London to Liverpool including Bedford, Milton Keynes, Rugby, Coventry, Wolverhampton and Crewe, you’ll find a route to suit you. And if after all of that you miss your train home, don’t worry, there’s always more to see ... and certainly more to eat.For the best value tickets, with no booking fee, visit londonnorthwesternrailway"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c612f741c784ff17a4e363d50906f6ead4b69ec/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef0b89529a7686daa65bae0870962190","title":"best albums 2018 kamasi washington heaven and earth","story":"The saxophonist achieved a maximal sound of choral harmonies, sweeping orchestration and his own raging intensityFor the saxophonist and bandleader Kamasi Washington, jazz music isn’t a technical exercise, it is a necessity. “My music is an extension of who I am, so I’m constantly searching within myself for my identity and beliefs,” he told Dazed this year. “Once you get past all the scales, the chords and technique, all you really have is your thoughts, and that will determine what your music really is.”These beliefs are empowerment and inclusivity, which translate into a maximal sound filled with choral harmonies, sweeping orchestration and the raging intensity of Washington’s tenor saxophone on his second studio album, Heaven and Earth. He lays them out on the first track, Fists of Fury: “Our time as victims is over,” vocalist Patrice Quinn declares. “We will no longer ask for justice  Instead, we will take our retribution.” It is a call to arms as much as an opening salvo.Kamasi honed his rallying cry as a session musician for the likes of Snoop Dogg, George Duke and Herbie Hancock. But it wasn’t until he appeared on Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly, in 2015, that listeners witnessed Washington as he is now: charging through melodic lines like someone grappling with a mighty external force, his breath pushing into reed-breaking ferocity, the sweaty slap from his fingers on the keys almost audible.This duality between imagination and reality, manifestation and acceptance, translates into 16 tracks of soaring power and intimate emotion. Washington’s pugilistic side comes out on the Bruce Lee-inspired Fists of Fury, the choral funk of Street Fighter Mas and the samba speed of Hub-Tones. As we progress into the Earth section, Washington displays a quieter aspect. Quinn and keys player Brandon Coleman channel a balladic softness on Journey, while on The Space Travelers Lullaby, trombonist Ryan Porter creates cinematic swells beneath the keening bass of Miles Moseley.The album was recorded in a two-week session while on a break from touring, with longtime bandmates the West Coast Get Down. The density of this creative period is felt in the innate tightness of the record’s arrangements. While Washington may have a cosmic vision for his output, its depth is contained within an earthly accessibility that references funk and soul as much as jazz.Heaven and Earth can sound like a shout of frustration at the world’s ills, but it also offers hope in the brightness of its harmonised voices and the endless breath of its wind instruments. It is a searching record, one that reflects an artist casting about for the beliefs that make up his music, but also one with an underlying energy to enact change: whether that change takes place within the mind or without, or whether that constitutes a difference at all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6097db412c4f6b4a54fe227dca1f19704bb273b1/0_86_5776_3466/master/5776.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87c9f9fef688f286b1f61fd9e3713e5d","title":"what happens now for the prime minister and her brexit plans","story":"Theresa May has bought herself some time but key questions still need answeringThe 200-117 result is in truth finely balanced. It is enough of a win to stave off Theresa May’s immediate resignation, but the rebellion is at a significant level too.Hard Brexiters such as Mark Francois took immediately to the airwaves to point out, correctly, that over a third of the Conservative parliamentary party had voted against May.Once the government ministers are excluded, that proportion rises to more than half of the so-called “no payroll” vote.Some called for her to sleep on the result, and – rather than go to Brussels on Thursday for the next round of Brexit talks with the European Union – to resign.But it is easy to dismiss that sort of talk as sour grapes: in the end May won the contest in front of her and, given the sensitive position of the Brexit negotiations, it is hard to imagine cabinet members calling on her to go with so much unresolved. May should have bought herself a little time, probably a few more weeks. She is due to talk to EU leaders about Brexit over dinner in Brussels on Thursday, and has the opportunity to make headway in securing some sort of reassurance over the unpopular Northern Ireland backstop.One cabinet minister, who heard her plead for her job before the 1922 Committee on Wednesday evening, said May has to win round the DUP, and persuade the Northern Irish unionists that the Brexit deal can work for them.That analysis is accurate, but it is a tall order given their opposition. The DUP vociferously argues that the border insurance policy would leave the region closer to the European Union – and hence Ireland – than the UK if it were to come into force.The result clearly highlights May’s essential Brexit problem. The number of rebels at 117 is eyecatchingly similar to the 100 or so MPs who were planning to vote against her Brexit deal before she postponed the vote the day before its scheduled date of Tuesday.It is a blocking minority preventing the current deal, or anything like it, from being ratified by parliament. To win round that amount of rebels, May has to make dramatic progress in her talks with Brussels and persuade the right of her party that she can “bin the backstop”.However, the European Union has made it repeatedly clear that the legally binding 585-page withdrawal agreement – which contains the Northern Irish backstop – is not up for renegotiation. And without renegotiation, the backstop will endure, and Tory rebels will almost certainly not vote for it.No 10 has promised that the vote will happen before 21 January, which in negotiating terms is very little time. So the Brexit fundamentals at Westminster remain, for now, unchanged.Many Conservative MPs do not want Theresa May to fight another general election as leader, after her disastrous performance in the 2017 campaign in which the party lost its overall majority and control of events.Hard Brexiters hoped that this would be a trump card in the no confidence ballot because, under the party’s rulebook, May is now immune to a party confidence vote for another year. The fear, they argued, was that May would call a snap general election to end the Brexit logjam – and the Conservatives would suffer as a result.To head that off, May made two successive concessions. At lunchtime, Downing Street said that the result of the no-confidence ballot would be accepted as a decision for the short term – not any future general election.But May was sufficiently rattled to offer a bit more when she spoke to MPs at the 1922 Committee meeting a few hours later. It was not, she said, “her intention” to fight the general election due in 2022 – although as Jacob Rees-Mogg was quick to argue, “intentions can change”.Rees-Mogg has a point, but May nevertheless conceded something more fundamental. The leader of the Conservative party has told her MPs she recognises that she is not an election winner. For a prime minister, that is a serious admission.Stephen Crabb, a former work and pensions secretary, summed up the problem, saying that Brexit day at the end of March felt like time for a change of leadership, because May’s government is living from week to week, and the party she leads is hopelessly ided.Theresa May has a chance to conclude a Brexit deal, but even if she can do that, she has failed to secure her leadership for the long term. Just the reverse.It would be intriguing if Labour were to call a vote of no confidence in May’s government, given the scale of the rebellion on Wednesday night. If hard Brexiters really want a change of leadership, they could, in theory, side with Labour, although in practice that would be a major step for a Tory MP to take.Under the Fixed Term Parliament Act, that would not immediately force a general election, but rather open a 14-day window for somebody else, almost certainly another Tory leader, to form a new government, which would need to be confirmed by a further vote of confidence.That alone, might give Labour strategists pause – but the party leadership is also holding back because, if it does not succeed, defeat in a vote of no confidence could play into the hands of second referendum campaigners.Those calling for a second vote want Labour to conclude that it cannot force a general election – in line with its carefully crafted Brexit policy – and should move on to campaigning for another referendum instead.But Jeremy Corbyn has always been lukewarm on the idea and there is huge suspicion over the subject among those close to the leader, because many of those keenest on a second referendum in the party have been among his biggest critics in the past.Labour may act in calling for a vote of no confidence, but it would be a surprise if it did so before Christmas. The party line is that it wants to see May definitively fail in the Brexit talks first and that is more likely to take place in the new year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0623fe2260a368626676609aba96952f4df9b521/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3eb4cda2141b4c0d021ee3716cd43e9d","title":"her goose is cooked papers ask how long may can last","story":"Front pages mostly say PM has failed ‘to heal party splits’ with a deal that is ‘dead as a dodo’ No 10 will not be happy with today’s front pages, which are all about Theresa May’s survival in the no-confidence vote, but paint the win as less of a triumph for May than a pyrrhic victory.Let’s start with the good news for the prime minister. Two papers have come out in support of the her, with the Express featuring a picture of a smiling May and the headline: “Now just let her get on with it”.The Mail is similarly supportive: “Now let her get on with the job!”, saying that “despite two months of sabre-rattling by her hardline opponents, and deadlock over Brexit, almost two-thirds of Tory MPs backed her”.Others were less sympathetic. “Time to call it a May”, says the Sun, never one to miss the chance of putting a pun in a headline. The Sun says the prime minister was “left wounded last night after a battering by Tory Brexit rebels”.The Mirror has: “It’s lame duck for Christmas”, saying May’s “goose is cooked”. The paper describes her as “wounded” and “battered” and says she only managed to survive the no-confidence vote “by promising not to fight the next election”.The Daily  says “A vote to Remain, but when will she Leave?”. It focuses on the fact that while she might have won nearly two-thirds of the vote, that number was boosted by support from her cabinet, and “over half of party’s backbenchers demand new leader”. The paper also has a front page comment piece by Nick Timothy, May’s former joint chief of staff, who says May “lives to fight another day, but her deal is dead as a dodo”.The FT’s headline is “May survives Brexiter challenge but margin fails to quash revolt” and highlights the prime minister’s “vow to step aside before election”. The i says Wednesday was a “Stay of execution” for May.The Times declares “May scrapes home”, writing: “A wounded Theresa May limped home from a vote of no confidence yesterday”, saying “the margin was far less than No. 10 had hoped for and will fail to heal the party’s splits over Brexit”. has “Tory coup fails. But scale of rebellion damages May”, saying teh PM faced an “uphill battle” to get her Brexit deal through parliament."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67fd1cd272e51874d14567b643570e1c68a51e04/0_57_1449_869/master/1449.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d60bfc0040c80b6f65ad29b715a9cfd7","title":"theresa may heads to brexit talks in brussels after seeing off vote politics live","story":"PM won party backing by 83 votes but faces uphill battle to get her deal through CommonsThe UK supreme court has ruled that a key part of the Scottish government’s emergency Brexit legislation breaches the law, because ministers in Edinburgh cannot veto legislation introduced by the UK government.UK ministers said the ruling vindicated their decision to challenge legislation introduced by the Scottish parliament earlier this year in a constitutional confrontation over the repatriation of EU powers into domestic law.Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, and Carwyn Jones, then first minister of Wales, accused Theresa May’s government of a “power grab” because the UK government wanted to retain the final say over scores of pieces of legislation.After both the Scottish and Welsh legislatures introduced so-called “continuity bills” in February which allowed them to take control of key bits of EU regulation, Welsh ministers suspended their legislation because they accepted a compromise deal over those powers brokered with the UK government.Sturgeon refused to sign off on the compromise deal, and in a long and complex judgment, the court said that one key section of Holyrood’s act section 17, which seeks to amend Westminster’s Scotland Act, was ultra vires because Scottish ministers cannot change power reserved to Westminster.Here is the press summary of the judgment (pdf). And here is the judgment in full (pdf).Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative Brexiter and former party leader, also criticised Philip Hammond for his saying the Brexiters were “extremists”. (See  10.06am.) Speaking on the Today programme, Duncan Smith said:I have one simple message for the chancellor: When you start turning on your own party and making accusations about them, that’s the beginning of the end for your party. You need to moderate your language and recognise that a party is a coalition and we need to get this thing through the line. I do not want to see the party where it is at the moment.James Cleverly, the deputy chairman of the Conservative party, has also joined those speaking out against Philip Hammond for his comment yesterday about Theresa May’s opponents being “extremists”. He does not name Hammond, but it is obvious that he is referring to the chancellor in this tweet.Hammond probably feels that is is open season on him at the moment. Stephen Barclay, the new Brexit secretary (and, like Cleverly, someone who is well below Hammond in the Tory hierarchy), also criticised his use of language this morning. (See 8.57am.) But Cleverly and Barclay can feel confident about speaking out, because May herself said Hammond’s comment was wrong when she was addressing the 1922 Committee last night. This is from the BBC’s Nick Eardley.For the record, this is what Hammond actually said yesterday.What this vote today will do is flush out the extremists who are trying to advance a particular agenda which would really not be in the interests of the British people or the British economy. Leaving the European Union without a deal would be bad for Britain.Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, has said he is holding last-minute talks with Theresa May ahead of today’s EU summit.Steve Baker, the former Brexit minister and deputy chairman of the European Research Group, which represents Tory MPs pushing for a harder Brexit, told ITV’s Good Morning Britain that Theresa May should stage the vote on the Brexit deal soon. He said:I’d like the prime minister to bring this deal forwards, let us vote it down, so it can go back to the European Union and we can say this clearly won’t go through parliament, we need to change the backstop.It’s an awful deal, the country doesn’t want it. Parliament would overwhelmingly reject it. This isn’t personal, this is about the policy being wrong for the country long-term.Labour is also pushing for an early vote, although the government has indicated it is likely to be delayed until January.Sir Bill Cash, the Tory Brexiter, has just told BBC News that there is no chance of his lining up with Labour to vote against the government in a no confidence motion. Asked about the chances of this happening, he replied: “None at all.”That may not sound at all surprising, but there has been speculation that Brexiters like Cash are so determined to see Brexit happen that they would rather bring down their own government than allow it to do something that would deliver a softer Brexit, or no Brexit at all.(It was always a far-fetched theory in the first place, not least because bringing down the government could easily result in Labour forming a government and implementing a softer Brexit, or holding a referendum.)The supreme court has ruled that parts of a Brexit bill passed by the Scottish government would be outside its legislative powers.And, since we’re on the subject of Jacob Rees-Mogg, this is what the pro-European Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt posted on Twitter last night after watching Rees-Mogg on Newsnight.Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter and chair of the European Research Group, which was the driving force behind the move to oust Theres May, was also on the Today programme this morning. After the result was declared last night he said that May should resign, and this morning, when it was put to him that she was staying put, he claimed that she might think again. He said:You may remember that Margaret Thatcher... said ‘We fight on, we fight to win’. Nobody was tougher than Mrs Thatcher, and the next day she resigned. So it’s not impossible. I think Theresa May should consider what she said last night. I agree with her that we do want somebody who can unite the country and the Conservative party and she has to ask herself is she realistically that person?Rees-Mogg also dismissed a report saying the ERG HQ had been nicknamed “the kill zone”. That term was invented by opponents wanting to smear the ERG, he claimed.It wasn’t referred to as that by me, I think it was only referred to as that by our opponents. I think it’s a deeply disagreeable term invented by people who wanted to support the prime minister. I never heard anybody refer to it as that, I would not have dreamt of referring to it as that. I think it’s deeply silly to have done so, and I don’t think it came from us, it came from others.He also dismissed Philip Hammond’s comment about May’s opponents being “extremists”, saying:Don’t take the chancellor too seriously when he gets a little bit over-excited - an unusual state for him, it has to be said.Good morning. I’m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Matthew Weaver. Here is the agenda for the day.9.30am: The supreme court rules on a legal challenge to Brexit legislated passed by the Scottish parliament.9.30am: Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, gives evidence to the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee.10.10am: Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, takes questions in the Commons.10.30am: Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, takes business questions in the Commons.12.30pm: EU leaders start to arrive for the EU summit in Brussels.2.30pm: EU leaders start their first working session at the summit.6pm: Donald Tusk, president of the European council, and Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, hold a press conference.The Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, has indicated that the government will try to run down the clock in the hope of getting the withdrawal agreement through parliament. Speaking on the Today programme he said:It is a question of having the time. The prime minister through the mandate she secured from the parliamentary party last night, now has the time to have those discussions with European colleagues.He insisted “there is movement” in EU on the issue of the backstop.But he added: The question is how do we ensure that that movement is sufficient for colleagues. But colleagues also need to focus on the alternatives – the alternatives deals also require a backstop.Barclay said May would try to secure concessions on the backstop but he warned that renegotiating the withdrawal agreement risked losing gains she had already secured. He said: The prime minister has been very clear that this is the only deal that will command the confidence of the house. But there is an issue that she has listened to colleagues on, the issue of the backstop, that’s why she is back out in Brussels again today.He refused to say when the meaningful vote on the deal would take place but confirmed it would be before 21 January. On the confidence vote he said: “The vote give us a chance to settle the issue of the leadership and really now to heal the party and back together in the national interest.” Barclay also criticised the chancellor, Philip Hammond, for describing Brexiters as “extremists” ahead of the vote. He said:All of us say sometimes things in interviews which we perhaps could have phrased in a better way. It’s not the phraseology I have would of used.Former cabinet minister Nicky Morgan suggested that a split in the Conservatives may be looming, with hardline Eurosceptics leaving the party.She told the BBC: I think there’s an inevitability that some of these people – the hardest Brexiteers – are going to walk. There may be some sort of reconfiguration of parties on the right of the UK political spectrum and that may be something we are going to have to accept in order to get a Brexit deal through the House of Commons.George Freeman, the Conservative MP and former head of the PM’s policy board, warned that the PM faces further struggles to get her Brexit plan through parliament, PA reports. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme:I think there will be at least one if not two or three defeats before opposition MPs and Conservative MPs start to realise that they’ve done their signalling and now it’s real.One of the reasons I think it’s important that the prime minister stayed is that whoever leads through this, I think, will be finished by it.Former minister David Jones suggested that campaigns for the leadership succession were already under way.I’ve no doubt that there will have been people in the room there who applauded the prime minister but are part of one campaign or another.Simon Hart, who founded the Brexit Delivery Group of Tory backbenchers and is supportive of the prime minister, said: I’ve had potential leadership candidates approaching me. I’ve had people I haven’t spoken to in nine years since I was first elected in 2010 using this opportunity to sell their own credentials and engage in a private beauty parade.Iain Duncan Smith, the Brexiter former Tory leader, told the Today programme that the last thing people wanted was a government of national unity with the Tory party reaching out to the Labour party to get May’s Brexit deal through. That idea was coming from “a mad place”, he told Today.People like me have never voted against the Conservative party in decades.If you think you can reach out to the Labour party with the leadership they have got at the moment you must be living in a mad place, because there is no way on earth the public want to see us deal with the Labour party.He insisted that Theresa May had to listen to the party after last night’s vote and work to get the DUP back on board. He added:The reality is for them the biggest issue for them is the backstop. If that’s not resolved they cannot go back to their electorate and say we allow that to go through where we are basically tied to Ireland. that would be a disaster for them.Stephan Mayer, a minister in the German government, has insisted there is no scope for renegotiating the withdrawal agreement. Speaking to Today he said: There were very serious negotiations for one year and now we closed these negotiations. I’m deeply convinced there is no better deal to achieve for the UK than what we have now.He suggested that a EU could offer different wording to the accompanying political declaration. We should consider to make clarifications in the political declaration or elsewhere to avoid a hard Brexit. This must be the main objective for both sides for the United Kingdom and for the EU 27.Mayer said a hard Brexit would mean a “lose-lose situation for both sides”. He added:My perception is that Theresa May did negotiate quite well. After one year of negotiations the treaty which lays on the table isn’t too bad for both sides. It is not possible to achieve any better deal than that which is not laying on the table."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc91006d8b331aa704ff4bd426a9cd2fda6baa76/53_590_1899_1140/master/1899.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c5a28d07f61faf8178bf31e51c23b49","title":"researchers call for new uti urinary tract infections testing method","story":"Study suggests standard test, widely used since 1950s, does not work for chronic sufferersThe “gold standard” test for urinary tract infections (UTIs) is not fit for purpose, according to research which suggests that it fails to diagnose most chronic sufferers.UTIs afflict an estimated 150-200 million people around the world every year. While many, particularly young women, suffer acute attacks of cystitis, which is quickly resolved with a few days of antibiotics, chronic infection can stay with people for many years and wreak havoc with their lives.Those who suffer most tend to be older women, who may be sent home time and again by the doctor because the UTI test is negative. But the test, which has been around since the 1950s and was adopted all over the world, is flawed, says Dr Jennifer Rohn, head of Urological Biology at University College London’s (UCL’s) Department of Renal Medicine in the Division of Medicine at the Royal Free Hospital.Her team compared the results of the standard test – the midstream urine culture (MSU) – with DNA sequencing for 33 new patients with symptoms, 30 who were experiencing a relapse after having been treated and 29 controls with no symptoms. Their research, published in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology, found only six of the MSU tests were positive, while the DNA test identified infection in all the patients with symptoms.“This work put the MSU head-to-head with modern DNA analysis methods – and it failed spectacularly,” said Rohn. “On the other hand, genomic sequencing using enriched urine specimens easily managed to pick out people who were genuinely ill.“This paper shows that the MSU is unsuitable for excluding UTI in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms. Therefore, we urgently need to develop alternative rapid diagnostic tests to take its place.”“For decades patients suffering appalling symptoms have been betrayed by a urine test that isn’t fit for purpose,” said UCL Professor Emeritus James Malone-Lee, a consultant physician in London who treats many chronic UTI patients, and one of the authors on the paper.“All too often, those afflicted are spurned by health carers who are duped by this test. This new study proves that the gold standard test, used throughout the healthcare system, is a hopeless dud incapable of distinguishing infected patients from normal controls.”Rohn said the test has been under suspicion for some time. “We’ve had inklings of this for years,” she said. “This really proves it for the first time.”UTI was not just about a young woman who has an acute infection that resolves with a few days of antibiotics, she said. “It’s a huge concern especially in the elderly, but also people with spinal injuries, multiple sclerosis, pregnant women, renal transplant patients, in-patients in hospitals – UTIs are a huge problem. These more vulnerable subsets are not the kind of people who get a one-off UTI.”It would be great if the paper convinced everyone, Rohn said, “but there is a lot of conservative thinking in medicine and it’s hard to change prevailing views about things like this.” There was also embarrassment and some stigma about UTIs, she said.“I feel like it’s been neglected in medicine because these people have been neglected. It’s really sad. People tell these same stories – I’m begging for antibiotics, I’ve had symptoms for 10 years but the computer says no. The test is negative. I feel it’s a moral issue in a way – that patients are getting a bad deal.”Carolyn Andrew from CUTIC (chronic urinary tract infection campaign) said the condition could be very painful and ruin lives, even making some feel suicidal. “We have people in our group who have had to give up work because of this, some who are struggling to bring up families. We have children from the age of eight to 13 or 14 who are not able to go to school,” she said.“Some people have to live on benefits. They can’t have a sex life because it is too painful and there is mental stress as well. We have dozens of women who have ended up with sepsis in hospital because it can travel to the kidneys. We have people who can’t get diagnosed and are absolutely devastated.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e98ad009f7b282363a3e58c72bf32adaa8e5779e/0_209_4191_2514/master/4191.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7e5a7c3cde3ca0ab63c1e7c0c00e3b1","title":"betting firms to ban pre watershed tv adverts during live sport events","story":"Voluntary plan agreed after bookmakers bend to pressure over children’s exposure to gamblingThe gambling industry has confirmed plans to press ahead with a voluntary ban on betting adverts during sport programmes from next summer, amid mounting pressure to protect children from excessive exposure to gambling.Jeremy Wright, the culture secretary, said gambling firms were “stepping up and responding to public concerns”, as the Industry Group for Responsible Gambling (IGRG) – which coordinates five trade bodies – announced details of the proposals.Companies in the sector would submit to a “whistle-to-whistle” ban on adverts beginning five minutes before pre-watershed live sport events and ending five minutes after. The curbs exclude horse and greyhound racing, which are seen as intrinsically linked to gambling.At present, online casino firms advertise only during live sports, also under a voluntary code, so the new restrictions would amount to a de facto ban on all their commercials before 9pm.The IGRG’s ban would also be extended to highlights shows and repeats and would prevent sponsorship of pre-watershed programmes.John Hagan, the IGRG chair, described the package of measures as a “watershed moment” for his industry. He said: “We believe that these new voluntary TV measures, which have been approved by the trade associations representing every sector of the gambling industry, will drastically reduce the amount of gambling advertising on television and they complement the strict controls that already govern gambling companies around advertising on digital platforms.”Gambling companies were thought to have been spurred into action by the lessons learned from the failed campaign by bookmakers to prevent maximum stakes on controversial fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) being cut from £100.Bookmakers initially opposed any restrictions on the machines, only to see stakes slashed to their lowest possible level of £2 on the back of a wave of public opinion, which ended in a cross-party push to usher the change in sooner than they had wished.Wright said: “Gambling firms banning advertising on TV during live sport is a welcome move and I am pleased that the sector is stepping up and responding to public concerns. It is vital children and vulnerable people are protected from the threat of gambling-related harm. Companies must be socially responsible.”Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, who has previously called for a ban on gambling companies sponsoring football shirts, said: “The next step will have to be addressing the gambling adverts that children and vulnerable problem gamblers see online.”Stephen van Rooyen, the chief executive of Sky UK, was highly critical of the TV ad ban saying it is meaningless unless the industry extend curbs to other media.“The gambling industry are ignoring the fact they spend five times more on online marketing than they do on TV,” he said. “By cutting TV ads, they’ll simply spend more online, bombarding people’s smartphones, tablets and social media feeds with even more gambling ads. A proportionate and responsible limit to gambling advertising across all media is the right thing to do.”The voluntary curbs also do not include shirt sponsorship on ads that run around hoardings in stadiums, which means gambling firms will still appear prominently during live sport. revealed in November that the majority of the gambling industry’s spend had shifted online in recent years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0122acda7e5f366729ea95db587a653bfde4873/0_22_1480_888/master/1480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c72d486ea2615930c4c3db3d77f666a","title":"eleven sports may be facing closure in uk after only four months","story":"Eleven Sports, the self-styled “Netflix of Sports” controlled by the Leeds United owner, Andrea Radrizzani, could be facing closure in the UK \u0026amp Ireland after failing to attract enough subscribers.The service, which launched less than four months ago, has the UK rights to sports including Italy’s Serie A, Spain’s La Liga and the Ultimate Fighting Championship.Eleven Sports, which was forced to stop its controversial practice of broadcasting European games on Saturday afternoons after pressure from football stakeholders, is aiming to renegotiate rights deals to avoid pulling the plug on its service.The situation has been triggered by the UFC triggering an exit clause on its exclusive deal with Eleven Sports, which was due to begin in January, after Eleven Sports was unable to secure promised distribution via pay-TV platforms including Sky, Virgin Media and BT.Eleven Sports is aiming to renegotiate its sports rights deals at a much cheaper rate to try to continue to operate a much smaller, commercially viable operation in the UK.UFC, the increasingly popular mixed martial arts competition, is understood to be back in talks with the previous rights holder BT about a new broadcast deal.Eleven Sports is preparing to hand back the TV rights to Serie A to IMG, which acts as agent, which would allow them to be resold. The streaming service secured the rights to Serie A in July in a three-year deal, ending BT’s six year association with Italy’s top league.In May Eleven Sports struck a three-year deal with La Liga, ending Sky’s 20-year association with Spain’s top-flight football league.

They will already be on the wing after the announcement on Wednesday that Sky will end its backing at the close of 2019.There is speculation that because some of their most valuable riders have contracts that last beyond the end of next year, backing may already be in place. It is equally likely that the contracts are long term, as the management had no option but to think that way and possibly little inkling the team may shut up shop, and that possible penalties for early termination of those contracts may be tied to the current sponsorship.Riders’ agents will already be considering the implications for the prices they can ask for their clients and the benefit to their own wallets of Team Sky’s disappearance. The loss of the British team could affect the entire structure of cycling because its budget is so vast, the wages it pays so large and the number of top riders it employs so disproportionate.The Tour de France is the sport’s market place and, unless Brailsford lands a backer before July’s race, the chances of Chris Froome, Geraint Thomas or Egan Bernal winning it will be diminished. There will be declarations of loyalty, of “doing it one last time for the team” but cyclists tend to live by the motto of Ibsen’s trolls: “Be true to yourself and to hell with the world.”Team Sky live on the edge at the Tour, as Thomas’s recently published memoir confirmed. Four weeks in the bubble during which the team’s stars and their staff negotiate in secret with other teams – accompanied by leaks and speculation in the media – could take that to a new level.One of Team Sky’s greatest strengths has been to avoid some of the instability inherent in the sport because its backing has been so long term. It has been one of the much-derided “marginal gains”. But the pressure to find a new team for 2020 will already be weighing on riders from the minute the 2019 season dawns with the Tour Down Under on 15 January.As for the chances of finding that backer, cycling sponsorship is a gamble that depends largely on a team finding the right inidual in the right company at the right time. Being the best in your field does nothing to change that. It is delicately ironic but not entirely a coincidence that the two longest sponsors are the national lotteries of France and Belgium, backers of the FDJ and Lotto-Soudal squads.There is a constant churn of squads and sponsors, and those that remain sustainable are the exceptions: AG2R in France and Quickstep Floors in Belgium are the only big backers with more than 10 years in the sport. Team Sky are already a rarity in that they have lasted so long with no major change and a budget running at several times that of some of their rivals.One problem for a backer is image given Team Sky carry an epic amount of baggage. Nine years ago the team were formed on a platform of anti-doping and racing “clean”. There have been no positive tests but the Jiffy bag controversy, the TUEs issued to Bradley Wiggins and the damning report by the House of Commons DCMS select committee have left the team in a less certain and more difficult place.They are a team whose chief had a public war of words with the head of the UCI, and whose riders toured France to a chorus of boos. The question of the alleged delivery of testosterone patches to the Manchester velodrome for the team’s then doctor, Richard Freeman, in 2011 – reportedly owing to an error by the supplier – remains unexplained, although Freeman, who denies any wrongdoing, is due to appear at a GMC tribunal in February that may offer clarification.Reopening that running sore may deter corporates with an eye on their image. Another factor that will weigh heavily is Brexit. Given the uncertainty around trading conditions with Europe and the consequences on investment decisions by UK companies, a large-scale British backer will be harder to find. It is more likely to be the kind of sponsor that has come to the fore in recent years: national backers from the east. China has yet to invest heavily in cycling but it can be only a matter of time.In securing a sponsorship by a corporation that will have lasted 10 years Brailsford pulled off as unlikely a feat in cycling as winning the Tour de France multiple times. Historically sponsors have tended to linger for half a dozen seasons at most, establishing brand name recognition relatively quickly and then hanging on while executives deem it worthwhile.Few major teams retain the same sponsor for 10 years or more – those Belgian and French lotteries excepted – none have found a single replacement that has lasted another decade.History and economic reality are against Brailsford. If he can pull it off, it will be a far more unlikely feat than winning the Tour de France six times in seven seasons with three different riders. Then again 10 years ago no one thought that was possible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17ff6fc1de72fbe55967c5503ee41abb2d8c7442/0_48_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f62f4b1973ee2554c287155f05850313","title":"yokozuna controversies and a dump truck a sumo history in pictures","story":"The origins of sumo date back 2,000 years and it was from the 17th century that saw its rise as a spectator sport.

The fit and finish of the Surface Headphones is every bit as good as Bose.The large, soft round ear cups encapsulate my ears with their oval openings, while the angle of the band and hinge points give plenty of flexibility, avoiding any obvious pressure points.The headband is a squishy rubber material and does a good job of avoiding causing sore points on the top of your head during extended wearing periods.At 290g the Surface Headphones are heavier than their two main rivals, the 240g Bose QC35 II and the 255g Sony MX1000M3. The added weight didn’t affect the long-listening comfort, but it was noticeable when walking out and about, as was the increased bulk compared with the Bose.The outside design of the headphones is both distinctive and bland in equal measure. The platinum colour (the only colour available) is quite noticeable on your head, but the simple design looks rather understated. They’re not subtle, but neither are they ostentatious.Each ear cup has a touch panel, on which you tap once to pause, twice to skip forward and thrice to skip back. Tap and hold to summon Google Assistant or Siri. They will also pause the music when you take them off.Surrounding each touchpad is a rotating ring. The right ring controls volume, the left noise cancellation level. Both are smooth and satisfying to use, with short beeps when you hit the maximum or minimum settings.The right ear cup also has a power button, which you short press to turn the headphones on or off or hold for five seconds to initiate Bluetooth pairing. There’s also a microphone mute button for calls. In the US that button can turn on or off Microsoft’s voice assistant Cortana, but it is not available in the UK on the Surface headphones.Bluetooth connectivity was strong and stable, but the Surface Headphones only support the default SBC Bluetooth audio standard, not AAC or aptX which both offer higher quality and lower latency. It’s a strange omission for premium Bluetooth headphones, which as a result can suffer annoying lip sync issues with video, particularly YouTube.The Surface Headphones have good but not great noise cancelling, not quite matching Bose or Sony. They will kill off droning noises, but they let through more of the sounds of the commute or the office, particularly voices, which became annoying while trying to concentrate.Unique to the Surface Headphones, however, is the ability to adjust the noise cancelling through 13 different levels, from maximum noise cancelling to amplifying ambient sound.I found the maximum noise cancelling was particularly prone to wind noise, while the maximum amplification generated spurious roars while in a train station or in a carriage. The headphones are noticeably better at blending outside noise with music than rivals. Disappointingly, though, there’s no setting to turn on ambient sounds when paused, which is a particularly useful feature when trying to hear public transport announcements.No matter if you can hear them with ambient sound piped into your ears, talking to someone with your headphones on is incredibly rude, so you end up taking them off. In the end I left noise cancelling at one step from its maximum.Sound quality was surprisingly good, even without advanced Bluetooth audio codecs. The headphones have a nice, warm, relatively rounded sound, with good bass reproduction where needed and crisp highs. The soundscape is quite wide too, which made listening over extended periods easy.The Surface Headphones made a decent job of most genres of music, but were best with guitar or vocals, sometimes feeling a little less sharp with electronica.Overall, as with noise cancelling, they are good, but not quite as sparkling as the Sony headphones, although some might prefer them to the sometimes clinical Bose sound signature.The Surface Headphones lasted about 14 hours in my testing over Bluetooth with noise cancelling on, which sounds long but meant I had to charge them at least twice a week. With rivals lasting at least 20 hours, sometimes far longer, 14 hours isn’t that long. At least they will last through a flight, and they charge pretty fast via USB-C – a rarity still for headphones.The Surface Headphones are good, but not great, and don’t not quite matchup to rivals costing the same amount such as the Bose QC35 II or Sony MX1000M3.They are comfortable, but heavier than the rivals. They sound good, but not quite as stellar as the competition, ditto for the noise cancelling and even the battery life.The styling is unique and they stand out on your head, but the platinum grey colour is likely to be isive. Equally the buttons, controls and particularly the rotating volume and noise cancelling dials work well.But when you’re spending £330 you should be able to expect the best performance, comfort and sound. Buy the Surface Headphones if you want to be different or you love Microsoft, but if not your money is probably better spent elsewhere.Pros: comfortable, well made, great controls, solid connectivity, USB-C, adjustable noise cancellingambient soundCons: no Cortana support in the UK, battery life, sound and noise cancelling not quite as good as rivals, fairly big, no support for AACapt This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

From Christmas cocktail parties to sit-down dinners, here’s how to host with impact and ease this seasonThe nights have drawn in, George and Mariah are in a state of perpetual soundclash, and with them comes the unsettling urge to host a seasonal get-together.If you’re an unsteady host, even an intimate dinner with a handful of friends can seem daunting, so when you chuck in the plus-ones, her next door and a cluster of colleagues, that “fun and festive” party can start to feel anything but.But things don’t need to get all out of control and Abigail’s Party. We live in a time when fine dining and Michelin-starred chefs appear in the most casual of settings, and that informality extends to the at-home-host, too. Claude Bosi - head chef of Bibendum restaurant and Rémy Martin cognac bar – is one such Michelin-starred chef who advocates this relaxed approach when entertaining.“The key to a great party,” he says, “is to ensure you are with your guests. There are so many dinner parties where you try to impress and find yourself spending more time in the kitchen than you spend with your guests. A great party is a balance between good food and good hospitality.”Here’s how it’s done:The dinner partyThis casual mantra starts at the top – the formalities of the past have been dispensed with. Invites can go out on WhatsApp or email. Similarly, boy-girl seating plans at dinner are a relic of another time. Remember, too, if there are only two single guests at a dinner party, they don’t necessarily want to be seated together, lest they feel like show ponies being watched over by the other guests for signs of good chemistry. And unless you have a particular gift for crafting, there’s no need for place names.That said, some small details done nicely can make a real difference. Take your dinner table, for example, as chef and caterer Stephanie Boote says: “I like a simple table, not too much fuss. A linen cloth can be lovely, napkins, if you have them. A couple of little vases or bottles with flowers or foliage. Candlelight is a must. You can have a pile of plates and cutlery on top of an undressed table, a water jug and a stack of glasses, and if you have candles lit it will all be just fine!”There are lots of ways to make life easier as you prep your dinner-party meal, especially as your guests arrive and the heat rises in the kitchen. For Bosi, a neat trick is to go for a cold starter. He suggests getting a terrine from a local deli and serving it with a salad, all handily ready to go on plates ahead of time.Food writer and author Killian Fox offers similar logic when feeding a crowd. “Simplify,” he says. “Instead of a starter, lay out a range of snacks – decent crisps and dips, olives, maybe some crostini – for people to eat when they come through the door. Use the time you’ve saved to make sure everyone has enough booze.”Drinks are, of course, key to a great dinner party. Leave time at the beginning for an aperitif, which will give you more breathing room to prepare your food, take account of inevitable late arrivals (“our Uber kept cancelling”) and let appetites build.Fox suggests a handy seasonal cocktail, too, named London Calling. “It was apparently devised at Milk \u0026amp Honey in Soho. It’s citrussy, it contains sherry, and it gives you a chance to look classy with a cocktail shaker. A fine Christmas drink.”Bosi suggests a drink can offer some surprises and lead to unexpected food pairings. He likes a Royal Sidecar, made with Rémy Martin 1738 Accord Royal cognac, Cointreau and lemon – and paired with oysters.“Until recently, cognac was something you would have after a great lunch,” he says. “It’s not something you’re expecting to drink at the start of the meal, but I find it goes very well with seafood. It’s a nice surprise, a bit of creativity. At that moment, you’ve made people really relaxed and given your meal a stamp of quality.”From then on, you can go with some classic dishes: a big joint of meat, a casserole that can be easily cooked in advance, a beautiful stew with game, or Bosi’s festive favourite: beef wellington.When it comes to serving, Bosi tends to stick to sharing plates. “I put pots in the middle of the table and we start sharing,” he says. “I think dinner parties with people closer to each other are a better atmosphere.”Boote adds a word of practical advice: “Preparation is key. Your guests are here to see you, not have you run about trying to do things. Keep it simple, with excellent ingredients that speak for themselves.”Dinner party music has long been something of a slur, a byword for a pleasant but bland background soundtrack. But you don’t want to be sitting in silence accompanied only by the sound of mastication and scraping forks, so head to Spotify to put together some playlists.For dinner, you want something that is eclectic but not too distracting – you don’t want to be continually flicking to the next song. However, you also don’t want to drift into nondescript tastefulness, either.The drinks partyInteresting people, nice snacks, some decent tunes and plenty of booze is all that’s needed for a drinks party. Keep things loose – this means submitting to the inevitable and assuming a crowd will congregate in your kitchen. Be ready to push some seats away in the living room if a late dance party emerges.When it comes to the drinks, try to be creative, says Boote: “This year, we have made a fig leaf syrup to go with lime juice, gin and soda. It’s delicious without the gin, too.” She follows that adding clementine flavours and fizz to spirits makes any drink feel “festive and delicious”.Of course, guests will be looking for something to nibble on, so lay out some decent crisps, popcorn or olives.You can also add some more expansive finger food into the mix. Boote goes for gougères, a French choux pastry filled with cheese, while Bosi will be serving up some intriguing offerings: Rémy Martin cognac, mixed with tonic (a Rémy Grand Tonic – the French spin on the British classic), served with his “pickled cockle popcorn”. The cockles are rolled in flour then deep-fried in hot oil, coming out as if popcorn. “It’s a fantastic pairing,” he says. To give it a seasonal twist, add some clove or orange to the cognac.Fox offers a snack serving with a backstory: “The Gilda – a pintxo created in honour of Rita Hayworth, who starred in the film Gilda. It’s pretty easy: skewer a couple of green olives on a toothpick with guindilla peppers and an anchovy fillet.”You want to keep the music equally eclectic but a little more upbeat. However, don’t feel the need to overload it with bangers and floor fillers. If the party goes late, you can bring out the hits.

Originally a trade route in the Middle Ages, the path is popular with both walkers wishing to get away for a while and cyclists up for a serious challenge. With 105 miles running from Bach’s birthplace, Eisenach, to the river Saale in Blankenstein, there is plenty to take in.Medieval wondersStrewn across Thuringia’s lush scenery are an incredible 400 castles and palaces. Queen Victoria, Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha famously danced at Schloss Friedenstein, while Richard Wagner’s operatic masterpiece Tannhäuser was inspired by Wartburg Castle, now a Unesco world heritage site and home to a 9,000-strong treasure trove of European art. Erfurt, the state capital, is also worth a visit. Peek inside St Mary’s Cathedral, where the 16th century monk Martin Luther was ordained, before taking in Erfurt’s perfectly preserved medieval old town that’s most impressive.Art and cultureEver since a youthful Johann Wolfgang von Goethe arrived in the city of Weimar, flushed with success from his romantic bestseller The Sorrows of Young Werther, Thuringia has been a haven for artists, philosophers, musicians, innovators and reformers. Weimar’s numerous coffee houses were frequented by everyone from Johann Sebastian Bach to Friedrich Nietzsche, Wassily Kandinsky and Marlene Dietrich. The world-class design school Bauhaus opened in Weimar in 1919 – before moving to Dessau in 1925 – and next year’s centenary will be marked with a plethora of parties and special events, culminating in the grand opening of the new bauhaus museum weimar.Take a different viewPrize for the coolest place to see goes to the Carl Zeiss-Planetarium in Jena. The world’s oldest planetarium, built in 1926, features an impressive dome projection system where Pink Floyd and Queen provide the soundtrack to gas clouds and galaxies.

But the retail magic is strongest in Whitley Bay … This is a lively, sweeping curve of a high street, catering for a whole host of tastes and interests. Immortalised in the Dire Straits song Tunnel of Love and once a beloved destination for hen and stag parties, it has come a long way of late. Now it’s packed with independent boutiques and stores such as Hound Dog Music, Lottie McPhees (cupcakes), Whitley Bay Skate Club (skateboards, rollerskates, scooters etc) and Pulp Fiction Future Food.There’s local craft ale in its own microbrewery pub, The Dog \u0026amp Rabbit, and a bottle shoptasting room, Nord. Follow the street to the sea and the recently renovated Spanish City – the majestic white dome providing spellbinding views of the rugged north east coastline from its elegant art deco champagne bar.Susan MarshallThis small city near The Hague has a lovely mix of artisan bakeries, small fashion and design shops, galleries, cheese shops, the wonderful ethnographic museum shop and vintage stores. It also has superb food and textiles markets on Saturday and Wednesday respectively. Combined with picturesque canals lined with old houses and bustling with crowds of students on bikes – to say nothing of museums, cafes, botanic gardens. Caroline CrookI hate shopping but Lake Geneva is one of the places I can make an exception for. There are plenty of cool knick-knack and novelty stores, as well as those selling useful things like clothes (and chocolates). It may be 1,000 miles from the ocean but with its surf shops, bicycle cafes, record shops and stunt kite shops it has the vibe of southern California. In winter there’s ice-fishing, skiing and helicopter rides off the frozen lake. In summer there’s a beach, ziplining and paddle steamers. For the best breakfast try Joni’s, an authentic 50s diner.AntonyAway from the tourist shops full of Putin calendars and endless Russian dolls, New Holland, a group of renovated industrial buildings on a triangular island surrounded by canals, is becoming a cool arts hub. At its heart is The Bottle, a beautifully converted circular naval prison. Inside are all the local designer-led jewellery, beauty and clothes stores you’ve been searching for, and at the centre a courtyard that stages film screenings and concerts. It all feels very off-beat and unique. Outside there’s an ice rink and, in summer, space for gigs and picnics, plus a ship-shaped playground.Alison MussettOn little-known rue Hermel and rue Versigy, north of Montmartre, you can buy everything you need for a dinner party (or a picnic or a suitcase full of edible souvenirs) within a stretch of 50 metres, without setting foot in a supermarket. Organic fruit and veg, freshly baked breads and patisseries from Boulangerie du Square (50 rue Hermel) and pâtés, hams and assorted delicacies from Les Fines Gueles. A dizzying array of cheeses, from great wheels of tomme to camemberts so ripe that they’ll run off your plate, can be found at the Fromagerie du Bas-Montmartre. Top off your basket with a bottle of wine from Rouge aux Levres or craft beer from Bièrothèque Belge for a stylish, locally sourced spread.StephFifteen years ago a derelict Victorian whiskey distillery just east of downtown Toronto was reborn as 10 pedestrianised streets worth of retailers and restaurants. The developer’s insisted on not leasing to chains, so now all the businesses are independents: from clothing and giftware shops to jewellers and candlemakers selling direct from their workshops to passionate collectors of sporting goods and craft beer who have turned their hobby into a business. The food shouldn’t be overlooked either – 18 months on from visiting, I still think about the sandwich I bought at Brick Street Bakery.Paul JonesThe narrow, graffiti-flecked streets of this district just outside Hamburg old town offer a kaleidoscope of indie shops for all tastes.

Located in a “troubled little corner in the north-west of Ireland”, the mile-a-minute Channel 4 sitcom was loosely based on writer Lisa McGee’s childhood during the Troubles, when Sinéad O’Connor posters adorned bedroom walls and there was not a mobile phone in sight – just people living in the moment. Oh, and armed soldiers were non-speaking extras in daily life.In tandem with director Michael Lennox, McGee found the humour in this unique situation with an authenticity that made us feel like we could have been there. Everyone had pals like Michelle (Jamie-Lee O’Donnell), the coarse firebrand (“I’ve been thinking, it might be time to lose the rest of my virginity,” she mulled in preparation of a party), her English cousin James (Dylan Llewellyn), who’s the butt of every joke, Clare (Nicola Coughlan) who likes to play by the rules, Erin (Saoirse Monica Jackson), a simpering ball of righteous teen angst, or Orla (Louisa Harland), who’s just as much of a free spirit as her mum, Aunt Sarah (Kathy Kiera Clarke).Those are only the protagonists. There was also a cast of meticulously acted secondary characters – such as the wonderfully cynical Sister Michael (Siobhan McSweeney), who really should neither be a sister nor a teacher. (Sample assembly announcement: “I know how daunting resit examinations can be. So if anyone is feeling anxious or worried, or even if you just want to chat, please please do not come crying to me.”) Throw in Inbetweeners-style situations we all encountered at school – such as the flurry of hormones when exchange students came over en masse – and the Derry Girls’ world became ours, too.And therein lies the reason for Derry Girls’ increasing momentum throughout 2018. For all its humour, it possesses a gravitas that other nostalgic teen comedies do not.Most likely, the show’s underlying intention was to highlight that by hook or by crook, life went on in Derry in the days of civil unrest. But it also serves as a timely reminder of Dolores O’Riordan’s ethereal vocals in the year of her death, with Dreams by the Cranberries bookending the series. And it made the political personal at a timely moment. With the border question featuring prominently in the Brexit negotiations, the last episode helps put that into context: no one wants to return to tragic deaths within the community while nearby, kids are trying to be kids, dancing terribly to Madonna on a school stage. It’s such a force that a campaign group named Derry Girls Against Borders has assembled, made up of everyday folk who are keen that life in Northern Ireland continues as is.But even without its unintended political relevance, the alchemy of the setup –­ from the whip-smart script to its authentic production ­– suggests that there’s plenty of enjoyable telly-watching hours to be had in Derry yet. And more screen time for Sister Michael, please."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86c09ddf7f8e4961d1c234eae112755d38f17a28/0_592_4033_2420/master/4033.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a71dcc66662b30ae221903b31b95dfd","title":"tv review jonathan pie american pie","story":"Tom Walker’s political insight as a fake Westminster correspondent amounts to little more than ‘I told you so’ and tedious Trump-apologismComedian Tom Walker and his co-writer Andrew Doyle have plied a healthy trade in viral rants with Jonathan Pie, the fake Westminster correspondent perpetually teetering on the precipice of his paper-thin patience, driven to apoplexy by the sheer stupidity of everyone on all sides of the political spectrum – apart from him. Jonathan Pie’s American Pie (BBC Three) takes this shtick away from its natural home of minutes-long shareable clips and extends it to an hour-long mockumentary, a format being slowly throttled by the BBC’s incessant overuse of it.In November 2016, shortly after Donald Trump was elected president, a Pie video was released pointing out that of course Trump won. “How can everyone be so fucking stupid?” he ranted, blaming, among others, himself, as a person on the left Hillary Clinton and a culture of no-platforming that closed in on free speech. “Not everyone who voted for Trump is a sexist or a racist. Some of them are, but most aren’t,” he announced. It quickly went viral and proved popular on right-wing news sites. I mention this particular clip because the premise of American Pie is that same argument, stretched out for an hour, two years after the fact.Pie has been sent to the US to report on the midterm elections. Clearly they were hoping that it would be a GOP knockout, so that his frustratingly superficial: “I told you so” analysis could be employed to mediocre effect once more. That was not the case, which leaves this as a curious rerun of arguments that have been made repeatedly over the past two years by people with greater political insight and better comedy chops.There is a long segment on why Clinton was a bad candidate, in 2016, that turns into a cheap point about how the news can be edited to tell any story the media – of which Pie is both critic and participant – wants to tell. At last, someone calling out fake news! But the focus, still, is on who voted for Trump and why. Pie meets a comedian and a singer who voted for the president, as well as a handful of regular-Joe Trump supporters, who explain their essentially understandable justifications for choosing him over Clinton. The devastating conclusion Pie reaches is that not all Trump supporters are “toothless hillbillies with banjos”. Nor are they racist and sexist, he says, without specifying who he thinks believes that: British people? BBC Three viewers? His own fans?Disingenuously, Pie includes himself in the category of lefty-liberal morons who think everyone in a Maga hat is one step away from fascism, and rallies against them, which manoeuvres him into a position of cynical immunity. Towards the end, there is a long, sweeping and patronising explanation of why “refusing robust debate” is leading to the rise of populism. I kept waiting for the punchline, the satire, the insight, but none arrived. More depressingly, this came after an interview with a white supremacist who advocates “a white ethno-state”, justified because, as Pie insisted, his views need to be aired in order to be challenged. The arrogance of Pie assuming that he is the person to dismantle this terrible person’s horrible views would be fair if he challenged them properly. But it is a desperately weak segment in which Pie simply declares those views – in favour of ethnic cleansing – to be “pretty abhorrent”.The format does it no favours. It was billed as “Louis Theroux meets Alan Partridge” and there is a running gag about whether Theroux would have done it differently. But Partridge is funny because he is pathetic and human Pie just has a sneering superiority complex. Theroux offers insight because he listens to people Pie has too many scores to settle to offer an impartial ear. Odder still is a transparently “humanising” backstory about Pie’s collapsing family, which is intended to solder a heart on to this cold slice of cynicism. I understand the appeal of Pie’s “it’s just common sense” clips, even if the last thing I would choose to watch is another man shouting furiously about how stupid everyone is.He has millions of followers, and perhaps they will love seeing even more of him, but the truth is that there’s little to justify taking it beyond a few minutes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/703197bb5b79a9f3d774b2ac796c4438f2de872d/0_243_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01eb41c03aeab8e1cb971a50ed5711d5","title":"dr dust the man who discovered a hidden black lung epidemic","story":"Today’s black lung rates are higher than 50 years ago, affecting men as young as their 30s, and in Kentucky, their right to decent health care is being curtailedDr James Brandon Crum was alarmed. For months, unemployed coal miners had been coming into his clinic in Coal Run Village, KY seeking chest radiographs.One patient in 2015 stood out. He was in his early 40s, about the same age as Crum, and had three children at home, just like him, but he could barely walk. The 68-foot hallway between the x-ray room and Crum’s office might as well have been Mount Everest’s summit. The miner repeatedly stopped to catch his breath. Crum, who had worked in his family’s coal mine as a youth, knew that this man, who was suffering from progressive mass fibrosis – the severe or complicated form of black lung disease – could have just as easily have been him.Back in his office, where papers, folders, and Post-it Notes cover practically every available surface, Crum started asking his patients detailed questions. There was a mystery: Why was he suddenly seeing so much severe black lung – an old man’s disease – thought to be an illness of the past, appearing in younger men with significantly less time in the mines?Between the miners visiting his clinic and the cases coming to him as a federally certified B-reader, or expert in special x-ray readings to classify dust diseases affecting the lungs, Crum was shocked. Coal workers’ pneumoconiosis, commonly known as black lung disease, an incurable but entirely preventable illness caused by inhaling coal mine dusts, was showing up in x-rays at his clinic far above rates reported by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (Niosh).After Congress passed the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act in 1969, which made the elimination of black lung a national goal, coal workers’ pneumoconiosis dropped to historically low rates by the 1990s. Progressive massive fibrosis, the severe or complicated form of the disease, fell to such scant levels it was considered rare. By 2012, though, Niosh announced that black lung was rising.After interviewing the miner, Crum started tracking every case of simple and complicated black lung that he was seeing. What he observed beat Niosh’s updated statistics by a country mile.Crum’s larger issue in 2015, though, was that, curiously, no other black lung specialists in Kentucky were observing the same trend. If they did, they certainly weren’t saying anything about it.Black lung disease is caused by coal dust, which thickens the air and blackens a miner’s face. Increasingly, respirable crystalline silica, which is invisible to the naked eye, and deadlier, is also to blame.Once these dusts enter a miner’s lungs, he will take them with him to the grave. Before then, they will sit quietly. Unnoticed. Unseen. Until enough white blood cells accumulate around the particulates to be visible on an X-ray like grains of salt sprinkled across a black tablecloth. These coal macules mimic ordinary lung tissue and other possible lung ailments and are frequently unnoticed or misdiagnosed.Though the nodules are part of the body’s ongoing effort to rid itself of the dusts, they can become their own problem. Continued exposure to dust will grow into scar tissue or fibrosis culminating in the complicated form of the disease. In time, the scars will become as big as a grain of rice. A dime. A quarter. A half dollar. Lung capacity declines. Hypoxemia (low blood oxygen levels) sets in.All the internal organs are taxed, particularly the heart and brain, as the scar tissue slowly “eats up” a miner’s lungs. The body just won’t quit trying to rid itself of these once invisible particulates until the day finally comes when the miner does not have sufficient lung capacity left with which to breathe. Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust.Though Crum watched his grandfather die a drawn-out death from black lung and his father also suffers from the disease, he did not decide to become a doctor to work on black lung. Instead, the disease found him.A fourth-generation coal miner from an owner-operator family, Crum spent seven years working in the mines on weekends and summers from the age of 14 to 21.Crum was reared in a typical Appalachian way in Elkhorn Creek, “a holler,” as he puts it, with generations of extended family all living in the vicinity of the family’s mines. He attended public school, where teachers wanted to move him ahead a grade owing to his above-average intelligence. His mother refused and gave her son extra work instead. He played little league, attended church (where his mother served as the pianist) on Sundays and Wednesdays, participated in Boy Scouts, and gathered with his kin for Sunday dinner. He hunted and fished, doing almost all of these things with his brother, Joshua, who is 13 months Crum’s junior, in tow.Crum started working in the mines because he had been in trouble for fighting. His mother, Shawna, says, “He didn’t initiate fights, but he didn’t back down, either.” His father, James, handled the problem by saying, “If you’ve got time for that then you’ve got time for work.”His first job was picking rock out of coal on the belt line. Later, he shoveled the stuff and handled rock dusting, which involves blowing pulverized material in the work area to reduce the risk of explosions caused by accumulating dust. “I didn’t give them good jobs,” Crum’s father says, referring to both his sons. “I gave them hard jobs. They had to learn to work.”Crum decided to become a doctor, enrolling at the University of Pikeville. After completing his residency in Ohio, he worked for two years as a radiologist at Norton Community Hospital, just over the mountains in the heart of Virginia coal country. There, Crum saw enough black lung to pique his interest. Then he and Joshua moved home to “America’s Energy Capital”, as the Pike County highway signs boast, and opened their clinic, right as coal began to crash.“The media here buried this thing,” says Linda Adams, 53, who recently lost a fifth family member to the disease this past July. She and others affected by black lung’s resurgence held rallies and tried to get legislators to confront the crisis as far back as 2014. “But then Brandon Crum came in here and blew the lid off of this whole thing.”The soft-spoken Crum does not come across as the type to blow the lid off of anything. His glasses are small and wire-rimmed, and his midsection thickening. Speaking with a distinct mountain twang and attending the Free Will Baptist church, an evangelical denomination that continues old-timey traditions like foot washing and immersion baptism, Crum stands with one foot in the old world of Appalachia and one in the new.As a radiologist, spending his days in his office surrounded by multiple computer monitors, reading up to 100 x-rays a day, he is the doctoring world’s equivalent of a geek, someone seemingly more comfortable with data than people. Nonetheless, Crum continued questioning patients to determine their coal dust exposure.At stake, as Crum began gathering stats over a 20-month period that began three years ago, was the health of the region’s principal workers in a crashing industry beset with layoffs. Families in a region already struggling with poverty and “diseases of despair”, such as addiction, had another cross to bear.Also at risk were millions in state and federal black lung benefits. After thousands of miners went on strike in 1969 to insist on compensation for black lung, benefit programs were developed. Appalachia’s endemic poverty worsens when miners get too sick to work. However, over the near 50-year  of these benefit programs, many ailing miners have never seen a reward, which is part of why B-readers, such as Crum, are so important. Niosh intended to verify that applicants for federal and state benefits suffered a lung ailment caused by coal mine dusts, and to classify the type and severity of the disease, which is critical for determining award amounts.With no one else seeing similar trends, Crum’s reputation was on the line, too. “Most radiologists read x-rays in a room and then they see the reports and they don’t think about the public health consequences or what that means,” says pulmonologist Dr Robert Cohen, also a B-reader.But Crum took another unusual step and alerted Niosh about what he was reading in June 2016. Though Niosh sends a white van wending through the region’s mountains to monitor the health of miners, participation in their voluntary survey was low. The cases and iniduals showing up in Crum’s clinic were unexpectedly providing him with a true sampling of the population.By December of that year, Niosh confirmed Crum’s discovery. The number of black lung cases in Crum’s office was eight times their rates. His single clinic also charted 60 cases of complicated black lung over a 20-month period. This was far and above the 99 cases in the entire nation that Niosh had identified over a five-year period going back to 2011.An additional study corroborated Crum’s findings: 416 cases of severe black lung had been reported in three Virginia clinics. Niosh recently declared that the US is facing an epidemic, affecting 1 in 10 miners nationally, and 1 in 5 – twice the national rate – in the central Appalachian states of Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia.Today’s black lung rates are higher than the ones that inspired miners and physicians to push for the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 almost fifty years ago.“Being from this area and being from a mining family, you always had the older people who had black lung,” says Crum. “It affected them in their 70s. Now with it affecting men as young as their 30s, you have it not only affecting them, you have it affecting the younger children and their families and wives.”As a fourth generation miner, Crum says, “It’s personal for me.”“It’s going to be the responsibility of somebody to pay for these men’s health care,” says Crum. “Or if they go to transplant.” A lung transplant can generally help a miner survive an additional five years, but costs at least $1.2m, which coal companies are unlikely to be willing to pay.Earlier this year, Kentucky’s Republican-led legislature passed House Bill-2 (HB-2), which curtails worker’s compensation, including black lung benefits, to 15 years. The bill also cuts radiologists like Crum from the certification process, limiting the doctors who can approve benefits to four pulmonologists. Three of who consult for the coal industry.Black lung advocates see HB-2 as singling out Crum. Pikeville black lung claimant attorney Phillip Wheeler openly refers to the bill as “The Dr Brandon Crum Exclusion Bill”. Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center staff attorney Evan Barret Smith, who edits the blog Devil in the Dust, which is devoted to the disease, says, “He saw more severe black lung coming into his office than any of the official statistics said he should be seeing. By the way, that’s the same reason that the industry people say he must be wrong.”When asked about this criticism, J Tyler White, President of the Kentucky Coal Association, the industry’s lobbying organization, said, “I believe this is a very narcissistic approach when the focus should be providing miners with the best qualified medical professional.” (White testified at a state hearing in favor of HB-2’s passage.) The number of physicians that can certify the presence and severity of black lung disease are at issue, though, not claimants’ actual medical care.Black lung costs are exorbitant. The federal Mine Safety Health administration reports that between 1968 and 2014, in which an estimated 76,000 miners died from black lung disease, federal compensation alone cost $45bn. Federal black lung awards, which are granted only in the event of total disability, prove difficult to win, though.While state benefits have historically been easier to receive, HB-2 shows that this is changing.HB-2 “stacks the deck in favor of the companies”, says Wheeler. Applying for black lung benefits is an adversarial process in which the coal miner is the plaintiff and the coal company is the defendant. The plaintiff must prove black lung is disabling, and that it came from coal mining. The company’s job is to defend itself and not have to pay benefits.Kentucky has already succeeded in creating backlogs through various means. Before HB-2 went into effect this July, the wait to receive black lung benefits was about two years.While the industry can’t get away with targeting a competent physician alone for finding high rates of severe disease, it can find a justification for eliminating an entire class of doctors, such as radiologists. “No one can say that his readings are wrong,” Smith says about Crum, certainly not after Niosh confirmed them. “So, they just try to find a way to knock him out of the system.”Kentucky is the sole state to exclude radiologists from the black lung benefit process. It’s a move doctors say is nonsensical, particularly during an epidemic. “Without the x-ray, you cannot diagnose,” says Dr Sanjay Chavda, a pulmonologist in western Kentucky and former B-reader. “Those in radiology would be more qualified to read these x-rays than pulmonary specialists. Crum may read 100 x-rays in a day, but we read 10 in a day. His exposure is much broader.”A bipartisan pair of local legislators are pushing back, though. In mid-November, Angie Hatton, a Democrat, and Robert Goforth, a Republican, pre-filed a bill to reverse HB-2’s restriction of B-readers to pulmonary specialists. The bill will be taken up in the 2019 General Assembly starting in January.Without doubt, black lung is difficult to diagnose. That early stage black lung often presents with no symptoms adds to the challenge.Doctors commonly misdiagnose the early stages in which miners can become prone to bronchitis or pneumonia. It’s not uncommon for a miner to learn he “has the spots” from an x-ray or scan to assess another ailment such as back pain.Experts contend that, had the cases that ended up in Crum’s load been spread out over 200 clinics, we would still not know this epidemic exists. Pike County, which borders West Virginia and Virginia, is the epicenter for a reason. Hazard No. 4, Upper Wax, Pardee, Amburgy, Poplar Lick: Central Appalachian coal seams have their own particular poetry and lethalness. Now that thicker seams of coal have been mined out and more rock must be cut, miners have been exposed to greater amounts of respirable crystalline silica dust, which is largely to blame for the spike in complicated black lung.There are other causes, too: more powerful machinery, longer workdays, fewer days off for miners to rest their lungs and a culture of company fealty that stretches back to coal mining’s earliest days.Crum’s work histories detail these factors and more. They comprise the largest data collection on central Appalachian coal miners with complicated black lung. These secrets of the disease’s resurgence await Crum’s analysis.Coal mining is also rife with bent rules. Just because a federal protection is in place doesn’t mean companies and miners observe it – employees of Armstrong Coal were recently indicted in western Kentucky for conspiring to falsify dust readings.“If we figured out how to mine these seams in a safe fashion, it would be worth more than any coal seam or strip job or truck mines that any of these companies would ever have,” says Crum. “They could figure that out and market it to the world.” Thus far, though, no industry executive has come knocking on Crum’s door.Crum wants to protect miners but he is also a coal mine owner-operator’s grandson who doesn’t “want to see the coal industry hurt. You know, ’cause we were in the coal business forever”.Crum’s attitude reflects our current coal mining era. In the 1960s, the narrative was the industry versus the workers, who had the public sympathy and strength in numbers. Now, the story that coal country likes to tell itself is one of a beleaguered industry and its workers united against a “war on coal”, in which zealous environmentalists threaten to put them all out of business – though a shrinking global market is the real culprit.“What we’re seeing in central Appalachia right now is the prequel to what you will see occurring in the rest of the United States coal fields, over the decades to come,” Crum says of the current crisis. He predicts that all of the other coal producing countries – Canada, China, India, Australia and others – will see an increase in black lung disease as higher quality seams of coal are mined out. “This is a massive problem. And it’s just gonna get worse.”“I think with a huge problem there comes huge solutions,” says Crum, maintaining optimism in spite of all the illness he’s seen in so many men much like him.“I would just much rather see people come together and figure out how to fix it because we can,” he says. “There’s fewer companies now so you have fewer people that could come together and work together and change it.”But that doesn’t mean he will be backing down any time soon.When asked if any of the state’s powerful coal industry leaders have said he’s the bad guy, Crum says, “I’m sure they all think I’m the bad guy, because if these guys have it, then I’m gonna stand up for them.” He then adds, “Because they do have it. And it’s killing them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aef5368899eada555a62114fb921fe079d049ff0/0_74_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6b4fd65733fd3476b4936846491d32f","title":"china canada diplomat michael kovrig detention latest ","story":"A second Canadian missing in China is under investigation on suspicion of “engaging in activities that harm China’s national security”, state media reported on Thursday.Michael Spavor was “being investigated” by the Dandong city branch of China’s ministry of state security and the probe started on 10 December, according to a government news agency in northeastern Liaoning province.Spavor is based in China and facilitates trips to North Korea, according to the Canadian foreign ministry. He met with its leader Kim Jong-un and famously arranged some of retired NBA basketball star Dennis Rodman’s visits there.Meanwhile, Michael Kovrig, a former Canadian diplomat, was detained by Chinese state security on Monday in Beijing, according to his employer, the International Crisis Group.After Kovrig was held, another Canadian citizen contacted officials, saying he had been questioned by Chinese authorities.“We have not been able to make contact with him since he let us know about this,” said Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, said at a news conference on Wednesday afternoon. “We are working very hard to ascertain his whereabouts and we have also raised this case with the Chinese authorities. We are in touch with his family.”Spavor and Kovrig are said to know each other, The Globe and Mail reported.Posts on Spavor’s social media showed friends beginning to question his whereabouts, after he failed to show up to a planned visit to Seoul on Monday, the same day Kovrig is believed to have detained by security officials in Beijing. He was scheduled to be in the city, for conferences and social events, until at least Friday.Canadian officials have been wary of potential retaliation by the Chinese government after the arrest last week of Chinese telecoms executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver.But the Canadian government has been unwilling to directly link Meng’s arrest with the detention of Kovrig, who is being questioned on suspicion of engaging in “activities that harmed China’s national security”, according to Chinese state-run media.“Canadian citizen Michael John Kovrig was on 10 December investigated in accordance with the law by the Beijing State Security Bureau on suspicion of engaging in activities that harm China’s state security,” the newspaper said.Accusations of harming state security could cover a wide range of suspected crimes, and in China are often very vague when first levelled.Kovrig, who works for the International Crisis Group (ICG) thinktank, is on leave from Global Affairs Canada, the department of the Canadian government that manages diplomatic and consular relations, but he is still considered an employee, said an official. However, he does not have diplomatic status.The ICG, which is focused on conflict resolution, said in an earlier statement Kovrig was detained by state security officials in Beijing on Monday night.Diplomats in China said the apparent involvement of the secretive state security ministry, which engages in domestic counter-espionage work, among other things, suggests the government could be looking at levelling spying accusations.However, the ICG president and chief executive, Robert Malley, said the group did not engage in such activity.“I don’t want to speculate as to what’s behind it but I am prepared to be categorical about what’s not behind it, and what’s not behind it is any illegal activity or endangering of Chinese national security,” Malley told Reuters, before the state media report came out.“Everything we do is transparent, it’s on our website. We don’t engage in secretive work, in confidential work.“The Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Lu Kang, said the ICG was not registered in China as a non-government organisation (NGO) and Kovrig could have broken Chinese law.The foreign NGO law, which took effect in January, is part of a raft of new national security measures introduced under President Xi Jinping.“All foreigners that come to China, so long as they respect the law, have nothing to worry about,” Lu said.William Nee, the China researcher for Amnesty International’s East Asia regional office in Hong Kong, said Kovrig’s detention was alarming, especially as it appeared to be the first time the law has been used to detain a foreign NGO worker.“We need to wait for the official explanation from the Chinese side, but this detention could have a chilling effect on the foreign NGO and business communities in terms of their feeling safe while travelling in China,” he told Reuters.Guy Saint-Jacques, Canada’s former ambassador to China, was asked by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation on Tuesday whether the Kovrig detention was a coincidence after the arrest of the Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou.“In China there are no coincidences,” he said. “In this case it is clear the Chinese government wants to put maximum pressure on the Canadian government.”China had threatened severe consequences unless Canada released Meng immediately and analysts have said retaliation for the arrest was likely.Meng was granted bail by a Canadian court on Tuesday, 10 days after her arrest in Vancouver on US claims that she misled multinational banks about Iran-linked transactions caused a diplomatic dispute. As part of her release, she has provided a $10m bond – in parts cash and properties – and must wear a GPS monitoring device."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3729195.1544637525!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"rising cost of school transport scheme may not be sustainable","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe State’s school transport service is heavily subsidised, with only 8 per cent of the cost recouped from fare-paying pupils in 2015.The rising cost of the State’s school transport scheme may not be sustainable and needs to be urgently reviewed, according to internal Government documents.The Department of Education is currently paying more than €1 million per school day – or €190 million a year – on bus services for more than 100,000 children who live some distance from their nearest school.The costs have been rising due mainly to an increase in the number of eligible children with special needs who require transport.Spending on special needs transport – which often includes bus escorts or taxis for students – has jumped from €64 million to €92 million between 201314 and 201718.Records released to The  under the Freedom of Information Act show concern within the Department of Public Expenditure over the rising costs in advance of last October’s budget.Another official warned that a review of the school transport scheme was needed to identify savings in light of “considerable increases”.At the Department of Education, meanwhile, briefing material prepared for the then minister for education noted that school transport required significant additional resources.However, it said this view was not shared by the Department of Public Expenditure, which was requesting efficiency savings.The issues are likely to come under scrutiny at a meeting of the Dáil’s Public Accounts Committee, which is examining spending on the school transport scheme.Primary schoolchildren are eligible to avail of school transport services if they live 3.2km or more from their nearest school, while the equivalent distance at second level is 4.8km.Pupils who do not qualify under the eligibility rules may use the school transport service if there is spare capacity on a bus route. These are known as concessionary ticket holders.The scheme provides transport for about 117,000 schoolchildren every day of the school term on 4,500 vehicles, making it one of the biggest operations of its kind in Europe. The Comptroller \u0026amp Auditor General (C\u0026ampAG) has found that the number of eligible pupils using the service has fallen in recent years, though costs have been rising due partly to the proportion of special needs pupils.It estimates that in 2015 the proportion of spare seats on these school transport bus routes is running at about 35 per cent. If pupils who hold concessionary, or paid-for, tickets are excluded, spare capacity would rise to some 48 per cent.The C\u0026ampAG has also noted that the service is heavily subsidised, with only 8 per cent of the cost recouped from fare-paying pupils in 2015. The average annual cost of transporting eligible pupils was about €1,800 in 2015. In that year, 48,000 ticket holders were exempt from charges and an annual ticket purchased cost on average just over €200 per fare-paying pupil."},{"url":null,"title":"charity prints from the irish times","story":" photographers have produced a gallery of images that will make a unique Christmas gift.

Photograph: Andy RainEPABritish prime minister Theresa May heads to Brussels on Thursday seeking fresh concessions for her Brexit deal after emerging from a confidence vote by Tory MPs bruised but victorious.Mrs May will address EU leaders at the two-day European Council after seeing off rebels who attempted to remove her from the party leadership, winning by 200 votes to 117 in a secret ballot on Wednesday.Her narrower than expected margin of victory came after she promised to step down before the next general election and a promise to MPs that she would find a legally binding solution to the Northern Ireland backstop that would allow the DUP to support her Brexit deal.She will travel to the Belgian capital still faced with the same dilemma she faced before it all took place: how to convince the EU to tweak the Withdrawal Agreement so that it will be passed by parliament.Speaking outside 10 Downing Street after the vote, Mrs May said she would seek assurances on the backstop when she attends the European Council in Brussels on Thursday.“I have heard what the House of Commons said about the Northern Ireland backstop and, when I go to the European Council tomorrow, I will be seeking legal and political assurances that will assuage the concerns that members of parliament have on that issue,” she said.Promising to find a legally binding solution to the backstop that would satisfy the DUP, she said the Brexit deal could only win a majority in the House of Commons with DUP support, adding that it would not be a success to pass a Brexit deal only to be unable to govern afterwards.On Wednesday, Mrs May met DUP leader Arlene Foster and her deputy Nigel Dodds. Describing the meeting as useful, Ms Foster said she had made clear to the prime minister that only substantial changes to the backstop would satisfy her party. The backstop is a provision in the Brexit deal designed to ensure there will be no hard border in Ireland.“We emphasised that tinkering around the edges would not work. We were not seeking assurances or promises. We wanted fundamental legal text changes,” Ms Foster said.Mrs May will address the other 27 EU leaders on Thursday evening and they will later discuss Brexit without her.The scale of her task was highlighted by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, who insisted in a phone call as MPs voted that the UK’s Withdrawal Agreement “cannot be reopened or contradicted”.“Both agreed that the withdrawal agreement is a balanced compromise and the best outcome available. While they agreed to work to provide reassurance to the UK, the agreement cannot be reopened or contradicted,” the Government said in a statement.The message to Mrs May from EU leaders was that the EU was open to providing assurances, but will not reopen talks on the substance of the withdrawal deal, and will not make the backstop temporary, as sought by the UK.EU leaders are planning to issue a statement after the summit that they hope will offer Mrs May some cover when she returns to Parliament in a bid to pass the Withdrawal Agreement by January 21st. This statement is expected to say the EU will “use its best endeavours to negotiate and conclude expeditiously a subsequent agreement that would replace the backstop,” according to a draft, and they’ll pledge to explore further assurances if needed. However the draft text has still to be approved by EU leaders and reports suggest it could change. Mrs May’s victory in the confidence vote means she cannot face another challenge to her position as Tory leader for one year.But she still faces the danger of a no-confidence motion in the House of Commons, which could bring her government down if backed by more than half of all MPs.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the “dismal” deal should be put before MPs next week.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell hinted Labour could call the motion next week if Mrs May does not get changes to the Withdrawal Agreement that it wants. He told ITV’s Peston: “We will just have to judge what she comes back with on Sunday night, Monday morning, see what the statement is in the House of Commons on Monday and take a proper judgment then.” - Additional reporting PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph:  Leon NealGetty ImagesTheresa May’s 200-117 victory in Wednesday’s confidence vote was clear enough to be decisive but close enough to ensure that she will continue to face a large, mutinous bloc of backbenchers. She won in part because she promised MPs that they will not have to face the electorate again under her leadership.More than a third of Conservative MPs, probably including more than half of those on the backbenches, no longer have confidence in her leadership. But Conservative Party rules mean she is immune to another challenge to her leadership for 12 months, by which time Britain should have left the European Union. With no risk of being ousted and no hope of leading her party into another election, the prime minister no longer has to look over her shoulder. She could, for example, seek to unlock a cross-party majority for a soft Brexit in defiance of hardline Brexiteers in her own party and in the DUP. But her innate caution and the promises she made on Wednesday to stay in power suggest that such a bold course remains the remotest of possibilities.The prime minister made two commitments to MPs: to leave office before the 2022 general election and to secure a legally binding solution to the Northern Ireland backstop that would win the DUP’s support for her Brexit deal. Her acknowledgement that she could not lead her party into the next election moved some ministers to tears and may have persuaded a couple of dozen MPs to vote for her.But her declaration that no Brexit deal could pass without the support of the DUP was more consequential, setting a bar for the next stage of negotiations with the EU that may be impossible to overcome. She told MPs that it would not be a success to pass a Brexit deal only to find that, without the support of the DUP, she could not govern.May had what she described as a positive meeting on Wednesday afternoon with DUP leader Arlene Foster and her deputy Nigel Dodds. The DUP have made clear that nothing short of a unilateral exit mechanism that would effectively kill the backstop will satisfy them.The EU is open to offering clarifications on the backstop, although senior officials say no new legally binding text can encroach on the terms of the backstop set out in the withdrawal agreement, which cannot be renegotiated. May’s commitment to find a solution the DUP can accept could set her on a course that makes a deal with the EU impossible.\u0026nbspOr it could simply be the latest in the long trail of broken promises that has littered her premiership from the day she entered Downing Street.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

Though the borough is served by the Jubilee line and the DLR, commuters generally have to change line at least once to reach their destination. Boroughs on the outskirts of London, including Barking, Brent, Harrow and Tower Hamlets, also had higher infection rates, as tube-travellers take longer journeys or crowded trains to big stations like Waterloo. But there are things commuters can do to reduce their risk of infection, from spending less time on the underground to washing their hands after using the tube. On average, people touch their face between 2000 and 3000 times a day - trying to avoid doing so while on the move can also help. Dr Goscé said that the new research should be used to help to draw a clearer map infections in an urban environment. “Policy makers, in particular, should address the role potentially played by public transport and crowded events and avoid encouraging the attendance of such environments during epidemics,” said Dr Goscé. We can see that this has a significant impact.But the tube is not the only form of transport where you can pick up a cold.A recent American study found that passengers sitting within two seats of an infected person on a plane had an 80 per cent chance of catching a bug while in the air. Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleProtect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Theresa May heads to Brussels in bid to save Brexit deal as Tory civil war escalates - latest updatesWinter solstice: Why pagans celebrate the shortest day of the year (a day late) Holly Willoughby could return to I\u0026#39m A Celebrity in 2019Theresa May no confidence vote result: Prime Minister survives but 117 Tory MPs go against herDramatic moment boy jumps from burning building in Texas rescueHigh-speed train crash in Turkey leaves at least nine dead and dozens injuredFireworks, knives and microwaves used to attack ambulances, investigation findsComment: Theresa May\u0026#39s pyrrhic victory puts Britain on course for political catastropheComment: Will Brexit be delayed or cancelled after the Tory leadership challenge?

However, as the producers want to maintain continuity, the bricks must be tinted and moss painstakingly applied to make them look identical to what is currently on screen.The BBC spent £44,000 on various types of sample bricks before signing a contract with the builders.he negotiation took six months longer than expected as Wates’ contract price offers were higher than the BBC anticipated, and both parties were also agreeing the type and supply of bricks for the Front Lot having reviewed a number of sample brick panels.Every inch of peeling paint on the outside of the Old Vic will be recreated, along with cracked paving stones or dirty stonework.The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh being given a tour of the EastEnders set in 2011 by Wendy Richards and Barbara Windsor“The BBC has now made more realistic assumptions of the time needed for scenic ageing.” Ageing the Albert Square buildings will take 13 months, with a further seven months for ‘back lot’ buildings.When the NAO first reported on the project in 2015, the BBC said it would cost £59.7 million and be finished by October 2020. The new date is May 2023.The NAO concluded: “The BBC will not be able to deliver value for money on the E20 programme in the way that it envisaged in 2015.“Disappointingly, some of the reasons for this were built into E20 at the outset and could have been addressed earlier. These include insufficient construction project management expertise.”The report found that an important design stage was completed without being reviewed and signed off by EastEnders production staff, who then demanded 16 changes at a cost of £440,000.Soap storylines that ignited debateOther factors in the overspend include builders encountering asbestos and inflation in the construction centre.But Meg Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said: “It is concerning that the BBC has been unable to keep to budget and time on this project again.“It is critical, given the BBC’s funding pressures, that every pound of licence fee payers’ money is spent effectively.”A BBC spokesman said: “The set of EastEnders was built in 1984 and only intended for use for two years. Over 30 years later, the show remains one of the BBC’s flagship programmes and yet is filming from a set that is no longer fit for purpose. The new set will be suitable for HD filming for the first time and extend Walford to better reflect modern East End London.“It’s a large, complex project which has already delivered many other vital improvements at BBC Elstree Centre but, like any building work of this scale, there have been challenges on the way including construction market issues beyond our control and from working on a brownfield site.“As the NAO recognises, we’ve already made improvements and are keeping the project under close scrutiny.”Bugs on the underground: how your commute could be making you illTheresa May heads to Brussels in bid to save Brexit deal as Tory civil war escalates - latest updatesWinter solstice: Why pagans celebrate the shortest day of the year (a day late) Holly Willoughby could return to I\u0026#39m A Celebrity in 2019Theresa May no confidence vote result: Prime Minister survives but 117 Tory MPs go against herDramatic moment boy jumps from burning building in Texas rescueHigh-speed train crash in Turkey leaves at least nine dead and dozens injuredFireworks, knives and microwaves used to attack ambulances, investigation findsComment: Theresa May\u0026#39s pyrrhic victory puts Britain on course for political catastropheComment: Will Brexit be delayed or cancelled after the Tory leadership challenge?

Sainsbury\u0027s and Asda are taking the CMA to a judicial reviewOn a day in which Britain was (again) going completely mad, Sainsbury\u0027s and Asda decided to take the Competition \u0026amp Markets Authority to a judicial review of the timescale\u0026nbspof its investigation into their merger.Yes you read that right. You could say it added another layer of icing to the crazy cake.\u0026nbspThe two chains say they need extra time - 11 days - to get their submissions in and to have them properly considered, hence their ‘reluctant’ decision to take this step, which is all but unprecedented, certainly in the history of the watchdog which was formed in 2014.

They have interests in multiple business lines: Grocery, fuel, clothing, and more besides.

A\u0026nbspregulator’s lot is not a happy one.\u0026nbspThat said, this deal was first announced last April and the CMA’s investigation, which is scheduled to be completed in March, was fast tracked at the request of the merger partners, who opted to skip Phase One and move straight to the always inevitable Phase Two investigation.Now Phase One and Phase Two are very different processes. But let’s look at this in practical terms. If they’d wanted and needed\u0026nbspto string things out, and create extra time, it’s not as if they didn’t have the opportunity to do that.\u0026nbspNow, much later in the day, we have this.The CMA would tell you that it will consider the case on its merits regardless.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

When the committee asked him whether he could keep all of the House of Fraser branches open, Mr Ashley replied: “What person could keep 59 stores open - beside God? It’s impossible, it can’t be done.”Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director at Fidelity International, said: “Replica football strips and cut-price trainers have helped Sport Direct buck the downward trend on the high street, with sales up 4 per cent over the period. However, its quest to turn the House of Fraser stores it’s acquired into the “Harrods of the high street” comes at a cost.“As a result, full-year earnings growth is expected to come in lower than last year. Whether investors will be able to look past the headline figures and see Sports Direct as a true diamond in the rough remains to be seen.”Sports Direct shares dipped by 1 per cent in early trading.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It’s the most reliable meteor showerThere are several reasons that explain why the Geminids are so beloved, but one of the main factors is the display’s reliability.It’s usually one of the strongest meteor shower of the year, as noted by the American Meteor Society – which currently displays the Geminids’ status as “active”.The shower is “very consistent”, to the point that it’s the “most reliable shower of the year”,\u0026nbspAccuWeather\u0026nbspreported.“Some argue it is actually increasing in intensity,” astronomy blogger Dave Samuhel told the website.The key to the Geminids’ consistency is the celestial object that has triggered\u0026nbspthe meteor shower each year since the 1800s, which orbits the Sun every 550 days or so.2. It’s named after the Gemini constellationThe Geminids’ name is no accident: once it enters Earth’s atmosphere, the meteor shower seems to be coming from the Gemini constellation.In order to spot the Geminid\u0026nbspmeteor shower, you should thus be looking towards the Gemini constellation, which is well positioned from 10pm, the American Meteor Society explained.This gives the Geminids\u0026nbspa rare status as a major shower experiencing significant activity before midnight.3. It’s also linked to a Greek godSo what exactly causes the Geminid meteor shower? A celestial object called 3200 Phatheon\u0026nbsp– which is also the son of the solar deity Helios in Greek mythology.It belongs to the Apollo asteroid group, an ensemble of near-Earth asteroids.As 3200 Phatheon, it is followed by a trail of debris. Earth passes through its trail each year, resulting in the display.4. This year is a prime viewing timeLast year, the supermoon\u0026nbspobscured the Geminids. Next year, a full moon might make it difficult to observe the spectacle – meaning now’s the time to step out to appreciate the meteor shower.NASA recommends\u0026nbspstepping out after 10:30pm and giving your eyes 30 minutes to adjust.\u0026nbspThen, the best way to spot meteors is to lie flat on your back – refrain from looking at your mobile phone to preserve your night vision – and wait until the show begins.5. As many as 100 shooting stars are expected to light up the skyThe Geminids have an hourly rate of 120, the highest listed on the American Meteor Society’s calendar for meteor showers.This means more than 100 shooting stars should appear – though NASA\u0026nbspcalls the figure a “theoretical maximum” and warns that it represents the experience of a “perfect observer” gifted with “perfect skies”.People residing in suburbs can still expect to see about 30 or 40 meteors per hour, and those living in darker areas on the countryside will be able to spot a bit more than one shooting star per minute.Bad news for people in large cities such as New York or San Francisco: they will see “practically nothing” due to light pollution, the agency warned.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Mike Ashley’s discount retailer increased revenue by 4.5 per cent, to £1.79bn from £1.72bn, in the first half of the financial year, while underlying profits fell by 27 per cent. The company said its earnings before income, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) rose 15.5 per cent to £180.3m excluding the effects of the House of Fraser purchase.

Mr Ashley has previously said he hopes to save the majority of House of Fraser stores, and has blamed ‘greedy landlords’ for blocking his attempts to negotiate lower rents in order to keep branches open. Sports Direct cutting off nose to spite face with retail invesmentsMike Ashley tells MPs: \u0027The internet is killing the high street\u0027House of Fraser customers\u0027 anger as gift cards no longer validHouse of Fraser flagship store on Oxford Street saved from closureOn Thursday, he said: “I have made my views clear that I believe the previous House of Fraser senior management team traded the business whilst it was insolvent for a long time, this means we have significant challenges ahead in turning House of Fraser around. “However, I genuinely believe we have acquired a fantastic opportunity and with the efforts of Sports Direct and House of Fraser teams, and the support of the brands, local councils and landlords, we can turn House of Fraser into the Harrods of the High Street.”Mr Ashley recently told MPs on the Housing, Communities and Local Government committee that most UK high streets are beyond help, and called for a tax on online retailers. When the committee asked him whether he could keep all of the House of Fraser branches open, Mr Ashley replied: “What person could keep 59 stores open - beside God? It’s impossible, it can’t be done.”Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director at Fidelity International, said: “Replica football strips and cut-price trainers have helped Sport Direct buck the downward trend on the high street, with sales up 4 per cent over the period. However, its quest to turn the House of Fraser stores it’s acquired into the “Harrods of the high street” comes at a cost.“As a result, full-year earnings growth is expected to come in lower than last year. Whether investors will be able to look past the headline figures and see Sports Direct as a true diamond in the rough remains to be seen.”Sports Direct shares dipped by 1 per cent in early trading.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Sitting in a hotel room dressed in a baggy black hoodie, walking boots and jogging bottoms, the lean 33-year-old is itching to head out into the chilly London rain and walk to a nearby climbing gym.\u0026nbspFirst, though, we have to talk about Free Solo, which despite sounding like another entry in the interminable Star Wars franchise is in fact an intimate, occasionally hair-raising documentary, showing why Honnold is a man in a class of his own when it comes to climbing rock faces without equipment.Free solo climbing, or soloing, eschews ropes and all the other paraphernalia one normally associates with safety, and leaves just the climber alone on a wall, with nothing but a pair of rubber-soled rock shoes, and chalk for his or her fingertips. As such, it is climbing in its purest and most dangerous form, where one small slip or moment of distraction can be lethal. It’s like an Olympic sport where if you don’t get gold you die, offers expert climber Tommy Caldwell in the film.\u0026nbsp“I think that’s a little hyperbolic,” muses Honnold. But aren’t the stakes so high, you have to be perfect, I ask? “Not perfect, but you have to perform well. It really draws the best out of you. To me, free soloing has definitely always felt like a skills test where you’re like, ‘OK, have I progressed enough as a climber to feel comfortable doing this thing that otherwise could seem impossible?’”For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialWe thought it was impossible to free climb the Dawn Wall of El CapitanLast year that seemingly impossible\u0026nbspthing was becoming the first person to free solo Yosemite’s daunting\u0026nbspEl Capitan (or El Cap, as its known among climbers). Towering around 914 metres, the imposing granite monolith was first climbed in 1958 by a three-man team using ropes they took 47 days to reach the summit. Fifty-nine years later, Honnold, tracked by the Free Solo film crew’s cameras, scaled the edifice in three\u0026nbsphours and 56 minutes. The feat stunned the climbing world and had people reaching for superlatives.\u0026nbspI want to think about other people’s accidents and to remember what happened to some of my friends, because that’s how you learn\u0026nbspHe appears comfortable at the cutting edge, but suggests that the only reason many of his solos have been breakthroughs is because he’s in a one-horse race where such big projects are concerned. “There’s nobody else doing it. So it’s easy to be first if you’re the only person playing the game.”In Free Solo, his girlfriend, Sanni McCandless, finds his desire to go further hard to understand. In one particularly difficult scene, she begs him to understand why she wants him to stay alive. He tells her he does, but he doesn’t feel obligated to stop. And anyway, he is already doing everything he can to mitigate the risks, he insists. Even so, this feels like cold comfort given the number of free soloers who have ended up dead – a point Caldwell gently but bluntly tries to drive home to his friend.\u0026nbsp“I knew a lot of those people and I know the whole stories, the context,” says Honnold. “I’ve known that stuff for many years. So it’s not as if that’s fresh knowledge that suddenly hits me like, ‘Oh that’s hard to deal with!’“In some ways it’s important to think about those things. I want to think about other people’s accidents and to remember what happened to some of my friends, because that’s how you learn. That’s how you make sure that doesn’t happen to you or you try your best to make sure that doesn’t happen to you.”\u0026nbspHonnold estimates he has free-solo climbed more than 35 routes\u0026nbsp(National GeographicJimmy Chin)Honnold started climbing regularly in local gyms around the age of 10, but has enjoyed climbing, and looking at the world as a kind of adventure playground, for almost as long as he can remember. He tells me that as a young boy he’d go to services at a Catholic church, near his home in Sacramento, with his mother – until he rebelled and declared himself an atheist – and stare up at the vaulted ceiling and its big exposed beams. He wasn’t contemplating God or Heaven, but “imagining different ways to swing around between the beams and how you could run on that and jump to that. Obviously I never did it, though I did\u0026nbspclimb the outside as a teenager.”\u0026nbspHe also climbed on the roof of his school, and got a kick out of balancing on guard rails.“I love play structures. Like swinging around on monkey bars. But then I’m often the person running around on top of the monkey bar, jumping from one to the other, just seeing what your body can do and enjoying the feeling of the movement.”Ultimately, “climbing feels like play”, he says. “I think that is at the heart of my desire to be a climber.”\u0026nbspOK, I say, but there is feeling like you are playing, and then there is risking your life climbing walls thousands of feet high, without safety gear. How does the one lead to the other? Honnold smiles.\u0026nbsp“I mean, that’s where you take this love of doing a thing, and you combine it with this sort of innate desire to want to improve all the time. To push yourself. When you let that run away from itself for 20 years, you wind up taking on some really, really big challenges.”My father died in the summer, which took some of the pressure off of going to school. Not that he was overtly forcing me, but it was certainly part of itBy the time he went to Berkeley to study civil engineering, at age 19, Honnold was climbing in the gym five days a week, for two to three hours a day. It was a “pretty enthusiastic hobby”, but still not something he thought he could turn into a profession. In the meantime, he drifted on the current of his academic parents’ expectations and disinterestedly continued his education.\u0026nbsp“The expectation was to finish university and get a job and just follow the conventional path. But I had never really chosen that particular path. It’s not like I cared about my studies that much.”His parents had filed for orce after he graduated from high school (“They weren’t in an overtly bad relationship, but I just don’t think they were that into each other, really”), which became final in May of his freshman year. Two months later, his father, who had taken him to the gym and supported his climbing, suffered a fatal heart attack while running through Phoenix airport. Soon after, Honnold dropped out of Berkeley.\u0026nbsp“My father died in the summer, which, to be honest, took some of the pressure off of going to school,” he admits. “Not that he was overtly forcing me to go to university, but it was certainly part of it, which is the expectation that I would.”Instead of going back to class, he hit the road in the family minivan (his mother had recently inherited a car from her father, who died around the same time as her former spouse), and adopted the frugal lifestyle of a “dirtbag climber” around California. When the minivan broke down irreparably, after\u0026nbspa year and a half of touring, he got a bicycle and tent, until he could afford a replacement.\u0026nbspToday, he has sponsors, but at first he was just living from “month to month, seeking out the next adventure or challenge”. The concept of climbing for a living didn’t really exist at the time, so Honnold thought he would eventually “wind up in some peripheral industry, like guiding”.Honnold climbs through the enduro corner on El Capitan’s Freerider (National GeographicJimmy Chin)However, when he became the first to free solo the Regular Northwest Face route of another awe-inspiring peak in Yosemite, the 610-metre\u0026nbspHalf Dome, in 2008, the climb caught the attention of documentary makers who asked him to re-enact sections of the ascent, as well as parts of his solo of the 370m Moonlight Buttress in Utah’s Zion national park, five months earlier, for a short film. This would be the first time that anyone had seen or got a feel for what Honnold went through doing the climbs, because neither had been witnessed by anyone. \u0026nbsp“One of the things I really love about climbing is that people will take you at your word for the most outlandish climb,”\u0026nbsphe says. “You know, ‘Oh, I free-soloed Half Dome today.’ There is basically no evidence of me free-soloing Half Dome. Nobody saw it. I think I told a friend, ‘OK, I’m going back up tomorrow.’ And then I texted him when I was done or whatever.” This level of trust among climbers demands “scrupulous honesty”, so when I jokingly ask why he didn’t cheat and use some nearby equipment to get himself out of a potentially life-threatening situation during the Half Dome solo, because nobody would have known, he is suddenly, and understandably, lost for words.\u0026nbspThe\u0026nbspresult of the film shoot, Alone on the Wall, according to his 2015 memoir of the same name, did more than anything else (including a feature in Outside magazine and a breathtaking National Geographic cover photograph) to spread Honnold’s achievements to an audience beyond the “insular world of hardcore climbing”.After Half Dome, El Cap was “the next obvious step. But it was just such a big step, it took many, many more years until it seemed even remotely possible.”I’d learned that I wanted to have a positive experience up there. I didn’t want to feel like I was about to dieOne of Honnold’s strengths is his ability to seemingly override his fear. In Free Solo, an MRI scan of his brain reveals that his amygdala, which initiates the automatic part of the fight or flight response, requires more stimulus than most people’s. This isn’t to say he doesn’t get scared though. When he was on Half Dome, in the previously mentioned hairy predicament he describes as “outrageous”, he certainly felt fear.\u0026nbspBy the time the climber had El Cap in his sights, he says: “I’d learned that I wanted to have a positive experience up there. I didn’t want to feel like I was about to die the whole time.“I mean, it’s not fun if you’re scared. And I climb for myself. I climb for fun. So if it’s really scary, there’s no real point in being up there.”To get himself where he wanted to be, Honnold reckons he did around a dozen other big free solos in Yosemite. None were\u0026nbspas prestigious as Half Dome, but they were “steps in the right direction. They were so challenging in different ways, and bigger, harder, in some way or another.” Finally, in 2015, he was doing a roped climb on El Cap, and for “whatever reason”, he suddenly thought, “This could maybe be possible.”Honnold peers over the edge of Glacier Point in Yosemite national park\u0026nbsp(National GeographicJimmy Chin)He chose a route and started to break it down into sections, or pitches, logging the features of each in a journal. In his mind, he distinguishes between risk and consequence. The latter is a constant (if he falls, he dies) that he has no control over. The former, however, is a variable that he attempts to minimise through research, rehearsal (on ropes), intense focus, and visualisation. Thus, he noted and memorised every foothold and handhold of the most difficult sections, meticulously choreographing the movements, which he still remembers, he would use to get through them. For example, to essay a pitch known as the “boulder problem”, he elected to use a karate kick-like move, rather than try to leap and catch hold of a piece of wall.\u0026nbspHe was particularly concerned about a section of granite which while not very long, and easily overcome using a four-move sequence on a rope, was “super slippery”, and therefore highly dangerous in the context of what Honnold was trying to do.\u0026nbsp“You basically had to put your foot on this, like, ball of glass, and just hope that it stuck, because if it slipped, you’d die,” he says.\u0026nbsp“There just wasn’t really an adequate way to free solo it. So I pioneered this whole variation that went around that move in a 10-metre circle.”Having a film team shooting the climb added another element of potential danger. I bring up the story of Henry Barber, who almost died when he was distracted by a cameraman while being filmed free soloing on cliffs in Britain, and Honnold tells me about Peter Croft almost getting knocked off a wall by a cameraman – “which would be a kind of\u0026nbsphorrendous way to fall to your death”, he laughs.“The thing about it is the cameramen are hanging off\u0026nbspropes, so if they swing off at the side to get a good angle, it means that they’re loaded on this rope like a pendulum and if they come unclipped from whatever they’re in, they’re going to come swinging across the wall and potentially floss you off with the rope.“So those were exactly the kinds of things that the whole crew was super-mindful of on the Free Solo filming, because they didn’t want to cause an accident.”Honnold cleaning his van in Yosemite national park\u0026nbsp(National GeographicJimmy Chin)While training, Honnold slipped and severely sprained an ankle. It still wasn’t completely back to full strength when he tried to free solo El Cap for the first time in 2016, and he aborted the attempt mid-climb. He knew the game was up when he reached a point where “you have to trust your life to this one right foothold, and you’re just palming the wall. I can still visualise it,” he says, miming the movements.“My foot was swollen and it was dark, it was cold, I couldn’t feel my toes. I couldn’t really tell if my toes were exactly on the foothold. You know, I was going to trust my life to this little edge that I couldn’t feel, so I just immediately started cheating.”\u0026nbspFailing was “pretty disheartening and pretty depressing”, but soon he came to see the fact he had been able to “walk up the base of El Cap and start climbing” as a “big victory”. As he’d written in his book, just getting off the ground was going to be a challenge for anyone who attempted to solo the wall.\u0026nbsp“So even that felt like this huge milestone in some ways.”\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe was left feeling “quite a bit hungrier”, and went to Las Vegas to live, train and recover. He returned to Yosemite in the spring of last year, and on Saturday\u0026nbsp3 June, almost two years after he’d begun his preparations, achieved what he’d set out to do\u0026nbsp– the highlights of which are captured in beautiful, breathtaking, vertigo-inducing detail in Free Solo.‘Great Escape’ pilot’s rare Spitfire discovered on Norwegian mountainThe audacious Wordsworth who put mountaineering on the mapMan survives a week lost on mountain by eating beesAfter dreaming about soloing the wall for so long, I wonder if actually doing it had left a big El Cap-sized hole in Honnold’s life. “So far not so much,” he says. “Partly because there’s so many other climbing challenges I’m working on.”\u0026nbspThe week after his El Cap solo, he went to Alaska to prepare for an expedition to Antarctica. Now, while he is doing press for the film, he is back in the climbing gym, and “getting back to my roots, a little bit”.\u0026nbspHe has to be careful where he goes, though. In LA, recently, he was mobbed at a gym by fans, who turned what was meant to be a relaxing workout in between getting off a flight and giving a presentation in the evening, into a full-on, meet-and-greet-type experience. “I was like, to myself: ‘This is definitely not a relaxing, fun way to stretch after my flight. This is crazy! There’s way too many people!’ It is stressing me out just thinking about it,” he says, and I can hear his voice quavering.Still, he can handle it a lot better than the “shy, dorky loner” he was as a kid. Then, it would have been “like my worst nightmare”, he confesses. “Can you imagine? You’re too shy to talk to anybody and then you have to basically do public speaking every single night, and interviews and things.”Free Solo is going to bring Honnold to an even wider audience, and could even take him and the film’s team, headed by co-directors Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi, to the Oscars. The film is an incredible record of an amazing feat, and will forever be a testament to the climber’s dedication and death-defying athleticism. \u0026nbsp“I can’t wait to show my kids and grandchildren\u0026nbspsome day,” enthuses Honnold, who says he’d like to have a family. “I mean, imagine me as an 85-year-old showing my grandchild: ‘Look what he used to be able to do! That’s cool!’”National Geographic Documentary Film\u0027s Free Solo is released in cinemas on 14\u0026nbspDecemberShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

This might seem like a pretty plain piece of ground if it weren\u0027t on Mars, but we\u0027re glad to see that.The spacecraft appears to be sitting in some sort of hollow, a dip made in the Elysium region where it landed when a meteor landed there. That should make it easier for the probe to dig down into the surface.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms. The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places.

(B) Body outline based on examination of musculature evident in X-ray imaging of other marsupials (Wells et al., 2018)“The extinct marsupial lion, Thylacoleo carnifex,\u0026nbsphas intrigued scientists since it was first described in 1859 from skull and jaw fragments collected at Lake Colongulac in Victoria,” they wrote\u0026nbspin the journal PLOS One.“Recent cave finds have for the first time enabled a description and reconstruction of the complete skeleton, including the hitherto-unrecognised tail and clavicles.”The analysis by Professor Rod Wells and Dr Aaron Camens suggested it had a heavily muscled tail that would have formed a tripod with its back legs as it handled its food or climbed.Powerful forelimbs combined with a rigid lower back would have meant that while the marsupial lion was not able to chase its prey, it would have been well adapted to jump out and grapple with it.Their results suggested that the closest living creature to Thylacoleo is neither a lion nor a large marsupial like a kangaroo, but the distantly related Tasmanian devil.Like the devils, the scientists suggested that besides being ambush hunters the marsupial lion\u0026nbspmay have used its massive legs to rip apart scavenged carcasses as well.The skeleton reconstruction also confirmed their closest relatives from the\u0026nbspperiod were diprotodons – a group of enormous wombats that are the largest known marsupials to have ever lived.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

People were against no deal by 44 per cent to 37 per cent, for a new referendum by 46 per cent to 30 per cent and for Norway by 41 per cent to 39 per cent.A sign of just how difficult it will be to secure any deal that enjoys broad support came from another question, which asked respondents to say what it is that is most important for a Brexit deal to secure.The equal top answers were “controlling immigration” and “maintaining smooth trading links with the EU” – two things which, to an extent, are mutually exclusive because of the red lines set out by the EU and UK in negotiations.Ensuring that there is no border erected between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland – the matter at the heart of opposition to Ms May’s plan – was rated as the key issue by just six per cent of people.EU ‘will renegotiate with Theresa May’ Brexit deal is voted down’Ms May is likely to play for time if the vote does go against her next week, and travel to Brussels for a summit of the European Council where she may ask for further concessions to try and make her deal more palatable to MPs.Despite a string of European figures saying there could be no further talks, ex-commission president Mr Prodi appeared to throw Ms May a lifeline on Saturday. Asked how he expected the commission to respond after the vote, he said: “Negotiate.

But, since then, the Mr\u0026nbspPichai\u0026nbsphas held closed door meetings with members of\u0026nbspCongress\u0026nbspto discuss what Republicans have branded as liberal bias at Google.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialFollow updates from the hearing below and watch a\u0026nbsplive stream of the testimony here.Hello and welcome to our live blog of the congressional testimony of Google CEO Sundar Pichai.\u0026nbspWe are waiting on Mr Pichai to arrive.In attendance in Washington today is Alex Jones, the conservative conspiracy theorist who has had plenty of problems with social media over the past year.\u0026nbspJones was in attendance the last time tech CEOs came to testify before Congress, and tends to get into squabbles with folks on a regular basis.\u0026nbspWe\u0027ll see if any Jones news comes out of today\u0027s hearing when the Judiciary Committee calls a recess.Mr Goodlatte has opened the hearing, and recognized House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy as a witness.\u0026nbspMr McCarthy has thanked Mr Pichai, and called Google one of the most valuable companies in the world.Mr McCarthy cited a\u0026nbspWall Street Journal\u0026nbspstatistic that said that 90 per cent of internet searches goes through Google.\u0026nbspHe has also said that there is a widening gap of trust between users and technology companies. He went on to suggest that political biases must not seep into Google\u0027s search product.Chairman Goodlatte says that Google is able to collect an amount of data that would make the NSA blush.\u0026nbspHe said that most Americans probably have no idea how much information Google might be collecting about them when they use the platform.Chairman Goodlatte has now said he is interested in how Google handles objectionable content.\u0026nbspHe also has mentioned algorithmic screening, and the dangers that tinkering with that system could have. He then claimed that some Google employees have considered tinkering with the algorithm.Chairman Goodlatte is hitting on a lot of issues here, and has now mentioned that Android smartphones are able to collect a massive amount of data from users during the course of the day.\u0026nbspThat includes tracking data on movement, and even the mode of transport that someone may take.Ranking member Jerry Nadler is now giving his opening remarks, after Mr Goodlatte thanked Mr Pichai for attending the hearing.\u0026nbspMr Nadler has called the idea that Google and other tech companies have anti-conservative bias a fantasy. He said that he expects Republicans to bring up anecdotes, but that they will provide little evidence of an anti-conservative bias.\u0026nbspMr Nadler, on the other hand, has suggested that they should be concerned about online efforts to spread disinformation. He referenced the 2016 election, in which Russia attacked the US elections in favour of President Donald Trump.Mr Pichai is describing his childhood and the changes that technology had on his life before he moved to the United States 25 years ago.\u0026nbspHe has been the CEO of Google for the past three years.Mr Pichai is noting that Google is a major driver of jobs in the US, and that the company is able to help businesses all across the country.\u0026nbspHe noted that the company drives a massive portion of the US economy. He also said that Google works with the government.\u0026nbspI\u0027m proud to\u0026nbspsay that we do and we will continue to work with the government to keep our company safe and secure, Mr Pichai said.Mr Goodlatte has asked if Android phones send information to servers every few minutes, including location, altitude, temperature, and other data points.\u0026nbspMr Pichai has said that Google goes out of its way to give people the ability to control their privacy.\u0026nbspHe said that users have a choice on what data they send, and that some apps — like fitness apps — require certain data collection.Mr Pichai has said that Google offers privacy checkups in order for users to review what information Google collects on them.\u0026nbspHe said that users are able to review data and then to decide if data is stored or\u0026nbsp deleted. He also said that users can take their data with them if they choose to use other services.\u0026nbspWe want to make this work in a sustainable way, Mr Pichai said of platforms like YouTube, and ensuring that the content is agreeable.Please allow a moment for the live blog to updateShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Come what May, who would replace her  Here are the latest odds.\" data-credit\"PA:Press Association\" data-sizes\"auto\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg stripallw\" PA:Press AssociationTheresa May managed to see off a vote of no confidence after a gruelling week in WestminsterUnder parliamentary rules, the result of the vote of no confidence means Mrs May will go unchallenged by her own party for the next year.But she has strongly hinted that she will step down before her term officially ends in .Mrs May has indicated that she will try to see Brexit before stepping down.However, the weaker-than-expected result might bolster the likelihood of Labour going for a vote of no confidence in the government itself.If this were to go ahead and get the required backing from other opposition parties, it could mean a snap election.There are several possible routes out for May - and there are plenty of colleagues priming themselves for the role.Now delegated to the back benches after quitting as foreign secretary, Boris Johnson remains a favourite to replace Theresa May in No.The controversial Tory has recently signalled his interest for the leadership contest, and has repeatedly refused to rule it out completely.Home secretary Sajid Javid also seems keen to step up to the role - recently unveiling his vision of a Conservative party that reflects a bigger picture of social mobility.If May had lost in the vote of no confidence it would have immediately trigger a leadership contestshe lost - but this is now off the cards.Here are the latest odds from Ladbrokes as of December , .Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is still a hugely popular figure among Tory grassroots and the general public.He drew a huge crowd to hear him bash Theresa Mays Brexit plans in a barnstorming speech at the Tory conference in Birmingham.Boris quit as Foreign Secretary on July  in a killer blow to Mays government.He walked out just hours after she lost Brexit Secretary David Davis over her Chequers plan to keep close ties to Brussels.But many MPs appear to have turned against him, meaning he might struggle to get on the ballot.His aborted leadership bid in  was scuppered by his friend Michael Gove, severely damaging his electoral brand.And his hopes could be dashed by reports of a close friendship with a blonde Tory aide and his orce from we Marina.The bookies have recently been giving Jeremy Corbyn strong odds as the nations most likely next Prime Minister.The Labour leader has had to fight constant opposition from his own MPs including a leadership contest after just a year.But the party has swung behind him after a much stronger than expected  General Election when Labour picked up  seats and Mrs May lost her majority.Although the fabled youthquake of support from younger voters did not happen, Labour is enjoying relatively strong support in opinion polls.He hopes to force a general election by voting down Mrs Mays Brexit deal, and has boasted he would win.The Home Secretary is the current bookies favourite among the Conservatives.Mr Javid was appointed Home Secretary in the wake of the Windrush scandal and the resignation of Amber Rudd.A known Eurosceptic, Mr Javid ended up backing Remain during the EU referendum but is popular among the Tory parliamentary party.Some of his statements in recent months and his backing for a harder Brexit have been taken as signs he is pitching for the leadership.The MP for Bromsgrove in Worcestershire is a former managing director from Deutsche Bank.The former Brexit secretary quit the cabinet in protest over Theresa Mays soft orce deal with the EU.He played a prominent role in the Leave campaign and previously served as a Justice minister.Before he went into politics he was a lawyer, working on EU and World Trade Organisation Law.His appointment was welcomed by Leave-backing MPs.But his former personal assistant branded him a bullying Mr Nasty after she was sacked for leading a double le as an escort.Mr Hunt was the longest-serving Health Secretary in British history before replacing Boris as Foreign Secretary.He left the Department of Health after securing a £bn funding increase for the NHS.Mr Hunt is known to have leadership aspirations and now says he backs Brexit despite campaigning for Remain during the referendum.David Davis quit as Brexit secretary on July , , with a devastating letter warning Mrs May her proposal would leave the UK in a weak negotiating position with Brussels.He has since launched a series of attacks on Mrs Mays strategy, and led a Tory rebellion to ditch the Chequers plan.He called on Cabinet ministers to rise up and kill off the plans.Furious Tories have demanded Mr Davis be installed as interim leader to save true Brexit.Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Latin-fluent millionaire financier and MP for North East Somerset, has emerged as the leading Brexiteer on the backbenches.He has won a huge public profile despite not being a minister and is loved by Tory activists.Rees-Mogg has also garnered a surprise following among many young Tories - including Jungle Queen Georgia Toffolo, who called him a sex god.Devout Catholic Rees-Mogg has made no secret of his socially conservative views, including being anti-abortion and against gay marriage.His plummy tones, double-breasted suits and traditional manner have earned him the nickname The Honourable Member for the Nineteenth Century.The Environment Secretary has achieved a remarkable turnaround since kning Boris Johnson during the  leadership contest.His support among party members dropped through the floor and it seemed his chances were gone for ever.But Mr Gove, who led the Leave campaign in the EU referendum, has rebranded himself as an ecowarrior as Environment Secretary.He has also thrown his full support behind Theresa Mays Brexit plan, winning him friends among MPsnot the party faithful.Though an unlikely candidate at the time, the Brexit campaigner reached the final two of the  leadership contest.She withdrew over ill-judged remarks about Theresa May not being a mother.She is now Leader of the House, and survived in post despite reports Mrs May was planning to cut dead wood in her January reshuffle.Mrs Leadsom had a role in the downfall of Sir Michael Fallon after she accused him of lewd sexual comments.The popular and savvy leader of the Scottish Conservatives has been touted as the potential saviour of the Tories in Westminster.But Ruth has said repeatedly she wants to focus on Scotland and as she is not an MP she currently is not eligible to stand as leader of the UK party.In September  she declared she never wants to be Prime Minister.She will also be putting politics on the back burner for a while as she has just had a baby.Another way for a PM to resign would be to lose a vote of confidence in the Commons, leading to the government falling.In that scenario there could well be a fresh General Election, with both major parties trying to secure a parliamentary majority."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/nintchdbpict000240614813.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jacob rees mogg children vandalised house brexit","story":"The MP for North East Somerset caused controversy after airing his views on gay marriage and abortion. Then, on August  his Somerset home was vandalised. Heres his story.Jacob Rees-Mogg is a backbench Tory MP for North East Somerset but is better known for his period drama persona which has been winning him fans.He entered parliament during the  General Election after working as a fund manager in London.During the EU referendum, he was a passionate Brexiteer and made many high-profile media appearances arguing for a vote to leave the EU.To say he was born into a privileged position is an understatement - he is the Eton and Oxford-educated son of the long-serving Times editor William Rees-Mogg.During the  General Election Rees-Mogg attracted ridicule.This is because he brought his faithful nanny along with him as he battled to be elected in the working class and staunchly Labour seat of Central Fe.He had batted away speculation that he would challenge Theresa May for the leadership of the party, insisting he was completely loyal to her.Rees-Mogg said he was more likely to become POPE than PM.On October  he also said changing Conservative leader could cause more problems than it solves and the party should back May.He said the Torys lack of a parliamentary majority meant it would be dficult for an alternative leader to push through an ambitious Brexit deal.Despite all this, he was one of the  Conservative MPs who submitted a letter of no confidence, which triggered a leadership challenge on December , and ultimately failed to oust May.There has been speculation that he might try his hand for the role, but previous polls put his likelihood of becoming PM at -.Outside the political arena, Jacob is a family man with six children.His we is journalist Helena de Chair, daughter of the aristocrat Somerset de Chair.He celebrated the birth of his sixth child with a touching picture on Instagram in September .He wrote: Helena and I announce with great joy that we have a baby Sixtus Dominic Bonace Christopher, a brother for Peter, Mary, Thomas, Anselm and Alfred.In May  it was reported by The Mail on Sunday that he had purchased a new £million house just around the corner from No  Downing Street.The five-storey mansion is just a short walk away from the Parliament and is also close to Tory HQ in the heart of Old Westminster.Rees-Mogg joked he had been priced out of swanky Mayfair and needed a bigger home for his six children.Rees-Mogg named his sixth child Sixtus, which is a Roman name meaning polished.It is also the name of a Pope and Saint.His full name is Sixtus Dominic Bonace Christopher .Sixtus eldest sibling is Peter Theodore Alphege, who was born in .Jacobs only daughter Mary Anne Charlotte Emma came along a year later followed by Thomas Wentworth Somerset Dunstan in  and Anselm Charles Fitzwilliam in .His fth child, Alfred Wulfric Leyson Pius, was featured in a video as his father tried to teach him how to say Brexit.Alfred was born in February .In September , a thug shouted at the children your daddys a horrible person outside their London home.It happened on August , , when the Rees-Mogg family were on holiday in the US.According to the police, graffiti was sprayed on a building and on a car as well as the garden.They managed to write posh scum on windows of the house.The MPs th Century country home, called Gournay Court, is a listed building.He also owns a £.m house in Westminster.Due to his strict Catholic beliefs, Mogg admitted on ITVs Good Morning Britain that he did not support abortion even in the case of rape and incest.I am completely opposed to abortion, le begins at conception, he said.Abortion is morally indefensible.The MP has also repeatedly voted against sex marriage legislation.He defended everyones right to free speech, and insisted thathe ever became Prime Minister, the law is not going to change.Soon after Rees-Mogg made his remarks it emerged the millionaire MP was making money out of an abortion pill despite his strong stance against it.Somerset Capital Management, the investment company he co-founded, owns nearly £million of shares in Indonesian firm Kalbe Farma.Reacting to the story, Rees-Mogg told The Mirror: This is not something I would wish to invest in personally but you have a duty as an investment manager not to impose constraints on investors.He added: This company does not procure the abortion of babies.It’s not my money in these investments and I profit from the total amount of client money we hold, not the investments we make.The Made in Cha star and  Im A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here winner has admitted she has the hots for Rees-Mogg.In an interview with the Sunday Times, Georgia Toff Toffolo revealed the politicians she admired “the standard - Zac Goldsmith, Jacob Rees-Mogg. I fancy them all, adding: Jacob’s a sex god.”The reality star elaborated: “The human mind can be sexy. He’s so clever, I just love him, adding: “I fancy middle-aged politicians, but I’ve never been with one.”Rees-Mogg has responded to news of the -year-olds crush, saying he was “greatly surprised but nonetheless flattered” by the revelation.“I am glad Miss Toffolo won and hope this is the launchpad for a glittering career,” he added.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Let’s look forward with confidence.”Javid has said he will launch a leadership challengeTheresa Mays Brexit deal collapses and shes ousted as Prime Minister.This plan was scuppered when May won a vote to remain PM after a vote of no confidence was called.However, only securing  per cent of her partys backing, May is still vulnerable.He has reportedly begun to gather support from ministers and is creating a team to help him bid to become the first non-white PM.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson are reported to also be seeking support for their own leadership bids.One Cabinet minister told The Sun: “Sajid is tapping us up. He is very direct, but he’s not offering jobs yet, which wouldn’t be a good look”.Another senior Tory disclosed: “He told me that Theresa’s Brexit deal is s***, she’ll be forced out when it falls, and he is then going to declare immediately”.Javid has said he would support a no-deal Brexit and has been backed by leader of the Commons, Andrea Leadsom.The government has been rocked by the scandal of Windrush-generation immigrants who have been treated as criminals by the Home Office despite living here legally for decades.Commonwealth citizens were encouraged to move to Britain from the s to s, but many were later unable to prove their right to be here. Some lost jobs, were denied healthcare or were threatened with deportation.Mr Javid said his family could easily have been caught up in the same situation after moving to the UK half a century ago.He told The Sunday : “I thought that could be my mum, my dad, my uncle ...it could be me.”He added: “I was really concerned when I first started hearing and reading about some of the issues.It immediately impacted me. I’m a second-generation migrant.My parents came to this country from Pakistan, just like the Windrush generation.”His comments heaped more pressure on Ms Rudd, but he also defended the government, urging people to look at the bigger picture and his colleagues efforts to put things right.After being made Home Secretary he said his most urgent task is sorting out the Windrush mess and his immigration policy will be fair and will treat people with respect and decency.The Sun revealed how Mr Javid grew up on Britain’s most crime ridden street, which led to his brother Bas Javid joining the police.Bas is now a chief superintendent in the West Mids Police Force, and his brother drew on the coppers  years of force experience in his first major speech.Describing his shock at the abuse he saw hurled at his brother as he tried to work, Sajid said: Over the years, I’ve heard what he has to say about policing.I know the tricky situations he’s been in. He’s been hurt more times than I want to know from being assaulted on duty.I’ve seen the impact the job has on his family le."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000402655327-e1528307444665.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"what brexit backstop plan theresa may eu irish border latest","story":"Here is our guide to the plan and what it means for Northern Ireland and its border with the Republic of Ireland.The backstop plan is essentially a safety netthere is no Brexit trade deal.It would avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.The backstop will see Britain remain in the customs union for as long as necessary until an alternative way of keeping the border open is found.It would ensure that no tarfs, quotas, rules of origin or customs processes would be applied to UK-EU trade.At the same time the UK would be able to strike free trade agreements with other countries.On November , EU leaders approved an agreement on the UKs withdrawal from the EU.MPs were due to vote on the deal in parliament today, but yesterday the PM announced she was delaying the vote.There was a three-hour long debate in the house of commons yesterday during which May was asked many questions about what will happen with the Irish border.She will attempt to reopen negotiations with Brussels about the Irish border backstop, however they have said negotiations are now closed.Attorney General Geoffrey Cox has been ordered to publish all the legal advice hes given Mrs May on her proposed deal - but has only handed over a summary instead.It concluded the proposed backstop would stop Britain making trade deals around the world in a separate legal document.After the refusal to publish the full legal advice, the government were found to be in contempt of Parliament on December  for the first time in history.Theresa May lost a crucial Commons vote by  to  over her refusal to publish the full legal advice on her EU deal.Conceding defeat moments after the vote, Commons leader Andrea Leadsom agreed to publish the “final and full” legal advice that Mr Cox gave to the Cabinet as they deliberated the EU deal.A motion tabled by Labour, the SNP, other opposition parties and the DUP, argued ministers were in contempt due to their failure to fully publish advice given to Cabinet by Attorney General Geoffrey Cox.Addressing the issue of the backstop - which will keep Britain in the customs uniontheres no other way to protect the Irish border - the Attorney General said: There is no unilateral right for either party to terminate this arrangement.This means thatno superseding agreement can be reached within the implementation period, the protocol would be activated and in international law would subsist, evennegotiations had broken down.How likely that is to happen is a political question, to which the answer will no doubt depend partly on the extent to which it is in either partys interests to remain indefinitely within its arrangements.We are indefinitely committing to itit came into force. There is no point in the Government trying to hide that fact.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.At the start of a key debate in Parliament on her Brexit plan, the Prime Minister said the backstop was not a trap for Britain.The backstop is not a trick to trap us in the EU, said Mrs May.It actually gives us some important benefits of access to the EUs market without many of the obligations and that is something the EU will not want to let happen, let alone persist for a long time.The unpopular backstop measure may have been once of the contributors to a vote of no confidence which left Theresa May facing a leadership challenge on December ."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000421388248.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jeremy corbyn as pm country faces ruin","story":"No doubt she will take one of her long walks as she prepares to face the toughest week of her political le.But on her trek around the gardens one thing should focus her mind above all others.The prospect of Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street within weeks.Of all the outcomes of the Brexit fiasco, the most disastrous by far would be ushering into Number  a man who would do untold damage to Britain.It seems almost inevitable that MPs will throw out the PM’s woeful plan on Tuesday, possibly by a majority of more than .That is not just defeat. It is catastrophic defeat.The PM could immediately face a vote of no confidence triggered by power-hungry Labour.The Parliamentary arithmetic means that she could narrowly lose this vote — evenshe manages to win the support of every MP on the Conservative benches behind her.It would raise the terrying prospect of Corbyn and his rag-tag band of half-baked Marxists in Downing Street.Not only will Corbyn fritter away the country’s hard-won economic and social progress but he will also pursue policies which are a disgraceful betrayal of Brexit and millions of his own voters.In the face of the dismaying scenario before her, the PM has no choice but to postpone Tuesday’s crucial vote on her deal.It will be dficult and humiliating.But it will give her vital breathing space at Thursday’s EU summit to address the grievous concerns over her backstop proposal.Even the most blinkered of Brussels Eurocrats, whose intransigence so far has led to this crisis, must realise that such a concession is as much in their interests as ours.Mrs May has often stressed her determination to act in the national interest.Does she really think it is best for this country to press on with a vote which could hand victory to Jeremy Corbyn Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If so, we need to massively ramp up preparation for a clean break.Why wouldn’t the EU come up with a sensible compromise Because this is a club of ideological bullies whose commitment to the project is far more important to them than the interests of their own citizens.They want us to hold a second referendum, so we make the “right” choice.But another ballot would be a disaster for trust in our democracy.The arrogance of those pushing for one here at home knows no bounds.It’s now revealed that Tony Blair, now effectively the Remain architect-in-chief, demanded that the body set up to scrutinise the work of former frontline politicians didn’t publish how he earned his cash after he left office.He doesn’t want us to find out, and he certainly doesn’t want us to have any say in the future of the country.He, and those around him, think they know best.But .million people think dferently — and Theresa May owes them every ounce of her strength.YET more evidence that the NHS is in need of desperate reform.An “over-s” AE wing  Bereaved parents being shafted It’s not money that’s the problem.

We are due to leave the EU on March  next year, deal or no deal — and Parliament cannot agree what to do.Some MPs want the PM to go back to Brussels and negotiate something better. Others want to negotiate a dferent deal altogether. Labour wants an election. Die-hard Remainers want another referendum. Many Leavers just want to get out without a deal.And Mrs May insists her deal is the right one, despite knowing it is so unpopular that she couldn’t put it to a vote in the Commons.Whoever gets their way, it is time to strap on our seatbelts and brace ourselves for an almighty crash. However things end, we are heading for multiple constitutional crises that risk smashing our political system to pieces.Yesterday Mrs May promised more assurances from Brussels about her deal’s so-called “backstop”, in which we will be trapped in a customs union with the EU, and Northern Ireland will be trapped inside the single market.But it is completely implausible that she will be able to negotiate an end to the backstop or the right to simply withdraw from it in future.So convinced was the PM that she could not win this argument with Brussels, she did not propose it during the original talks. The Europeans insist they will not make any legally binding commitments about how the backstop might end.So the only effect of delaying the vote is to take up even more time before March . In other words, the game of chicken between ministers and rebel MPs will get more and more high-risk.The time for MPs to prevent a no-deal Brexit will be cut short, the chances of no deal will increase and ministers — because they want to bully Parliament into accepting their deal — will continue to refuse to prepare properly for no deal.And remember what the PM’s deal involves. For nearly two years — but maybe longer — we will pay into the EU budget, accept free movement and respect all European laws.Then, when there is no agreement on the future relationship, we will find ourselves in the backstop. Northern Ireland will effectively be annexed by Brussels. British goods heading for Ulster will be stopped and checked, European goods will be waved through. The EU will decide how other countries can trade with Britain, without our say and regardless of the effects on British jobs. And we will be forced to follow the rulings of the European Court of Justice.Our constitution says Parliament is sovereign: Nothing is more powerful than an Act of Parliament, debated and approved by elected representatives.What’s more, no Parliament can “bind its successors”: One generation of MPs cannot dictate what future generations can and cannot decide.Yet the PM’s deal subordinates Parliament to the EU, and does so permanently, with no legal right for Britain to escape its punishing terms. It would leave us as a colony: A country dismembered and incapable of democratic self-government.The remaining options are just as dangerous. Many pro- Europeans want Britain to join the European Economic Area and form a customs union with the EU.Norway Plus, as their plan is now known, would mean Britain accepting even more European laws than the PM proposes, without any say over what they are. For that reason, coupled with the knowledge that it does not avoid the backstop, Norway Plus is even worse than Theresa May’s deal.Yet the “Norwegians” inside the Conservative Party persist. They know there is no majority among Tory MPs for their model but they have a plan.If Mrs May’s deal is rejected and they win a majority for Norway Plus with support from Labour MPs, they can install a caretaker prime minister to deliver it.With a Commons majority for Norway Plus, they believe the Queen would be obliged to appoint their man — David Lidington, perhaps — as PM.The risk to the monarchy of embroiling the Queen in a political controversy of such magnitude seems not to matter to them. One other option, pushed by a handful of Conservatives and many Labour MPs, is to re-run the referendum. Their goal is to remain in the EU after all.The possibility they might lose, the effects on public confidence in our democracy and the instability caused by a narrow remain victory do not matter.For these Europhiles, staying in the EU is more important than the damage they might do to Parliament and to the party system our democracy relies upon.The default option, however,Parliament rejects the PM’s deal, is a no-deal Brexit. That was decided when Parliament passed the Withdrawal Act earlier this year. To override that Act, Parliament must do more than hold a single vote, and the Government must do more than negotiate something .Parliament must amend the Withdrawal Act or pass another Act to set us on a dferent path. If there is any ambiguity, the Supreme Court — whose president, Baroness Hale, has challenged the sovereignty of Parliament in the past — might again play a controversial role.While the Commons is ided, we know a majority of MPs are determined to stop a no-deal Brexit at almost any cost. Some senior Tories say they will vote against the Government in a confidence motion — risking the election of Jeremy Corbyn —it means they can stop leaving without a deal.It is probable we are heading for Norway Plus or another referendum. Whatever happens, the constitutional consequences are likely to be profound.The power of the courts, the party system, Parliamentary sovereignty, the future of the Union, even the monarchy, might come under scrutiny. Whatever happens will be controversial and further ide the country. But something has to give.So buckle your seatbelts and adopt the brace position.

This would have starved the country of wealthy investors for months.The latest gaffe follows an ongoing delay to the publication of the Immigration White Paper amid a Cabinet stand-off over post-Brexit controls.And the Home Office is still battling the fallout of the Windrush scandal earlier this year where it emerged Commonwealth nationals living in the UK for years had been wrongly deported and deprived of medical care.The new rules were likely to ask applicants to provide comprehensive audits of their financial and business interests – and proof they had control of £ million of investment funds. It follows a Government review of the visa route as part of a crackdown on money laundering.Some  applications for the ‘golden visas’ came in July alone – up nearly  per cent on a year ago.

It’s a matter for him but nevertheless it’s a challenge and all colleagues need to form their own view of that.”It was the latest outburst in a long-running vein of animosity between Mrs Leadsom, whose role involves organising the order of business in the Commons, and Mr Bercow, who presides over sittings.In May, Mr Bercow hit the headlines after being accused of calling Mrs Leadsom a “stupid woman” and “f****** useless”.Mr Bercow admitted using the word “stupid” amid frustration at the Government when it forced a debate on the Grenfell tragedy to be cut short.But he offered no apology and insisted he would “continue to speak out firmly” for the interests of the Commons.He was not investigated by the parliamentary standards watchdog because he is responsible for ruling on behaviour in the chamber.A spokeswoman for the Speaker declined to comment.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This, alas, is the position the Government and the Prime Minister have now reached.For many people their virtues and vices are cut from the same cloth. Indeed, one may simply be an extension of another. This is what we have seen with Mrs May.Her very steadiness, dutulness and determination have led her to be unable to see that her policy has failed. In her latest House of Commons statement it was once again the mantra that “nothing has changed” — these three small dangerous words that did so much damage to her election campaign were wheeled out again but convinced nobody.After Ministers had taken to the media to insist that the vote on her deal would go ahead there was not one word of apology to them or hint of embarrassment that policy had turned on a sixpence. Continuity, instead, was claimed.At the heart of this humiliation was a dreadful deal that does not represent Brexit. As a London cab driver told me yesterday, he did not vote for a deal. He voted to leave.That widespread sentiment is not honoured in the Withdrawal Agreement, which subjects the United Kingdom to the European Union as a vassal state or colony.Yet the humiliation is even greater for having failed even to allow her deal to be voted on in Parliament. Fearing a huge defeat the Prime Minister is now scurrying around the Continent asking for something she said was impossible a few days ago.Last week this deal was the only one available and the British people were told to like it or lump it.Today, apparently new assurances can be given which will allay our fears. Both positions cannot be true and as EU officials have been arrogantly dismissive of Mrs May’s request it seems that only the airline profit margins will benefit from these trips.However, it could have been so dferent. Had the Prime Minister held the vote and lost by over  votes then she would have had proof to show the European Union that the deal could not pass through Parliament.It would have made it abundantly clear that the Withdrawal Agreement had failed and would have encouraged the EU to take her request for change seriously. Instead the President of the Commission and of the Council have mocked her and almost thrown back in her face the line that “nothing has changed”.Fortunately the UK has a trump card, which is to leave without a deal. In these circumstances we would save £billion of taxpayer’s money and be able to remove all tarfs on goods we do not produce,  helping the least well off.We can immediately cut VAT on domestic fuel, helping the elderly in the winter and remove it from women’s sanitary products where the imposition of tax is an injustice.The Prime Minister has challenged those who want to deliver on the Referendum result to be “honest” about the risks of leaving without a deal, including potential queues at Dover, as there have been in the past when the French go on strike or blockade the roads.There is inevitably a risk that the EU is determined to punish a country that leaves and is willing to break International Treaty obligations.On the other hand there are tangible advantages to be had, too, as Mrs May must herself recognise. Otherwise she ought not to have said “no deal is better than a bad deal”. If she never believed this to be the case then it explains why her negotiating position has been so weak and submissive to the EU. It is the root cause of her failure.This must now be recognised. The Government’s Policy, personally linked to the Prime Minister and the operation at Downing Street, has produced an agreement that fails to deliver Brexit and breaks Theresa May’s own promises.This has lost her the confidence of the House of Commons, for she can no longer push her most important business through, and by all constitutional precedence she ought to resign.Mrs May is a decent person with many honourable characteristics but her handling of Brexit has been hopeless, and has left the country, the Conservative Party and the Government humiliated.As we look to forge an agreement that could set our relations with our nearest neighbours for generations and define the authority of our own democracy, it is time for someone who backs Brexit to take over.Theresa May has failed because she never really wanted to do it.

At that moment, the wind blew my hair and head scarf which got stuck in the spindle.I had to struggle not to get my body caught in the spindle. If I didnt my body would have been torn apart too. But then I realised my hair was gone.Binnaz said she could hardly see because of the blood running into her eyes, but managed to find the remote control for the harvester and turn it off.She added: Then I realised I was still alive, I ran to the tractor.When I saw myself in the mirror I got very scared but I drove back home.Despite her horric injuries, she drove the tractor about a mile home where her father, Gungor Unver, took her to a local hospital.Gungor said: She parked the tractor next to the house and walked over. I was shocked when I saw my daughter covered in blood.I called  immediately, but could not wait for the arrival of the ambulance.We got into the car and drove immediately to get help. Even the hospital staff were horried when they saw her.Binnaz was later flown by air ambulance to the Antalya Research and Training hospital in south-western Turkey.Her husband, Tugrul Sertcelik, , said that at first surgeon Dr Asim Uslu had thought he would be unable to repair the damage as part of her scalp was missing.But, fortunately, Binnazs cousins had later found it and also put it in a refrigerator.Tugrul added: When Dr Uslu saw a picture of the missing skin part, he said it was not damaged and could be stitched back. Three hours later, the hair was brought to Antalya.Surgeons worked for seven hours to repair Binnazs damaged head, after finally receiving her scalp more than four days after the injury.Luckily, her cousins had had the presence of mind to refrigerate the skin and it was still in sufficiently good condition to be sewn back onto her head.Binnaz is now well on the way to making a full recovery, her hair is beginning to grow back, and she is smiling again from her hospital bed.Dr Uslu paid tribute to his patient saying: She could have died due to the bleeding. But Binnaz is a very brave woman.When the missing part came to us we took her into surgery. Normally the replantation can be made after a maximum of  hours but  hours had passed.We tried anyway, this was a very dficult surgery that lasted seven hours.

The fear was such that you felt hostage in your own town by these kids.Crime stats from Cheshire police reveal the number of crimes reported in Congleton and the immediate surrounding area over the last few months.The crimes reported include anti-social behaviour, criminal damage, arson, theft, sexual offences and burglary.October -  crimesSeptember -  crimesAugust -  crimesJuly -  crimesJune -  crimesMay -  crimesApril -  crimesMarch -  crimesHow these kids can cause so much havoc is beyond me.Among the gang’s victims are a -year-old girl, who was allegedly attacked by the rampaging yobs after daring to stand up to them.The student, too scared to be named, needed surgery to a fractured ankle after being pushed to the floor.Recovering at her home in Congleton, the young student recalled: “They were asking us for fags, so I told them to p*** off. They started lobbing sticks and twigs - whatever they could find - at us.“Later on, we saw them again. There were about  of them, some as young as . They were throwing eggs and flour at girls.“I stood up to them and said ‘what the hell are you doing ’ and one of them threw a bag of flour over me.“Another one smashed an egg over my head.“I was fuming.“I followed one of them behind the Argos. He strode towards me and pushed me out of his way.“I fell and fractured my ankle.”The teenager, who is studying to become a hairdresser, had to have a screw drilled into her ankle during a two-day hospital stay.Five weeks after the November  ordeal, she still requires the use of crutches and wears a special protective boot.Rachel Brown, , had gone to pick a friend up at Sandbach train station in April when her car was surrounded by dozens of teens.Speaking to the Sun Online, the mum said: “They surrounded the car and proceeded to jump up and down on the bonnet.“They weren’t aggressive to begin with, they were normal teenagers that were hyped up and wanted to be known.“But then it got to be a bit more – I opened my car door to try to get them to leave and they started taking stuff out of my car.”Rachel said the youths also started mocking her Scottish accent, and licking her car windows as the incident escalated.She said: “It quickly changed – one of them said - oh  you’re an f***ing slag, go die in a fire.“It went from being sort of funny to quite dark really  fast.”Eventually, the gang left with Rachel reporting it straight away to police.She said: “I was intimidated but I was thinking more along the lines, they have run off and they are looking for trouble, that’s why I reported it.”Police responded straight away, taking forensic swabs of her car and pulling CCTV of the area.But the abuse worsened after Rachel spoke to police, with the Congleton local receiving threats online, including from -year-old Jayden Burdern.The message read: “Oi why’ve u sed I’ve smashed ur car n got me court.“Best drop da charges”.And in another message, a pal wrote: “Oi u slag.“Drop the charges wid burden and ik where u live sou don’t drop em I’ll blast ur t*t off.“And your houses.”Jayden Burden, , pleaded guilty in court this week to witness intimidation for sending electronic messages.A British Transport Police said they had investigated the incident of anti-social behaviour at Sandbach station on April .They added: “A number of enquiries were made into the incident, however the Crown Prosecution Service later decided not to continue with court proceedings.”Another -year-old caught up in the carnage was knocked out outside a takeaway on the same night.She was left with concussion and whiplash after being kicked.Her mum said: “They started shouting stuff and she told them to leave her friends alone.“She was knocked to the floor and kicked.“Nothing like this has happened before.Cheshire Police believe the Crewe gang were behind both terrying incidents.That some locals vowed to take the law into their own hands over a lack of visible policing, with fears more than a dozen other teens are yet to be brought to book.Pub owner Shaun Radclfe, , called for a public meeting with cops over the disorder.He said: “It all started about two months ago.“A group were coming down to Congleton and causing havoc in the town centre.“They had been banned from Crewe, so they went to Sandbach and were quickly moved on by the police.“So they ended up in Congleton. The police were never around so they kept getting away with it.“Everyone was so angry - there were messages on social media where people were threatening to take the law into their own hands.I didnt want my -year-old daughter to go out at night.“Thankfully the police have bucked their ideas up and arrests have been made.Dog walkers at pretty Congleton Park told how the area had become a no-go zone at night because of the trouble.Police have linked two attacks in the park to the Crewe invasion. One attack was said to have been on a teenage boy near to the town’s leisure centre.Other incidents being probed by police include disorder when several youths were trying to board a the  bus from Congleton to Crewe.Arriva Buses has passed CCTV footage to cops.A pensioner told Sun Online he was fearful of being in the town centre.The -year-old, who did not want to be named, said: “They’re coming to cause trouble.“It makes you think twice about coming to town - especially with it going dark so soon.”Congleton kids, meanwhile, have come in for praise after replanting flowers and tidying up the mess left by the yobs.Mr Radclfe, who saw more than  people attend his public forum with police, added “It’s not something you see in Congleton and, to be fair, some of our kids have helped tidy up the mess they’ve left behind.“This is a nice little town and we don’t need this. Kids shouldn’t be told to stay indoors because there’s a chance they might be beaten up.”Three teens - Jayden Burdern, , Riley Gaffney, , and -year-old Reigan Gaffney, , from Crewe, were this week hit with criminal behaviour orders.It is not known whether the teenagers were directly involved in any of the incidents described.At the Crewe home of Jayden today, rope was tied around a front gate.A man yelled: “F*** off, f*** off” loud enough to hear through closed double-glazed windows.There was no answer at the home of the Gaffney brothers, who live with their gran, Jeannette, a parcel delivery worker.IT used to be a quiet town full of pensioners and families settling down.Almost half the population are over , with .% aged  or older according to the Census data.But the tranquil town had its serenity shattered with the arrival of violent yobs bent on chaos.Before then, the country of Cheshire - to which Congleton belongs - had less crime than the nations average.It had some of the lowest figures in the country for kne crime, vehicle crime and burglary, according to police stats.It even won three gold medals at Britain in Bloom for its beautul bouquets. Councillor Janet Clowes, Cheshire East Council cabinet member for adult social care and integration, said: “These young people’s behaviour impacted on members of the public and we had no alternative but to seek these Criminal Behaviour Orders alongside custodial sentencing for those that continue to persist with their offending.“We hope the orders assist these young people by giving them the boundaries they need to improve their behaviour.“In the case of a young person, taking a criminal case is always a last resort and our officers both within Cheshire Constabulary and Cheshire East Council have spent a considerable amount of time over several years to support everyone involved.“However, there has to be a point at which we say, enough is enough, our residents have the right to live in peace and without fear and we must protect them from iniduals who don’t respect this.We know it can be dficult but we would urge people to report anti-social behaviour to us.”Sergeant Andy Baker, from the Crewe Beat Team, added: “The behaviour of this group of youths was totally unacceptable and I welcome the punishments that they have been given.“We will continue to work closely with our partners to take robust action against those who persistently cause misery to members of our community with this kind of behaviour.”Last month we told how up to  teenage yobs were terrorising another town -  miles away.Residents in Stanley, County Durham told how gangs of kids as young as ten were attacking cops with fireworks and bricks and pelting locals with eggs."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000309979144.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"woman grab boy next chippenham","story":"Wiltshire Police say the youngster was approached at the store in Chippenham at around pm on Tuesday.She is alleged to have tried to grab his arm before he moved away and went to tell his mum, who was apparently nearby at the tills.Community Co-ordinator PC Hazel Anderson, from Wiltshire North Community Policing Team, said: “The boy was not hurt in any way but obviously both him and his mother have been left shaken.“The boy did exactly the right thing and went to tell his mother what happened, and she then phoned police.“We are keeping an open mind about the circumstances around the incident and I would like to reassure people that there is nothing to suggest there is any risk to children in the area.“We have been examining CCTV from the store and our enquiries are continuing.”A Wiltshire Police spokesman later said: “Following the report of a suspicious incident in Next in Chippenham, we have now spoken to everyone involved and can confirm that no crime has been committed and no further action is needed.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The clay pot contained copper plates, tin alloy, and an iron rod.It could have been used to create an electric current by filling it with an acidic solution, like vinegar.No one knows what the device was used for, but it sheds some light on the fact that people may have been learning about electricity long before Humphry Davy invented the first electric light in ."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000455951740.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may vows to carry on","story":"The PM set the clock ticking on the end of her Premiership as she addressed all Tory MPs last night.Minutes later, they decided to give her more time in No in a dramatic snap confidence vote on her rocking leadership.But Mrs May took a heavy blow, as  Tories refused to back her versus  who did – a majority of , or % of her troops.Her bitter critics seized on the deep split to insist she would step much within weeks, rather than serving up to three more years.In an attempt to ease the tidal wave of anger against her handling of Brexit, the PM revealed she was giving up her burning ambition to right the wrong of last year when she threw away the Tories’ Commons majority.She told a packed Commons committee room: “Look in my heart, I would have liked to lead the Party in the next election, partly because of what happened last time.“But I realise that the party would like a dferent leader to take them into that election.”Instead, she insisted the question they were voting on in her leadership “for now” to get the nation through Brexit, as one minister said she also told the room it was “no time for navel gazing”.At the same time, the PM insisted she was “listening to colleagues and acting on their concerns” as she said she was doing her “very best” to plot away through the myriad of dferent Brexit views that Parliament has.During testy exchanges during the showdown meeting, angry hardline Brexiteer criti hauled her over the coals.One MP, Lee Rowley, told Mrs May witheringly: “Stamina is not a policy, Prime Minister”.Mrs May was also grilled on what further concessions she had wrung out of Brussels, and whether she really was prepared to walk away without a deal – a question she pointedly ducked.One critic in the room said she was clearly nervous, and started her pm address with the gaffe “good morning colleagues”, and her answers were “evasive”.But loyalists banged the giant committee room’s desks and doors loudly in support, with pro-May Tory grandee Sir Nicholas Soames dubbing her “magnicent”.The shock confidence vote in her Tory leadership was declared at .am yesterday by Tory backbenchers’  Committee boss Sir Graham Brady.He revealed the threshold for it of  letters had finally been reached, having hovered on around  for weeks but surged in the last few days from MPs irate that Mrs May pulled a doomed vote on her Brexit deal on Monday.Sir Graham phoned Mrs May at pm on Tuesday evening to break the dramatic news to her.Reacting with a powerful statement on No’s steps before am, Mrs May vowed to fight bid to topple her “with everything I have got”.Ousting her would mean Britain’s EU exit date would have to be delayed for months by whoever succeeded her, the PM warned.And she had insisted: “Weeks spent tearing ourselves apart would only create more ision”.The leadership crisis erupted ahead of crucial EU summit in Brussels today, during which Mrs May will plea for better terms on the hated Irish back stop element of her Brexit deal.The PM was also forced to rip up a trip to Dublin yesterday afternoon to hold key talks with Irish premier Leo Varadkar.Every member of the Cabinet immediately rushed out messages of support and their backing for Mrs May, along with most of her  ministers.Long standing eurosceptic Ian Liddell-Grainger gave an early inkling that the PM would win out among the  or so waverers, saying early yesterday afternoon: “I thought about this long and hard. We can’t change horses in the middle of the race”But other MPs sat on the fence and said they would wait to hear what the PM had to day to them.Backbencher Michael Fabricant said he wanted to hear from Mrs May that she has found “a solution or an alternative way forward”.After Mrs May addressed her MPs at pm last night, an emotional Home Office Minister Victoria Atkins welled up as she told reporters of the PM’s decision to step down, saying: “It was an emotional moment”.But her critics questioned her pledge to step down before , after she ducked follow up questions to name a hard date when she would go.Brexiteer rebel leader Jacob Rees Mogg also insisted she had left key wriggle room in her promise, saying: “She recognised the party doesn’t want her so it wasn’t her intention to stand.“But intentions can change.”The PM was seen to have been bolstered earlier by a strong performance at PMQs, after even Labour MPs admitted she had trounced Jeremy Corbyn.Tory grandee and at bitter critic Ken Clarke – who once dubbed her “a bloody dficult woman – rose to tell the chamber during the session that a leadership contest now was “unhelpful, irrelevant and irresponsible”.Mrs May’s husband Philip made a rare appearance in the public gallery to watch her, with a No aide saying he wanted to give her “emotional support”.Charlie Elphicke, , was quizzed by cops earlier this year over “serious allegations”.And Andrew Grfiths, , still faces a party probe for bombarding two young women with lewd text messages.The married dad quit as small business minister in July after it was revealed he sent , messages in  days soon after his first child’s birth.The pair were expected to cancel each other out. Mr Grfiths, the PM’s former chief of staff, said he would back Mrs May while Mr Elphicke was expected to oppose her.But their reinstatement sparked fury. Labour MP Dawn Butler said: “How can Theresa May call herself a feminist when she lets an MP who was suspended for sexual harassment back into the Conservative Party to vote for her in the leadership challenge ”Fellow Labour MP Jess Phillips added: “They said, ‘We won’t let patronage and power change our minds where wrongdoing occurred’. They lied. They all lied.”As the two hour-long secret ballot opened last night, a total of  Tory MPs had declared their public support for Mrs May.Just  had said they would vote against her.Other prominent critics of the PM, including ex-Cabinet ministers Dominic Raab and Boris Johnson, refused to say how they had voted.But amid high skull-duggery, several MPs were claimed to have pledged their support to BOTH camps.Loyal Tories were last night tweeting snaps of their ballot paper, with one – business minister Margot James – saying she was “proud to have voted in support of the PM”.Several Tory MPs reported to have been inundated with messages from party members and normal constituents for them to back Mrs May.MPs filed into Committee Room  to place their vote, after being asked to show their photographic ID passes.Officials from the  Committee, the backbench body that represents all Tory MPs, checked off their names from a list and handed them a numbered ballot paper.On it was with the simple question “I have confidence in Theresa May as leader of the Conservative Party   I do not have confidence in Theresa May as leader of the Conservative Party”.The Prime Minister placed her vote at .pm.Asked by reporters how she’d voted she laughed before heading out with security officers.Former Brexit Secretary David Davis moaned as he left the room that officials didn’t know who he was and “wanted to see my bloody pass”.THERESA May had to lap Parliament Square ahead of Prime Minister’s Questions after the gates did not open.Her convoy directed her bomb-proof armoured Jaguar XJL to do a loop of Parliament Square before police on Carriage Gates eventually opened the doors.Twitter users had joked that it was “a bit early for a victory lap” ahead of the vote.It was her second car gaffe after she was locked in her limo before meeting Angela Merkel in Berlin on Tuesday.Her embarrassed security staff battled for  seconds to open the PM’s door.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

detachment of the US Air Force’s Edwards Air Force Base.Tyler posted footage of his “discovery” to his YouTube channel ‘secureteam’ where he echoed other outlandish claims made by fellow alien conspiracist Bob Lazar.Explaining his “findings”, Tyler claims to see “three big hangar doors” that he believes stretch “miles into the ground”.Linking his theories to Lazar’s, he claims these new ‘hangars’ are similar to artistic illustations based on Lazar’s claims from the s.Back then, Lazar famously claimed that UFOs had been “camouflaged” into the sides of mountains at the site of the dried-out Papoose Lake – which is bizarrely the same location seen in Tylers video.Elaborating on what he thinks he can see, Tyler claims that the “openings” appear to be some sort of “secret entrance into these mountains.”The video was uploaded early in the day on December ,  and has drawn more than , YouTube views.Over the past decades, conspiracy theorists have regularly claimed that this heavily guarded military airfield was actually a hot spot for UFO activity.UFO chasers regularly climb Tikaboo Peak – located around  miles away – in order to get a peek at one of the most talked about military bases in the US.While there is not much to actually see at Area , except some white buildings which require binoculars to get a look at, visitors to the site often see their imagination run wild with fantasies of the extra-terrestrial wonders that are claimed to be within the compound."},{"url":null,"title":"wicked step mum harry potter room starved kid nappy","story":"Tammi Bleimeyer was jailed for  years after starving the child and making him wear a nappy at their home in the town of Spring.The -year-old , from Texas, was found guilty of injury to a child by omission after forcing Jordan Bleimeyer, now aged nine, to sleep in the tiny crawlspace under the stairs with his lone mattress surrounded by exposed nails and wiring.Jordan weighed just lbswhen he was finally rescued from his hellish ordeal.Doctors said he was days from death when he was found, and compared his state of malnourishment to that of a Holocaust survivor.The child’s dad Bradley Bleimeyer was found guilty of the same charges as his we in  and was sentenced to  years in prison.The case was brought to the attention of authorities in March , when the evil stepmother’s then -year-old son reported her.The unnamed teenager told authorities his mum and -year-old step dad were abusing the boy, and had put him in a diaper.He told police he believed someone had slammed the child’s head into a wall, and had even tasered him.Tammi was six months pregnant at the time of the report, and vanished from the family home taking Jordan with her when police arrived.Using mobile phone records, police traced her to a nearby motel where they found her with her severely underweight stepson.Jordan was also found to be covered in bumps and bruises and was rushed to a nearby hospital.According to a paediatrician, the five-year-old had suffered “severe physical abuse and habitual starvation” and was just days away from death.Court documents revealed the child was not allowed to eat at the family dinner table with his siblings, who were all the children of his stepmother.He was given just one slice of bread to eat daily – and that too would be snatched awayhe didn’t eat it fast enough.Prosecutors also revealed that the child would be drugged up by his dad in order to keep quiet when guests were at their home.Officials claims the child’s health had deteriorated rapidly following a visit from Child Protective Services, who had made numerous visits to the Bleimeyer home in .The stepmother was arrested and charged in February  and she was sentenced following a -day trial.Two of her biological sons took to the stand to testy against her.In a prepared statement, one of the boys addressed his mother saying: “You made a big mistake, and ultimately have to face the consequences.“Im up here to ask a rhetorical question of how, how could you put your children through all that “The people who should be your pride and joy.“You caused me feelings of sadness, anger, confusion, and emptiness.“I cant say that Ill ever be the same emotionally because of this.”Jordan, now aged nine, was reunited with his biological mother and made a good recovery from his ordeal.Child Protective Services took custody of Tammi’s six children, while her seventh – a newborn – was given to a foster family."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000455974730.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"girl christmas letter santa dad work shift change

indicating ministers could try and string out the decision for longer.Whenever it does come to a vote theres still a huge chance it could be voted down, which could force the Government to its knees.Jeremy Corbyn chickened out of a vote of no confidence earlier this week, saying hed only bring one forward when he was sure they could win.A spokesperson said the party would wait until she came back with changes to the deal, which they reckon wont be enough to win anyone over.But Labour faces pressure from the SNP, Lib Dems and other parties to strike as soon as possible.John McDonnell said last night the party would look at the situation next week.He told ITVs Peston: we’ll just have to judge what she comes back with on Sunday night, Monday morning, see what the statement is in the House of Commons on Monday and take a proper judgement then.Shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman said she thinks the party will make a move before Christmas.Mrs May yesterday promised colleagues she would stand down before the next election, which is set to take place in .That means she could end up staying for another three years -

and lavished praise on Sajid Javid.But Eurosceptics were worried that their vote could be splitMr Raab, Boris Johnson and David Davis all stood. Sources claim Mr Davis and his long-time apprentice Mr Raab are at loggerheads.Ladbrokes’ Jessica Bridge said: “Betting suggests it’s between Johnson and Raab to step up.”Sources also claimed Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd and Home Secretary Sajid Javid had both been privately sounding out supporters for days.Insiders said Ms Rudd had been ringing MPs and claiming that the Tory “women” have to stick together.And MPs were stunned to discover yesterday that Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom was canvassing support on Tuesday night – at the same time Theresa May was first told she was staring down the barrel of a leadership challenge.Insiders claim Amber Rudd could eventually partner Boris Johnson on a joint ticket despite their falling out in the  Referendum campaign.One source said: “Amber’s pretty advanced. She could decide to team up with Boris as they get along well. Or Michael [Gove] could swing in behind her.“But she’ll definitely run.”A source close to Ms Rudd last night said: “Amber fully backs the PM.”Others believed to be in the running include de-facto Deputy PM David Lidington, former Education Secretary Justine Greening and International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt — who famously appeared in ITV show Splash.Ex-Army officers Tom Tugendhat and Johnny Mercer, entrepreneur Rishi Sunak and arch-Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg cannot be ruled out either.Yesterday DUP leader Arlene Foster, whose MPs prop up Mrs May’s minority government, lavished praise on Mr Javid after a meeting on Tuesday — saying he “understands where we come from” on the controversial Irish backstop.She later appeared on stage with Mr Davis and Mr Raab as they presented their alternative Brexit plans.Ms Foster, whose endorsement could be vital in a leadership election, has also held recent talks with Mr Johnson.Her endorsement could play a decisive role in a Tory leadership election because her party’s  DUP MPs currently prop up Mrs May’s minority government.The backing of the Ulster unionist party would give a candidate a massive boost.Ms Foster gave a damning verdict on Mrs May’s leadership. Asked for her reaction to news of the no confidence vote she said: “I can’t say I’m surprised.”She revealed she met Mr Javid on Tuesday for talks on immigration and also discussed the backstop plan.The DUP leader told the Today programme: “I think that he understands where we come from in relation to the backstop.“I think there are many actually who in the Conservative who not only understand but actually support our position in relation to the backstop because they want to see a deal delivering Brexit that works for the entirety of the United Kingdom and that’s very important for me obviously as a unionsist and I think it’s very important for many members of the Conservative party.”She quipped last night that Boris Johnson was “curiously silent” during the PM’s last ditch appeal to the  Committee last night.Home Secretary Sajid Javid and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt were among those publicly praising the PM yesterday.But allies of both have been working furiously behind the scenes to lay the groundwork for leadership bids.One MP told The Sun yesterday: “So much gushing public support for the Prime Minister – from those who were just  hours ago asking us to support them in their leadership bid.“Saj is like a new boy at school – bless him.”The Eurosceptic ERG Tory group were yesterday planning a mini-hustings to pick a preferred candidate to replace Mrs May in the event of a leadership contest.They were concerned that the Brexit vote could “split”Boris Johnson stood alongside David Davis and Dominic Raab.Sources claim Mr Davis and his longtime apprentice Mr Raab are at loggerheads over who should run.One said: “Have a look at the spinning in the press over the weekend and these comments that Dom hasn’t been tested yet and that it’s time for an experienced hand. It’s all coming from DD’s camp.”PERSEVERANCE is an admirable quality.Try, try, try again! We all admire the boxer, flat out on the canvas, who nonetheless staggers to his feet to get another seven shades of **** knocked out of him before the mercy of the bell.But sometimes perseverance is stupid and pointless. And a grave mistake.You might hope that our Prime Minister has learned this now.At long last the spineless monkeys in the Conservative Party have told her to give it a rest. Go and have a lie down somewhere quiet, Theresa. Chill.She still wants to soldier on, banging her head against a brick wall, her brain cells diminishing every time. But she has to go. And surely she will go.Let’s be kind. Theresa May has been dealt a bad hand.Truth be told, there is no majority in the House of Commons for ANY Brexit solution. No majority for No Deal. No majority for her deal. No majority for a second referendum. That won’t change simply because the leader changes.But she hasn’t helped herself, either.She called an election last year which wasn’t needed and overnight lost her entire majority. That was dumb.And for two years she has been criminally inept at dealing with the thuggish bureaucrats of the European Union. She has been perpetually on the back foot. Too ready to agree to each and every concession demanded by these smug pygmies.An extortionate bill for leaving — yep OK, do you want a tip with that  Restrictions upon how we trade, how we regulate our economy, on what we do with our Irish border. Yep, OK, we agree.Perhaps she thought she was being NICE. Well, OK. But the people we’re dealing with aren’t nice.They’re spiteful and vengeful and want to see Britain suffer. Because they know the EU is coming apart at the seams. Just look at France today.But Theresa May has been out-manoeuvred at every single point. Perhaps worse, she has appointed decent Brexit Secretaries — David Davis and Dominic Raab — and then overruled everything they tried to do.Went behind their backs to push HER agenda. She was for Remain, remember.And as a result the Europeans are crowing with delight.I heard a Latvian MEP the other day instructing us what we must do to strike a deal. Laying down the law. A Latvian!We are not going to be told what to do by Latvians. Or people from Luxembourg. This is the United Kingdom. We are a sovereign nation and we will do as we please.We have the fth largest economy in the world. Latvia doesn’t make the top . So get real.And that’s how we should have conducted negotiations from Day One, two years ago.We should have said we would like to strike a nice deal with you. You are our friends and allies.But don’t worry, we’d also be perfectly happy with no deal. In which case you get no money whatsoever.Kick up a fuss about that and we’ll sue you for reparations from our expenditure in freeing you from tyranny in the Second World War.A fight which bankrupted us and for which we have never been repaid. And further... try to restrict our trade and we’ll sue you again. We don’t want to do all this, but we willwe have to.So cut the bluster, don’t get arsey and let’s seewe can come to some arrangement. Not the one Switzerland, or Norway, or Canada has. A United Kingdom agreement.One just for us. Comprenez  Verstehen  Capice  Understand It’s not yet too late to take that very approach over to Brussels.The Remainer MPs back here will try to undermine us at every step — which is one of the problems we’ve had all along.But a new leader with a supportive and united Cabinet might at least proceed with a bit of confidence and chutzpah.Who should it be  Sajid Javid is one of the favourites. But I haven’t got a clue what the bloke stands for, or what he believes in. He would be Maybot Mark II.The Conservative activists would probably like Boris Johnson or Jacob Rees-Mogg. But they couldn’t hold the party together — and the voters, north of Watford, are not terribly keen.Dominic Raab would not be a bad choice — he is a Brexiteer and it MUST be a Brexiteer.But a bit more experience wouldn’t go amiss. We need a clever little bastard who knows his stuff. So, you Tories — get behind David Davis. Cometh the hour, cometh the man.The bell chimed for Theresa May some time ago, in truth. We’re grateful for your efforts, Theresa... but late though it is, we need to change our leader for the fight, a deadly fight.Out with Chamberlain, then, and in with a pocket-sized Churchill.Mr Raab, , who holds a black belt in karate, resigned from the Cabinet last month, saying he could not support the PM’s deal. He argued it may be worse than remaining in the EU and insists we should be willing to pursue a No Deal.In his resignation letter he wrote: “I understand why you have chosen to pursue the deal with the EU on the terms proposed, and I respect the dferent views held in good faith by all of our colleagues.”Mr Raab, whose Czech-born Jewish father came to Britain in , has been the MP for Esher and Walton since he was elected in . He is married with two kids.PROS: Clear views on Brexit and great insight into the intricacies of the process.CONS: Only served four months in the Cabinet. Leadership rivals claim that he hasn’t been subjected to the full “media glare”.BORIS JOHNSON- ODDS  OLD Etonian Mr Johnson, a prominent Brexiteer, claims the Prime Minister’s deal will reduce Britain to “colony status”.The ex-Foreign Secretary, a key player in the Leave campaign, quit the Cabinet after the Chequers summit in July.Mr Johnson, , wants to withhold the £billion orce settlement until the EU negotiates a trade deal.At the weekend he refused to rule out challenging Theresa May for her premiership. Mr Johnson — tipped to succeed David Cameron until he dropped out the leadership race — said the British people should not “underestimate the deep sense of personal responsibility I feel for Brexit”.PROS: Charismatic and articulate with a huge public profile. Darling of powerful Tories.CONS: Critics within the party brand him lazy and say he lacks attention to detail.SAJID JAVID- ODDS  A EUROSCEPTIC who has urged Tory Remain rebels to drop demands for Britain to stay in the customs union with the EU.Mr Javid, the son of a Pakistani bus driver from Rochdale, has argued for looser post-Brexit restrictions on immigrants.He became the first Home Secretary from an ethnic minority background when he was appointed in April.The -year-old did not stand in the  leadership race but has since emerged as one of the favourites in ­Westminster to succeed Theresa May.One of five brothers, Mr Javid, who is married with four children, has said he will back Mrs May but could still throw his hat in the ringshe quits.He was managing director at Deutsche Bank before becoming an MP for Bromsgrove, Worcs, in .PROS: Experienced Cabinet minister with great back story.CONS: Eurosceptic Tories have not forgiven him for coming out for Remain in . Had a rocky spell as Business Secretary.JEREMY HUNT- ODDS  THE Foreign Secretary is a Brexiteer who has compared the EU to the former USSR.Sources say he was ready last month to urge the PM to pursue a Canada-style free trade deal. He backed Mrs May yesterday as “the best person to make sure we actually leave the EU on March ”. He is  and married with three children.PROS: Former Health Secretary has impressed in the Cabinet.CONS: Not seen as having the X Factor necessary to take on Labour.AMBER RUDD- ODDS  SHE makes no bones about having campaigned for Remain in  — but has backed the PM’s Brexit deal.The Work and Pensions secretary broke cover at weekend to float the possibility of deal options such as a Norway Plus or EEA membership. She offered the PM her “full support” yesterday.PROS: Formidable. Heavily backed by female Tories. Possible moderating influence on rival wings of party.CONS: Majority in Hastings slashed to  in the  snap General Election.DAVID DAVIS- ODDS  THE arch Eurosceptic unveiled his plans for a new Brexit deal just hours after the no-confidence vote was announced.Mr Davis, , who lost out to David Cameron in the  leadership race, wants a Canada-style free trade deal.He quit as Brexit Secretary in July, warning the PM’s proposals would leave the UK in “a weak negotiating position”.PROS: Experienced.

A phenomenon you’ll be well aware of,you watch television or engage with Twitter.The Last Leg’s Adam Hills, for instance, is a helluvaguy. So are presenters like Nish Kumar, James O’Brien and all those other blokes who cannot stop wanging on, very publicly, about their feminist credentials and just how much they love the NHS.While others might rely simply on empty words though, Nick Knowles preferred grand heroic gestures, right from day one in the jungle when he threw himself into the water to save four women who were in absolutely no danger of drowning.The idea that Nick Knowles was every woman’s Sir Galahad, was clearly never in doubt then. At least not in his own mind.The ever-so-slightly deluded David Brent-side to his character did not fully emerge, though, until the very last week when James McVey revealed Nick’s version of Make You Feel My Love had gone to number one in the iTunes chart.A stroke of genius for production to let the news slip, obviously, and for someone to send an acoustic guitar into camp, so that Nick could delight everyone with an unplugged rendition, which Emily Atack described as “a viral moment,” much like Ebola.Dec was clearly having the time of his le poking fun at Knowles as well, describing him as: “So good at DIY he’s even gravelled his voice.”I need nearly hardly tell you what happened next then.The public got rid of Nick Knowles, just as they get rid of any jungle contestant who’s ever shown the slightest inclination to act like an entertaining jerk.This is a problem that dates right back to series one, of course, when livewires Uri Geller, Darren Day, Rhona Cameron and Nigel Benn were all voted out before silent Nell McAndrew, and it continues to prevent a genuinely great line-up from turning into a genuinely great series, eventhis one did end with exactly the right winner in Harry Redknapp.I don’t see any way round the problem, either. The voting public just seems to prefer self-absorbed young bores, on “a journey,” to genuine characters.If any of us thought Nick Knowles was finished, the moment Dec read out his name, though, we reckoned without an eviction interview which will surely take its place in I’m A Celeb . . .  folklore.For it turns out Nick Knowles wasn’t in the jungle for purely personal or financial gain.It was to heal a ided nation.“We’re having such a hard time in the UK,” he told Dec, alluding to Brexit, “I thought,we can get on, it might be a bit of a pointer to the nation.”Gee, thanks Nick. I had been wondering why a cane toad was sat on your head, during the Wicked Warehouse task, but it’s beginning to make sense now. He wasn’t finished either.“I’d like to say one last thing.” Go on . ..“Please support veterans, support the police, support the NHS, support the emergency services.They have it a lot harder, on a day to day basis, than we have it in here.”A hell-of-a-claim to make when you’ve reportedly just been paid £, to sit around a television set, in Australia, with John Barrowman, but then Nick Knowles is clearly a helluvaguy.SO there was Gemma Collins behaving like a monstrous old boot as usual, last week, when fellow BBC diner Adrian Chiles silenced her with a simple question.“Is there anything you can’t stop eating ”At which point you could see Gemma disengaging from the conversation as she ran through the checklist: “Cakes, buns, crisps, Pringles, biscuits, pies, potatoes, cows, pigs, horses, breeze blocks, deep-fried landfill, light aircraft . . . ”The silence couldn’t last forever, obviously, but it was a nice  seconds on BBC’s I’ll Get This, a celeb dinner party show, that I hadn’t really seen the point of up until the arrival of Chiles, who has a streak of honesty that’s very rare among presenters.Even by Adrian’s own standards, though, his response to the question “Why would you make the best chat show host ” was brutally self-aware.“For a huge amount of money, a big hullabaloo, billboards everywhere, I went to ITV and did another chat show, Daybreak, at which I was s**t.“I failed abysmally, humiliatingly. I looked miserable, I was sullen, I sat there like a bag of potatoes, I dragged everyone down with me, from the moment I walked in the door at am.“SoI ever get the chance to host another chat show, let’s be honest, unlikely, I will be the best chat show host ever, ’cos I know what it’s like to succeed and I know what it’s like to fail, dismally.”A confession that I expected to be met with stunned silence but it was actually greeted by spontaneous applause, from fellow celebs, and a faint whirring noise from Gemma Collins’ brain: “Doritos, kebabs, dips, mini eclairs, maxi eclairs, Jenny Eclairs . . . ”I PARTED company with Celebrity Antiques Road Trip the moment the commentator announced: “Russell Kane’s heading for an auction at Penkridge.”Anyone know how much he fetched UK’S Strongest Man. Best dead-weight lt was, of course, won by Declan Donnelly . . .  who carried about  kilos for three weeks.FRANCE is burning, Paris is in lockdown and its government’s on the brink.So how many mentions do you think TV’s fearlessly impartial satirical news shows, Have I Got News For You, The Mash Report and The Last Leg, gave it, on Friday Correct. None. Because these inconvenient facts don’t fit the narrative and agenda of the BBC and Channel , which believe Britain is a basket case and Europe is our only salvation.So it was simply ignored and all three proceeded with the same lazy and witless anti-Brexit and Trump routines they go with every week.There were some slight iations with the other material, obviously.The Last Leg and HIGNFY, ably hosted by Danny Dyer, both invited lists to be outraged by alleged sexism at the Ballon D’Or awards, held in Paris, ironically.While the final Mash Report of the series offered Rachel Parris lecturing viewers about poverty, as only a privately-educated, Oxbridge graduate truly can, before smug-bucket in chief Nish Kumar closed the show by saying: “We’ll be back next year,the will of the people demands it.”Which is almost the very last thing the will of the people will ever demand.The Mash Report will be back, though. The political agenda of the BBC demands it.Who said the following last week: “Oh my God, there’s a cockroach having dinner on my butthole.”A John Barrowman doing the Rotten Retrieval trial on I’m a Celebrity B Tyson Fury during his Good Morning Britain interview with Piers Morgan Sent in by Connor David.

The Prime Minister will jet off to an emergency Brexit summit in Brussels on Thursday to pick up the threads of her beleaguered deal. Her frantic tour of EU leaders earlier this week ended in humiliation after they rejected her calls for more Brexit concessions. She told the Commons that her none of her European counterparts were in “any doubt” about the strength of their fears over the Irish backstop. But she faces an uphill struggle to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.  Having survived her confidence vote, the PM gets back on the plane to Brussels on Thursday morning where anxious EU leaders are gathering for their monthly summit. Mrs May will get a chance to update the her counterparts who can then ask her questions. They will then go into private session, without Mrs May, to discuss Brexit before European Council president Donald Tusk and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker hold a press conference around pm [UK time]. With the clock ticking, Brussels is also expected to step up its own no deal preparations.  The PM is desparately seeking help from the EU to win over mutinuous Tory MPs in support of her deal. More than  have spoken out publicly against it, in addition to the Democratic Unionist Party which props up the fragile Tory government. And  voted against her leadership - more than a third of her parliamentary party. Her only realistic chance of getting her withdrawal agreement through parliament is to persuade sceptical Tory and DUP Brexiteers the UK will not be trapped in the Irish border backstop indefinitely. Brexiteer ministers have insisted that any change has to be legally binding.  Downing Street has several ideas under discussion. One is to ask Brussels for a letter of intent on the political declaration, which Tory sources have suggested could include the EU defining “temporary” as lasting for as little as three years. Mrs May’s officials are also hoping to agree a clearer route out of the backstop through a legal “codicil” to the withdrawal agreement. Mrs May wants to offer MPs - and possibly the European Parliament - an annual vote on whether to remain in the backstopit is ever triggered.  Unlikely. Tusk says he is keen to help “facilitate UK ratication” and providing warm words shouldn’t be a problem for the EU. But she will come up against a brick wallshe proposes any legal alterations to the substance of the withdrawal agreement. Juncker told her this week there was “no room whatsoever” to renegotiate the backstop, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there was “no way” to change the deal. Brussels will not accept anything which prevents the backstop to avoid a hard border from coming into effect.  Probably not. They have already dismissed the idea of a letter from the EU as a “figleaf” and have demanded legally binding assurances, which the EU has refused to give. In the unlikely event Mrs May persuades Brussels to agree to give the UK a unilateral exit from the backstop - backbenchers would only support itattorney general Geoffrey Cox made a statement guaranteeing it was legally binding. Eventhe PM resorts to threatening no deal to get what she wants, Tory Brexiteers think that EU diplomats wouldn’t believe she would follow through. When will the meaningful take place   Downing Street has confirmed that the postponed vote on Mrs May’s Brexit deal will take place before January st, even though technically she has until the eve of Brexit on March th. But No  said Mrs May would “keep the spirit” of the EU withdrawal act and make statement on how she intended to proceed in the event of Brexit talks breaking down. Although the vote could still take place before Christmas, Tory insiders have indicated early January is more likely as they hope the holiday will take the heat out of the rebellion What other options are on the table   In a word: everything. Jeremy Corbyn has said it was a matter of “when, not ” Labour tables a no confidence motion against the government in the House of Commons. Much depends on the DUP, with rumours swirling they might vote against the government at first and back it in the second vote  days later, on the condition Theresa May steps down and a new Tory leader is ushered in. But it is improbable that a Brexiteer Tory leader would get the Commons behind them. If Labour then failed to form a government, a general election would follow  days later under the Fixed Term Parliament Act. What about a second referendum   Mrs May has ruled out going back to the people, saying it is too isive. Downing Street doesn’t want a referendum, nor is it planning for one. But senior Number  sources believe this is where the country could end up. It is also Labour’s second choice option, and senior figures have insisted that it could only ever be an absolute last resort. But the longer that parliament remains deadlocked on Brexit, the more likely it is to happen.

Conservatives voted by  to  for the Prime Minister to stay on as PM. But Brexiteers argue that the so-called Payroll vote means the vast majority of her backbenchers voted against her. The payroll vote is the number of MPs who are also ministers, or ministerial aides. Furious backbench Brexiteer Peter Bone has called for Theresa May to quit. He said: She said in  she would lead the Conservative Partyshe had the support of the parliamentary party. Clearly when youve got more than a third voting against you dont. Soshe honours her word she will decide in the interests of the party and the nation she will go.  He added: The payroll vote is more than . So its clear the overwhelming backbenchers voting against. How can she govern when she doesnt have a third of the party supporting her  Mr Rees-Mogg, a leading critic of Mrs May, said: “Its a terrible result for the Prime Minister, it really is.” He added: “Of course I accept this result. “But the Prime Minister must realise that under all constitutional norms, she ought to go and see the Queen urgently and resign.” A European Research Group source said: The parliamentary arithmetic remains unchanged. We cannot and will not support the disastrous Withdrawal Agreement the Prime Minister has negotiated. We urge her to bring it back to parliament without delay so that the view of the House of Commons can clearly be demonstrated, and we can move on to a viable policy instead. If Theresa May pushes ahead with her deal, which our Confidence and Supply partner quite rightly cannot support, we are set to have a general election she has said she will not lead us into, and which no one can realistically think she would win.  Jeremy Corbyn said: Tonight’s vote makes no dference to the lives of our people. “The Prime Minister has lost her majority in Parliament, her government is in chaos and she is unable to deliver a Brexit deal that works for the country and puts jobs and the economy first. “That’s why she pulled the vote on her botched Brexit deal this week and is trying to avoid bringing it back to Parliament. It’s clear that she has not been able to negotiate the necessary changes in Europe. “She must now bring her dismal deal back to the House of Commons next week so Parliament can take back control. “Labour is ready to govern for the whole country and deliver a deal that protects living standards and workers’ rights.”  Chancellor Philip Hammond tweeted: “Tonights vote of confidence in the Prime Minister @theresa_may, is the right one. Now is the time to focus on the future. Her deal means we will honour the referendum result while safeguarding jobs and maintaining business confidence.” Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss said: “Convincing result for Prime Minister in ballot tonight. Vital we now get on with delivering Brexit.” Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: “Huge congrats to @theresa_may whose stamina, resilience and decency has again won the day and given her the chance to deliver Brexit for our country.” "},{"url":null,"title":"national enquirer admits paying hush","story":"NewsNational Enquirer admits paying hush money to Playboy model over Trump affairAmerican Media Inc , owner of the National Enquirer, paid Karen McDougal , to stop her going public with her story ahead of the  US electionShare, owner of the National Enquirer, paid Karen McDougal , to stop her going public with her story ahead of the  US election\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s Donald-Trump-with-former-Playboy-model-Karen-McDougal.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\", owner of the National Enquirer, paid Karen McDougal , to stop her going public with her story ahead of the  US election\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s Donald-Trump-with-former-Playboy-model-Karen-McDougal.jpg\" data-tracking\"messenger|share|\", owner of the National Enquirer, paid Karen McDougal , to stop her going public with her story ahead of the  US election\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s Donald-Trump-with-former-Playboy-model-Karen-McDougal.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\", owner of the National Enquirer, paid Karen McDougal , to stop her going public with her story ahead of the  US election\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s Donald-Trump-with-former-Playboy-model-Karen-McDougal.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\", owner of the National Enquirer, paid Karen McDougal , to stop her going public with her story ahead of the  US election\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s Donald-Trump-with-former-Playboy-model-Karen-McDougal.jpg\" data-tracking\"linkedin|share|\", owner of the National Enquirer, paid Karen McDougal , to stop her going public with her story ahead of the  US election\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s Donald-Trump-with-former-Playboy-model-Karen-McDougal.jpg\" data-tracking\"flipboard|share|\", owner of the National Enquirer, paid Karen McDougal , to stop her going public with her story ahead of the  US election\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s Donald-Trump-with-former-Playboy-model-Karen-McDougal.jpg\" data-tracking\"email|share|\"CommentsByNatalie EvansUS Editor Christopher Bucktin:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news us-news video trump-defends-hush-money-cohen-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe publisher of the National Enquirer yesterday admitted it paid hush money to a former Playboy model over her alleged affair with Donald Trump. American Media Inc.was revealed to have struck a deal with the Trump campaign to suppress negative stories before the  US presidential election. The company had repeatedly denied they had ever done deals with the President’s team before yesterday. AMI admitted to paying ,to Playboy magazine model Karen McDougal in concert with Trumps campaign.   The hush money payment was made in order to ensure that the woman did not publicise damaging allegations about the candidate before the  presidential election.” AMI, which is run by Trump’s former close friend, David Pecker, has been granted immunity along with its staff infor cooperation with prosecutors.   AMI said Chief Executive Pecker met with Trumps former personal lawyer Michael Cohen and at least one other member of the campaign in August . The company offered to help with negative stories about Trumps relationships with women by buying the rights to those stories, according to a document made public by prosecutors.  AMIs admission may support statements made by Cohen, who was yesterday sentenced to three years in prison for his role in the payments, that they were made to influence the election in violation of campaign finance law, legal experts said. Federal law requires that the contribution of anything of value to a campaign must be disclosed, and an inidual donation cannot exceed ,.   Trump and his lawyers have argued the payments were a personal matter unrelated to the election. The charges on which Cohen was sentenced include campaign finance law violations relating to his negotiation of payments to McDougal and another woman, adult film star Stormy Daniels. Cohen has said both payments were directed by Trump. A spokesman for AMI declined to comment.

But considering Brexit could dispatch Theresa May anyway, its actually quite brave. Believing youll make it to  is cracking chutzpah when your MPs, your non-majority and your Brexit are all off the rails. Her speech tonight had to save her career. So of course, in the most Theresa May turn of events possible, Theresa May U-turned and said shed end it. The steely-faced PM strode into Commons Committee Room  and told her MPs she doesnt intend to stand in a  election. In a classic display of Theresa Mayity, she was calm, in a state which had a total disregard for the reality of the scrum around her. Scores of journalists, Tory aides and Labour staffershuddled for a glimpse of the first Tory no-confidence vote this decade. The air was hot and close. MPs stood shoulder to chest, disgruntled, shuffling aside when yet another one tried to squeeze in. Imagine the London Underground, but with everyone a bit more exhausted, the air a bit staler, and a less inspiring voice on the tannoy. Basically the Tube  years ago, given all the oak on the walls.  The Prime Minister gave a two-pronged pitch to save her job. But, in a very Theresa May turn of events, both prongs look set to fall apart at a puff of wind. First, shed not lead the party into a  election. Tory MP Alec Shelbrooke said: She said in her heart she would like to have led this party into the next general election. But she realises it would be better served with somebody  in the  election. She understands we will want something dferent for the next election, said Chief Treasury Secretary Liz Truss, who would never dream of that something dferent being herself. But Jacob Rees Mogg, the Brexiteer, put things a little dferently. He said: It was not her intention. Intention is one of those politicians dangerous words that one should never rely on.  Second, shed seek yet another incomprehensible and probably insufficient solution to her Brexit deal. The solution for Brexit itself was a legal binding change to the Northern Ireland backstop - which extends EU customs rules across the UK - to keep it temporary. It would be legally binding that its temporary, confirmed Ms Truss. No word yet on how this will go down in the EU. Or with Remainers. Or Brexiteers. But I expect we can guess.  Dfering reports emerged of what all that heat and standing and drama did to people. One MP swept past breathlessly, declaring: Some of her ministers were crying in there. It was bad. But others gave a picture that sounded a bit more Theresa May. Askedthere were tears in the room, a former Cabinet minister said: I didnt see that. Another MP got askedTheresa May was emotional.He replied she was businesslike. Right.  The Prime Minister did manage to raise one smile, though - when she came back later to vote on her own leadership. A journalist asked which box shed decided to tick on the ballot paper. She chuckled but, in a final self-surpassing display of Theresa Mayness, didnt answer. Its a secret ballot. No one will ever know. Shes ending her career anyway. And most importantly, shes got form for saying one thing about an election - then doing the opposite. Maybe, just maybe, she out-Theresa Mayed herself - and ticked permanent walking holiday on that little form.

May herself must be aware of the irony herself when shes forced to let Parliament vote on her poor deal shell insist on a second vote by MPs on the planshe loses narrowly. The PMs cowardice in pulling Tuesdays vote then touring Europe to have doors slammed in her face triggered todays confidence vote within the Conservative Party. Jeremy Corbyn rightly condemned her contemptuousness of Parliament on top of the unenviable record of leading the first Government to be found in contempt of the place.

Even when she did finally become pregnant, she was diagnosed with pre-eclampsia and her baby James was born dangerously early.But, against all the odds, Wendy is celebrating Christmas with the healthy miracle baby she had always hoped for.Wendy, now , says: “James really was the best Christmas present we could have asked for. For so long, I truly believed I would never become a mum – so to hold James in my arms was the most incredible feeling. He really is the proof that miracles do happen. “And this year, we will be spending our first Christmas at home as a family – something that I only dared dream about.”  Wendy and her husband, Andrew, , started trying for a baby after their wedding in , a year after they met through on online dating agency. The happy couple couldn’t wait to start a family, but Wendy, from from Rothley, Leicestershire, was diagnosed with polycystic oies a year after their wedding and was told it would be very dficult to fall pregnant naturally. They considered adoption, but decided they wanted to find a way of having a baby of their own. But their hopes were dashed once again when Wendy was told the NHS only funds IVF treatment for women aged  and under. Wendy and Andrew, an accountant, were quickly running out of options. “I thought all my chances of becoming a mum had ended,” says Wendy. “I almost resigned myself that it was over.”  But, after doing some research, the couple found CARE fertility in Nottingham, and arranged to see a consultant. Wendy was told she would be eligible for treatment until she was  using donor eggs and the couple were given their first glimmer of hope in years. “We were told there was a % of the first attempt being successful, which we were very optimistic about,” says Wendy “I just thoughtit’s meant to be, it will happen.” And it did. On Father’s Day last year, Wendy discovered she was having a baby.  “I just cried and cried in disbelief and amazement as Andrew and I hugged one another,” she remembers. Although the pregnancy went well initially, the -week scan revealed the couple’s unborn baby wasn’t growing at the rate doctors would have hoped for. After being regularly monitored, just four weeks later Wendy was diagnosed with pre-eclampsia and told their baby may not be receiving sufficient fluids. Just  weeks into the pregnancy, Wendy was rushed to theatre for an emergency caesarean section. Baby James was born weighing a tiny lb oz and needed urgent medical attention, meaning Wendy couldn’t even hold her newborn son. “I was so worried after everything we had all been through that James wouldn’t make it,” she says. James was rushed to the neo-natal department where he was placed on a ventilator. Then, when James was one-day-old, Wendy got to hold her precious son for the first time. “I felt like the happiest mum alive,” she says.  The family tried to make Christmas Day in the hospital as special as possible. Then, when James was eight weeks old – a fortnight before his actual due date – Wendy and Andrew were finally able to take him home. This year, James, who is now lbs and still only on age six month clothes, will spend his first Christmas Day at home surrounded by family. Wendy said: “He will be spoilt rotten. I can’t wait to see him tear open all his presents and watch the look of sheer delight on his face. “It may have taken for me to reach  for me to spend my first Christmas at home as a mum but it will be worth every second of the wait.” "},{"url":null,"title":"butcher handing out free christmas","story":"NewsButchers free Christmas hampers for struggling Universal Credit claimantsDavid Jones, , is giving away free baskets of festive meat worth £ including a turkey for Christmas Day and pigs-in-blanketsShareCommentsByNiamh Cavanagh:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsDavid Jones Butchers\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA butcher is handing out free Christmas hampers to people who have been left with nothing over the Christmas period due to delayed Universal Credit payments David Jones, , is giving away free baskets of festive meat worth pound to claimants whose money will not be available until the New Year. The donated hampers include a turkey for Christmas Day and pigs-in-blankets. Mr Jones, owner of D Jones Quality Butcher in Dewsbury, West Yorks, said he wanted to help vulnerable people. The butcher noticed the strain the delayed payments was having on a number of locals in his area a few months ago. He said he had spoken to families left with no money or just a pittance for weeks on end.   At the time he gave away pound, worth of meat to claimants who were struggling. But now he is so keen to help the needy that he is handing out hampers to skint families over the festive season. Mr Jones, who also organises collections for local food banks, said: They just dont know where their next meal is coming from. I think Universal Credit is a barbaric, cruel benefit that is deliberately imposing great hardship on people who are the most vulnerable in our society. Going without money over Christmas doesnt bear thinking about.   Controversially, there is a standard five week wait for payments for the benefit, which sees payments rolled into one. Many have said they will be left with little or no money over the Christmas period. The Department for Work and Pensions says Universal Credit is replacing a complex, out-of-date benefit system, moving people into work faster and helping them out of poverty. A spokesman added: We have listened to concerns as the benefit rolls out and recently announced a pound.bn cash boost. We have also recently agreed a partnership with Citizens Advice to help vulnerable people make and manage their benefit claims. The butchers Christmas initiative is not for just anyone, says Mr Jones, stipulating that claimants must be at risk of having no payment before Christmas and must live in the local area.

Odette Baxter-Booth and her daughter Maisy Bennett, , drove from their home in Cornwall to Heathrow Airport where they were due fly to South Africa. After leaving on Tuesday, the pair were looking forward to spending the holidays with Odette’s fianceacute Jason Dreyer and his family. But Cornwall Live reports that their dream festive holiday turned into a nightmare when Maisy was told she couldn’t board her flight without a signed letter from her father giving his permission. Odette, who is a hotel business development manager, said: “We couldn’t believe it – Maisy was crying her eyes out in the airport. She was nervous enough as we booked her holiday later than mine so we were taking separate flights to Paris two hours apart.   We checked her bags in and she started going through security when she called out, ‘Mum! Come here!’ We were then told she needed an affidavit signed by her dad which stated he was okay with her travelling as she’s under .” The trouble was Maisy’s dad and Odette’s former partner Steve Bennett was in Truro. He agreed to sign the relevant form and get it witnessed by a solicitor and emailed to Air France, with whom mum and daughter were flying to South Africa. However, Odette phoned the South African Embassy which said email copies weren’t acceptable – it had to be the original, signed form. After discussing whether to delay the holiday,to Cornwall to pick up the affidavit and pay for replacement flights, Odette decided that the logistics – and expense – were too much and so they had to cancel their Christmas holiday in the sun.   It was doubly heart-breaking for Odette as she was due to book her wedding venue with Jason while in his home country. South Africa’s Department of Home Affairs relaxed some of its international travel requirements for children going through South African points of entry this month. However, the need for a signed consent affidavit from an absent parent is still necessary. South African regulations have stated since  all children under the age of  – both local and foreigners – are required to travel with a valid passport and an unabridgedbirth certicate stating both parents’ names. If the child is travelling alone or with only one parent, then the child must also carry an affidavit filled out by the missing parent s.  Odette, who was speaking to Cornwall Live from a “hideous hotel” in Hounslow, said: “I’m a seasoned traveller and Jason is from South Africa but we had no idea about this – you’d think someone would have mentioned it when we booked Maisy’s flights. “Maisy last travelled to South Africa three and a half years ago but they changed the regulations just after that and we had no idea.” Jason, who was driving to Port Elizabeth Airport to collect Odette and Maisy, was also devastated. “He was really upset and said he’d pay for new flights as it wasn’t about the money, but we’d already paid well over pound, and the logistics of organising it again were really dficult, as it involved three flights and  hours of travel. “I have to say that the airline staff were brilliant – they did everything they could and were consoling Maisy.” Odette and Maisy, who is in her final year at Truro College, are now travelling to Manchester to stay with Odette’s brother where they will book a last minute Christmas break in the sun. She added: “I wasn’t expecting it to be just Maisie and me celebrating Christmas together. I couldn’t face driving back to Cornwall – as much as I love Cornwall and it’s beautul – as we’d set our hearts on a holiday in the sun.” What about Jason – who lives in Falmouth but is originally from South Africa’s Eastern Cape – who will now be spending Christmas without his fianceacutee  “We’ll just have to Facetime each other a lot over the next two weeks,” said Odette.

The homes were built without planning permission and a planning inspector has just upheld a council enforcement order to have them removed. One frantic resident on the Lakeview Park site on the London-Essex border is Ann Hughes, who paid pound, for the home she shares with husband Roger, who has dementia.   “Where are we going to go ” she asked. “What’s going to happen ” The site is in the greenbelt and run by Wyldecrest Homes, part of Alfie Best’s company Best HoldingsLimited. He insists that all the homes at Lakeview have planning permission and has claimed that local Havering council’s motivation is “because I’m gipsy”. The council’s response is that a new road and homes have been built outside the permitted development area.   Leader of Havering Council, Conservative Damian White, said Wyldecrest “flagrantly flouted planning laws by extending their current site onto greenbelt land, then selling mobile homes without planning permission or without thought to the welfare of residents investing their hard earned money. He went on: “We can’t sit back and let rogue businesses encroach on our greenbelt. “The Council will always do everything in its power to protect Havering’s environment so the borough stays a special place for everyone to enjoy.” He said the council would offer housing advice to the affected residents, but urged Wyldecrest to “do the right thing” by helping its residents.   Keith Darvill, Leader of Haverings Labour Group, called the planning inspector’s ruling in the council’s favour “entirely predictable”. “Wyldecrest has been irresponsible and has misrepresented the position to those residents who purchased park homes which were placed on land that did not have planning permission,” he said. “Those residents have been living for more than a year now in deplorable conditions and now face being forced off the land despite being assured by Wyldecrest that they could purchase these homes without the need to get legal advice. “Wyldecrest must now assure residents that they will not suffer financial loss, and provide compensation for the inconvenience they have endured.” He described some of the affected residents as vulnerable and needing support from Wyldecrest to relocate, adding: “Failure to take responsibility for this terrible situation will be a corporate disgrace.” "},{"url":null,"title":"madeleine mccanns mum lives hope","story":"NewsMadeleine McCanns mum lives in hope well find her as they face th Christmas apartKate McCann, who is preparing for her th Christmas without her daughter, made a heartfelt speech during a carol service for Missing PeopleShareCommentsByLaura Forsyth:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsMadeleine McCann was just three years old when she vanished \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMadeleine McCanns mum has urged parents of missing children to never give up - and still lives with the hope that she will find her daughter.

The holiday will be the last time that the couple will have before they become parents but they will be spending the first few hours in separate quarters. Royals will wake up at Sandringham Estate, the private home of Queen Elizabeth II in Norfolk on Christmas Day. But royal sources claim that the women will stay in their bedrooms for the first meal of the day, away from the men. The Queens former chef Darren McGrady told the Mail on Sunday that on Christmas Day, the ladies usually enjoy a light breakfast delivered to their rooms. This usually consists of sliced fruit, half a grapefruit, toast and coffee.  Meanwhile the men sit downstairs at .am for a separate more hearty breakfast of eggs, bacon and mushrooms, kippers and grilled kidneys. Although the ladies usually enjoy a relaxing start to Christmas Day, the male royals in contrast attend a am church service at St Mary Magdalene. Former royal butler turned etiquette expert Grant Harrold - who worked at Highgrove for Prince Charles and Camilla for seven years - added that this happens in a lot of aristocratic homes.  He told Fabulous Online : The reason it happens is because its an old tradition that when a couple are married, the gentleman would come down for breakfast and the ladies would remain upstairs. He added that this is only the case for married aristocratic women and said: All the ladies would have breakfast in bed apart from the single ladies. The single ladies have to be seen as sociable whereas the ladies who were married didnt have to come down and socialise.

The Met Office has said however that there could be as much as  inches of snow in some places, adding that it will remain on higher ground. Snow has been forecast for much of the country as temperatures are expected to e. Strong winds will make it feel as cold as C as arctic low pressure moves across the country. Earlier in the week it was forecast that snow could reach as far south as Devon and Cornwall, but the latest forecast shows it is unlikely to go that far. There is a chance of snow on the highest hills of Scotland and northern England, according to the Met Office, with wintry showers possible further south into Wales and the Midlands.  A Met Office spokesman told Devon Live: There is arctic low pressure moving across the country and it will be bringing snow to the high grounds. There could be as much as cmor more in places such as the Caingorms in Scotland this weekend, but it is unlikely to reach the South West. The snow will remain over high ground. The winter is three months long and we are only at the start of it, so at this point we cannot saywe will be getting snow this winter.  Meteorologist Aidan McGivern warned of mph wind gusts around coasts and hills, telling people in those areas to watch out. He told the Express: “Because of the clearest skies and the lightest breeze will be in the east. “Here, temperatures will drop to - or - degrees before coming up a little bit by dawn. “So a chilly start for eastern parts of England, eastern Scotland, some sheltered spots of central Britain but plenty of sunshine in the colder spots and that sunshine becomes more widespread through the day.”  Tonight it will stay cloudy and windy across Northern Ireland and the south-west corner of Britain, with occasional rain. The Met Office is expecting a few showers in the east and northeast. Clear spells and a frost are forecast where.  Thursday will be a cold one for much of the country, with rain and strong winds easing across Northern Ireland, and west Devon and Cornwall in England. Some showers are expected near North Sea coasts. Friday will be cold with an early frost and showers in the north-east before wet and windy weather moves east on Saturday, with snow in the north and east. Sunday is expected to be brighter, showery and less cold, the Met Office said. Meanwhile, there are warnings that Britain could face a brutal polar blast this winter, with similar conditions that the country saw in February when it was hit by Arctic air from Siberia and heavy snow that caused travel chaos.

Borris, a chubby Cavalier King Charles spaniel, tipped the scales at a whopping st lb, before losing % of his body weight to become a svelte st lb. He shared top slot in the PDSA Pet Fit Club competition with lardy Labrador Sadie, who had ballooned to st lb but has now slimmed down to st lb. Every year vet charity PDSA helps the UKs fattest pets battle the bulge in a six-month diet and exercise challenge, specially tailored and overseen by its vets and nurses, with pets who lose the most percentage body weight declared winners. Borriss owner Annmarie Formoy, , from Deal, Kent, admitted the family fed him too many treats in the past, but said his lovable nature meant even complete strangers would give him titbits.  His love of food also led to several mishaps - including once raiding a cupboard full of chocolate Easter eggs, and chewing up Annmaries fathers  teeth. Im delighted, completely over the moon, said Mrs Formoy, whose pets weight loss was supervised by Louisa Carey, head nurse at Margate PDSA Pet Clinic. Borriss weight loss has been amazing, she added.  In the past his belly used to be touching the ground and he would refuse to walk. Now he loves his walks - even when its raining, which he used to hate. The best part was the first time that I saw Borris taking his first few running steps, it made me want to cry, I was so happy. He hadnt run in years! It has also helped show me just how bad his le must have been before with carrying around all that extra weight. A side effect of the weight loss has been the change in dynamic with the Formoys other pet, cat Charlie. Mrs Formoy added: Before, she used to creep up and hit Borris with a paw and he was too fat to fight back. Now she thinks twice about it as he will chase her up the stairs.  Sadies owner, George Chaplin, , from Grays, Essex, said his Labs unrelenting appetite and lots of leftovers led to her sumo size before her diet and exercise regime was overseen by PDSA vet nurse Kerry Grfith from the PDSA Pet Hospital in Basildon. Mr Chaplin added: PDSA has given us the help we desperately needed to kick start the change, theres no way I could have done this myself. Shes a totally dferent dog now and is so much happier. Before I would have to pull on her lead to get her on a walk but now she waits for me by the door, and shes got so much more energy. She loves playing with a ball and toys too, which she wasnt interested in before. We go on two walks a day with a group of dog walkers. At the beginning of her diet she would waddle at the back of the group but now she bounds ahead and thats great to see.  PDSA vet Olivia Anderson-Nathan, who helped to judge the competition, said: It has been hugely rewarding to see our Pet Fit Club pets weight decrease over the last six months thanks to their new diet and fitness regimes. Their success is testament to the hard work of their owners and our PDSA veterinary teams across the UK. Pet obesity is a growing issue that affects millions of UK pets. Around % of dogs and cats in the UK are estimated to be overweight or obese. Borris and Sadies owners have won a pet-friendly holiday courtesy of Sykes Cottages and a years free pet food from Dechra Specic. Two fat cats came joint third. Chester, from East Lothian, and Pepsi Cola, from Blackpool, each lost % of their body weight.  Chester, from East Lothian, was more than % above his ideal weight at .kgbefore slimming to .kgover six months. The cat was used to eating treats and leftovers from his fellow house cat and was so big his owners thought there was an underlying medical problem. When tests showed too much food and a lack of exercise were the problem, Chester was enrolled in the PDSA Pet Fit Club.  Owner Lisa Gilmour said: Its made such a big dference to Chester - hes a completely dferent cat. Before, he would sleep all the time and do his best to avoid us. But now he joins in and shows much more interest - he greets us at the door and comes to us for cuddles. He is much happier and no longer looks miserable. He runs rather than plods - its done him the world of good.  Another Scottish cat - Elvis, from Clydebank - was also praised by PDS for losing % of his body weight. At the start of the competition, the Burmese cat, named after Elvis Presley, weighed-in at .kgbut slimmed down to .kg . His owner Carole Sweeney said: I honestly believe thatwe hadnt take part in this competition and got his weight right down, that we wouldnt have him now. He was dangerously overweight. We will never allow him to get like that again - thats it now and were going to keep going until hes down to his ideal weight.

Britons will need to bundle up as the polar blast brings chilly conditions, including strong winds and heavy snow over higher ground in northern England and Scotland. The Met Office could issue severe weather warnings due to predicted rain and snowfall. Thursday is set to be cold and breezy with some rain and snow showers before temperatures fall sharply overnight. From then on it will be a frigid few days with wet and windy conditions making things even worse through the weekend - and some forecasts are predicting further gloom for the rest of the month as El Nino brings a polar vortex.  The Met Office said Thursday will be dry in many places, but cold in the breeze. Britons woke up to windchills that made it feel like -C in Birmingham, -C in London and Manchester, zero in Cardf and Glasgow, and C in Belfast. Isolated showers are expected in eastern coastal areas and some northern parts to begin the day, where they will be wintry on hills. There will be occasional rain in Northern Ireland, Cornwall and western Wales. Rain will continue to fall near eastern coasts at night as temperatures plunge to almost -C in parts of northern Scotland and to about zero degrees in southern England.  Friday morning will see a hard frost and isolated freezing fog. It will stay cold throughout the day, with temperatures hovering around -C in northern areas and C in the south. Saturday will stay cold as wet and windy weather moves east, with snow in some parts of the north and east. Met Office meteorologist Becky Mitchell said on Saturday “snow will be over the hills across Scotland and northern England. She told the Express: “There is potential to see some snow at lower levels and wet weather warnings could be issued.” Sunday will be brighter, showery and less cold, the Met Office said.  In the long-term forecast, bookies are expecting a white Christmas in Britain. Some forecasts even claim that a powerful polar vortex will bring  days of snow, blizzards and -C temperatures through the festive season - meaning it could be one of the coldest Christmases in decades, the Express claims. But the Met Offices current long-term outlook - for Monday  December to Wednesday  December - doesnt have the same doom and gloom. It is predicting unsettled weather, with further spells of wind and rain, and temperatures that will likely be a little milder than average. Met Office five-day forecast Thursday Dry for many with sunny spells, but cold in the breeze. Isolated showers will affect eastern coastal areas, and some northern parts at first, these wintry on hills. Northern Ireland, Cornwall and western Wales will be cloudier with occasional rain. Thursday night Isolated showers continue near eastern coasts, where itll be dry with clearing skies and easing winds. Temperatures will fall sharply with a hard frost and isolated freezing fog by morning. Friday After a frosty start itll be dry for most with sunny spells. Isolated showers may continue near eastern coasts and rain spreads into Northern Ireland in the afternoon. Feeling cold. Saturday Wet and windy weather moves east Saturday, with snow in some parts of the north and east. Sunday Brighter, showery and less cold Sunday. Monday Wet and windy in west later Monday. Will it be a white Christmas  Its still dficult to predict whether snow will fall on Christmas Day, given that its still  days away, but the Met Office is expecting unsettled weather during the Christmas week and temperatures that are milder than average. Some forecasters are predicting heavy snow over higher ground. Here is the Met Offices outlook for Monday  December to Wednesday  December: Through the middle of the month, a mix of blustery showers and longer spells of rain looks likely, with a risk of severe gales. Temperatures will be around normal for the time of year, although the south and west could become rather mild at times. However, a chance of some colder air in the north could give the risk of some hill snow. Heading into the Christmas week, it will probably stay unsettled, with further spells of wind and rain, but interspersed by some brighter and showery weather. Temperatures on the whole look likely to be a little milder than average. However, there is a small chance of colder temperatures, which could bring snow to hilltops in the north, and perhaps to low levels for a time in the northeast.

Bolte, , told the agents that Watts had a photo of the mountains on his profile and said that he was straight, the newspaper reports. This prompted Bolte to ask why he was messaging a gay man. Watts replied: lol, I dont really knowIm straight or not,.  Bolte told officers investigating Watts horric crimes that the pair met for the first time at Boltes residence and Watts ripped off his clothes. Bolte said: I performed oral sex on him, he performed oral sex on me, after that there was intercourse and he pretty much panicked and then didnt say much and left.  However soon after that, Bolte said, he met Watts daughters Bella and Celeste - who Watts would go on to murder in a twisted bid to start a new le. Bolte said prior to that Watts had told him: If you turn out not to be a psycho maybe you can meet them.  The -year-old escort said he and the married father-of-two, , had a ten-month relationship that ended this past spring. The two would spent time together at a remote Wyoming cabin said Bolte, which his mother Colleen confirmed in her own interview with a Colorado Bureau of Investigation agent. She also told the agent that Watts had given her son money while they were together, and even paid for Bolte to get lip injections. However Boltes story has been questioned since he first claimed he and Watts were together in a Facebook post shortly after the murders.  It was that post and an interview on a television that led to police reaching out to Bolte. At first Bolte was dficult for police and investigators to lock down. However police were able to speak to his mother. Colleen said that her son admitted he was seeing Watts long before the “horrible crime” occurred, and that Watts gave him money.  Bolte told her told his mother that Watts paid him , , and  on separate occasions, with Colleen adding that one of the payments was for her sons lip injections. Boltes August Facebook post said: We had relations off and on from last June up until March or April. I found out he was married with kids in February. I didn’t know that when we first met. He also noted: I can only speak for myself but before this happened, I would’ve % told you that Chris isn’t a murderer nor a sociopath. He told me he was the victim of emotional and mental abuse and was stuck in loveless marriage but was so scared to leave because of Bella and Celeste.

Ann, of Escondido, wants to have Maurices twin brother Francis remains dug up and his DNA tested to prove the link. Speaking to the Daily Mail, -year-old Ann said this would give her the answers shes been seeking for more than  years. She claimed she was the flesh and blood of the British royal family. But Ann says she has contacted members of the royals and hasnt received a response yet.  Ann claims she discovered the real identity of her biological father in a confession letter from her mum Evelyn Rudderforth who died in . But she only found the letter four years after her mums death. Ann, born in Kings Lynn, Norfolk, always believed she was the daughter of Charles Rudderforth.  But she now believes her mum had a love affair with Maurice. According to the Mail, the letter said: Please try to understand. I just have to get this off my chest. Charlie was not your biological father. I fell in love with Lord Fermoy and we had you as a result. He was married and I was just a commoner.  There was nothing we could do. We stayed in close touch and he loved you very much. Ann wants to have the remains of Maurices identical twin Francis dug up, who is buried in New York, to show she is Princess Dianas auntie. She has got in touch with lawyers about making this happen - and has even set up a gofundme page to raise money for the legal fees.  The page, created by her partner Michael King, says: Anns biological father was th Baron Maurice Fermoy, buried at Sandringham Estate, United Kingdom. th Baron Maurice has an identical twin brother who is buried in a cemetary in NYC. For us, it would be much easier and far less costly to disinter the body of the identical twin brother, andviable DNA remains, then, Anns claim would be proven once and for all, either way..

Michael Spavor and a second Canadian, Michael Kovrig, were detained separately in China this week, with Beijing claiming they are suspected of engaging in activities endangering national security. Their arrests come just days after Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou - the daughter of the Chinese tech giants founder - was held on suspicion of violating sanctions against Iran. Spavor runs a company that takes tourists to North Korea, and he has been pictured having a drink with Kim and welcoming retired basketball player Dennis Rodman to the country.   Chinas foreign ministry said on Thursday that the two Canadians are suspected of engaging in activities endangering national security. But China has reacted angrily to the December  arrest of Meng, which has sparked a diplomatic row between the two countries, and it has been accused of detaining the two men in a game of tit-for-tat. China said the cases involving Spavor and Kovrig, a diplomat who is on leave to work for the International Crisis Group, are under investigation.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told reporters the legitimate rights and interests of the two Canadians had been safeguarded. Spavor, a business consultant who founded China-based Paektu Cultural Exchange, has jet skied with Kim during his travels to North Korea. He is one of few Westerners with personal ties to the North Korean leader, and he has been trying to drum up international interest in investing in North Korean economic projects, in anticipation of sanctions being eased amid warming ties.  Spavor, who is based in the border city of Dandong, China, helped to facilitate former NBA star Rodmans visit to Pyongyang in . The Canadian told Reuters in : That was the most amazing experience Ive had in my le. We hung out for three days. Images from that time show Spavor sharing cocktails with Kim on board one of his private boats, after they had been jet-skiing in the bay next to Wonsan, one of Kims pet economic development areas. In , Spavor was involved in efforts to attract more than min foreign funds for Wonsan, including mto fund a new brewery.  He lived in Pyongyang for several months in , teaching at a school run by a Canadian non-governmental organisation, according to the Paektu Cultural Exchange website. Spavor had written on Facebook that he would be in Seoul from Monday for a few days to do consulting work and catch up with friends. But his friends said he never arrived. Chinese state media said he was detained by the National Security Bureau in Dandong. He informed Canadian officials that he was being questioned by Chinese authorities, but Ottawa said it hasnt heard from him since then and officials are trying to locate him. Huawei CFO Meng, meanwhile, has been released on bail in Vancouver after she was arrested on an extradition request from the US.

Festive flippancy aside, there is, of course, reason to believe the slide in results presided over by Csaba will not be repeated this time round.Under the new boss, the Tangerines have looked better organised and with a clearer game plan than they’ve probably had since the early days of Jackie McNamara’s time in charge, or certainly since Ray McKinnon’s first term in charge.Their style under this gaffer, by no means just blood and thunder, is more robust and therefore better suited to the physical rigours of Scotland’s second tier.On top of that, and in part it should be said because of Csaba’s ability to identy decent talent, there can be little argument this season’s squad contains better overall quality.In striker Pavol Safranko they have a front man of the calibre many teams even at top-flight level must be anxious off.And wide man Fraser Aird has been another astute signing who, like Safranko, has really come into his own under the current boss.There is also reason to believe his past, successful, experience of Championship football when he raced to promotion at Hearts means that come next month’s transfer window, Robbie will get exactly what he needs to strengthen the weaker areas of his team.The impressive form of Ayr United does remain a worry and, as they showed at Tannadice the week before last, they have to be regarded as serious promotion contenders.Ross County and this weekend’s opponents Inverness also remain challengers.And another disappointment against them could have fans worried about that early Christmas gt."},{"url":null,"title":"we are the team no one wants to play says dundees gensy kusunga","story":"Gensy Kusunga says Dundee used to be the team everybody wanted to play – now they are the team nobody wants to face he’s urged his team-mates to keep their focus.The impressive defensive display which earned the Dark Blues a - draw at home to Rangers, despite being reduced to  men after just  minutes, lted the side off the foot of the Premiership table for the first time since August.And that was in no small part down to the solid defensive display from Angolan international Kusunga, alongside centre-back partner Andy Boyle.Between them, they repelled everything Rangers threw into the box to keep up their unbeaten run, which now stretches to four matches.And the confidence which is oozing through the team now, allied to that dogged defensive display, will mean nobody will fancy facing Dundee in the coming weeks, evenit is Kilmarnock, Aberdeen and Celtic away next.Kusunga said: “I hope that is the case!“It’s good to hear that other teams won’t want to play us.“Before everyone wanted to play us to take confidence!

Before we could always say we didn’t win because of one mistake, you need to take responsibility and work like men.”And he’s urged the Dark Blues to repeat their show against Rangers in the coming weeks.He added: “Every game is hard, the opponents are strong in every game and we can’t think about playing a small team or playing a big team.“Every match is dficult and we need to work hard the same against whoever we play.”"},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas -

The effect of the route on other roads in and around Aberdeen was noticeable.Motorists at the Bridge of Dee can typically expect queues around the evening rush-hour, however last night it appeared to be greatly reduced. vw, px\"  Google Maps’ traffic monitoring showed a stark contrast between traffic levels at around .pm last night and on typical Wednesdays.Elsewhere, however, roads leading to the new Aberdeen Western Peripheral Routewere experiencing queues, as motorists tried out the road for the first time.Larger-than-usual tailbacks could be seen stretching along the A from the new Kingswells junction back to, and onto, the Lang Stracht. And there were also delays approaching the Charleston junction, with motorists heading to join the new fastlink connecting with the bypass.It meant drivers saw their travel times cut, with the journey time between Stonehaven and Craibstone taking just  minutes for the .-mile stretch.One motorist who used the road yesterday said said: “It only took about five minutes to drive from Peterculter to Kingswells. That may have been because the road was quiet but it would normally take at least double that – on a good day.”The milestone came as a call was made for a public inquiry to be held into the project’s handling.A Transport Scotland spokesman said: “It is not unusual for it to take some time before travel patterns are fully established as road users become familiar with the changes to the road network and they identy the routes that work best for them.“We would also like to ask road users to continue to drive with caution and be considerate of other road users while they become accustomed to the new road and mody their journeys.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"luke naisby named red stars new manager","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowAccomplished defender Luke Naisby is Lochgilphead Red Star AFC#s new manager.The new manager#s first challenge was to take charge of Red Star against Ferguslie Star AFC on Saturday November  in Paisley.The Red Star Facebook page said: #The committee is delighted to welcome him to his new role with the club.

No wonder he looked nervous.The boys got to grips with the dferent handling characteristics of Willie Senior#s car and started to up the pace in the afternoon bringing the car home in a respectable th overall and third in class three. This result was enough to secure second position in the overall championship in class.Jamie Miller continued the learning process with the little Citroen C-RMax with Ian McCulloch pointing him in the right direction. A very neat rally from Jamie with very few mistakes saw him finish a creditable th overall and second in class two, only beaten by the Scottish Tarmac Champion for  Michael Harbour in his similar Citroen, who was only one place above him after seven stages.Innes Mochrie was once again out on the stages in the Mightyand this time he had someone whom he might listen to in the co-driver#s seat. His daughter, Kirsty, had elected to fill the silly seat for this event and they, after a few first stage detours, managed to keep speaking right to the end and brought the class one pocket rocket home in th overall and a brilliant second in class. The mind boggles as to what the result could have been , as Kirsty was heard to remark, she had #someone who would listen to her#.Jonothan MacDonald and Chris Wareham were out in the beautully prepared Mull of Kintyre Cheese sponsored Peugeot . Their pace was good enough for th overall and fourth in class three.Mull pair Malcolm MacDougall and Stuart MacLean were out in the class one Vauxhall Nova and were getting visibly quicker as the day went on, a trend that had repeated itself over the course of the year with confidence and technique increasing with every stage mile covered. They finished th overall and a commendable fourth in class one.There were three Argyll co-drivers directing their pilots around the airfield. Ian Parker, recently announced as one of seven # and the only Scot # co-drivers to be selected to join the MSA Academy for , was back in the Honda Civic of Fraser Smith. The Civic screamed its way round the stages with minimal fuss, other than perhaps a lucky trip on two wheels after clipping a tyre, to finish in nd overall and fourth in class two.The final Argyll man out was Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan who was shouting left and right for Greg Inglis of Montrose in his quick and agile Lotus Exige. Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages. They got the hammer down over the last three and were to finish fth overall and first in class three.They were beaten only by the Kirkaldy brothers, both in Escort MkII#s of the highest calibre, and two WRC cars driven by Brian Watson and Reay Mackay.Last but not least, Oban#s Angus MacNeil was out with Sam MacFadyen in Brian Watson#s Mitsubishi Evo  binging it home unscathed in th overall.The event was won by Alan Kirkaldy in a freshly built Escort MkII, followed by his circuit racer brother Andrew in secondand Reay Mackay taking the last podium place in his WRC Fiesta.

The buildings on the main street and the front street just look sad.The front green for years has waited and unfortunately it still waits#this time for the council to clear away debris after a storm.Come on # the place looks bad enough. Clear it up as it happens or do something in the development plan to make sure it doesn’t in the future.Name and address supplied.What do you think about Lochgilphead and its future  Contact the Advertiser on editor@argyllshireadvertiser or message us directly via Facebook. Alternatively write to: Argyllshire Advertiser,  Argyll Street, Lochgilphead, Argyll, PA NBSir,As reported in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Christmas came early for local causes in Argyll recently when the Co-op revealed a £, festive funding boost.The money was shared by three organisations, all of whom are making a real dference to communities throughout the region. These are Argyll and Bute Youth Forum, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and Lochgilphead Phoenix Project, which wants to build an information point on the front green in Lochgilphead.This is the latest round of payouts from the fund generated by more than  , Co-op members in Argyll and Bute and means the Co-op has invested £, in nine groups in Argyll since the membership scheme launched in September .Co-op members, who receive a five per cent reward for themselves with a further one per cent going to local causes when they buy own-brand products, have a say in how the money is allocated, and are encouraged to select the organisations they wish to support online.Since the launch of the local community fund Co-op members have helped , organisations make a positive dference in their neighbourhoods and in the last  months alone £m has been invested in local causes.The fund is now supporting a wide iety of local organisations, from village halls and support groups to education providers and neighbourhood watch schemes, all of which are helping to make Argyll a better, happier, and healthier place to live.Rebecca Birkbeck, Co-op director of community engagement.Sir,I was pleased to attend the latest Argyll Islands Strategic Group meeting in Kilmory recently.I was able to speak to Scottish Government and Argyll and Bute Council representatives about the challenges facing our island communities.While we on the islands of Islay, Jura, Colonsay and Gigha are rightfully enjoying strong local economic growth, future growth will be stled by poor local infrastructure, at times unreliable ferry links and the never-ending troubles with the A.Regardless of what political stripe the leadership of the Scottish and UK parliaments have, all should be united in getting our vital links to the mainland and wider the UK economy back up to scratch.Without large scale investment from central government to fix Argyll and Bute#s roads and Transport Scotland#s trunk roads, our future prosperity is at risk and, as ever, it will be islanders that suffer the most.While political bun fights in the local press letters pages are entertaining,  what we really need is action from our MSPs and MPs.If we were talking about road and transport links between Scotland#s cities, it is highly likely these problems would already be fixed. The Scottish Government must in the future not be so urban-centric in its allocation of resources.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,I write following the release of the latest figures on alcohol use by the Office for National Statistics .The more you drink, the greater the long-term risk to your health and these ONS figures show a worrying increase in the number of alcohol-specic deaths in the UK, particularly amongst women and  to -year olds.From time to time, we are contacted by the families of people who have died as a result of alcohol and are only too aware of the heartbreak and utter sense of helplessness people feel when trying to lead someone to seek help for alcohol misuse.We must all do more to address the stigma that people feel in reaching out for support. For many of us, there are simple and effective ways for people to cut back on alcohol.Taking more drink-free days each week for example can reduce the overall amount of alcohol you drink and reduce the risk of developing serious illnesses. The Drinkaware website also provides information and resources for people concerned about their drinking or that of someone close to them and our DrinkChat online advisors can direct people, in complete confidence, to local treatment agencies.Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware chief executive."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead opens up for christmas","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowThe success of independent retailers depends on imagination and initiative, and Lochgilphead shops will be showing plenty of that # and festive spirit # in the weeks leading up to Christmas.Lochgilphead is, arguably, seeing a mini-revival, with new businesses outnumbering closures in recent times.

That kind of team confidence comes from having the care and understanding of first class management.The staging was deceptively simple and the backstage staff produced a delightful cart and car for Mr Toad, plus his horse, and the costumes were not elaborate while most effective.All were well-rehearsed, and the singing was clearly the result of very careful expert teaching. It was a great pleasure to see how some of the young voices have been developing since their last appearance in #The Wizard of Oz#.We would have liked a couple of the characters to project spoken parts more audibly but overall the clarity of words should be complimented.The energy of Mr Toad himself carried all before him, just as it is written in the script and the original Wind in the Willows.No inidual names are here mentioned, quite deliberately, as the outstanding impression of this show was the seamless blending of the entire team involved, with each and every participant a star in their own right."},{"url":null,"title":"camanachd association agm reports income rise","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Camanachd Association#s annual general meeting took place in the Muthu West End Hotel, Fort William, on Friday November .The  accounts showed a £, increase in turnover and a surplus of £,, increasing the association#s reserves to £, at December .Having fulfilled its obligations and met its related targets, the association did not suffer any reduction in its £, funding from Sportscotland, its largest single contributor.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

In fact shersquos really quite unique in that shersquos furry, has four legs, a tail, and is the schoolrsquos very own puppy.So how did this adorable pooch make its way into the lives and hearts of the pupils and staff at Priorsford  Did the pupils ask for a puppy on their Christmas list this year I discovered that Peggy was actually on the wish list of teacher Caroline Sharpe, who approached headteacher Sandra Macgregor a year ago with the idea of a therapy dog for the school.Caroline explained: ldquoWe heard about therapy dogs and the benefits they bring to pupils, we wanted to tie it into our health and wellbeing in the school.ldquoI attended the SSPCA conference and there were people there from universities who had taken therapy dogs into final exams for students.ldquoEvidence shows that therapy dogs lower peoplersquos heart rate, gives a general sense of well-being and improves childrenrsquos socialisation skills. We visited a school in Midlothian who had a Cockapoo puppy and we knew we could make it work for us. She has changed the dynamic of the school.Peggy will live with Caroline, but will be in school full-time.Having settled into her new home at Priorsford Primary this week, Peggy is already the most popular pupil in school.Despite skipping five primary year-groups to join the P class, Peggy is at the very start of her journey to becoming a certied school dog.ldquoShe has settled in well and has already met the pupils at assemblies. My daughter is a vet and told me to expose her to everything straight away. The time between eight and  weeks is really important for stamping the personality and the secureness of the puppy, added Caroline.Peggy is learning how to become a listening dog, who will help children read aloud more confidently. She will put her head in their lap and listen without judgement, prompting them to turn a page with her paw.Caroline explained: ldquoNot only will she improve the pupilrsquos literacy skills, Peggy will be there for any children who are feeling anxious or worried, they can take some time out to talk to her.I joined the P class in the library as they read the tale of Greyfriars Bobby to Peggy. But she was worn out after a busy morning and childrenrsquos soothing reading put her to sleep!As I wander through the school with Peggy, pupils eyes widen at the sight of the furry bundle and instantly a smile lights up their faces. ldquoI love her Mrs Sharp, she is soooo cute, cooed one girl.When it came to naming the puppy, it was decided not to ask the children, who, Caroline said, would have come up with wonderfully unique suggestions.Before leaving the school, I am given Peggy to cuddle, and for a split second I consider slipping her into my handbag and making a run for it. But a vision of an angry mob in blue chasing me through the playground fills me with fear and I decide she is exactly where she should be.It is said that dog is a manrsquos best friend.

That science has or will find solutions to all our manmade problems. The issue with this approach has always been that, experiments carried out in controlled environments like laboratories and then replicated in nature have always been unexpected and sometimes catastrophic.These scientic methods involved limited assessments and tests and mainly conducted for profit by big pharma!Having covered Making Scotland GMOFree in my previous column I will focus on our next vision, which is to make Scotland a  per cent organic country.The green revolution introduced in the s, sprayed fertilisers and pesticides on farm land all over the planet to increase crop yields. This in turn led to many forests being cut down to grow what was then called lsquocash cropsrsquo and small-scale farming was replaced by industrial farming on a massive scale supported by government subsidies.Big corporations acquired land across the globe, food was added as a commodity to be traded for profits on the stock market and this in turn has led to inequalities in health and access to food especially in developing and third world countries.The unforeseen impact of chemicals for growing over the last few decades, has led to the fall of nutrients in the soil, as this was being depleted by over use and irregular crop rotation. Profits were maximised and are even today. For example, soya beans are now grown in many countries as cattle feed for the West! This then leaves no arable land for the local population to grow food leading to widespread hunger and impoverished conditions.We need to go back to our roots and grow food at local levels on a small scale and bring back farming as a lucrative job for people to invest their time and energies. This will be a sustainable long-term approach and remove the need for farming subsidies that are the biggest scandal of our times as most go to big landowners in this country. Can you imagine governments are currently paying farmers in some cases not to grow Organic farming will not only bring back the health of the soil but also stop corporations making money through selling chemicals and hybrid seeds. This will have a positive impact on the lives of all people as lsquoorganic produce will no longer be the domain of the rich and middle class who can afford to feed themselves and their children with good food. This choice should be available to all.So! Whatrsquos happening globally where organic farming is concerned  Denmark is on its way to becoming the worldrsquos first  per cent organic country, followed by Bhutan and Estonia. India has the North-eastern state of Sikkim designated as the first fully organic state anywhere in the world and was awarded the UN lsquoOscar for the Best Policy that is inclusive and comprehensive of all socioeconomic aspects.Can Scotland be  per cent organic  Yes! It can."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-factory-announces-50-redundancies","story":"ONE of the regions major manufacturers has announced that it is looking to pay off more than  members of staff.Jedburgh-based Mainetti UK is looking for voluntary redundancies following a second year of reported losses.Bosses at the Oxnam Road coat-hanger manufacturer are blaming recycling and a reduction in high street retailers as well as an increase in the minimum wage for combined losses over the past  months of more than pound million.Mainettis Regional MD Jim Hutchison stated: \"The last two years have been dficult for the business.\"In  Mainetti UK Limited made a loss of pound, and this year we are forecast to lose a further pound,.\"The business is faced with an ever increasing cost base with increases in the National Minimum Wage, higher electricity costs and higher business rates.\"To add to these cost pressures the business is seeing local UK demand for hangers reducing.\"Many retailers are closing down shops or reducing their selling space and this means there are less hangers required.\"In addition, an increased emphasis on recycling means more hangers are being ed from stores for resorting, which further reduces manufacturing demand.\"Mainetti UK currently employs around  staff.Talks have already started with unions over the planned  redundancies.Mr Hutchison added: \"These changes will only impact the Jedburgh hanger manufacturing unit.\"All other products made in Jedburgh ndash flower buckets, polythene bags, Glastic and The Seatcase will not be impacted and in fact the company will continue to invest in all these areas during , in order to grow those parts of our Jedburgh manufacturing business.\"Local MP John Lamont has been in talks with the company over the past few days.He told us: ldquoThis is disappointing news from a long standing employer in Jedburgh.ldquoClearly their market is changing and Mainetti are having to adapt to that.

their Burnham on Sea microwave joke was worth the admission fee alone.These four crazy characters swayed towards slapstick, flirted with farce and brought down the house with a bombardment of belly-laughs.Despite all the fun and frivolity, though, Sleeping Beauty was still a sensational piece of stage theatre.Julia Noble and Steve Hartley-Oliver were authoritative and appealing as Queen Marigold and King Cactus.And the regular arrival of sinister Witch Hazel, played by both Tracey Borthwick and Julie Smith, in a cloud of customary green smoke made sure the young audience were kept on their toes.The couplet duels between the villainous Witch and Fairy Lilac, played exquisitely by Amanda Blacklock, were both clever and entertaining.Couplets aside, music was at the heart of Sleeping Beauty, from the opening Lazy Hazy Crazy Days of Summer all the way through the seasonal finale, and many of the most memorable numbers came from Fairy Lilac and her supporting coloured fairies of Shannon Mack, Ruby Everett, Caitlin Green and Katie Wilson.From You Can Do Magic and Dream a Little Dream of Me to the luscious Hushabye Mountain, Amanda and her young apprentices were wonderful.A beautul rendition of Born with a Smile on My Face was the highlight of Aimee Richardsons all-to-short appearance as Young Rose.And the childrens fun-filled version of Wake Up You Sleepy Head was also among the many highlights of a fantastic night of musical theatre.The songs came thick and fast - as did the jokes.Hawick, Melrose and Tweedbank were ridiculed regularly, as were Theresa May, the Ladhope Vale one-way system and the residents of Abbotsford Court.The laughs were loud and the cheers, especially when Braw Lad and Braw Lass Greg Kelly and Kimberley OMay turned up for Roses Christening, were even louder.The choreography was both imaginative and eye-catching with dancers Emma Wilson, Jess Thomson, Rachel Falconer and Sara Facchini having obviously put in the rehearsal hours.The score was foot-tappingly good, the scene changes were swt and the stage was picture perfect.But ultimately its the actors, dancers and singers who take a production to new heights.And when the cast is enjoying themselves as much as the audience, the people behind the Right Angle Theatre Company can go to sleep this Christmas with a smile on their faces.CASTFairy Lilac: Amanda BlacklockWitch Hazel: Julie Smith Tracey BorthwickMuddles: Billy RooneyKing Cactus: Steve Hartley-OliverQueen Marigold: Julia NobleNurse Hettie Harpic: Jodie MillarFetch: Antony WilsonCarrie: Katie GordonFairy Red: Shannon MackFairy Yellow: Ruby EverettFairy Green: Caitlin GreenFairy Blue: Katie WilsonYoung Rose: Aimee RichardsonPrince Alexis: Stuart MitchellRose: Amy ThomsonDancers: Sara Facchini, Rachel falconer, Jess Thomson and Emma Wilson.Chorus: Ruaridh Anderson, Charli Black, Tracy Borthwick, Callum Crooks, Erin Gallagher, Nicole Hughes, Mya Lamb, Molly McFarlane, Lee-Anne Robinson, Millie Robinson, Ally Turnbull, Eilidh Walker.Children : Abigail Burns, Ellie Cockburn, Grace Decoteau, Rhianna Devlin, Faith Heriot, Fraser Scott Hermiston, Chloe Noble, Ceijay Robinson, Rebecca Scott, Max Turnbull and Ellie Welsh.: Simona Andom, Sophia Blaen, Georgie Everett, Skye Machara Henderson, Sky Hume, Chloe Johnston, Emily Johnstone, Lucy Johnstone, Ellie mcLaren, Molly McLaren, Carrie Smith and Isla Train.PRODUCTIONStage Crew: Billy Easson, Steven Headspeath, Craig Monks, Adam Nichol and Malcolm Wilson.Prompter: Sheila WilsonMake Up  Hair: Team from Millars Hair SalonMake Up Co-ordinator: Yvonne KeddieProps: Gordon Keddie and Sarah PhilipsChildrens Co-ordinator: Amanda BlacklockChildrens Organizer: Michelle DevlinPhotographs: Jade PringleGroup Bookings: Morag KeddieRaffle: Susan FalconerScenery: Border StudiosFront of House: Lana ThomsonKeyboards: Chris AchenbachPercussion: Graham Borthwick"},{"url":null,"title":"new-housing-estate-for-lauder-given-go-ahead","story":"SCOTTISH Borders Council has given the go-ahead to a brand new housing estate in Lauder.Members of the councilrsquos planning and building standards body voted unanimously to approve an application from Persimmon Homes to build  new homes just north of Thirlestane Drive.Seven people have objected to the development, with a further four expressing concerns, including Kimberly Shaw-Walker, of Thirlestane Drive.She wrote: ldquoThe site is not suitable for the volume of houses proposed.

has found.The Scottish Government cut the legal blood alcohol limit for motorists from  milligrammes of alcohol in  millilitres of blood to  in December .It argued the change would help save lives and make the countryrsquos roads safer.But Jim Lewsey, professor of medical statistics at Glasgow Universityrsquos Institute of Health and Wellbeing, said the ldquounequivocal results of the research were this ldquosimply did not have the intended effect of reducing RTAs.The ldquomost plausible explanation for this ldquosurprising finding was the lower limit in Scotland was not backed up with sufficient police enforcement or media campaigning, he added.The research, which was carried out alongside NHS Health Scotland, the University of Stirling and the University of East Anglia, looked at police data on road traffic accidents in not just Scotland but also England and Wales ndash where the drink-drive limit has remained at  millilgrammes of alcohol.The drink-drive limit in Scotland was reduced in December  This was combined with market research data showing alcohol consumption rates ndash with the researchers believing the design of the study allowed them to isolate the impact of the policy change.Prof Lewsey said: ldquoOur findings are surprising, given what we know from previous international evidence, which generally supports a reduction of RTAs following the same lowering of a blood alcohol concentration limit.ldquoHowever, the results of our high-quality study are unequivocal ndash they indicate that the reduction in Scotlandrsquos drink-drive limit in December  simply did not have the intended effect of reducing RTAs.When the lower drink driving limit was introduced, then-Scottish justice secretary Michael Matheson said he believed the change would ldquonot only reduce accidents but also reduce fatalities on Scottish roads and in that way make Scottish roads safer.Prof Lewsey added: ldquoIn our view, the most plausible explanation for our findings is that the change in legislation was not backed up with additional police enforcement, nor sustained media campaigning.ldquoIt is also perhaps an indication of the safety of Scotlandrsquos roads more generally, following continual improvements in recent years, and the fact that drink-driving is increasingly socially unacceptable.He stressed: ldquoDrink-driving remains highly dangerous and against the law. It is important to stress that these findings should not be interpreted to imply that any level of drink-driving is safe.In response to the study Alison Douglas, chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland said: ldquoReducing the drink-drive limit was the right thing to do as the risk of having an accident rises in direct relation to the amount of alcohol consumed.ldquoThe safest thing to do is avoid alcohol completely before driving. We need to increase public understanding and awareness of the risks and the limit.There were at least , road traffic accidents in the UK in  that involved drink-driving, while such incidents are estimated to cost the Scottish economy about pound million a year.The study, which was published in the medical journal The Lancet, also looked at the impact the lower limit had had on alcohol sales.Here it concluded there had been no change to sales in supermarkets and off-licences, while sales in pubs, restaurants and bars were found to have reduced by less than %.Scottish Conservative justice spokesman Liam Kerr said: ldquoWe warned at the time that the SNP Government was focusing on the wrong end of the scale with these changes.ldquoWe wanted more attention on those whose irresponsible behaviour actually cause death and destruction.ldquoThis report seems to back that approach up and I hope the SNP Government takes this on board.ldquoWe all want to see a reduction in drink-driving and the accidents it causes, and itrsquos vital that we work towards that.SNP MSP Emma Harper responded: ldquoThe Tories are absurdand deeply irresponsible. Theyrsquore attacking the SNP for leading the fight against drink-driving despite supporting us by voting for lower limits.ldquoAnd, to top off this hypocrisy, their own spokesperson was posing outside Parliament for a photo op for an anti-drink drive campaign which backs the Scottish Governmentrsquos approach.Meanwhile, a Scottish Government spokeswoman said ministers would look at the research ldquocarefully.She said: ldquoThe  independent North Report found that drivers are six times more likely to die in a road traffic accident with a blood alcohol concentration between mg and mg than with zero blood alcohol.ldquoThat is why the Scottish Parliament agreed unanimously to set the drink-drive limit based on the scientic evidence as to when impairment begins to increase signicantly ndash bringing Scotland in line with most European nations..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: New drink-drive limit in Scotland  uhas not reduced road accidents u"},{"url":null,"title":"slow-reaction-for-emergency-response-in-selkirk","story":"A COMMUNITY councillor in Selkirk has slammed his colleagues for their snail-paced push towards creating an emergency reaction group.Resilience teams have been formed in towns and villages across the Borders.The volunteer organisations react during storms and other emergencies to clear snow, distribute sandbags, operate floodgates, deliver supplies and provide hot meals in community centres.And support in the way of equipment, training and insurance cover is provided by the local authority.Although community councillors in Selkirk agreed at the start of the year to form their own reaction group, apart from an initial meeting in April and the creation of a Facebook page little  has happened.Councillor Adrian Kentleton blasted the lack of progress.

Seasports SCIO.#We are very pleased to see the project move forward to the current position where a broad range of partners and potential funders are actively engaged in the effort to bring the project to fruition.#While our interest is focused on the sailing and powerboating aspects, we fully understand the benefits of working with other water based sports to create a community asset, within which we create synergies, economies and share skill sets.#It is a model that is worthy of replicating where and one which closely aligns with general development in community sport across Scotland.#We firmly believe the new Kintyre Seasports facility will create a hub within the community of Campbeltown where all members of the community can learn, practice, train and enjoy an active engagement in the sea.#Such opportunities are known to provide a tangible connection to improvements in health, social cohesion through volunteering and introduce many, particularly young people, to their first structured employment as instructors within their chosen water sport.#We are clear that developing grass roots opportunities within sailing and powerboating as well as other sports, provides young people with positive habits and skills that last a letime and iniably enhance employability.#We find the club environment is also an excellent place for the development of interpersonal skills, intergenerational relationships and to experience positive role models from many walks of le.#Families enjoy a place which is safe for children and supports the active participation of parents in sport, sustaining lelong participation and encouraging family cohesion through sharing of activity.#The uniqueness of sailing is that there are no barriers to participation.#Those aged from eight-years-old to , with disability or able bodied, LGBT or otherwise can share the same activity, learn and compete on an equal basis with minimal adjustments and are bonded by their love of boating.#There is every reason to expect that the Kintyre Seasports Project will be a shining example of inclusion.#The full potential of the project lies in the wider connections across the communities of interest the facility will serve.#Campbeltown sits on one of the most ied and interesting stretches of water in Scotland having benefits of both the shelter for Campbeltown Loch and immediate access to wider open sea in the Kilbrannan Sound and the Irish Sea.#In addition to becoming a hub of community activity, it is entirely conceivable that future events in dinghy racing, sea kayaking, coastal rowing and yacht racing will find a regular home in Campbeltown, facilitated by the skills and resources of the Kintyre Seasports Project.#RYA Scotland is excited by the prospects of

However, when the fall of communism led to the break-up of Yugoslavia, war came to Bosnia in , driven in part by Serbiarsquos desire to create a lsquoGreater Serbiarsquo, including large parts of Bosnia, from which they planned to remove Croats and Muslims in what became known as lsquoethnic cleansingrsquo.Our delegation leader Resad Trbonja was , living in Sarajevo. On April , , he woke to find his city under siege, surrounded by Serbian artillery and snipers on the mountains overlooking the city. The siege would last four years, the longest in modern warfare, longer than Stalingrad. An average of  mortars landed in the city every day, , on the worst day.Resad, who lived through, and fought in, the siege, explained that Sarajevo regressed two centuries overnight ndash no water, no electricity, no phones. The Serbian army allowed minimal UN aid into the city sporadically but nothing .The survival of the siege is a story of human courage, spirit and defiance.Our first visit was to the remnants of a tunnel, dug under Sarajevo airport to reach Bosnian-held territory on the other side. This tiny tunnel was the only way in or out for four years.Through this tunnel extra aid came, for example from Edinburgh Direct Aid, who drove lorries of supplies from Edinburgh to help Sarajevans. My own predecessor, John Home Robertson, then MPfor East Lothian, spent several Parliamentary recesses as a volunteer lorry driver. It was dangerous work and one of his colleagues died on the notorious road known as lsquoSnipers Alleyrsquo.Perhaps the most affecting visit in Sarajevo was to the War Childhood Museum, where those who grew up in the siege display the things they kept to remind them of what it was like, and tell their story.A homemade cardboard knightrsquos breastplate made by a brother who later died a cuddly toy from a UN delivery, cuddled threadbare because it was the only toy a homemade lsquounormrsquo for a childrenrsquos choir which rehearsed and performed in defiance of bombs and bullets the remains of a playpark lsquojungle gymrsquo kept to remember the day a mortar tore it apart and killed your friend ndash no one who visits this museum will forget it.That is true too of Srebrenica. This was supposedly a lsquosafe havenrsquo protected by UN troops. Yet on July , Serbian paramilitary units overran it. Thousands of Bosnian Muslims sought refuge in the UN base at a disused factory.When we visited the museum now sited there, survivor Hasan Hasanovic explained to us how UN soldiers stood by as women and children were herded onto buses and deported, while their men were separated and removed in lorries. They were systematically murdered nearby. Thousands more who tried to escape through the forest were hunted down, shepherded into a meadow, and shot. In all, , Bosnian Muslim men and boys were slaughtered at Srebrenica.Finally, the international community acted. In a matter of days, air strikes lted the siege of Sarajevo, drove Serbian paramilitaries out of much of the territory they had occupied, and forced agreement to a peace deal signed in Dayton, Ohio.Srebrenica was not the only genocide in this war, but it is emblematic because it happened under the noses of the UN and because of the bravery of the Mothers of Srebrenica, who ed home to find out what happened to their husbands and sons, refused to be silenced, and demanded justice.This led to the International Commission on Missing Persons and the forensic anthropology unit in Tuzla, where we saw the incredible work done to identy remains using DNA. More than , victims of genocide have now been identied, allowing their families to grieve and to bury them at the final stop of our visit.We arrive at the cemetery at Potaceri, outside Srebrenica, as the sun sets.

It is important to stress that these findings should not be interpreted to imply that any level of drink-driving is safe.In response to the study Alison Douglas, chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland said: ldquoReducing the drink-drive limit was the right thing to do as the risk of having an accident rises in direct relation to the amount of alcohol consumed.ldquoThe safest thing to do is avoid alcohol completely before driving. We need to increase public understanding and awareness of the risks and the limit.There were at least , road traffic accidents in the UK in  that involved drink-driving, while such incidents are estimated to cost the Scottish economy about pound million a year.The study, which was published in the medical journal The Lancet, also looked at the impact the lower limit had had on alcohol sales.Here it concluded there had been no change to sales in supermarkets and off-licences, while sales in pubs, restaurants and bars were found to have reduced by less than %.Scottish Conservative justice spokesman Liam Kerr said: ldquoWe warned at the time that the SNP Government was focusing on the wrong end of the scale with these changes.ldquoWe wanted more attention on those whose irresponsible behaviour actually cause death and destruction.ldquoThis report seems to back that approach up and I hope the SNP Government takes this on board.ldquoWe all want to see a reduction in drink-driving and the accidents it causes, and itrsquos vital that we work towards that.SNP MSP Emma Harper responded: ldquoThe Tories are absurdand deeply irresponsible. Theyrsquore attacking the SNP for leading the fight against drink-driving despite supporting us by voting for lower limits.ldquoAnd, to top off this hypocrisy, their own spokesperson was posing outside Parliament for a photo op for an anti-drink drive campaign which backs the Scottish Governmentrsquos approach.Meanwhile, a Scottish Government spokeswoman said ministers would look at the research ldquocarefully.She said: ldquoThe  independent North Report found that drivers are six times more likely to die in a road traffic accident with a blood alcohol concentration between mg and mg than with zero blood alcohol.ldquoThat is why the Scottish Parliament agreed unanimously to set the drink-drive limit based on the scientic evidence as to when impairment begins to increase

So I got tapped on the shoulder by one of the coaches and asked to step in to the breach.Now, it was hardly the second leg of the Copa Liberatadores final between Boca Juniors and River Plate in the Bernabeu. It was a seven-a-side game between a bunch a  and -year-old boys on one third of an articial pitch in the suburbs of Glasgow. Nevertheless, it gave an eye-opening insight into the lot of the man-in-black.Who knew, for example, that determining which player touched the ball last in a   challenge and which team should subsequently be awarded a throw-in could be dficult  Having a linesman would have helped. But it was startling how something so seemingly straightforward could be so challenging.The reaction to many of my calls ndash indignation, outrage, tears, recrimination, disbelief ndash was also unexpected.Anyone who says that kids arenrsquot influenced by how high-profile professional players behave on television is, as Steve Clarke might well say, talking out of their backside.One particular objectionable urchin, who must have stood all of three feet tall in his studs, spent a couple of minutes after the game offering a less than complimentary appraisal of my performance. Apparently, for example, shouting isnrsquot allowed in boysrsquo football and is punishable by a free-kick. You learn something new every day.As for the spectators! Their conduct of the smattering of onlookers in what was effectively a kickabout left much to be desired. One especially joyless parent on the sidelines took time to inform me ldquothat was a blue ball after one of my dubious calls. Had he sensed my deep-rooted anti-blue agenda Then there was my positioning. I made Willie Young look like Kylian Mbappe as a I lumbered about the pitch trying to keep up with the action. But I lost count of the occasions I found myself either in the way of play or in a hopeless vantage point.How do referees possibly work out in the blink of an eyea player who was in an offside position had been interfering with play after a goal is scored by a team mate  How do they cope with making such a call in front of tens of thousands of people  The mind truly boggled.Several Stella after the ordeal, I concluded that referees are selfless not clueless iniduals, have a nigh on impossible task and deserve our sympathy and support not abuse and opprobrium.At the very least, they need VAR. The system, as we saw at Russia , isnrsquot perfect, but in an age when every passage of play is filmed from half a dozen dferent angles and incidents dissected the instant they happen, it would help quell a growing disaffection with match officials and make their lives easier."},{"url":null,"title":"derek-mackay-could-bypass-greens-to-secure-scottish-budget","story":"One option would be to rely on the two LibDem MSPs for Orkney and Shetland, who voted for the last budget because of a pound.m investment in local ferry services.The support of Liam McArthur and Tavish Scott would have enabled the SNP minority government to secure its budget by  votes to , eventhe Greens had opposed it.A Scottish Government source said the experience had demonstrated there were ldquointeresting options available, adding: ldquoTherersquos more than one way to skin this cat.Green MSP Andy Wightman also admitted the budget could pass without his partythe finance secretary won over MSPs with ldquopork barrel spending in their constituencies.He told The Herald: ldquoLast year did demonstrate the government can rely on the support of constituency members on matters of importance to their constituents.ldquoThey got those two votes from the Liberals.

Now they know that.If Mr Mackay again made the Northern Isles MSPs an offer they couldnrsquot refuse, it would give him  votes out of  .If the former SNP minister Mark McDonald, who now sits as an Independent, also backed the budget, Mr Mackay would then have an absolute majority in Holyrood for his plans.The Greens negotiated extra spending infor supporting the last two budgets.However they are adamant they will not negotiate on the   budget without meaningful progress on replacing council tax and giving councils more tax powers.They want a fundamental shake-up of council finance, bringing it into line with the European norm, with local authorities raising around half of their own spending in tax.However Mr Mackay has so far given no sign that he is willing to accede, fuelling speculation at Holyrood about other options.A government source said: ldquoPeople are aware of options when we get to critical votes.ldquoThe attraction of the Greens is that we donrsquot have to be negotiating for every single vote.ldquoBut itrsquos a fact of arithmetic and political reality that itrsquos not the only route.ldquoSome other routes might be less attractive, and harder work. But therersquos more than one way to skin this cat.Mr Wightman said: ldquoAt the end of the day itrsquos a decision for Derek Mackay. Hersquos got to decide how he plays this.ldquoWersquove made our position very clear. The problem with the SNP on this is that theyrsquore not making commitments for one budges - in fact nothing wersquore asking for would be incorporated in a finance bill - everything is about commitments for the longer term.ldquoThat involves cabinet sitting down and thinking about the next election, thinking about their manesto, and thinking about the kind of commitments that they can make.ldquoOn local tax wersquore doing no more than asking them to confirm [a previous commitment] that council tax should end.ldquoIt shouldnrsquot be too hard for them, in our view, to say that, but somehow it is.LibDem leader Willie Rennie last weekend said he would not enter budget talks because the SNP would not meet his precondition of shelving a second independence referendum.A LibDem source said that made it unlikely Mr McArthur or Mr Scott would vote for the budget, although no decision had been taken.The LibDems also expect the one-year ferry funding from   to be continued next year, so Mr Mackay would not be able to dangle that particular carrot a second time.ldquoWersquore not interested in pork-barrelling from one budget to the next one, said a source."},{"url":null,"title":"iain-macwhirter-derek-mackay-should-be-bold-and-take-the-chance-to-reshape-our-fiscal-landscape","story":"The big issue, had it not been for the Brexit shambles, would be the Scottish Governmentrsquos expected decision not to raise the threshold for higher rate tax payers to pound,, as announced in the UK Budget. This would normally be portrayed by the Conservatives and much of the press as an irresponsible Nat Tax increase that would ldquohammer middle income earners, even though it does nothing of the kind. Embarrassingly for Labour, the Shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell, controversially supported the Tory threshold rise, which of course is an effective tax cut for higher earners.Scots earning around pound, are a vocerous group and they could find themselves paying pound, more in income tax than they would had they been living in England. Thatrsquos serious money. However, few of the , or so higher rate payers are in a position to pay the relocation costs of fleeing to the border, eventhey wanted to. And of course many wonrsquot actually notice, since they will see no increase in their tax bills.So, with political attention where, Mr Mackay has a unique opportunity to raise tax without actually raising taxes ndash the ultimate stealth tax. Just doing nothing brings a conditional windfall of more than pound million, according to the Fraser of Allander Institute The vast majority of Scots, anyway, make a lot less than pound,. Median gross earnings are less than half that figure. Mr Mackay could fiddle around with the new rates and bands, and deliver a headline tax cut to half of Scottish workers and still be quids in. A useful little tax giveaway in what could be an election year. ndash though hersquod be wise to avoid pulling out too many budgetary rabbits since, with the Scottish economy expected to slow down after Brexit, overall tax revenues are likely to be depressed in future.Indeed, Mr Mackay has more than usual reason this year to be grateful for the much-maligned Barnett Formula. Thanks to Chancellor Philip Hammondrsquos increase in NHS spending, the Scottish Government will receive poundm for health alone next year through Barnet ldquoconsequentials. With NHS boards like Lothian plunging into the red, this has come not a moment too soon.As is well known, the SNP Government failed in past years to devote all the health revenue increases to the Scottish NHS. This time Mr Mackay has made clear every penny will go to health. Half a billion should at least paper over the cracks in a service which still has widespread public support, but has serious problems. Though no one should underestimate the capacity of the NHS to swallow vast amounts of public money.With new medicines and procedures, health spending needs to rise by around two per cent just to stand still. Scotlandrsquos population is ageing rapidly and older people need expensive care. Waiting targets in A E are being missed. There is a recruitment crisis that is only going to get worse as doctors and nurses stop coming from Europe after Brexit. The spending watchdog, Audit Scotland, reported recently that the NHS in Scotland is ldquofinancially unsustainable.The injection of cash from Westminster will put this crisis off for some years. However, the sheer volume of resources devoted to the NHS is creating problems where. Nearly half of the entire Scottish budget now goes on health, and this has squeezed local government. Thanks to austerity, council spending has been cut to the bone over the last decade, and there is little prospect of them being able to catch up. Crucial services like education, social care and waste recycling are disintegrating. Teachers are threatening to go on strikethey donrsquot get a  per cent pay increase.Council cuts canrsquot go on much longer without causing irreparable damage to communities. The obvious answer is to allow councils to raise more money themselves. But the Scottish Government allowed them to raise the council tax cap last year by three per cent, and it didnrsquot make much of a dent in the problem. Councils are also raising cash from things like parking charges and the ending of second home discounts, but more needs to be done. Many believe that only a replacement of the council tax itself, by a local income tax or land and property wealth tax, could close the gap.The Scottish Green Party, whose six pack of MSPs are threatening to vote against todayrsquos budget, could potentially bring down the Scottish Government over council tax reform. A firm timetable for its abolition is their green red line. But I doubt Scottish voters could cope with another parliament in crisis right now, so their co-leader Patrick Harvie will probably settle for rather less. Possibly movement towards the ldquotransitory visitor levy, otherwise known as the tourist tax.Itrsquos not entirely clear why Nicola Sturgeon is so leery of a tax that is applied in most European cities. Edinburgh hotel rates are now so high ndash more than pound a night on average ndash that a two per cent tax would hardly be noticed, especially since foreign visitors are paying  per cent less thanks to the collapse in the value of the pound. Never has low-hanging fruit dangled so tantalisingly close to a finance ministerrsquos grasp.Some talk of the agreeable and intelligent Derek Mackay as a future leader of the SNP, and he certainly has the chance to shine today. The Finance Secretary is reshaping the entire fiscal landscape of Scotland, and thanks to Brexit, getting the political space to do it."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9106109.jpg?type=article-full","title":"msps-to-receive-a-pay-increase-from-april-next-year","story":"Speaking at a Holyrood committee, members of the Scottish Parliaments Corporate Bodysaid the rise, which MSPs do not vote on, is linked to those in the public-sector pay.:Derek Mackay could bypass Greens to secure Scottish BudgetThe figure is determined by using the annual survey of earnings and working hours published by the Office for National Statistics .It means MSPs will receive an annual salary of pound, - up from pound,.Total overall pay for the First Minister, including MSP salary, will rise to pound,.Cabinet secretaries will earn pound, and junior ministers will receive pound, when their salaries as MSPs are included in the overall figure.The overall budget for MSPs pay will increase next year by %, attributed to the creation of two additional Cabinet secretary roles and one more junior minister at an extra cost of pound,.The Parliament was noted to have been \"signicantly busier\" over the course of , with MSPs spending an increased amount of time at Holyrood.:Nicola Sturgeon - UK facing chaos due to vicious civil war within Tory party- they all need to goThe time spent in committees increased year-on-year by %, with % more time spent in the chamber.The number of committee meetings held also increased by %.Sir Paul Grice, chief executive of the Scottish Parliament, said they are continuing to develop \"innovative ways of working\".Mr Grice said: \"Staff are just working very hard - there hasnt been a noticeable spike in overtime, we have a very flexible system of working so although were very busy at certain times of the year, over the summer recess we would expect staff who principally service committees and in the chamber to be able to draw that down\"."},{"url":null,"title":"ian-blackford-calls-for-theresa-may-to-resign-at-pmqs","story":"The SNP Westminster leader urged Mrs Mayto \"do the right thing\" andstep down as he slammed the Prime Minister for pulling the meaningful vote, which was scheduled to take place yesterday.He said: \"That is contemptuous of Parliament.

Irsquod honestly never thought of it before and the idea came from there.The idea has spawned a comic script collaboration with Italian artist Katia Vecchio, and the creation of Warpaint, which Sherry says is comparable with s coming of age films Stand By Me and Goonies, but told from a feminist perspective.He said: ldquoThe comic uses menstruation as one of the themes, and how girls are expected to be ashamed of it, but the lead character is a woman who is very up-front about that sort of thing.ldquoThe characters have a fantasy world that they go to, a place where they imagine a better world and try to bring that world into reality. And in that fantasy world theyrsquore not ashamed of their blood, their menstruation.ldquoItrsquos called Warpaint because the characters use their menstrual blood as a stand against the patriarchy and misogyny of their small-town upbringing.ldquoItrsquos a dficult thing for a man to be writing about and I did a lot of talking with my female friends and to gauge how a woman feels about a man writing or co-writing.ldquoI asked things about the consistency of menstrual blood, and whether it was possible to use it as war paint. I discovered it was.ldquoBut Irsquom not trying to tell women about menstruation. If anything, itrsquos for men like me who never actually think about it.The project comes in the wake of a major drive to eradicate period poverty, something which one in five women in Scotland have experienced.Earlier this year the Scottish Government became the first in the world to make sanitary products available for free to all , of its pupils in a bid to ensure girls didnrsquot miss out on any part of their education through a lack of access to sanitary products.Councillor Alison Evison, president of Cosla, said the pound. million initiative would ldquocontribute to a more open conversation and reducing the unnecessary stigma associated with periods.Warpaint is published on worldwide online comic  ComiXology, and will be followed by a novel and solo album which Sherry is currently recording at Chem  studios in Blantyre, Lanarkshire with leading indie producer Paul Savage.It follows the story of a -year-old girl being brought up by her religious grandparents, and navigating the impact of misogyny and bullying on women and men in small-town Scotland.Sherry said: ldquoShersquos trying to escape and find a better le for herself. Shersquos the kind of rare kid you meet who doesnrsquot back down in the face of authority.Sherry is the lead singer and co-songwriter in Attic Lights, who have released two albums with a third due next year.He says he thinks of his songs as ldquosongs women might write.ldquoThe way I make my melodies work, and the way I sing also has a feminine quality, he said. ldquoI went to that place, and also to the place where I had to take my male ego to pieces. But I couldnrsquot have done it without Katia, shersquos what makes it ring true.ldquoThe comic takes a fairly militant feminist slant on patriarchal attitudes towards menstruation and how young girls and your women are treated in society. But at its heart itrsquos a human story about friendship and regret and courage and kids who want to change the world being let down by adults who supposedly know better.The writer acknowledged the influence of comics such as Dundeersquos iconic Beano, and  AD whose character Judge Dredd was conceived by Greenock-raised John Wagner. Other Scottish comic book success stories include Frank Quitely and Grant Morrison.Sherry said: ldquoI worship at the feet of people like Grant Morrison. Irsquove been buying comics since as early as I can remember. The true love of my le is AD, which I still read to this day. Itrsquos responsible for my political and moral outlook on le."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-now-is-surely-the-time-for-another-national-government","story":"There are voices of real ability and sound common sense across parties to be found in Westminster. Sadly these voices are too often drowned out by the febrile claims of the Brexiters. A change of leadership in the Tory Party is unlikely to rescue us from the mess that we are in. Nor is a General Election, given the present polls, going to produce a strong government that commands a majority in the House. Given the real and present danger of political chaos, then surely there is now a strong case for political leadership that will act in the best interests of the country and form a National Government.Now that we know the frightening costs and consequences of leaving the EU, then hopefully one of the first decisions of such a government would be to go back to the people with a second referendum. Even more hopefully would be a decision to introduce proportional representation for future Westminster General Elections and to abolish the undemocratic, anachronistic House of Lords.Eric Melvin, Cluny Place, Edinburgh.NOW we know what the Conservative Brexiters meant when they said \"Brexit means Brexit\". They have assiduously worked to prevent the Prime Minister getting a deal that would benefit the country solely that they could take the opportunity to advance their own political careers: the real purpose of Brexit all along. Now, in the midst of a constitutional crisis that threatens the economic and social welfare of not only ourselves, but our children and grandchildren ndash as they themselves have constantly reminded us - they choose, with Brexit Day only weeks away, to plunge the country and the EU negotiations into turmoil. If I may paraphrase a famous Prime Minister, never in the history of this United Kingdom has there been such a bunch of self-seeking political chancers.These \"Honourable\" Members have shown their true colours and their total disregard for anything other than their own greed, and the public should treat them as the worthless egotists they have shown themselves to be, and consign them to the political wilderness.T J Dowds,q Fleming Road, Cumbernauld.SEVERAL of your correspondents todaysuggest sympathy for Theresa May would be appropriate.Have they forgotten that she was part of a government which imposed such brutal austerity on the poorest members of society that they were disposed to lash out at the Establishment in any way they could Have they forgotten that she fed the flames of that disaffection by introducing the xenophobic \"hostile environment\" policies while she was at the Home Office Have they forgotten her behaviour during the pre Brexit debate, when she made herself so invisible that she was known as \"Submarine May\" Mrs May deserves no ones sympathy. She is probably the most self-serving and leadership-obsessed politician I have witnessed in more than  years of political awareness.John Jamieson, Craigie Road, Ayr.I SAY to JS Morrisonthat a gerrymandered referendum has no place in a mature democracy, which most of us thought ours was until recently, and that he is in fact arguing that lies and financial misbehaviour do.Furthermore, the referendum, as I understand it, was advisory, Parliament and not the People being sovereign for good reason. The purpose of our representative democracy is to ldquoprovide a filter against mob rule, moods and errors . Elitist  No way. It stems from an understanding of how easily the voters can be manipulated by malign forces.John Milne, Ardgowan Drive, Uddingston.SO Lord Foulkes wishes to sort out the constitutional position of England . He seems to think sticking a few devolved assemblies in England will assuage the lack of a devolved parliament in that country, when many of us regard Westminster as very much Englandrsquos parliament. When Keir Hardie advocated Scotland having Dominion status, I doubt he would have settled for Holyrood, with its lack of authority, power and sovereignty. What will be the role of Westminster  What is the point of the Lords, evennew placemen replace old placemen  I can see no future in Lord Foulkess proposals. The UK is a lopsided, largely non-democratic, constitutional monstrosity, where we even have to pay to have a British state broadcaster . I think Northern Ireland will go to join the Republic fairly soonas the standard of living in the south overtakes that in the north. Scotland will either be first to leave or a close second, Brexit having opened our eyes to our true status within the UK.GR Weir, Mill Street, Ochiltree.ALEXANDER McKaywrites that the ldquoever-opportunistic SNP are ldquopolitical pygmies. Could I just remind him that at the  UK General Election the SNP won an incredible  Westminster seats out of .In all my  years, this result is by far and away the most astounding and resounding UK election achievement by any UK party. EvenI live another  years I donrsquot expect that this will ever be repeated.What is noticeable to me is that Unionists on both sides of the ldquotraditional political ide never miss any opportunity to denigrate this achievement.I am a socialist by nature and voted Labour in every election at all levels until I was well into my s, as did many working-class folk like me.However, even I can see that the SNPrsquos accomplishment in  reflects widespread deep-seated dissatisfaction in Scotland with the UK status quo. This will not dissipate easilyhellipespecially now.How someone can describe the SNP as pygmies is incomprehensible unless that someone has a vested interest in attempting to ignore what is clearly in front of them.Alan Middleton, Newton Place, Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-heads-to-brussels-for-brexit-talks-at-eu-summit","story":"The Prime Minister will address EU leaders at the

a day of drama in Westminster, she will travel to the Belgian capital still faced with the same dilemma she faced before it all took place: how to convince the EU to tweak the Withdrawal Agreement so that it will be passed by Parliament.Speaking in Downing Street moments after the result was announced, Mrs May acknowledged that a \"signicant\" number of her MPs had voted against her and said: \"I have listened to what they said.\"She pledged to seek \"legal and political assurances\" on the Brexit backstop to allay MPs concerns about her Withdrawal Agreement when she attends a European Council summit in Brussels on Thursday.And she said she and her administration had a \"renewed mission\", saying: \"Following this ballot, we now need to get on with the job of delivering Brexit for the British people and building a better future for this country.\":Hollow victory as Theresa May left weakened by Tory confidence ballotShe said this must involve \"politicians of all sides coming together and acting in the national interest\".But she had earlier sowed the seeds for her eventual departure by telling Tory MPs at a meeting of the backbench  committee that she would not lead the party into the next general election, expected in .According to MPs present at the meeting, she also promised to find a \"legally binding solution\" to ensuring that the UK does not get permanently trapped in a backstop arrangement to keep the Irish border open after Brexit.The scale of this task was highlighted by Irish premier Leo Varadkar and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, who insisted in a phone call as MPs voted that the UKs Withdrawal Agreement \"cannot be reopened or contradicted\".DUP leader Arlene Foster, who met Mrs May shortly before the ballot, insisted that \"tinkering around the edges\" of the agreement would not be enough to win her partys support for the deal.:Eurosceptic Tory MPs keep up calls for Theresa May to quitMrs Foster, whose  MPs prop up the minority Conservative administration, said she told the PM that \"we were not seeking assurances or promises, we wanted fundamental legal text changes\".Immediately after the vote result was announced by  chairman Sir Graham Brady, she faced calls to resign from Brexit-backing MPs including Jacob Rees-Mogg, who said that she had lost the confidence of more than one-third of her MPs and a majority of backbenchers.Mr Rees-Mogg told the Press Association Mrs May should resign \"as soon as the Queen has a moment in her diary to see her\".The hardline European Research Groupvowed to continue opposing Mrs Mays \"disastrous\" Brexit deal, with a spokesman warning: \"The parliamentary arithmetic remains unchanged.\"But other Brexiteers said they would end their efforts to unseat the Tory leader.Crispin Blunt said: \"The leadership question is now behind us for a year and we must get behind Theresa May in delivering Brexit.\"It was Mrs Mays decision to pull a vote on her deal in the face of what she acknowledged would have been a heavy defeat earlier this week which sparked a new wave of letters of no confidence from Tories, triggering the challenge to her position.Mrs Mays victory in the confidence vote means that another challenge cannot be mounted against her position as Tory leader for a year.But she still faces the danger of a no-confidence motion in the House of Commons, which could bring her Government downbacked by more than half of all MPs.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the \"dismal\" deal should be put before MPs next week.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell hinted that Labour could call the motion next weekMrs May does not get changes to the Withdrawal Agreement that it wants, telling ITVs Peston: \"We will just have to judge what she comes

It isn’t intended to be a ‘straight’ narrative as you usually see, but as in a fairy tale there are strange detours, unexplained events, outcomes out of all proportion to what caused them – a kind of rough and dangerous magic working beneath the surface.Aside from that, each page of the book was crafted to be as inidually beautul as I could make it. Every page took at least a few days to create, and some pages took weeks, even months.Where did the inspiration for this book come from There are so many ideas that have fed into The Boy with Nails for Eyes that it’s very hard to pin it down to a single moment of inspiration. When I was at school, I was struck by a painting done by a previous student. It was a very unnerving picture — a spectral, jagged figure with crude smears of black where the eyes should be.Many years later I saw the music video for the Tool song Sober. There was a brief glimpse of a mechanical figure with a metal mask for a face, with one eye missing and the other pierced by this huge swivelling nail. I thought of Norse mythology — Odin, sacricing one of his eyes in the well of Mimir to gain wisdom. That second image married with the memory of the painting from school that same evening, I painted the first picture of The Boy with Nails for Eyes. A few weeks later, the story began to slowly take shape.It’s changed beyond recognition over the years, taking on influences such as the War on Terror of the early s. I was born in Bahrain and was there during the Gulf War. We were all issued with gas masks by the American military, and I remember waking up one night to find the rest of my family in my room, my mum holding the masks, my dad stuffing a towel under the door. It turned out Iraq had launched a Scud — we were all terried of the thought of chemical weapons. I recognised that same feeling of paranoia in the days after September the th, and Bush’s declaration of the War on Terror. That feeling pervades the story.How did the crowdfunding for this book come about I had been shopping the comic around to agents and publishers for a long time. I found it to be a frustrating process. I tended to receive positive responses, which were still rejections. I was running out of options, and was wondering where I’d go nextI wasn’t able to place it with anyone. I received a boost when the book was long-listed for the Myriad First Graphic Novel competition earlier this year.I was speaking to an editor at Unbound, the publisher, about an entirely dferent project — an illustrated poem. Almost as an aside I mentioned that I had this other graphic novel whose first volume was finished and ready to go. I showed her the first couple of chapters and she fell in love with it . We decided to temporarily shelve the other project and proceed with this.What would it mean to you to see this book published It would be fantastic. I’ve been working on the project over  years, since my early twenties. It’s been a labour of love — for myself and my we Anna as well, who had major input into the work. I honestly had no thought of publishing it properly, it was just important to me to allow it to be exactly the story it needed to be. I basically taught myself digital art by working on it, and honed my drawing and writing skills through it. It sounds strange, but I’m as much its product as it is mine. Having it out there as a book, something physical that can be picked up and read, would make it real in a way that it isn’t yet, for all that I’m satisfied that the story is what it should be – or near as I can make it.To find our more about The Boy with Nails for Eyes and support Shaun#s project visit: www.unbound books nails-for-eyes copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It has been a gradual build-up over the years but I think the way the Highland Council has been dealing with issues has not helped and it has not helped any of you whatsoever.Mrs Manson promised a ldquolistening council when she took the reins from Steve Barron last month. That has included a y series of drop-ins across the sprawling Highland Council area inviting people to share what they feel the local authority does well and where therersquos room for improvement.The council faces a massive budget gap against a backdrop of simmering public discontent over areduction in services as belts are tightened.She said she was willing to look at all issues raised. She said: ldquoI need to think about how we structure staff in the council so that people feel there is an equal service out there.The planned introduction of parking charges to a town which boasts freely available space prompted warnings. Councillor Margaret Paterson said: ldquoI can tell you that the majority of people in Dingwall want you to stop imposing parking charges. And as a council you donrsquot care how the High Street will go down the plug hole because of it.Mrs Manson said she would consider the concerns raised during the drop-ins and would report back in January.What do YOU think  We welcome feedback.

This wee semi-detached cottage had no bathroom, no running hot water and no inside toilet so inevitably we loved it. Jeannie, our rotund grandmother, really was the stereotypical granny living in a house at the bottom of the woods and spoiled us within her limited means . My grandfather, also Jimmy, was an astonishingly good-looking man with crystal blue eyes he was a Stalinist for rather longer than was fashionable, and worked at Glenochil, the huge whisky bond, as a foreman, which to my unpractised eye meant he sat and read for a living: he was the only man I’ve ever known who took three novels to work. But he saved a man’s le in a terrible accident, being injured himself into a premature death – another, sadder, story as well.Anyway, Papa Jimmy used to take us for a walk in the woods on a fine day, thenus to the house for our lunch, which always included masses of butter, a substance somewhat rationed in our own home. Jimmy would retire to his chair and read the paper and chain smoke, ashing his fags into an ornate standing ashtray which was an object of great fascination to me and which I eventually inherited. On these walks, a bit like Uncle Pumblechook in ‘Great Expectations’, Papa Jimmy would ask us questions relating to our general knowledge – the times tables, dates in Scottish history, capital cities of the world. This once led to an argument – of quite heated proportions, because both these Jimmys were obstinate fellows – about the capital of Ceylon. Young Jimmy, probably about , knew it was Colombo old Jimmy, about , insisted it was Kandy. At eight, I did not feel well placed to intervene and contented myself with playing with bugs.: Cameron Wyllie: Face facts, some kids are smarter than othersGeneral knowledge was part of our lives then it was part of everyone’s. Twenty years later, in the s, as a young schoolteacher, I would always have a quiz book ready in my desk as an end-of-term treat: classes in teams, rounds of questions, sweeties as prizes. Even ‘less academically able’ boys – for this was a boys’ school – knew stuff, random facts about Russia or prime numbers or current affairs. Thirty years on, at the end of my career, I used to take great pleasure in the success of the school quiz teams indeed, we even granted our ‘quizzers’ the sacred right of ‘colours’ eventually, so the really successful ones went round the school with blazer badges saying ‘quiz’. No-one but me and other gnarled ancients thought this was remotely strange – that something as ordinary as general knowledge was in our youth had become a specialised extra-curricular activity – you did ‘quiz’ while others played the oboe or threw the discus.Does this matter  Clearly, the school curriculum has to move with the times and technology means that all of us can get away with knowing less stuff than we used to – when you don’t know somethingyou just Google it. Who is that actress  Who was that king  What, for God’s sake, is the capital of Ceylon, and why is it not called Ceylon anymore, and what can be done to stop brain cells oozing out my ears ...  I can’t be alone in suppressing a deeply rooted grumble when the nice girl in the shop reaches for a calculator to work out what  per cent of £ is, and then laboriously subtracts £. from £ etc etc. But, does it matter : Cameron Wyllie: Here’s how the snowflake generation can toughen upWell, it must a bit. If you don’t know that you need to know something, then you can’t Google it. Lots of information that was reasonably common currency simply isn’t there in the minds of young people and has been replaced by dferent skills, of which they have many. However,you are, for example, teaching a text that refers directly or indirectly to something  – the mention of Icarus in a poem by W H Auden, say, and the clever children in your Higher English class don’t have a scoobie who Icarus was, then they are, quite clearly, not able to understand the poem. Again, in the great scheme of things, this may not matter very much, but,we do not have things to connect, then E M Forster’s much-quoted dictum “only connect” cannot happen some intellectual breakthroughs just require two bits of factual knowledge to be laid side by side. All of this may just be a reaction to skills-based learning. Someone who did O-grade history in the s or s just would not recognise a National  paper today and I suspect that most history teachers would say that these changes are entirely right. I honestly think there is validity in both approaches, but I’m afraid I also have a little feeling in my tummy that says that knowing more things is one of the proofs that you are grown up.

This appears to be associated with the Scottish Fiscal Commission having revised down Scottish income tax take by a considerable sum. As a result, and despite the finance secretary foregoing any increase in the higher tax threshold, Scottish income tax revenue fell, when it should have increased given the policy choice. This is a big worry for future budgets. However, we will have to wait to understand this better as the finance secretary did not refer to it in his speech and it was barely brought up in the debate that followed.Despite the talk of a good deal for local government, the general resource grantfell, in cash terms, by almost £ million. However, the finance secretary was helped \u2028out by a big rise in \u2028non domestic rates incomethat supports local government spending. It seems clear that the Scottish Government take these two sources together in determining a settlement in this area, rather than NDRI being seen as an autonomous funding source for local government. Further gains were seen in specic resource grants but this may be of limited use in terms of funding the core public services provided by local government.Despite all the talk of extra NHS funding, only just over half of the health budget’s £ million increase actually ends up with the NHS. Instead, it was other, non-NHS, areas of health spending that benefitted the most , including primary care services and support for social care. What the overall plan, for NHS spending in particular and health spending in general, is remains as clear as mud.One area that has done well is investmentwhich rises by  per cent in real terms in -.So is there a plan, cunning or otherwise, behind all this  If there is it’s dficult to discern it. The SFC’s contributions, and the associated increased Scottish revenue powers, are making for increasingly dficult budget decisions. The degree to which higher taxes in Scotland are feeding through to higher spending is questionable, versus what would otherwise have been available using the old system. The finance secretary may have been able to disguise this on the day of the budget but it is likely to increasingly unravel as time goes on.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

What we haven’t heard is what exactly it will mean for Shetland.”But clarity remained out of reach over the next two and a half hours with a pivotal vote in the House of Commons scheduled for Tuesday.Presenting a view from Westminster Mr Carmichael said: “Every time you think we’ve got to peak madness in the House of Commons something  happens.”He added that Tuesday will likely to be on “another level” and said that he hesitates to “predict anything beyond the next hour at the moment”.Miss Budge said that farmers were particularly worried about the future of subsidy payments in the aftermath of leaving the EU.“The big concern is where the Scottish government or UK government will find that kind of money to put into farming.”The tourism industry was most concerned about maintaining visa free travel for citizens of the EU, said Mr Mathieson, while Mrs Hambleton said that businesses had to scenario plan in order to offset any potential negative side effects from Britain’s departure. which had highlighted government analysis which warned of potential delays of up to six months for pharmaceuticals.“Project fear is now project reality”, he said.Unsurprisingly, the biggest optimism came from Mr Collins, who viewed Brexit as an opportunity for fishermen. He noted that British fishermen caught less than half of fish in UK waters, compared with Norway catching around  per cent in theirs.He later criticised the EU as undemocratic but said he was a committed European and that he and his partner had four EU passports between them. His ideal scenario would involve dismantling the EU and for the project to be rebuilt with more accountability and less bureaucracy.Indeed the EU came in for criticism throughout the night. Mr Carmichael said that his view was not “massively dferent” from that of Mr Collins. But where the fishermen’s chief was keen to depart Mr Carmichael favoured remaining and reforming.A straw poll at the close of proceedings found an overwhelming support for this view. One person favoured Theresa May’s deal, two opted for leaving with no deal and  said their preference was to stay in the bloc.Isn#t the whole idea of Brexit, to do with the Conservatives wanting a trade deal with the USA, without the interference of the EU This will also, I think, be the beginning of the mass privatization of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to USA companies, where the Conservatives will benefit from such a deal  .The impact on Shetland, I fear, will be very damaging indeed, as economic circumstances will mean a vast reduction of Local Authority spending. This will also force the SIC to do huge cuts in budgets and very much streamline and prioritize what money goes where.This will force many other companies and people owning their own business to either reduce the workforce or shut up shop The general outlook does not look favourable for Shetland in the long term.I sincerely hope my outlook is proven wrong  finally Mr Carmichael should know that the only reform of the eu that they will be doing is ever closer integration. Starting with what his former leader called a DANGEROUS FANTASY dreamed up by brexiteers, an EU ARMY. Well that DANGEROUS FANTASY has been seen to be a DANGEROUS REALITY since the referendum with EU armoured personel carriers on the streets of Paris battling french protestors.Is this DANGEROUS REALITY stuff for real Someone may have been listening to Trump and Farage#s comments on the EU army without turning on their b.s. filter.Why shouldn#t EU nations cooperate in defence matters  Is Ali saying NATO is a bad thing Since  it has become politically correct for democratic European neighbours to cooperate. Why not get over it What is this DANGEROUS REALITY Ali fears  Does he imagine the purpose of a EU army would be to attack domestic protesters across frontiers like the Soviet army did in Hungary in   Does he see the EU as a fascist entity that must be stopped  Before you know it he will be advocating the citizen#s right to bear arms so as to protect itself against the government like they do in the good old US of A. Just how whacky is his DANGEROUS REALTY No one gets to choose their nationality Ali, just how we feel about it. There is nothing natural or God-given in being Scottish, British, German or European.

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh # she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too.

The case has been raised with local MSP Alasdair Allan.He said: #I have met with Eilidh and her family. I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints. A spokesman said they were #unable to comment on inidual cases#.#As a general principle,# the spokesman added, #we are committed to supporting people with complex needs in their own communities but for a small number of people there are circumstances in which outcomes will improvethey are supported in specialist centres of excellence on the mainland. This is not a matter of a lack of financial resources but rather not having the required levels of specialist care and expertise.#Whilst this is the case for many areas across Scotland it is clearly more acute in an island setting because it involves those requiring such care to live away from home for perhaps extended periods of time. It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27497  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinSinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit. - Mary Lou McDonald TDAmid all the chaos in Westminster, there are few certainties as to where the Brexit circus will stumble to next.Brexit began as a squabble between the rich and right wing boys of the Tory party. Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh. Two other posts - at Clady and Strabane in Co Tyrone - were also to have been demolished that night but the bombs to be used exploded prematurely, killing three Volunteers at Stranamuck, near Castlefin, Co Donegal.Comdt John James Kelly and Staff Capt James Joseph Reynolds were killed instantly and Comdt Charles McCafferty died a few days later in Lford Hospital.The three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof. The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady. He took part in many operations during the Tan War and was arrested and imprisoned in England.

In  he was arrested and sentenced to six months in Derry Prison for possession of firearms. He worked as a barge loader on the Strabane-Derry Canal and he was known as a quiet man with an abiding interest in the history and folklore of his area.Jimmy Joe Reynolds was from Leitrim. He was the OC in that county and had been for a time OC of Britain. He had been sent to Donegal as the representative of the IRAs General Headquarters Staff and it was he who transported the bombs - three in all - to Stranamuck.Jimmy Joe had been active in the IRA for many years. In  he was charged along with six other men, including his twin brother, John Joseph, with the assassination of a rack-renting landlord, More OFarrell, at Edgeworthstown, Co Longford. After two trials the case was dismissed and there were bonfires for fty miles around to celebrate their escape from the Free State hangman.All three Volunteers received huge funerals with full IRA honours.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland. We are simply collateral damage,\" he said. The South Down MP also said these and other public statements from Tory MPs highlight the importance of the backstop. \"It is our only insurance policy against a hard border in Ireland and comments such as Priti Patel’s will only serve to reinforce the determination of those of us who are saying that the backstop is the bottom line.

We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8737398.1544617405!/image/image.jpg","title":"ian paisley luxury maldives holiday paid for by mystery friend","story":"The trip, which the DUP MP said he partially paid for, was part-funded by a mystery friend who Mr Paisley declined to identy.Ian Paisley, M.P.The holiday for the entire Paisley family was not registered in the House of Commons register of membersrsquo interests.The revelations in a BBC Spotlight programme broadcast on Tuesday night come just a fortnight after the North Antrim MP ed from the longest ever suspension from the House of Commons.That suspension of  sitting days came after it was revealed that he took luxury holidays from the Sri Lankan government and then advocated on behalf of a regime which was facing allegations of war crimes.Mr Paisley told Spotlight that he did not need to declare the foreign holiday and that the trip had not been paid for by the Malian government.The MP, his we and his two sons stayed full-board for five days in October and November  at a luxury resort on one of the coral islands in the Indian Ocean famed for sandy beaches and blue lagoons.Gavin Millar QC, a legal expert on parliamentary rules, told Spotlight that the Nolan principles on standards in public le placed an onus on Mr Paisley to be transparent about why he has not registered the trip.ldquoFor the record, the government of the Males did not organise or pay for my family vacation in , which I do not intend to go into with you.

My sacrice and dedication went to motorcycling and I’m very proud to be a Doctor of Letters because of that.“It’s a lelong sacrice. Since I was six-years-old I’ve travelled theand breadth of the UK racing. The injuries I’ve faced, the ups and downs, to actually win a world championship on top of all that is massive.“It’s nice that my family can see there was an endgame after all their sacrice in the beginning.Jonathan Rea shows off his new threads“It’s a very proud day for the whole family. Especially my two little boys , they realise that it’s not normal to be at an event like this. They know the ious race tracks inside out but this is dferent. I hope I can be a good role model for them.”The -year-old said it was the first time he had ever attended a graduation, adding: “I never imagined the first one would be my own.”Asked about his graduate attire for the ceremony, he said: “Of course I feel a lot more comfortable in leathers and a helmet but it’s really nice to be acknowledged outside the sport. It’s something that’s happening more and more recently.”The honorary degree follows the  award of an MBE on the New Year’s Honours list.

I went travelling the world racing bikes.“After I left school I went to technical college and got an HNC in manufacturing engineering and then went on to work as an engineer.“It was hard to hold down a job as I was taking too much time off work to go racing.“I had what was nearly a career-ending injury. That was a dark time in my le because I didn’t know what was coming, I’d no great qualications behind me, I was working a minimum wage job. I wasn’t in a great state of mind.“I threw myself at bikes for a few years and then it worked out, my big break came.”He added: “Northern Ireland fans are very important to me. The travelling support has been immense these last few years. It just keeps getting bigger and bigger.“On my sighting laps and slow down laps I can see the Northern Ireland fans. I always try to throw out a leg to acknowledge I’ve seen them.”Rea is often claimed by both Larne and Ballyclare and sometimes referred to as a son of Ballymena.

There is no mitigation payment for that crossover period because the Assembly collapsed before they could pass the legislation.”Started in , the local food bank drive resulted in a record number of people receiving hampers last Christmas, with a total of  hampers delivered to iniduals and families in need.Once again, Sinead is appealing for long-le food products, fresh fruit and vegetables, dairy products and festive toys and gts amongst the vital donations for this year’s appeal.“We want to build on last year’s successful food bank drive success which resulted in  Christmas hampers delivered to those in need.“This year we expect the demand to be much higher and we will continue to work with our partners in St Vincent de Paul, St Patrick’s Soup Kitchen, Haven Outreach and Oasis Food Bank on the Shankill to meet demand.“We want to maximise resources to support a bigger group of people. Food is always the priority – it frees up other money for them to pay bills and spend a few pounds at Christmas time.“Christmas hampers are vital so that local families get through the festive period. There are extra costs because more people are off and stay at home which means extra heating bills.“This year has been so tough for everyone, especially low-paid workers, those on benefits and those affected by universal credit.“It has been really bad.Unfortunately, it is a sign of the times that food banks will become the norm for so many people.“Universal Credit is so cruel and will continue to roll out to so many more people. Soup kitchens and homeless charities are a leline for people. It is a helping hand for people.“I would appeal to local people to once again support this year’s food bank appeal- people in North Belfast are so generous when it comes to donating at Christmas.”Items can be donated to this year’s Food Bank appeal by bringing them to the Wolfhill Centre in Ligoniel, or they can be dropped into a number of other community centres including Ardoyne Association , Ashton Centre , Tar Isteach , Vine Centreand Ballysillan Community Forum ."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"leading economist to give talk on brexit and a united ireland","story":"LEADING economist David McWilliams will be speaking at a Féile an Phobail event tomorrow on Brexit and its implications for the ending of partition.

While the band’s line-up has inevitably changed over the years, brothers George and Eddie Furey have continued to tour the globe, bringing the finest ballads to generations old and new.To celebrate their th anniversary they have released a new album, ‘The Fureys  Years On… to be continued’, and will play a headline gig at Belfast’s Waterfront this January.Ahead of the gig, the Andersonstown News met with George and Eddie, who had just ed from the Netherlands leg of their jubilee tour. While their music has touched thousands,not millions of people, George and Eddie are a pair without air and graces. Our chat was an informal one that took place in the Waterfront Hall’s lobby, with school kids, excited by their trip to the panto, providing an excitable background hum. As for the story of The Fureys – it’s one of famous faces, infamous sessions, and more years worth of craic than can be adequately depicted in a single newspaper article. However, with the release of their new album – which foregoes many of the obvious tracks and is jammed full of new material – our conversation almost immediately turned to things more current.“A lot of the songs we would’ve heard as kids and would’ve grown up singing them,” Eddie explained.“Streets of London is one of them, which was written by Ralph McTell, and we know Ralph going back many, many years.”George added: “The first track on the album was written by a Donegal man, Jordy Gallagher, and he wrote the song about eight years ago. “Joe, our manager knows him very well and he gave our manager the song to have a listen to because he thought it might suit on the album because it’s a protest song. A lot of those songs from years ago are all protest songs, from the s.“We grew up with all these protest years ago. There was a great song years ago called The Eve of Destruction, and it’s about what would happen to ussomeone dropped the big bomb – we grew up with those songs. So this song really suits the album.”“The Day’s Gonna come is a great song,” Eddie concurred. “The song tells you what’s happening to the world and those older songs tell you what was happening at that time. The words are ‘the day is gonna come when the water runs out and the wells run try, man’s so dumb, fish can’t swim and birds can’t fly’.”He continued: “There’s also peace songs, love songs, and drinking songs. “We’ve sang an awful lot of love songs over the years too. Songs that our mother used to sing and our father used to sing, Sweet Sixteen and that sort of stuff.”Although it’s an anniversary album, the new CD is new territory for The Fureys, who had not previously recorded much of its material. But much like their previous albums, The Fureys have continued to record songs from some of world’s best songwriters.“The songs are mostly from people we’ve met over the years on our tours,” Eddie said.“We’ve sang a lot of great ballads over the years.“We even recorded an album of Charlie Chaplin songs. Josie, Charlie Chaplin’s second youngest daughter, was cleaning out her father’s house and she found five songs that were never recorded before, written by Charlie Chaplin, and she asked uswe would do the songs. We had to do them, and we had to do them with an orchestra. We had a -piece orchestra in the studio with us recording these great songs.”George added: “We do a mix of stuff – not just Irish songs. If you listen to some of the bands now they’re going back on the old stuff. To me, you can’t beat the real thing.”Unlike some older musicians and music fans, The Fureys are not consumed with thoughts of past ‘glory days’. On the contrary, George admits that music is “probably more versatile now”. Instead the past only serves to make their current concerts more fulfilling as they bring together people who have followed them through the generations.“A lot of the kids that come to see us now, their grandparents or parents would’ve come to our concerts and bought our albums,” George said. “Now we have kids coming to concerts with their grandma and grandpa.”Eddie noted: “People grew up with our stuff and they love to see it live.”The Fureys have united generations and their music has been played everywhere from their hometown in Dublin to the International Space Station – where astronaut Chris Hadfield famously played their track ‘Steal Away’ – but of all other places outside of their hometown, it’s in Belfast where they feel most at home.“We’ve been up here so many times it’s like our second home,” George insisted.“We used to play in the Ulster Hall before this was built. We used to bring the wives up to do the Christmas shopping, because it was cheaper up here. Then we’d smuggle it across the border. If you got caught at customs they’d take it off you – drink and everything – party time. We had some parties like.”He continued: “This is our tenth gig here, which I never knew until this morning. It was only opened up when we first played here. They know what to expect – people are used to coming to see us. They always ask for some of the old songs, and we have to do them. People will ask for some dferent songs too, and we can do them no problem.”Eddie added: “We’ll be singing some songs off the new album too. You have to add them in here and there. If a request comes up for an old song we like to keep people happy.”The Furey’s play at the Waterfront Hall on January , .

The WA would undermine the economic  constitutional integrity of the UK. There are alternatives.\"London, Dublin  Brussels have all ruled out a hard border in any circumstance. Backstop is not needed.\"Included in the document is a proposal for a new protocol on Ireland Northern Ireland to replace the backstop.The document states that \"nothing in the New Protocol on Ireland Northern Ireland shall imply the creation, existence or maintenance of a single customs territory between the European Union and the United Kingdom\".The protocol would be in place from the end of the transition period at the end of no alternative arrangements are in place to guarantee the absence of a hard border.The paper retains many elements of Mrs Mays package but removes what they referred to as \"poison pills\" which prevented her securing cross-party support. Backers of the new approach said that Parliament had effectively rejected the deal by making it impossible for Mrs May to get it through the Commons.The document, drawn up by a former adviser to Liam Fox, Shanker Singham, customs expert Hans Maessen and lawyer Robert MacLean, proposed: • No single customs territory between the UK and the EU, allowing Britain to regain control over tarfs and regulations and negotiate trade agreements with other countries • A -year, extendible backstop featuring advanced customs facilitation measures to keep the Irish border open, a zero-tarf free trade agreement in goods and a commitment by all parties not to place infrastructure on the border • Mutual recognition of regulations, with measures to ensure that the animal health and disease control zone on the island of Ireland can be maintained • Level playing field provisions on labour, the environment, competition and state aid • The removal of geographic indications provisions from the withdrawal agreement, to be considered as part of a later free trade deal • The removal of language on World Trade Organisation collaboration, ensuring that the UK can operate independently in the WTO. Launching the paper, former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab said: \"There are modest and reasonable changes that could help salvage the proposed deal with the EU.\"The UK needs a unilateral exit mechanism from the backstop, but we can give the Irish Government assurances that we would put in place specic measures to guarantee noto a hard border.\"This proposal can help deliver this and allay fears that the UK would be stuck indefinitely in an undemocratic regime of laws we have no control over and cant exit.\" Also backing the paper was Mr Raabs predecessor as Brexit secretary David Davis. Labour MP David Lammy added: \"The alternative plan of two failed Brexit secretaries is not a solution but a recipe for disaster.\"Not only would it create a hard border in Ireland, it would cut the UK off from our closest partners and make the whole country poorer, disproportionately hurting the worst off. \"As we stand, there is no clear majority in this House for any specic Brexit plan. \"The way to unblock our politics and get a mandate for a tangible plan to move forward is through a peoples vote, which gives the option to remain in the EU.\""},{"url":null,"title":"defiant may vows to get on with job and deliver brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Jon Tonge: Tory no confidence vote solved nothing - just a spectator sport for the DUP Suzanne Breen: May still needs DUP support but while Brexit backstop remains she won’t have it She immediately faced calls to resign from Brexit-backing MPs including Jacob Rees-Mogg, who said that she had lost the confidence of more than one-third of her MPs and a majority of backbenchers.Speaking in Downing Street moments after the result was announced, Mrs May acknowledged that a \"signicant\" number of her MPs had voted against her and said: \"I have listened to what they said.\"She pledged to seek \"legal and political assurances\" on the Brexit backstop to allay MPs concerns about her withdrawal agreement when she attends a European Council summit in Brussels today.Last night the BBC reported that EU leaders are considering making a commitment to continue negotiating a trade deal with the UK eventhe Irish backstop comes into force.It was reported that the move aims to reassure the House of Commons that the backstop will be a temporary measure - although it would not be legally binding.It is believed this would be the start of a two-stage reassurance process starting immediately, with officials working on more drafts to be published in January.Mrs May also said she and her administration had a \"renewed mission\", adding: \"Following this ballot, we now need to get on with the job of delivering Brexit for the British people and building a better future for this country.\"But Mr Rees-Mogg said Mrs May should resign \"as soon as the Queen has a moment in her diary to see her\".The chairman of the European Research Group of Tory eurosceptics told the BBC: \"Its a terrible result for the Prime Minister.\"With the \"payroll vote\" of ministers, parliamentary aides and trade envoys all likely to have backed Mrs May, a majority of the remaining - backbenchers voted no confidence in her, he said.But other Brexiteers said they would end their efforts to unseat Mrs May.Nadine Dorries said: \"The PM has secured the confidence of the Parliamentary party tonight. Its not the way I voted, however I will fully respect the result.\"It was Mrs Mays decision to pull a vote on her deal in the face of what she acknowledged would have been a heavy defeat earlier this week which sparked a new wave of letters of no-confidence from Tories, triggering the challenge to her position.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said that the \"dismal\" deal should be put before MPs next week.\"The Prime Minister has lost her majority in Parliament, her Government is in chaos and she is unable to deliver a Brexit deal that works for the country and puts jobs and the economy first,\" Mr Corbyn said.\"Its clear that she has not been able to negotiate the necessary changes in Europe.\"She must now bring her dismal deal back to the House of Commons next week so Parliament can take back control.\"Labour MPs described Mrs May as a \"lame duck\" due to her decision to pre-announce her departure.Mrs May said after the result: \"While delivering Brexit is important, we also need to focus on the other issues that people feel are vital to them and matter to them today. The issues that we came into politics to deal with, building a stronger economy, delivering first-class public services, building the homes that families need.\"We owe it to the people who put us here to put their priorities first. So here is our renewed mission: delivering the Brexit that people voted for, bringing the country back together and building a country that truly works for everyone.\"Mrs Mays victory in the vote means that another challenge cannot be mounted against her position as Tory leader for a year.But she still faces the danger of a no-confidence motion in the Commons, which could bring her Government downbacked by more than half of all MPs.Addressing MPs at a meeting of the  Committee moments before the crucial vote, Mrs May said she accepted she could not fight the next election as leader.Solicitor general Robert Buckland told reporters: \"She said, In my heart I would like to lead the party into the next election and then that was the introductory phrase to her indication that she would accept the fact that would not happen, that is not her intention.\"And, according to MPs at the meeting, she also promised to find a \"legally-binding solution\" to ensure that the UK does not get permanently trapped in a backstop arrangement."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37610293.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/graph.jpg","title":"survey reveals 65 in northern ireland would now vote remain and 60 think united ireland more likely","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We wanted fundamental legal text changes.\"We have been consistent, which is why it is so frustrating that our warnings about the backstop have not been heeded.\"The DUP wants a sensible deal which our MPs can support in the House.

The country will now go to the polls in early .Criticising the performance of the government, Mr Martin said his party had reached the decision reluctantly, but he said it was “unavoidable” given the concerns posed by Brexit.He said business as usual in the Dail parliament was “not acceptable” in the circumstances and there was a need to put the “national interest ahead of party interests”.“Fianna Fail is determined that the political chaos we see in London will not be allowed to spread to Ireland,” he said.“We simply do not believe that the national interest could in any way be served by taking up to four months during next year to schedule and hold an election campaign and then form a government.“With business and communities already fearful about the impact of Brexit and with Ireland manestly not ready for many of the potential outcomes, how could it possibly be in the national interest to have extended political uncertainty next year “This is why Fianna Fail will extend a guarantee that government will be able to operate throughout .“This will allow the introduction of any emergency legislation and budgets, as well as the full end of year Budget and associated legislation. “This will in turn allow the holding of an election early in the following year.”Mr Coveney said the timing of the announcement was important.“At a time when there is clearly a lot of uncertainty about Brexit and the British political system, the Irish political system has responded in the way that it should, to work together to ensure that we will have certainty for at least another year and probably more, to ensure that we can prepare the country for whatever may unfold in the context of our closest neighbour leaving the European Union at the end of March,” he said.Mr Coveney said the move allowed the government to plan in the “medium term” on Brexit and other domestic concerns.“From our perspective this is good news,” he said.“I want to thank Fianna Fail for the maturity of the decision that has been made today.“It is not easy for a large political party in opposition to essentially facilitate government and extend that facilitation beyond what was agreed a few years ago but I think Fianna Fail have recognised that it is in the interests of the country to provide the kind of certainty in Irish politics that is needed.“At a time when we have a minority government here, I think we are showing that the Irish political system responds when the country needs that to happen and I want to thank Micheal Martin for his leadership and Fianna Fail for facilitating the confirmation of that extension that we expect will go well into .”Addressing the Dail, Mr Martin criticised the performance of Mr Varadkar’s administration, particularly in the areas of housing, health and tax policy.“This decision has been reached reluctantly but it is unavoidable,” he added.Mr Martin said one of his party’s key priorities was ensuring the country was prepared for a no-deal Brexit: “Of course we cannot guarantee that the government will not undermine itself and stumble out of office, but it is receiving a guarantee of stability unprecedented for a minority government in its situation.”“If we could have a new government in days then we would be able to act dferently. “But it will take a process of months and Ireland doesn’t have months which it can waste on putting politics before the people’s interests.”Mr Martin said he would be meeting representative from fellow EU countries on Thursday.“I will be telling them that Ireland will be a stable and reliable partner for them in the months ahead,” he said.“The contagion of political chaos will not spread here from London. “There is a clear majority in Dail Eireann which will ensure stability and the national interest will be put first.”"},{"url":null,"title":"james nesbitts plan for luxury home rejected by northern ireland council","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

The latest battery-only cars need just five minutes at the quickest chargepoints to add  miles to their range, compared with an hour for almost all plug-in hybrids to achieve the same benefit.

I didn’t wear them until about  years later. I was working in a dentist’s office at the time. I had a patient reclined inches from my crotch when - suddenly! - it began.— Marie Christmas 🏳️‍🌈December , Of course the pants went off at work, playing The Troggs’ s hit Wild Thing right next to a patient’s head.🎶 Wild thing, you make my heart singYou make everything groovy, wild thingWild thing, I think I love you🎶This played from my crotch. Inches from my patient’s head. I had zero idea they were musical.— Marie Christmas 🏳️‍🌈December , I knew immediately that it was my panties, as the song that was blaring from my vagina was written on my panties. I told the dentist and patient it was a ringtone and apologized profusely. It played any time I bent sideways and hit the little sound button.— Marie Christmas 🏳️‍🌈December , Unfortunately the hastily imagined excuse didn’t seem to go down well at the time.I could tell the patient, whose head was practically in my lap, sensed it wasn’t a ringtone. My dentist told me I had to turn it off. I excused myself and went to the bathroom. I removed my panties and spent the rest of the day going commando under my scrubs.— Marie Christmas 🏳️‍🌈December , Only time I ever got less than an hour out of a pair of panties that wasn’t related to some sort of bodily fluids incident. Honestly, bodily fluids might’ve been less embarrassing than my vagina serenading a random stranger during a dental cleaning.— Marie Christmas 🏳️‍🌈December , Anyways, I’ve told this story routinely to my friends the last  years or so and I figured it was time I told it on twitter because, well, I’m Lisa from Twitter and I’m here to laugh at myself so no one  gets there first.— Marie Christmas 🏳️‍🌈December , Adam, we broke up ages before this incident occurred but I hope you’ve never given another woman musical panties because, dude, that’s the worst gt ever.

They have been waiting years to feel the kick of the rocket’s ignition, a near-vertical high-speed ascent into the blackness of space and several minutes of weightlessness with a view of the Earth far below.The spaceship is not launched from the ground but is carried beneath a special plane to an altitude near ,feet. It then detaches from the plane, ignites its rocket engine and climbs. The rocket is shut down and the craft coasts to the top of its climb — and then begins a descent slowed and stabilised by unique “feathering” technology. The twin tails temporarily rotate upward to increase drag, thento a normal flying configuration before the craft glides to a landing on a runway.The project began in  when Sir Richard announced the founding of Virgin Galactic in the days after the flights of SpaceShipOne, the first privately financed manned spacecraft that made three flights into space.

To work so hard to organise this event and support fellow kidney patients is magnicent.ldquoAll their hard work and attention to detail certainly paid off and it was wonderful to be with them on the day to help out and see this couples infectious enthusiasm in action.ldquoOn behalf of Kidney Care UK I thank them for their hard work and efforts to rally so many people to support a cause which touches the lives of so many.Thanking Stephen and Christine on behalf of Northern Ireland Kidney Patients Association, William Johnston said: ldquoIt was lovely to get the chance to join with Stephen and Christine in the beautul setting of Castle Ward and to see their enthusiasm for supporting our cause and delivering and Organ Donation message of hope.ldquoI want to say a special word of thanks to them for really pulling out the stops to put together an amazing event to help local kidney patients and their families..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Campaign to clamp down on dog fouling  ","story":"LOCAL council officials have unveiled a new campaign aimed at helping rid the district of its dog fouling problem.It is a particularly contentious issue and one of the single most complained about problems in the area and, despite valiant efforts over recent years by council officials and others, the issue has not been adequately addressed and there is virtually no town or village not affected by it.This week, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has launched a new awareness campaign to remind dog owners about the importance of cleaning up after their dogs.Rolled out after a survey by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul found that levels of dog fouling had increased from the previous year, the local authority is determined to get a grip on the issue.One of the biggest problems the local authority has to tackle is the hardcore of dog owners who point blankly refuse to clean up after their pets.While the mindset of these particular iniduals is hard to fathom and it is concerning that they are prepared to turn a blind eye to potentially harming children who come into contact with the mess their animals leave behind, council officials hope the new campaign can change minds.Dog owners are being reminded that it is their responsibility to clean up after their dogs and that not doing so is leaving them open to an pound fine.In addition, dog owners are reminded that they are responsible for training their dogs properly to lsquodo their businessrsquo in their ownerrsquos garden where it can then be collected and placed in a black bin.Politicians have become increasingly frustrated at the blatant disregard some dog owners and ratepayers are displaying and are keen to finally address the dog fouling issue.There are a number of notable dog fouling hot spots across the district and council officials are prepared to do all they can to tackle the problem. Politicians are also conscious that dog fouling is a problem which does nothing to enhance the districtrsquos image.The new campaign is reminding dog owners that they should never allow their pets to foul on the street and that when out in public to carry a bag with them so they can collect dog dirt and dispose of it properly.Council chairman Mark Murnin said all councillors were unanimous in their support for the new awareness campaign.ldquoWe intend to monitor and extend this initiative over the coming months, he explained. Dog fouling is a serious matter and we need to remind dog owners that not only is it unacceptable, but also can potentially cause disease.ldquoIt is important that we develop and promote a culture of responsible dog ownership and are asking all dog owners to help us keep the parks and open spaces in the Newry, Mourne and Down area clean and welcoming for all users.As part of the new campaign, notices about dog fouling will be displayed prominently across the district to ensure that the local authorityrsquos message to pet owners is clear to all..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Classy Campbell seals victory  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH secured an excellent away win on the articial surface at Old Wesley as a strong second half performance was enough to get them over the line in a match strewn with penalties.lsquoHinch lost Rory Butler, James Simpson, Stuart Morrow to injury during the extremely physical encounter with Banbridge and, coupled with the unavailability of Johnny McPhillips, their midfield had to be rejigged completely with Callum McLaughlin and Robin Harte starting in the centre, outside fly half Hilton Gibbons.Tom Martin came in at lock to replace Simpson and the pack was bolstered by Tommy OrsquoHagan, who made his debut at tight head prop.

In recognition of the le-saving work, his employers named the air ambulance as its nominated recipient at the annual charity breakfast.March  began like any other for Damien but took a dramatic turn when he started his sht. His right arm became trapped above the elbow while working with heavy machinery, with the alarm quickly raised by one of his colleagues.Helicopter Emergency Medical Servicesparamedic Mike Patton was on duty when the call came through and quickly tasked the air ambulance to the accident with the crew joined at Carryduff business by the Fire and Rescue Service and Ambulance Service paramedics.Even though the builders yard was clear of obstacles, the landing proved challenging for the air ambulance due to the signicant amount of dust which was created as the helicopter came into land.Fire and Rescue Service personnel worked to release Damienrsquos arm from the machinery and were assisted by one of his colleagues who was also a former part-time firefighter and played an important supporting role during the incident.Throughout the entire ordeal, Damien remained conscious and remembers every moment right up until he was sedated mdash he believes his ldquomind blocked out the trauma.Once anaesthetised by a doctor, Damien was transferred to the Royal Victoria Hospital by road ambulance, accompanied by the HEMS team, where he then underwent crucial surgery tometal plates into his arm.Damienrsquos road to recovery has been long, undergoing a further operation, overcoming two incidences of MRSA which required surgery, and a requirement for a Picc line to allow for regular antibiotic treatments by a team of dedicated rapid response nurses who called daily at his home over a period of  weeks.He is also likely to require further surgery. However, thanks to the initial care of the HEMS team, the work of the Belfast Trust and follow-up surgery, Damienrsquos arm has been saved.ldquoIt has been a long journey to recovery so far, but I have been making great progress and exceeding the expectations of my medical team, Damien confirmed.ldquoEvery week there is further improvement and we are now hopeful that I will gain % mobility in my arm. I owe so much to the air ambulance HEMS team, the Ambulance Service and Royal Victoria Hospital for my initial care and treatment.Damien has also thanked staff at the Ulster Hospital and in particular Mr Harry Lewis, consultant plastic surgeon and consultant orthopaedic surgeon, Miss Denise Shirley.He continued: ldquoI firmly believe that it was their hard work and skill that has meant my story has had a more positive outcome.ldquoSince my arm has been saved I have been able toto work which is great as it was driving me mad sitting at home. The goal I am working towards now is to get as much usage back in my arm as I physically can.Damien said the air ambulance costs pound, per day to run so every penny really does go a long way to making sure this vital service can continue.He added: ldquoI was delighted when Carryduff Building Supplies nominated the Air Ambulance to benefit from its annual fundraising breakfast. Being able to raise pound, on the day was a phenomenal achievement and is the highest amount that has ever been raised at this event. We were thrilled to be able to present this to the charity.Shirley Gilliland, who owns the Carryduff firm along with her husband John added: ldquoDamien has been part of the company for over four years and as a close team we were all gutted when the accident happened.ldquoThe speed of the response of the air ambulance and the critical interventions at the scene have clearly made a dference in Damienrsquos recovery. Wersquore so grateful to have him back on the team and doing well.ldquoWhilst you take every precaution accidents can happen and we are now very much aware of the role that the air ambulance has to play in the local community, including the impact for industry related accidents.ldquoI would urge other companies to do what they can to support the service whether that is by corporate donation or fundraising..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Great grandmother’s pens new children’s novel  ","story":"A CLOUGH woman has just published her third childrenrsquos book in a series cleverly written to capture the imagination of young readers.Eighty six year-old Maureen Donnellyrsquoa book, Five Famous Dogs of Ireland, which is illustrated by Ulster artist Susan Hughes, looks at the wealth of legends and rich folklore which has almost been forgotten today.Mrs Donnelly, whose late husband, the Rev James Donnelly, was rector of Saul and Inch Parish Churches, says she got her inspiration from a picture of her great grandson, one year-old Rory Donnelly, holding on to a fluffy teddy bear in one hand and patting the familyrsquos pet dog with the other.She said: ldquoIt struck me when I saw the photo how well children and animals get along.

His wolfhound was called Bawn and was known to be the best jumping dog in all of Ireland and could scare off the meanest of enemies.Mrs Donnelly said: ldquoI had the privilege to grow up with stories such as Bran. I loved the story so much I wrote it down back then. And Irsquom really glad I did. I came to write all the ones I could recall back then too. These tales will be sure to ignite again the imaginations of every child who reads them.No book would be complete without the tale of Setanta, the young boy who grew up to be a brave warrior. He was renowned for tackling a fierce hound with his bare hands. But feeling so bad after killing the hound, he asked the dogrsquos owner for a pup and promised he would train him up to be as good as his father.Setanta became known from that day on as Cu Chulainn mdash the Hound of Cullen.Mrs Donnelly has been instrumental in setting up a number of historical societies around Co Down.She adds: ldquoThe books are aids to help parents hand down our wealth of Irish folklore and the great legends of Ulster to another generation. So much of our heritage and culture is being lost on our young generation.ldquoThis series of books is a way for me to rescue those stories.

He doesnrsquot hog the limelight ndash in fact quite the opposite. He stays away from it. His hero status is earned, though, his earning of the status is not a deliberate focus. That is more for others to do. If we donrsquot have heroes then where do we get our inspirations from  Often our heroes are close to home, and that is true of this one.Itrsquos early summer  and an eager  year-old is anxious to know. ldquoWell, was he there  The equally eager  year-old, deciding to be a wee bit cute, replied: ldquoWho  A few playful expletives from the  year-old and the  year-old burst out laughing: ldquoAye, he was there ndash there was no county training tonight.:It was the first Town senior training session the  year-old attended. Dferent times. A  year-old nowadays would be a ball-boy at training. ldquoDid he train or was he ndash like ndash just there standing about not involved as he was on the county team A few expletives from medeclared: ldquoOf course he trained ndash hersquos Arkle the county captain, midfielder for The Town. ldquoDid he pass the ball to you and by the way hersquos a Fontenoy , the nineteen year-old declared robustly.ldquoYes he did I replied excitedly. The Town man gave me great encouragement and told me to keep coming back to training. He is our hero. Hersquos everyonersquos hero. I will come back to our nineteen-year old later.Over  Gaels from Down, all over Ireland and beyond gathered in the Slieve Donard Hotel last Friday night to honour and to pay tribute to one of Downrsquos greatest ever footballers, none other than the great Colm McAlarney.His evening started with a knock on the door at his home in the Town when club chairman, Kevin Sweeney, and event organiser Kevan Owens surprised Colm in his kitchen with those immortal words ldquotonight Colm ndash this is your le.It was filmed and the first sign of his hero status became apparent ndash total shock and his humble disbelief. Then came his sudden realisation of what the meaning of the word lsquoOmertarsquo was ndash the code of silence.He didnrsquot see it coming or expect it. Colm arrived into the Shimna Suite to a tumultuous welcome ndash the sort of welcome only heroes get, the standing ovation, the shy bow of the head and of course the irreplaceable smile.He was among friends and worshippers. He spoke to his adoring audience and we lapped up every word. He spoke of his unease at the inidual honours he achieved as Gaelic football is a team game and that he achieved much on the shoulders of giants both in size and sheer ability. They gave him the  to achieve what he did.Colm said It wasnrsquot about Colm ndash itrsquos what others did for him. The unglamorous work, the blocking, the chasing ndash all the stuff we, as footballers do.The first video, mist and rolling hills ndash the early strains from the film many years ago ndash yip local hero.We all canrsquot be wrong. Wersquore all thinking the same way. In true lsquoThis is your lersquo style our compere for the evening, the classy one and only Austin OrsquoCallaghan eased Colm into his throne.He didnrsquot sit easy. Hersquos in the spotlight. Itrsquos not like the chair at home from which he was supposed to be watching the Late Late Show . As Colm said himself, before Mickey Cole got his tuppence in, saying it was about Colmrsquos level of viewing.There was laughter from the hall. Now, like all his years on the field, he is being watched once again. The evening will unfold. There will be surprises. He will forget himself, the nervous tension will go.He will relax into the throne ndash on one which he will wear a virtual crown. There was one thing missing ndash the big red book. This was duly delivered by Colmrsquos grandchildren, Eimear and Senan adorned in the Castlewellan and Liatroim Fontenoys colours.He got his biggest hug of the night from them. They probably whispered lsquowe love you grandarsquo to him. He would have known that.And so the story of his le began and it began with family. His sisterrsquos Mary, Nuala, Una and Dympna talked warmly of their brother. They spoke of the early days in Dublin, the near emigration to Australia and ultimately theirto Liatroim.In later years one newspaper headlined ldquoColm McAlarney ndash Dublinrsquos gt to Downrsquo ndash which we all know now is so fitting and thank God for that.The next sign of the hero status revealed itself though not a sporting one. Dympna told of how as a four year-old she misbehaved at Mass. As children wersquove all got the ldquowait until I get you home remark from a parent. When she got home, Colm being the big brother. gave her a big protective hug and all was forgiven by her parents.Stories of his early playing days were laid out by his friends Tommy Armstrong, Brian Malone, Gerry and Noel McCabe.Those days as young lads where they played in a field, set up goals and the youngesttold they were in goal. The humorous story of those times set the evening up well.We also heard from Willie Doyle and Colm Shields of those days in the mid-sixties when the young Colm was starting to make his mark on the Gaelic field. And so the flow of old playing colleagues from St Patrickrsquos High School, Downpatrick, with MacRory Cup memories, Down Minors and U-s of the day.In  Colm played for Down in three Ulster finals in the space of eight days mdash for the seniors, minors and U-s. A quite unique feat and a sign that perhaps greater things would come.Another unique fact was revealed. Colm played in four consecutive minor county finals, one with Loughinisland, one with Annaclone and two with Castlewellan. The great and the good continued to file passed.They told their tales of opponent, rival, colleague and what makes the GAA tick ndash friendship. We all know the headline stories, but it will always be the anecdotal tales behind the stories which give us all the biggest chuckles.Of course there was the glory years where we had Paddy Doherty, Sean OrsquoNeill, Gerry Dougherty, Kevin McIlroy, Donagh OrsquoKane, Barney McAleenan, Liam Sloan, Peter McGinnity, Sean og McGourty, Ray Carolan to name but a few.The little story from Liam Sloan, when back in , he received a call from the Ulster Council to seea trophy Colm won the previous year could be ed to be presented to the next recipient. Liam called to Colmrsquos house where Colm went looking for it. Imagine the scene, Colmrsquos backside sticking out from under the stairs, arm reaching back with each trophy saying ldquodo you think itrsquos that one.There were video messages from Kevin Moran, the great Mick OrsquoDwyer, Sean Cavanagh, Mickey Harte and then of course there was Joe Brolly, who wants to sit down and have a pint with Colm sometime.Colm could turn his hand to any sport. Basketball was always a preferred past time. What was revealed also was when he was at St Josephrsquos Training College was how he became involved in a wee bit of boxing.When members of the Immaculata Boxing Club came over from Divis to lsquoThe Ranchrsquo Colm took up the gloves. They were impressed by his skills. They wanted him to join the sport and even came to watch him play.The young Colm simply did not have the time to fit it in. The one good thing was that, as many of you will remember boxing skills came in handy in the Gaelic football arena back then. Better with the skill than without it.I cannot tell everyonersquos tale but perhaps one of the greatest footballers of all time, the great Kerryrsquos Jack OrsquoShea, paid Colm the greatest of sporting accolades by telling everyone he modelled his game on Colmrsquos.The second Gaelic football, box to box player, learning from the first and had Colm been a Kerry man ndash well you know how many All-Ireland medals hersquod have. This comment met with huge applause and nodding approval for our hero.Another milestone in Colmrsquos illustrious career, sometimes forgotten, was his foresight back then in  to introduce Saturday morning coaching sessions in Castlewellan for potential footballers between six and eleven years of age, a true testimony this practice is still thriving within the club some thirty three years down the road, all due to Colm McAlarney.The most touching tribute of the night came from his daughter Grainne. Hersquos dad and not the hero we know.He is the hero that is her dad. It was only in her early twenties she appreciated the GAA star her dad is. Sometimes, whenever she mentioned her surname, through the medium of her work with Danske Bank, there was then the silence and the pause, then the question, ldquoAnything to Colm  which she would answer with pride and a smile ldquoyes thatrsquos my dad.Hersquos first and foremost a dad. Sitting quietly and elegantly through the evening, watching the proceedings unfold and Irsquom sure bursting with pride, was Theresa, Colmrsquos we. Along with the family she kept the secret of what was months in the making.Her smile and perhaps a quiet reflection on a sporting le which she supported all through the years deserves recognition. Though, I suspect she would be like Colm in that that recognition doesnrsquot sit easy with her either.The final video of the night was delivered to the tunes of My Way and Simply the Best. This was a reflection of a career which spanned four decades. Perhaps most poignant of moments was the final montage from the  Down Senior Championship final where we saw a very proud Michael McAlarney with his son Colm and Colm Og with the Frank OrsquoHare Cup he spoke of bursting with pride of the two men beside him.Colm did it his way, but never to the detriment of others and he is simply the best. All the guests rose to their feet, once again, when the red book was handed over. The evening wasnrsquot over yet. There was another award. One from within his own club. Castlewellan chairman Kevin Sweeney, came to the podium and announced that Colm was the worthy recipient of the Castlewellan Hall of Fame award.Some of our previous proud winners were there to see Colm presented the Johnny OrsquoNeill Trophy by Johnnyrsquos son, our vice-chairman, John OrsquoNeill. Colm is now among a special group of people within our club.Well done to Kevan Owens, Kevin Sweeney, Gerry Dougherty, Liam Sloan and Barney McAleenan. This is the team who put the night together and they deserve our praise and appreciation.So, there you have it - the word hero ndash you know by now itrsquos a big one.Kitty Kelley said that a hero is someone we can admire without apology. I use the word unashamedly. By the way, that  year-old I mentioned at the beginning was the late Gerry Rushfrom the Bann Road. He was a very proud Fontenoy, my friend and a McAlarney man.JR went to his eternal rest in October , but his spirit was there on Friday night to pay tribute to a very special local hero..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"McNamara and Murray strikes send Olympic into raptures  ","story":"TWO goals in a mesmeric three-minute first half spell proved decisive as Ballynahinch Olympic secured their place in the Christmas showpiece final against Crumlin Star.Strikes from Niall Murray and Chris McNamara had Olympic purring, but they took their foot off the gas after the break and nearly threw it all away.Orangefield huffed and puffed for most of the second half, but a determined Olympic restricted them to a solitary strike from Vitalis Ogunwa in the th minute.There wasnrsquot much to write home about in the opening exchanges, but Olympic looked the more comfortable in possession with their fluid and ambitious -- formation.Orangefield had the first shot in anger when William Gracey had a shot from the edge of the box well blocked by the impressive Chris Magee. Owen Peden then had a header blocked as Orangefield had penalty appeals for hand ball waved away.Stuart Nelson had a shot comfortably saved by Ryan Walsh as Orangefield probed for an opening, but Olympic were nor for yielding.However, the east Belfast side committed a cardinal sin by ping their guard and affording the roaming Murray and Nathan Jones far too much space and time on the ball.Jones served notice of intent in the rd minute when he was picked out totally unmarked on the right side of the box, but he contrived to screw his shot badly wide.Three minutes Ryan Molloy instigated one of Olympicrsquos trademark moves when he released Murray. Without even having to look up to see his options, Murray immediately fed Jones, but Glenn Taylor denied him with a parried save.With  minutes gone and Olympic in the middle of a power play, Jones again found space down the right and played an angled pass in behind centre half Jonathan Doey that was latched on to by Murray and he beat Taylor all ends up with a sweet strike.It was - three minutes later. A sweeping pitch- move, started out on the left by the immaculate Dalton Tate, ended with Chris McNamara, who was involved in the build-up, converting a sublime pass from Jones.Jones could easily have made it - in the st minute, but his well-struck shot was tipped round the post by Taylor. Jones then played a brilliant ball into the path of Murray, but he was denied by an alert Taylor who rushed off his line to interceptTaylor saved from McNamara at the start of the second half, but Olympic strangely retreated into a defensive shell with Jones being starved of possession and Murray and McNamara being forced to live off crumbs.It was at this stage of the game that Ryan Noade really started imposing himself on proceedings and he revelled in providing protection to his back three with numerous, telling tackles and interceptions where it mattered.Orangefield were seeing much more of the ball, but they were never able to hurt Olympic.If anything, Olympic still carried a greater goal threat with Jones having a free kick blocked and Stevie Noade flashing one wide after Jones threaded the ball into his path.Orangefield managed to reduce the arrears in the th minute when Ogunwa beat the offside trap inside the box and drilled an unstoppable effort past Ryan Walsh.Despite applying intense pressure, Orangefield never looked like equalising and with the  minutes almost up, Olympic hit them on the break only for Murray to blast wildly over the bar with only Taylor to beat.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Chris Magee, Ryan Noade, Conor Reid, Jason Noade, Dalton Tate, Stevie Noade, Niall Murray, Nathan Jones, Ryan Molloy, Chris McNamara.

The scale of the crisis is quite simply breathtaking and the figures speak for themselves.Mr Savage said an estimated , applications had been made for social housing district-wide, with almost , of applicants placed in the urgent need category.He continued: ldquoThese figures highlight the terrible extent of the housing crisis in this district. Enough is enough, it is time for us to take action and time for everyone to put their shoulder to the wheel to tackle this mounting problem.ldquoThe conference is the first step in getting sustainable solutions at a time when the people we represent cannot get a place they can call home. The Department of Communities has an obligation to come and play a lead role because it oversees the Housing Executive and needs to hear first hand the level of need in the district and work with us all to provide collaborative solutions to the problem.Cllr Savage added: ldquoWe need to explore all the options. Access to a home is a fundamental human right and we need to act swtly so the current generation is not left without a place to live.Cllr Billy Walker said all elected representatives are approached about the lack of social housing on a daily basis and that not one of the part of the district is not affected by the current crisis.ldquoWe need this conference to pull all the key players together and we must be robust with them on this issue. We need solutions going forward and this conference is the perfect opportunity to do just that, he added.Cllr Davy Hyland said the council needed to do what it could to find solutions for people in desperate need of housing, while Cllr David Taylor said a lack of resources was not helping the housing crisis which had left people on the waiting list for several years in some cases.He added: ldquoWe need a new social housing strategy and need all the key players to buy into this. We also need funding to meet the demand which exists.Cllr Andy McMurray said he was ldquoacutely aware of the trauma associated with being on the waiting list for social housing, describing the waiting list figures as ldquopretty shocking, while Cllr Jarlath Tinnelly suggested the social housing crisis ldquohas gone well beyond crisis point.Cllr Willie Clarke described Newcastle as a priority area and warned that the current social housing shortage has the potential to get worse in the months and years ahead.He said there is a particular need for accommodation for small families, highlighting the problems social housing providers face when they have to compete with private developers to secure building land.Cllr John Trainor said that while work on a major social housing scheme was underway at the old Downe Hospital site in Downpatrick, it was important to plan for the townrsquos needs over the next five to  years..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Murlough runners in full flow  ","story":"ON a wet Saturday morning, some  Murlough AC members made their way across the province to Loughgall in Co Armagh to complete the third race in Born  Runrsquos Run Forest Run series.There is no other way to describe the day other than it chucked it down, our feet were well and truly soaked before the race began.

Children who are educated together create friendships which last for the rest of their lives, she continued.ldquoWe believe that there are more opportunities for children in integrated education which can provide them with a broader experience a safe, neutral environment where people can mix with each other and help us create a genuine, shared future for everyone.Mrs McAlpine explained the aim locally is to create the new steering group to take the post-primary project forward and write to existing controlled schools to testthey would be interested in transforming to integrated status.She said this would be a ldquofundamental change which may be dficult for some, confirming that existing schools preferred to maintain the collective status quo, the Mid Down steering group would adopt a greenfield approach for a new school.ldquoNICIE will be delighted to support parents in favour of new integrated post-primary provision as in all consciousness we cannot allow the current situation to continue as it is. You have around  children not being able to secure a post-primary place in the integrated sector and I think there is something we can do to redress the imbalance, she said.ldquoWe want to provide provide a much better future for post primary integrated education in the Mid Down area and hope to form a new steering group before Christmas and then contact controlled schools in the New Year to testthey wish to transform to integrated status.ldquoI have asked the Department of Educationwould it start a site search for me and I have an idea where a new school could be located but not a specic site. We currently have an integrated school at Blackwater in Downpatrick which I believe has never had the chance to reach its full potential as its site is quite restricted.Mrs McAlpine added: ldquoI am trying to get something that will enable us,the children would like to transfer, to get everybody on the same site and we would hope to have new post-primary integrated provision in the Mid Down area by , either in an existing school or via a new-build project..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New principal at Knockevin Special School  ","story":"THE new principal at Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick is looking forward to her new role with relish.While Sara Liddell has been acting principal since the start of the new school term, her appointment as Mrs Anne Cooperrsquos successor was only confirmedrecently and she says she is delighted to be at the helm of a school which has a special place in the heart of the community.Sara always wanted to work in special education and feels privileged to head up a school where work on a much-needed new extension is expected to start next September.The former Down High School student worked at Tor Bank Special School in Dundonald before moving to Knockevin, where she was a teacher and vice-principal for four years before taking over as principal.From Downpatrick, the new principal has a close link with Knockevin as her brother Jamie was educated at the school.ldquoI always wanted to work in special education and wanted to be here in Knockevin because it really is such a special place, said Sara. ldquoWhile I was studying at Stranmillis I did my teaching practice here which was lovely for me.ldquoThere is such warmth in the community for the school which has such a lovely, family feel about it. I obviously knew the school because Jamie came here and know how special it is. I wanted to work in special education because I saw what Jamie was able to achieve.ldquoJamie came through Knockevin and while he has his challenges, he was able to leave school and secure a job a few days a week which is great. My brother learned so much because he was educated here.ldquoThere is so much warmth about this place and I am fortunate to work with a wonderful staff team. Everyone, including pupils and families were so supportive to my family when Jamie was a pupil here. That sparked my interest in special education and was why I always wanted to work in this field, Sara explained.Knockevin is split across two sites, with an Early Years centre in Dundrum catering for  children and  pupils based in Downpatrick with a - strong teaching staff across both locations.ldquoWe are the only special school for a wide geographical area and have pupils coming from as far away as Kilkeel and Newry, with others closer to home coming from the Downpatrick, Ardglass, Strangford, Crossgar and Killinchy areas, the new principal continued.ldquoI am looking forward to my new role and already knowing the staff, pupils and families has been a big help. Knowing I have their genuine support is really wonderful.Given that it is the only special school in the local area, Knockevin is oversubscribed, with Sara explaining her appointment coincides with what she described as a ldquochallenging time.She continued: ldquoWe have a good reputation which has been enhanced with the new early years centre in Dundrum which is a real centre of excellence and we have huge numbers coming through, she continued.ldquoWe are pushed for space in Downpatrick, but Knockevin is in the school enhancement programme and work on a new extension will hopefully start next September, replacing mobile classrooms with a new permanent structure and it is a really exciting time to be part of this.Tendering documents are currently being prepared ahead of the start of building work which is expected to take  months to complete to meet what the new principal described as a ldquohuge need in the area.As Sara settles into her new role, she admits the fact she was vice-principal for four years has made the transition a smooth process.ldquoThere is so much love and warmth for the school across the community and local people are fantastic. May aim moving forward is to harness that warmth to give our pupils lots of new opportunities, she explained.ldquoWe already have a fantastic work experience programme where seniors go out and so many businesses have been so supportive. This is something I really want to build on, strengthening our school links.ldquoWe have been involved in a few projects with the Assumption Grammar in Ballynahinch and St Patrickrsquos Grammar in Downpatrick which produced benefits for everyone involved. As a former Down High student I have been able to establish a link with its student council which is really beneficial.Sara believes that linking Knockevin with other schools is important as it provides young people with an insight into what a special school is ldquodemystying the issues around it. She is also pleased her students can attend other schools to use a range of specialist facilities which provide access to art and drama, science and technology in particular.ldquoIt is amazing how other schools have opened up to us.

There will also be tea and refreshments and open invitation is extended to people to attend. Organisers say the service is open to all, not just those who have a relative who took their own le.Ailish Teague, who helped establish Le Change Changes Lives with her husband, Manus, said the service will be held in the charityrsquos new home for the first time.ldquoIt is a joint service organised alongside PIPS and it will be the third we have organised. PIPS initially came up with the idea and asked could they use our new premises which we were delighted to make available, she explained.ldquoThere has been a very good response over the past two years, with the service an evening where people can join together in their grief and remember loved ones collectively. Relatives are alongside others who have experienced the same pain and there is a lot of empathy and understanding.Ailish said the service is open to people from across the district and explained that there will be an opportunity for people to place the names of their loved ones on a Christmas tree.ldquoPeople are given as much time as they need and this can, for some, be a cathartic experience. We place peoplersquos names on skeleton leaves which we make. We chose leaves to reflect how fragile le is, while some people will bring a bauble to hang on the tree which has a picture of their loves ones on it, she continued.ldquoWe will also have a bigger tree this year more as more people have been attending as suicide figures continue to rise. It is always a very emotional service and there are very few people who donrsquot know some family that has been touched by it.Ailish explained that all the names placed on the tree this year will be kept and placed alongside those gathered over the past two years with the intention of placing them in a time capsule at some point in the future which will be buried locally.She continued: ldquoChristmas is a dficult time for families and that is why we do not decorate our tree located at the front of our building which looks out on to Market Street. There is no tinsel or lights.ldquoThis time of year can be troubling for many families and we choose not to decorate our tree which is much like the empty chair in many peoplersquos homes as their loved ones are no longer here.Ailish said the tree is decorated by those who have lost their lives, not through suicide, but due to mental health problems and addictions, highlighting the importance of people recognising this.She added: ldquoIt is depression that kills, not the selfish act of an irrational mind. People think suicide is a selfish act, but it is not.ldquoWe are extending an open invitation to next Thursday eveningrsquos service and people who have lost loved ones, regardless of the reason, are welcome to join us.ldquoWe would like them to join us and place a small decoration on the Christmas tree in memory of a loved one.

For the past few years we have been unable to tell Tourism NI or Bord Faacuteilte when our festivals were likely to take place as the local authority does not even have a calendar of events looking forward.ldquoMost festivals run at the same time each year in the Down area and it would not be a dficult task to publish a calendar that would cover a five year period to include both council tourism and community-led events.Cllr Enright believes the introduction of such a calendar would have several benefits, ensuring there would be no overlapping of festivals in the same area, allowing Tourism NI to be aware of them well in advance and local festivals and events appearing in their brochures and in tourism offices at home and abroad.Gerry Casey, from the Ardglass Festival Association, described the current funding mechanism in place for community festivals as ldquoinadequate.He continued: ldquoVillages cannot plan ahead with such short-term annualised funding. The process in the new council makes funding for these festivals precarious and uncertain from year to year and inhibits festival organisers booking in advance to get best prices or being able to secure match funding from where.ldquoThe Ardglass festival has been running for  consecutive years and been funded for  of those.

announced in the last couple of minutes, was  in her favour, to  against.Footage from live announcementThe gathering of the Conservative parliamentary party dissolved into cheering and raucous applause just after pm when the result was announced by Graham Brady, chairman of the Conservative body representing its Parliamentary members, the  Committee.There can be, under party rules, no similar vote on her leadership for  months.She had needed  MPs to back her in the secret ballot.Afterwards, Brexiteer Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said the result was “terrible” for the Prime Minister, and that she should nevertheless resign.Prime Minister Theresa May makes a statement outside  Downing Street, London, on WednesdayHe said that about half of all Tories in the Commons are not mere ordinary MPs, but have some connection to the government, whether it be as members of the cabinet, as trade envoys, or as parliamentary private secretaries .This meant about half the people voting were effectively “in the pay of the Prime Minister in one way or another”.Looking at it from that point of view, it was a “terrible result” for Mrs May because it meant the “overwhelming” majority of people not on her “payroll” were likely to have opposed her.The vote was triggered by party grandee Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the backbench  Committee, early on Wednesday after he received letters of no confidence in the PM from at least % of the parliamentary party.Conservative MPs listen during a meeting addressed by Theresa May in Committee Room  in the Houses of Parliament in Westminster, London, ahead of their vote of confidence in her as party leaderIn a day of high drama, a defiant Mrs May vowed to fight “with everything I’ve got” to defend her position, warning that a change in prime minister might mean Brexit being delayed or halted.In an early-morning statement outside  Downing Street, Mrs May said that securing a Brexit deal which will deliver on the result of the  referendum was “now within our grasp” and said she was “making progress” in securing reassurances from EU leaders on MPs’ concerns about the proposed backstop for the Irish border.Every MP in her Cabinet swtly issued statements of support and she was greeted by loud cheers from the Tory backbenches when she faced the House of Commons for her weekly session of Prime Minister’s Questions.Danske first in NI to launch open banking feature Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Addressing assembled MPs at a meeting of the  Committee moments before the crucial vote, Mrs May said that she accepted she could not fight the next election as their leader.Solicitor general Robert Buckland told reporters: “She said ‘In my heart I would like to lead the party into the next election’ and then that was the introductory phrase to her indication that she would accept the fact that that would not happen, that is not her intention.”And, according to MPs present at the meeting, she also promised to find a “legally binding solution” to ensuring that the UK does not get permanently trapped in a backstop arrangement to keep the Irish border open after Brexit.The scale of this task was highlighted by Irish premier Leo Varadkar and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, who insisted in a phone call as MPs voted that the UK’s Withdrawal Agreement “cannot be reopened or contradicted”.And DUP leader Arlene Foster, who met Mrs May shortly before the ballot, insisted that “tinkering around the edges” of the agreement would not be enough to win her party’s support for the deal.Mrs Foster, whose  MPs prop up the minority Conservative administration, said she told the PM that “we were not seeking assurances or promises, we wanted fundamental legal text changes”.Anger over the backstop among Tory backbenchers and their Democratic Unionist Party allies was the main obstacle to Mrs May getting her Brexit deal through the House of Commons earlier this week.Her decision to defer the vote sparked a new wave of letters of no confidence which pushed the total beyond the threshold of  needed to trigger a ballot.By the time of the vote, Mrs May’s survival looked assured, with the tally of Tory MPs publicly declaring they would support her passing the threshold of  needed to secure her position.Mrs May’s victory in the confidence vote means that another challenge cannot be mounted against her position as Tory leader for a year.But she still faces the danger of a no-confidence motion in the House of Commons, which could bring her Government downbacked by more than half of all MPs.And Labour MPs branded her a “lame duck” PM because of her decision to pre-announce her departure.try catch  TrendingPSNI issue warning to O customers seeking refund after network outageWhat we know so far about the man shot dead outside N.I. schoolO compensation package

that an important segment of her sworn evidence to the RHI Inquiry is #wrong#, relating to when she was told about the belief that her Spad delayed RHI cost controls.The DUP leader’s admission comes in one of  new witness statements which the inquiry published last night ahead of its final oral hearings next week.Arlene Foster had told Stephen Nolan that she had no idea why cost controls were delayedIn October, senior Stormont civil servant Andrew McCormick told the inquiry that Mrs Foster’s account of what happened on the night of Stephen Nolan’s seminal interview with the DUP leader where she responded to Jonathan Bell’s allegations simply could not be accurate.Under pressure from the BBC man’s questioning in December , the then-First Minister told the public that she had “no idea” why cost controls on the out-of-control RHI scheme had been delayed.The inquiry has heard several pieces of evidence which show that her closest advisers – who spent hours preparing her for the huge interview – had been told by Dr McCormick of the allegation that it was her special adviserAndrew Crawford who had worked in the shadows to delay cost controls.However, Mrs Foster’s version of events – which like Dr McCormick’s evidence was given under oath – was that Dr McCormick had never said that directly to her until after the interview during a conversation which she seemed to recall clearly, describing his demeanour as “sheepish”. Her account was endorsed by DUP minister Simon Hamilton, who was also in Stormont Castle that night.However, Dr McCormick said thatthat conversation did occur it could not have been after the recording – and therefore would have to have been before Mrs Foster told the public she had “no idea” why cost controls were delayed. He set out in detail how and why he had left Stormont before the interview even began and did not speak to Mrs Foster over the following days.Now Mrs Foster has rowed back from what she told the inquiry, saying in a fresh written statement that Dr McCormick may be correct – but evenhe is, she stands over her claim at the time that she had “no idea” why cost controls were delayed. She said: “Given the febrile atmosphere...it is possible that I am wrong about the sequencing of Dr McCormick telling me his view that Dr Crawford delayed the scheme. “However, regardless of when Dr McCormick’s belief was communicated to me, I was already aware of the contents of Dr Crawford’s emails and would have taken the view that there was insufficient evidence at that time to draw any conclusions about the reasons for delay in the scheme, hence my reply to Mr Nolan that ‘I had no idea’.“I would not have voiced publicly an unsubstantiated comment of that nature. Indeed, I remain of the view that to repeat this unsubstantiated allegation to Mr Nolan, particularly in the circumstances that prevailed at the time, would have been inappropriate.“I did have no idea as to the facts of what took place and therefore I do not believe that my reply to Mr Nolan was contrary to the principle of openness within the seven principles of public le.”Dr Crawford has also taken issue with a claim from Dr McCormick that the DUP spad told him at a dinner in October  that he thought RHI funding was coming from the Treasury and therefore it was possible to “fill our boots”.Man arrested on suspicion of murder after body found in flat Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Dr Crawford said: “This statement is not true. At no time did I make this or any similar comment, I believe that Dr McCormick made this misleading and inaccurate comment to deflect any criticism of his role in relation to the RHI scheme and this has resulted in a great deal of negative publicity towards myself.”Dr Crawford pointed out that Dr McCormick had been asked about the conversation on several occasions by the inquiry and had not used the phrase “fill our boots” until his final appearance before the inquiry.In oral evidence to the inquiry Dr Crawford had been asked about the conversation and said that he could not recall what had been said.But in a statement to the inquiry last month Dr Crawford said that he now believed the conversation could not have been at the October  dinner because he does not believe he attended it.However, when the inquiry put fresh evidence to Dr Crawford, in a fresh statement on Tuesday he accepted: “It appears I did in fact attend the  NIFDA dinner. “I did not remember having done so and am grateful to the inquiry for giving me the opportunity to correct the evidence in my last statement on the issue.”try catch  TrendingSnow forecast for N.I. this week - tonights temperature to drop to -degCPSNI issue warning to O customers seeking refund after network outageWhat we know so far about the man shot dead outside N.I. schoolFatal shooting: Man gunned down outside schoolO compensation package revealed          ..

Unionists usually shrug off this kind of political harassment but this was unusual because his ideas were afforded a full page in the influential Financial Times to expound his ideaDr Graham Gudgin, Cambridge University academic and former economic advisor to David Trimble as first ministerAlmost all his figures were wrong or misleading and the FT has subsequently published two letterspointing out the worst errors.The BBC Good Morning Ulster picked up this debate in an item in which McWilliams was allowed to repeat his argument.In the following interview my attempt to demonstrate his errors was dismissed as “patronising, given that McWillams is a well-respected economist”. This was a clear example of BBC bias where an uninformed interviewer takes a view on what is true and what is not.The core of McWillams’ case was that  years ago two-thirds of people were Protestants, but by  McWilliams indicates more under-fours were described as Catholic than as Protestant . He then suggested that Catholics would form a majority by  leading to a united Ireland, a trend accelerated by Brexit.His figures merely demonstrated the well-known fact that over the last century the Catholic share of Northern Ireland‘s population has risen. His deduction about the future was however wrong.The latest figures, from the  census, clearly show that the percentage of the population who described themselves as Catholic had peaked among those born almost two decades ago and has subsequently slowly declined.Among those who were teenagers in , % said they were Catholics but among the under-fours the figure was lower at %.If this trend continues there will never be a Catholic majority. Since Catholic birth-rates are now close to those of Protestants it seems likely the trend will indeed continue.Moreover, one in  Catholics are now from Poland, Lithuania, Portugal and the Philippines. The future constitutional preference of these immigrants and their children is hard to predict. It is certainly wrong accept McWilliams’ glib equation of Catholicism with Irish nationalism.The  Northern Ireland Le and Times Survey shows once again that only slightly over half of Northern Ireland’s Catholics identy as ‘Irish’ and under half have an Irish passport. The proportion of Catholics who support eventual Irish unity is stable at %. Only % express a desire for immediate unity. Among the whole population of Northern Ireland only % support Irish unity and this has changed little since the Brexit referendum.Since some Protestants clearly voted remain in the referendum there was some feelingthat these might prefer a united Ireland in order to remain within the EU.While this might be true of some, it now seems clear that such Protestants were voting for the UK to remain in the EU but not necessarily for Northern Ireland to remain in the EUthe UK was out. Views on Irish unity were clearly shown in the  general election when the DUP increased their vote by a massive , while the pro-remain UUP lost a third of its vote and has since changed its tune on Brexit.Witch hunts against those former police officers who are accused of the sorcery known as collusion Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"We do not know why should so many Catholics support Northern Ireland’s place within the UK, but we can guess that the NHS, free school education, a generous social security system and low-cost housing are all factors. McWilliams tries to argue that the Republic of Ireland is much more successful economy and that its people are richer. He seems not to know that Professor John Fitzgerald of ESRI in Dublinhas recently calculated that living standards are % higher in Northern Ireland compared to the south. Although wages are generally higher in the south, higher taxes and fees and inferior levels of public service provision mean that northerners do better even before we take cheaper housing into account. Because he married a we from Protestant east Belfast, McWilliams feels he knows Northern Ireland well. This may be true in some respects, but his grasp of the economy is weak. His triumphalist view of northern economic failure in contrast to southern success is crass. While it is true that the south has replaced the north as the main location of industry over the last century, the prosperity of Northern Ireland is plain to see in congested roads and hotel building projects.Nor does the north’s dependence on public spending indicate a weak private sector as McWilliams simplistically suggests. Rather it reflects the way the UK works. The high birth rates of the past created an excess of labour which a sedately-growing UK economic union was not designed to accommodate. Instead public services and hence jobs were provided for growing population. While the south relies on its rip-off tax-haven status to employ a growing population, the UK provides public spending in a way that is fully sustainable.• Graham Gudgin is chief economic advisor to Policy Exchange and academic at the University of Cambridge.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing.

When I woke up whenever and potted and mooched and just saw what the day would bring.Like most people, the demands of work, family, friends, errands and the general stuff of le, mean that at any given moment we can be doing one thing, planning something  and thinking about many more.I get in to grasshopper phases where it feels like there is so much on my lsquoto dorsquo list that I flit and fly between myriad things and sometimes few of them get completed how Irsquod like or indeed completed at all and for those that that do get sorted and sewn up with aplomb, there is no time to take any satisfaction or pride because it is time to crack on with the next thing folks.I read a while ago about a concept that affects your brain around scarcity.The idea that when we feel that something is scarce, be that time, money or something  that we feel is in short supply, it can make us act with less focus and rationality thanwe had an abundance of such.So, in my case, when I feel time is pressured, I am more likely to try to do more with the result that I feel I have less time and my scarcity suffering brain is more likely to forget, to misplace to mess up.And so, knowing this, I am going to set aside the lsquoto dosrsquo and the lsquoshouldsrsquo and curl up on the settee with my utterly wonderful friend and eat and chill and know that with every mouthful of delicious cake, I am doing myself some good. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is important to stress that these findings should not be interpreted to imply that any level of drink-driving is safe.In response to the study Alison Douglas, chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland said: ldquoReducing the drink-drive limit was the right thing to do as the risk of having an accident rises in direct relation to the amount of alcohol consumed.ldquoThe safest thing to do is avoid alcohol completely before driving. We need to increase public understanding and awareness of the risks and the limit.There were at least , road traffic accidents in the UK in  that involved drink-driving, while such incidents are estimated to cost the Scottish economy about pound million a year.The study, which was published in the medical journal The Lancet, also looked at the impact the lower limit had had on alcohol sales.Here it concluded there had been no change to sales in supermarkets and off-licences, while sales in pubs, restaurants and bars were found to have reduced by less than %.Scottish Conservative justice spokesman Liam Kerr said: ldquoWe warned at the time that the SNP Government was focusing on the wrong end of the scale with these changes.ldquoWe wanted more attention on those whose irresponsible behaviour actually cause death and destruction.ldquoThis report seems to back that approach up and I hope the SNP Government takes this on board.ldquoWe all want to see a reduction in drink-driving and the accidents it causes, and itrsquos vital that we work towards that.SNP MSP Emma Harper responded: ldquoThe Tories are absurdand deeply irresponsible. Theyrsquore attacking the SNP for leading the fight against drink-driving despite supporting us by voting for lower limits.ldquoAnd, to top off this hypocrisy, their own spokesperson was posing outside Parliament for a photo op for an anti-drink drive campaign which backs the Scottish Governmentrsquos approach.Meanwhile, a Scottish Government spokeswoman said ministers would look at the research ldquocarefully.She said: ldquoThe  independent North Report found that drivers are six times more likely to die in a road traffic accident with a blood alcohol concentration between mg and mg than with zero blood alcohol.ldquoThat is why the Scottish Parliament agreed unanimously to set the drink-drive limit based on the scientic evidence as to when impairment begins to increase signicantly ndash bringing Scotland in line with most European nations..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: New drink-drive limit in Scotland  uhas not reduced road accidents u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,Comments are closed on this article.Contact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sinn Fein Cllr Keith Haughian said: “Numerous independent consultations show a dire need to improve facilities in North Lurgan. SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly“Time and time again this has been ignored. We believe that this needs addressed urgently by the Chief Executive of ABC council.”Ms Lockhart pointed out that £.m was set aside for both north and south Lurgan community centre provision during the old Craigavon Council with vows to look towards additional funding for expansion and upkeep of the new premises.“There is broad political agreement but unfortunately there would appear to be a leapfrogging of other priorities within the Council. The people of Lurgan deserve community facilities that are fit for purpose and meet the modern day standard. Ms Lockhart has been lobbying the council to repair a failed heating system in the Mourneview Centre. “Whilst this has resulted in two halogen heaters being supplied to heat the mainroom this is only a short term fix and greater investment is required.” .\" title\"Cllr Keith Haughian .\" data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_

officials on how council is meeting its statutory obligation under section  of the Northern Ireland  and its requirement to target social need.“I spoke to Ms Lockhart about the lack of investment in Lurgan most notably in the Court ward which has one of the highest levels of social deprivation in the Borough and the fact that despite many promises the people of Shankill have no community

dferences we are agreed that commitments made under the legacy councils, based on assessed need, must be honoured.”Cllr Haughian said: “The issue of community centre provision in the Lurgan area is one which has been dealt with very poorly by CBC and now ABC.“Our stance in SF has never wavered. Where there is a need for improvements to community provision in socially deprived areas then the Council should prioritise it. Numerous independent consultations show a dire need to improve facilities in north Lurgan. “Time and time again this has been ignored. We believe that this needs addressed urgently by the Chief Executive of ABC council.“If there is similar evidence that the need is there for Mourneview then these two projects should be progressed without delay,” said Cllr Haughian. A Council spokesperson said: “The Council is committed to delivering capital projects and investing in infrastructure across the borough. Investment in Lurgan Community Centres is one of the capital projects currently under consideration.“There are a large number of capital projects for council to consider, each of which require robust financial planning. In addition to the capital projects, there are also many other demands on council resources to continue to deliver essential services across the borough.”try catch  TrendingDad leaves sickbed to deliver baby in laybyHeartbreak as teenage Syrian refugee dies suddenlyPolice angered as thieves target elderly woman in supermarketHome turns into a Festive WonderlandStaff flee shop after activating panic alarm          ..

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey.

Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/chamber_1.jpg","title":"outline your alternative to brexit deal says ni chamber president","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew It’s now time for political leaders opposed to a draft withdrawal agreement on Brexit to “outline alternative proposals” as an overwhelming majority of Northern Ireland’s business community back the plans, an industry leader has said. Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”.

Meanwhile, farming unions in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK have also issued their support for the deal.It would essentially provide a backstop, and create a deeper customs union between Northern Ireland the EU, along with a closer alignment in the single market.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI says that the agreement is “the only show in town.”He said a poll of its members showed .% of those who replied were in support.“This is the only show in town. The rules are clear – in order for the UK to move to the most productive discussion on what the future relationship will be, we need a withdrawal agreement. The options are the agreement, or no deal,” he told Ulster Business.“Business in Northern Ireland and agri-business have made it clear that no deal is not an option.”Other business groups backing the proposed agreement include the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI, Hospitality Ulster and the Freight Transport Association.Writing in the Belfast , Prime Minister Theresa May said Northern Ireland will thrive under the proposed Brexit deal, and its position as part of the UK “is guaranteed”.She said her agreement with Brussels “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future”, and moved to reassure unionists that “Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is guaranteed.“Under this deal the future is certainly bright for Northern Ireland.”On the backstop, Ms May said three things made it “an acceptable insurance policy”.She said the transition period could be extended instead of entering the backstop, regulations would be the same across all of the UK, and Northern Ireland would not be treated dferently.Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said:“The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before.

The Belfast Region City Deal will see a series of projects and schemes taking place across, Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Mid and East Antrim, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Newry, Mourne and Down. And with that, a series of major IT initiatives are being outlined, many in collaboration with Ulster University and Queen’s University, in a bid to grow and expand Northern Ireland’s credentials on a global scale. “Queen’s University Belfast and Ulster University have collaborated extensively to develop proposals for global centres of innovation excellence in key growth sectors in which world-leading expertise in our universities can be leveraged by businesses to create breakthrough technologies, products and services,” the City Deal proposal says. And it adds that a deal “requires a catalyst that will drive forward investment in research and development and help embed a culture of innovation to act as a driver for increased productivity”. The councils took their case to Westminster at the end of October, and following that, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced the Treasury’s commitment. The rest of the proposed funding will come from matched finance from Stormont, with the remaining from the councils. Andthey pull it off, they are predicting as many as , new jobs could be created. DIGITAL HEALTHCARE In a bid to further grow and develop Northern Ireland’s position on the international healthcare market, the City Deal proposes creating a branded cluster of medical device and technology companies that “through a supportive and collaborative eco system of co-location and working will build the size and value of the sector”. The centre aims to attract and develop businesses across a range of areas, especially in the areas of cardiology, diabetes, respiratory and stroke. It says that a key aspect of the proposed cluster is the partnership working with scientists and companies with the existing pilot clinical lab at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Also in the pipeline is the ‘i-Reach’ project. Led by Queen’s University, Ulster University and partners from the le and health sciences sector, those behind the City Deal say it sits within the umbrella of an “emerging health innovation NI concept which seeks to bring a unied ‘front door’ for external investment into the health and le sciences sector”. DIGITAL PARTNERSHIP It is proposing a “physical and digital environment” to allow the academic research community, tech entrepreneurs and industrial partners will come together to address key challenges in business and society through the application of the IoTand data science. Those behind it say it will support a common approach to big data sourcing and management, including early adoption of prevailing industry standards and codes of practice for secure and ethical use of data. There are also plans for a ‘global innovation institute’. The plans say it will draw together the skills of several areas of Queen’s University – which includes electronics, communications and information technology, health sciences and food security – to “anchor and support the creation of a Global Innovation Quarter in Belfast”. MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY According to those behind the City Deal, the will operate at the interface between academia and industry “accelerating new technology developments through the innovation phase and ensuring that real industrial challenges based on market need are solved through collaboration with the best university research”. Queen’s and Ulster University have developed an ‘advanced manufacturing innovation centre’ concept, that will “become the springboard for manufacturing innovation within the region”. CREATIVE INDUSTRIES Northern Ireland has already proven itself on the big and small screen, but there has been a strong move towards growing that further still. Aside from NI providing the facilities and backdrop for most of Game of Thrones, there’s also been the development of the Belfast Harbour Film Studios. Part of the City Deal plan involves boosting that position, with a ‘screen and media innovation lab’ bringing together “transformative production, studio and RD facilities”. SCIENCE PARK Elsewhere, in Mid and East Antrim, plans are under way for the transformation of the former St Patrick’s Barracks site in Ballymena into a new science park – Integrated Industrial Inspiration and Innovation Campus called iC. It’s being proposed that each council area will have some form of innovation hub, which will be directed towards business development. CONNECTIVITY Aside from specic schemes, infrastructure and connectivity improvements are part of the plans. That includes improvements in fibre-optic and mobiles broadband connectivity. It comes as mobile network EE, part of the BT Group, announced that Belfast is among six cities across the UK which have been chosen for the first phase of its G launch. “Our G trials are going well, giving us valuable insight into both the performance of the new technology and the challenges of upgrading sites with this new equipment,” Marc Allera, chief executive of BT’s consumer ision said. “We’re confident that we can bring G to the busiest parts of Belfast and the UK in .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"ni hospice the best of business and sport championing a force for good","story":"Posted on Tuesday  December  by Ulster Business The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice wants to partner with business leaders from right across the province. We speak to some of its supporters, including Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers, and why they are firmly behind the charity When Northern Ireland’s top sporting exports and business leaders are getting directly involved in a charitable cause as worthwhile as the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice, it’s hard to ignore the work the organisation is doing on a day-to-day basis.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice was established in  and is the only dedicated palliative care service in Northern Ireland. Among those working closely with the charity are Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers, founder of Vanrath, Wayne Sullivan and Pinnacle chairman, Ken Montgomery.The organisation cares for around  infants, children and their families, each year. With annual costs of £.m, the children’s hospice depends heavily on donations from the public to keep vital services going.But in addition to that, the children’s hospice is focused on boosting and growing philanthropic relationships with Northern Ireland business leaders who want to establish long-term links and a partnership with a charity who make a positive and meaningful impact across Northern Ireland.And as a result of that, it’s Time to Care programme was created – looking at new and innovative ways to reach out for key support.Heather Weir is chief executive of the NI Hospice. “The NI Hospice costs £m to run each year, and we have to raise £.m for direct care costs every year through our fundraising efforts,” she says.“As well as relying on the local community, we rely on business support too. With the vast amount of charities out there, we have been looking at how we can align the charity with business leaders and their companies, in terms of a fresh partnership approach.“We looked at how we could make supporting a charity feel really meaningful for businesses.“As a charity we need business insights, and not just in fundraising support. Having a network of business leaders is a practical way of supporting the hospice.”Heather says, aside from helping young people with le-limiting conditions, it’s also a chance for them to help improve their companies corporate social responsibility agenda.For Co Antrim man Brendan Rodgers – who paid a visit to the organisation’s Newtownabbey base alongside Wayne Sullivan and Ken Montgomery – the connection started with a letter from the NI Hospice, back when he was manager of Liverpool.“When I met Heather and came over, it was something from a personal perspective. We are all brought up as carers in Northern Ireland, and we want to give back. But I also felt that my role and responsibility as a manager – sport touches a lot of people and I could use it in a way that would hopefully open up doors for the NI Hospice in a dferent way.“In the last number of years, it’s been a great opportunity for me to meet people like Wayne, who I have met before – like-minded people who are very driven in their professional le, but alongside that, they have a real duty of care for organisation they support.”“What you have when you support the NI Hospice is something tangible.”Wayne Sullivan, founder of Vanrath, said: “What we have come up with is a project where all donations and funding goes into a specic account that is designated solely for the use of spending on nurse salaries.“You know where the money is going and that really ticks a box from our perspective. The nurses also come out to provide presentations of what they have been doing.“But asfor this, we get to use the brand and we co-partner. This is a marketing partnership.”The Time to Care relationship with companies also includes a Business Ambassadors network, which brings leaders together across a range of events.Ken Montgomery, chairman of Pinnacle, said: “For us at Pinnacle, my interest was the corporate social aspect of it and giving back to the community. Running a successful business in the community, I think there is a big role for corporates to play.”“It was also selling it to our own employees – the people working in the company. One of the things that appealed to me was having the direct contact with a particular nurse, and you felt the direct impact of what you are doing.”The key focus is enabling businesses to fund the cost of a qualied children’s nurse for a year. That relationship then offers a company access to co-branding opportunities and its own business network.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice has opened two new cots this year, at a cost of £, each. And for each cot, the children’s hospice needs five paediatric nurses.And the target for the NI Hospice in the next three years is focused on achieving maximum capacity, bringing it to  cots and beds, serving over , infants and children living with a le limiting and le threatening illness. That’s an additional £.m over the next three years that’s needed.   So, what’s the key message to get Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes involved “For most top businesses, their brand will have a set of values which is important to them.” Brendan says.“The key word is alignment... you want to align yourself with those values that will drive your business, your people and your customers or beneficiaries.”This year, it has also launched its Jingle All the Way campaign. It encourages businesses, organisations, schools, clubs, churches and iniduals across Northern Ireland to get involved and fundraise through a iety of areas, including a k run, a Jingle bake-off and a Jingle Jumper Day.Time to Care is a unique offer for business leaders to support the children’s hospice and the specialist nurses who  provide vital care to infants and children with a le limiting illness across Northern Ireland.

Here Emma Deighan looks at the who, what and why of STEM initiatives in the business sector According to the most recent Skills Barometer report the biggest shortage of skills in Northern Ireland falls within the science, technology, engineering and mathssectors.The research, compiled by Ulster University for the Department for the Economyin , shows an urgency to train future generations in what are the fastest-growing areas of our economy.In its analysis the report concluded: “The subjects forecast to be predominantly under-supplied are engineering and technology, maths and computer sciences and physical and environmental sciences. It is estimated that the economy will require an additional  engineering and technology graduates and a similar number of additional maths and computer science graduates each year. Strong demand for the STEM related subjects is forecast.”It’s a concern given the growth within those business isions here. An influx of international STEM related employers have set up shop here, investing in a skillset that still needs much attention. Meanwhile our homegrown hub of STEM related employers are expanding at a phenomenal rate.Some of these investments include Lisburn-based firm Camlin’s announcement that it will create  new roles in the engineering field thanks to a £m expansion. And in earlier in the year, financial services firm, FinTrU revealed it would add a further  employees to its team across Belfast and in the North West.Then there’s the hugely successful sports device firm, STATSports, that is seeking another  staff members. And two years ago Belfast-based global aerospace and defence system manufacturer Thales’ opened up a whole new field here when in it launched a £m space propulsion facility signalling a whole new area of expertise that would open up to graduates here. With the future looking bright in terms of employment in these sectors, sirens sound when the Skills Barometer says STEM related subjects have been regularly under-supplied. It described it as a “consistent finding” across several years of research but fortunately activity to level out the supply-demand flow within the STEM world here is by no means passive. Governmental, third sector organisations and indeed those businesses reliant on that talent pool have been engaging in initiatives to support a deficit in talent. Clinical diagnostics firm Randox is one such employer. Software development, IT support, engineering, science research and mathematics make up the bulk of its operations and as such it promotes roles within the latter fields through STEM programmes.Linda Magee, head of human resources at Randox, said: “At Randox there are plenty of opportunities to work across a wide iety of STEM disciplines. Our APEX programme, which offers first year university students a complete career package, includes work experience between first and second year, a paid placement in third year and, finally, a graduate position post-degree.“Students accepted on to the Randox APEX programme work with, and learn from, the most experienced professionals in the industry, across a range of departments within their discipline.“They might be assisting our ground-breaking research into tests for cancer, kidney disease and Alzheimer’s, working in our engineering department developing diagnostic technologies, contributing to the output of a busy forensics laboratory, or joining our business development teams as they expand the Randox portfolio across the globe.”Linda said the firm also encourages “established talent” to come back and join the company through a ‘ers’ programme, a six-week scheme aimed at those who have had a break from the workplace. It includes induction, training and mentoring.“There are endless opportunities for career progression at Randox – the sky really is the limit,” she said.Another firm with training high up its agenda is FinTrU, the investment bank services firm, at the Gasworks in Belfast.In terms of recruitment, FinTrU developed its two-year Graduate Programme with a long-term commitment to providing analysts with support, training and industry qualications such as Investment Operations Certicates .It also offers financial services academies which have resulted in almost  jobs for graduates in Belfast. Named Academy X,  this year’s intake welcomed a range of graduates from non-financial backgrounds to allow them to forge a career in the sector. Founder of the company, Darragh McCarthy, believes such programmes create an “ecosystem” that gives back to the talent pool and economy here. “I see FinTrU as having a social purpose to create high-quality professional employment in Northern Ireland,” he said.One of the most active firms in nurturing a talent pool in IT is Kainos. Each year the NI digital services giant donates over £, and , man hours to safeguarding the IT sector’s future. Kainos’ technology outreach manager Gemma Crothers said: “You can go into schools and they have this tumbleweed idea thatyou’re going to work in IT you literally get a PC and type stuff. And we want to change that perception.“There are so many dferent areas to IT. And it’s lucrative and that’s the message we’re trying to put across. We are trying to change the way the schools are managed and bring computer science in at a nationwide level and we are lobbying the government for that.“One of the big areas for us is trying to train teachers on all levels so they have the confidence in the classroom to weave the skills in and give the students the exposure they need so they can chose to follow through.”Kainos recently announced that it was seeking applications for its ‘Earn as you Learn’ scheme. It’s a funded computing systems degree that also allows students to earn a salary while they study. Brendan Mooney, Kainos’ chief executive said of the scheme offers students the best of both worlds. He said: “The pace of technological change is faster than ever. So, anyone who can obtain both industry experience and an education at the same time, will have the advantage. They get to apply what they have learned in university and also get a head start in their career.“At Kainos we pride ourselves on our determination to nurture and invest in the talent of the future and are committed to broadening access and offering dferent routes to school leavers from dferent backgrounds.”In the science field, Craigavon-based global pharmaceutical company Almac Group also works closely with schools and universities to encourage interest in STEM subjects and careers.Frances Weldon, STEM outreach manager at the firm said Almac believes it has a responsibility to drive interest in the field to “grow a dynamic and innovative economy that benefits all”.“At Almac we are hugely focused on engaging with the next generation and helping them gain skills that they will need for their future careers. We rely on the talent, skills and expertise of our dedicated employees to drive continued growth and realise our vision to advance human health. We know that to ensure our success in the future we need even more skilled and knowledgeable recruits.”Among its initiatives are the Sloane McClay and Almac McKervey awards, work shadow placements, apprenticeships and industrial placements for third level students, some of which do not require a science background. “In the new year, through a partnership with W, we will launch a £m project aimed at enhancing STEM knowledge, skills and understanding among school pupils. An interactive exhibition will explore the human body and the diagnosis and treatment of illness as well as telling Almac’s story,” Frances said.The objective she says is to “inspire a new generation of students to gain skills to help them secure exciting and innovative roles such as those we offer at Almac”.The latter investments represent just a fraction of STEM activity ongoing here. The wider picture of such initiatives is not just beneficial to STEM businesses but the economy as a whole here.

Seamus Leheny is just one voice in the increasingly tumultuous debate around the main concerns and issues that still exist around the border, following the UK’s exit from the EU. We currently sit on the precipice, a Schrodinger’s cat scenario, where we on one hand have some form of early agreement on ensuring noto a hard border, and at the same time, don’t, while waiting to see whether the Prime Minister can sell it. We then establish what will be done to avoid any severe impact to cross-border trade here. The BBC’s Chris Mason garnered attention with an honest abstract on Brexit progress a couple of weeks ago - ‘I haven’t for the foggiest idea’ he told his colleagues back in the studio. “When we turn our attention to commercial goods vehicles crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, it’s a very dferent story,” Seamus Leheny says. More than . million goods vehicles crossed the border in , according to official stats. And of those . million movements, the majority was recorded on the A Belfast to Dublin road. “When we break down the figures on cross border traffic, this equates to an average of , goods vehicles crossing the border daily, which is  per hour – or to illustrate it in comparison to cross channel movements, it’s a large freight ferry fully laden every  minutes,  ,  days a year,” Seamus says. For Dale Farm for example, and other food processors, its concern is over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says. “For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t. “It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate. “I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now. “Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.” Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy, as an example, is sold where. A study by InterTrade Ireland said a signicant share of cross-border trade is accounted for by firms that trade “simultaneously in both directions”. “These two-way traders make up around % of ﬁrms, but accounted for over % of exports and over % of imports,” according to Seamus. With transport, Translink boss Chris Conway says it remains unclearthe company will be able to run cross-border bus services,no deal on Brexit is secured. During an evidence session in Westminster, he said that the organisation runs around  cross-border services – some which, he said, “meander” between Northern Ireland and the Republic during a journey. There’s also the issue of whether drivers will be able to operate between jurisdictions following the UK’s exit. That’s due to a question mark floating over the head of licences for drivers in the EU. Elsewhere, the Road Haulage Association has said with around three months left to go it is not prepared for what’s around the corner. It’s a two-way street, of course, for both firms from Northern Ireland selling south, and those from the Republic selling north. Figures from the ONS show Northern Irish business with the Republic of Ireland accounted for around % of exports and % of imports. “The share of intermediate products in imports from Northern Ireland to Ireland is higher in almost all sectors than trade in the same sectors from the rest of the UK,” Seamus said in a piece examining the impact of a ‘no deal’ scenario. “So for example, a company could transport ingredients or components across the border several times before the finished product is completed in Northern Ireland, and is then ready for export to consumers in Great Britain. “Naturally the intermediate products will be of lesser value compared to the completed product, hence the disparity in value of goods crossing the Irish Sea compared to the land border. “In recent Brexit discussions the signicance of the value of trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain has been highlighted. “This is quite right and we must ensure this hugely important market for us is not jeopardised or impeded in any way as a result of Brexit. “What has often been overlooked is our reliance on being able to move goods quickly, cheaply and without tarfs across the Irish border, in order to assemble those valuable goods we end up shipping to Great Britain. “If the all-island supply chains are impeded with subsequent increased costs and subject to tarfs, then those exports we champion and put on those ferries to Great Britain will suddenly become less competitive in price – or, in the worst case scenario, won’t exist anymore.” Seamus says a “holistic approach is required when trade from Northern Ireland is discussed and used as a bargaining chip due to the fact it’s a unique economic region that is finely interwoven with that of another EU member state”. “To pursue, or indeed to sleep walk into, a no deal Brexit would unravel the carefully tailored economy of Northern Ireland and potentially leave it in tatters.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
