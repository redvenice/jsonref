Lol.\u0027The message was accompanied by a GIF of Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson shooting their proton pack weapons at a ghost in the 1984 cult classic Ghostbusters.Anne Boleyn was the second, and the most controversial and influential, of Henry VIII\u0027s six wives.The king had his first marriage to the childless Catherine of Aragon annulled so he could marry Anne, and by doing so broke with the Roman Catholic Church and triggered the English Reformation.          Anne Boleyn, portrayed by Natalie Dormer in the Showtime series The Tudors, was executed by her husband Henry VIII in 1536, after their marriage sparked the English Refomration  Over the course of their tumultuous marriage, Anne gave birth to a daughter who would go on to become Queen Elizabeth I, but failed to produce a male heir.In 1536, Henry ordered Anne to be executed by decapitation after trying her for adultery and incest.Samantha, who suffers from multiple sclerosis and is wheelchair-bound, has been feuding with Meghan since before the wedding, most often about her estrangement from their ailing 74-year-old father, Thomas Markle. Meghan, 34, and Harry, 37, are set to welcome their first child together sometime between April and May, which is when Samantha is planning to release her book, titled In The Shadows of The Duches, which, in the author\u0027s words, promises to uncover all of her sister\u0027s \u0027lies\u0027 and shed light on the rift in their family.In a tweet on Saturday, Samantha accused her sister of \u0027ghosting\u0027 their entire family.Samantha\u0027s barbed comments directed at Meghan come amid a litany of reports suggesting that the newly minted duchess and her royal husband have had a falling-out with Prince William and his wife, the Duchess of Cambridge.           Samantha has accused Meghan of ghosting her father Thomas and their side of the familyIt was also suggested that the mom-to-be duchess was overly demanding with staff, and that her personal assistant quit after being reduced to tears. Last month, it was announced that Harry and Meghan were moving out of Kensington Palace, where William and Kate reside with their three children, and relocating to Windsor. Despite a steady drumbeat of stories painting a picture of a strained relationship between the two royal couples, last week it emerged that William, Harry and their wives will join the Queen and other members of the royal family at Sandringham for Christmas, in an apparent show of unity.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Kendall Jenner Ben Simmons slip college basketball game canoodle","story":"    Kendall Jenner and her rumored boyfriend Ben Simmons stunned students when they turned up at a college basketball game in Philadelphia          The Keeping Up With The Kardashians superstar and the 76ers athlete slipped into a game at Drexel University on Saturday afternoon to watch as the Drexel Dragons took on the Robert Morris Colonials      Go hell for leather like Kendall wearing a coat by FrameAvailable at FWRDIf there is one coat doing the rounds amongst the A-list it’s got to be this one by Frame, which has already been seen on Kaia Gerber, Kylie Jenner and now it was Kendall Jenner’s turn.The model made quite the statement when attending a basketball game this week as she opted to wear the leather trench coat with straight-leg trousers and trainers, which resulted in a casual look.

There were nine flying saucers out in the desert near Area 51, he said – ‘flying discs’ being tested and flown and analyzed secretly by the US government. He’d seen them, this mystery man claimed not only that, he’d worked to reverse engineer the propulsion systems on aircraft that would have been ‘totally impossible’ for US officials to have created themselves.‘The propulsion system is a gravity propulsion system,’ the man – going by the pseudonym of ‘Dennis’ – told journalists in the studio. ‘The power source is an antimatter reactor. This technology does not exist at all.‘In fact, one of the reasons I’m coming forward with this information, it’s not only a crime against the American people it’s a crime against the scientific community, which I’ve been part of for some time, who are actively trying to duplicate these systems. Yet they are in existence now, basically, in the hands of the government.’And the government had gone to great lengths to keep him from talking, the ‘scientist’ claimed. He’d been warned that he’d be prosecuted for espionage even his life – and that of his wife – had been threatened, he claimed.‘Anything could happen I don’t know,’ said the man, sounding resigned. ‘I haven’t the slightest idea.’It wouldn’t be long before ‘Dennis’ was unmasked as Bob Lazar, an infamous name that continues to cause controversy and ripples in ufology communities around the world to this day. Type ‘Bob Lazar’ into Google, and almost every site, blog or thread mentioning him is niche, a playground for alien enthusiasts and conspiracy theorists. There’s not a lot about him in the mainstream media, particularly 30 years later.But in November 1989, when he appeared again on television, this time unobscured, Lazar’s coke bottle-glasses and deadpan, bookish appearance became recognizable globally. His claims about working near Area 51 at a hangar called S-4 – where he insisted he’d seen alien aircraft fitted with tiny seats and constructed with a then-undiscovered material called Element 115 – brought news crews from all over the country and the world, throngs of tourists hot on their heels.Scroll down for video           After his initial interview in May 1989, Lazar spoke on the record and on camera in November of the same year, revealing his identity to the world - subsequently unleashing huge waves of curiosity, support and criticism from various factions          Lazar stars in new documentary Bob Lazar: Area 51 and Flying Saucers, which features drawings he made of alien spacecraft he claims to have worked on - such as the above picture - in addition to interviews with his friends and family          Lazar\u0027s explosive 1989 claims attracted the interest of media from around the world, he descended upon the Nevada desert - along with throngs of tourist which continue to make the journey to this day, nearly 30 years later          While Lazar, left, now enjoys a low-profile and rarely speaks about his alleged work, he agreed to participate in the new film - directed by Jeremy Corbell, right - because he says he still receives \u0027emails from people wondering what happened to me and what direction my life took since releasing the information years ago. In addition, I have heard and seen so many fabricated stories and ridiculous versions of my life and experiences that it actually became entertaining. It seemed like there needed to be something on the record – something current’Listening at home in 1989, as Lazar steadfastly stood by his literally out-of-this world claims, was a curious 13-year-old named Jeremy Corbell. While Lazar faded from the public eye as time wore on, Corbell remained riveted by what he’d heard – and now, nearly 30 years later, he has directed new documentary Bob Lazar: Area 51 and Flying Saucers, about the controversial figure – re-investigating Lazar’s assertions and following the scientist to his quiet home in small-town Michigan.‘This concept that I heard on the radio was so transforming to me as a youth, as a kid at 13, that it weaponized my imagination,’ Corbell tells DailyMail.com. ‘It weaponized my curiosity. It forced me to want to become an active participant in learning the truth about UFOs.’Filmmaker Corbell names as his mentor journalist George Knapp, who first introduced Lazar to the world and who has continued investigating extraterrestrial claims over the decades. Knapp features prominently in the documentary, and both he and Corbell exhibit similar personalities: animated but deliberate, drawn as much to unexplained phenomena as soundbites and flowery language. Corbell describes Lazar to DailyMail.com, varyingly, as ‘like the Elvis,’ ‘the Bigfoot,’ and ‘the Messiah’ of ufology.Lazar himself, however, displays the opposite demeanor. He’s matter-of-fact in the documentary his glasses, his haircut, and his deadpan delivery haven’t changed in the slightest since his 1989 TV spot – and neither has his insistence that he saw what he saw, he worked where he worked, and the US government was absolutely studying alien aircraft more than 30 years ago. (The government denied the existence of Area 51 until CIA documents were released five years ago which listed the location as an aerial test site - though not for extraterrestrial spacecraft.)‘It’s changed my life a lot,’ Lazar says in the film, referring to his alleged part in those studies and his decision to go public. ‘It’s probably changed every aspect of it … for the most part, negative. I mean, it’s really difficult to find positive aspects of that. I mean, I’m sure there are some here and there, but most of them were negative.’     A major industry has built up in Nevada around Area 51 and alleged alien research done there, with businesses latching onto the theme to attract traffic and the state even renaming a 92-mile stretch of State Route 375 the Extraterrestrial Highway in 1996 journalist George Knapp says in the film that, after Lazar made his claims in 1989, \u0027every major news organization in the world beat a path to Area 51\u0027            \u0027Tens of thousands of people started showing up out there to see whatever it was that was flying around in the desert they\u0027re still coming, all these years later,\u0027 Knapp says in the film            Lazar claims to have attended MIT and Caltech before working at Los Alamos National Laboratory and near Area 51 at a hangar called S-4 neither school has any record of him attending. He counters: \u0027Do you think Los Alamos just hired me out of high school?\u0027          Phyllis Berliner, Lazar\u0027s mother, shares a story in the film about how her son outfitted a bicycle with \u0027a jet engine\u0027 as a boy she adds: \u0027You believe him or not. It’s a fearful thing to think that there’s something out there that we don’t know anything about. Are they dangerous? Can they hurt us? Will they attack us? You don’t want to know, so you don’t believe it. You’d rather not believe there might be other things out there, other things in the universe. There has to be. We can’t be all by ourselves. We can’t be\u0027          While evidence was never uncovered to support many of Lazar\u0027s claims, his name was found listed in a 1982 Los Alamos phone directory and an article that pre-dated  his TV appearances listed him as a scientist with the national laboratory          Lazar now runs United Nuclear in small-town Michigan, which producers lasers and other scientific materials and equipment he leads a quiet life with his wife, Joy, who told filmmaker Cobell: \u0027I don’t know about UFOs and all this stuff, but I’ll tell you one thing – he’s the most honest person that I have ever met, and I’ve slept next to him for 18 years’‘That’s the important stuff. It almost seems like this is an intentional distraction. You need to pay attention to the bigger picture. If you really want to research all the other stuff, fine, go ahead and do it – but you really need to pay attention to what I’m saying, because I have better things to do than coming up with this.‘I don’t like being in the public eye I don’t have money for doing this – and, quite frankly, I could make up a better lie. But I have no motivation to lie this hasn’t helped me out.’Corbell, for his part, went to great lengths to verify some of Lazar’s claims. The ‘scientist’ had always described a security device which scanned the bones of employees’ hands at secret government locations the filmmaker found one on the internet, and Lazar reacts with a mixture of amazement and satisfaction when Corbell points it out on camera.Lazar had also described a man named Mike Thigpen who he said vetted him for government work Corbell says in the documentary that he tracked the man down to the East Coast, and Thigpen confirmed the information via phone. But Thigpen, Corbell says, declines to appear on camera ‘because he doesn’t want to put a dark shadow on the work he did before – but personally conveyed that was his job, that was exactly what he did in Vegas in 1989.’And various outside developments over the years have also given more weight to Lazar’s story, many claim. Fifteen years ago, an Element 115 was added to the periodic table – moscovium, a radioactive synthetic element first synthesized by a joint team of Russian and American scientists. On top of that, just last year the Department of Defense confirmed for the first time that it had financed a UFO program – after officials denied for decades that any such research had ever existed anywhere within the government.All of those developments – and likely the alleged verifications made by Corbell in his film – serve as a major boon for Lazar’s supporters. The documentary also interviews the people who know him best – his friend, his wife, a United Nuclear employee, even Lazar’s mother – in an effort to get to the heart of who Lazar really is and what he truly believes.Mysterious \u0027cigar-shaped\u0027 UFO spotted hovering in the sky...UFO investigation launched by Irish aviation officials after...Share this articleHis wife, a trim, sharply dressed blond Lazar met more than a decade after his 1989 fame, is ‘a godsend in his life they share great moral strength and fiber and values,’ Corbell tells DailyMail.com.He continues: ‘Bob’s wife doesn’t care about UFOs she didn’t date Bob 18 years ago, get together with Bob … she didn’t even know about the UFOs. They don’t talk about UFOs. That’s not their life that’s not their relationship.‘However, she did tell me one thing. She said something about Bob she said, “I don’t know about UFOs and all this stuff, but I’ll tell you one thing – he’s the most honest person that I have ever met, and I’ve slept next to him for 18 years.\u0027And whatever academic credentials Lazar may or may not have, his mother, Phyllis Berliner, paints the picture of a child gifted with a scientific mind from a very young age. She describes in the film being awoken by a huge bang at 6 o’clock one Sunday morning when Lazar was a boy, after he outfitted his bicycle with ‘a jet engine.’She felt ‘scared out of my mind,’ Berliner says in the documentary. ‘I didn’t know what he was going to do next – was he going to blow up the house? Blow up the world?’She adds: ‘I want him to be happy. If vindication is what he wants, fine. But that’s up to him. You believe him or not. It’s a fearful thing to think that there’s something out there that we don’t know anything about. Are they dangerous? Can they hurt us? Will they attack us? You don’t want to know, so you don’t believe it. You’d rather not believe there might be other things out there, other things in the universe.‘There has to be. We can’t be all by ourselves. We can’t be,’ she says.          Lazar looks as if he has barely aged since his explosive television appearance nearly 30 years ago his trademark coke bottle glasses and deadpan demeanor remain the same          In addition to the work he says he witnessed at Area 51, Lazar tells DailyMail.com: ‘I’m certain research continues involving the working of the alien craft and technology – somewhere in the USA, but I do have to wonder, what other projects government entities might be involved with along the same lines\u0027          Lazar claimed that he he\u0027d been threatened with prosecution for espionage and even death to scare him away from going public he tells DailyMail.com now: ‘At the risk of sounding paranoid, I do always have a suspicion that someone is monitoring me – it’s something that is difficult to get out of my mind’      "},{"url":null,"title":"Georgina Chapman Huma Abedin pictured rare outing NYC grabbing dinner","story":"    Sisters are doin\u0027 it for themselves: Georgina Chapman and Huma Abedin were pictured grabbing dinner in New York City on Sunday night (pair above)          Standin\u0027 on their own two feet: The pair were spotted dining at the Indian eatery Tamarind in Tribeca, just one black from the former offices of The Weinstein Company      The conscious liberation of the female state: Chapman has yet to finalize her orce from estranged husband Harvey Weinstein while Abedin and her jailed ex Anthony Weiner orced last year          Mothers, daughters and their daughters too: The two have known one another for years due to Chapman\u0027s involvement in the Hillary Clinton campaign, and her son Dashiell, 6, would have plays dates with Abedin\u0027s son Jordan, who is the same ageThe two have known one another for years due to Chapman\u0027s involvement in the Hillary Clinton campaign, and her son Dashiell, 6, would have plays dates with Abedin\u0027s son Jordan, who is the same age.Their sons do not attend the same school, but the women used to live just a mile apart from one another.Abedin also spent time in the Hamptons with Chapman back in 2014 and 2015 when her boss Hillary rented the mansion next door to the one that was owned by Weinstein.The mogul has since sold the mansion, along with all his other properties.Georgina Chapman DITCHES Huma Abedin after they share dinner...If looks could kill: Chris Watts stares daggers at wife...REVEALED: Shallow Grave where Chris Watts buried his wife...Share this articleAnd in a Vogue piece about Chapman earlier this year, Abedin was not shy to address the most well-known similarity between the women - their predatory husbands.Weinstein is facing possible criminal charges for the alleged rape and assault of multiple women while Weiner is serving time on charges that stem from his sexual exchanges with an underage minor online.The FBI learned of Weiner\u0027s unlawful actions after DailyMail.com exclusively revealed that the disgraced politician had been exchanging sexually-charged messages with a 15-year-old high school student for close to three months.\u0027This particular club, ironically, it’s not such a small one: women who have had to endure it in such a public way, women like Georgina and me,\u0027 explained Abedin of their husbands\u0027 misconduct.\u0027People don’t feel sorry for us you don’t get that empathy.

He did not settle for anything less than a complete surrender by Jeffrey Epstein,\u0027 Scarola said.           In a statement read by his lawyer, Epstein (pictured in 2008) apologized to and admitted to making \u0027totally false allegations\u0027          Brad Edwards was all smiles while speaking to Jeffrey Epstein\u0027s attorney\u0027s Scott Link and Jack Goldberger prior to a civil settlement announcement made in Palm Beach County Court Tuesday.

He was reportedly allowed out for up to 12 hours a day to visit his office and meet clients.  The \u0027non prosecution\u0027 deal with the state also meant he, his named co-conspirators and his unnamed co-conspirators were given immunity from federal prosecution.  The deal was also sealed from the public and the victims, meaning no one would  ever learn the entirety of Epstein\u0027s crimes. It was revealed last week that the deal was brokered by President Trump\u0027s Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta when he was US Attorney for the Southern District of Florida.              Trump\u0027s current Labor Secretary Alex Acosta (right) was the top federal prosecutor in Miami that brokered the deal to have Epstein serve just over a year behind bars instead of life behind bars In the second case mentioned by Scarola today, his client Edwards is suing the US government on behalf of three victims in the sex investigation.  He alleges it violated the Crime Victims\u0027 Right Act, which states victims should be kept informed of possible hearings and \u0027reasonably heard\u0027 over pleas and sentencing.  Jeffrey Epstein\u0027s victims could finally have their day in...Killer dad Chris Watts has been secretly moved from a...Share this articleEdwards wrote in a court filing that if the victims knew about the non-prosecution agreement \u0027they would have taken steps to object\u0027, according to the New York Times.      Epstein could be stripped of his criminal prosecution immunity if the case succeeds, possibly leading to a federal trial for the sex crimes. Scarola had said earlier this week that the purpose of the second case is to \u0027invalidate Epstein\u0027s non-prosecution agreement\u0027 which also granted immunity to his co-conspirators. At a press conference after the hearing, Mr Scarola re-emphasized the bid to quash Epstein\u0027s plea deal.He said: \u0027We have tried for a long time to convey the injustice done to Bradley Edwards and the injustice that continues to be done to the victims of Epstein\u0027s abuse as a consequence of the plea bargain that not only resulted in immunity for Jeffrey Epstein, but handed out get-out-of-jail cards to his named and unnamed co-conspirators as well.\u0027That injustice needs to be addressed and will be addressed through the pro bono efforts of Bradley Edwards and his co-counsel.\u0027Mr Edwards told reporters: \u0027I am getting calls from my clients who have been hidden but pushed into silence, scared to death, finally saying thank you for standing up to him (Epstein) and sending him to the brink until he had to admit you win, he lost.\u0027They are willing to talk.

The same year, Congress passed the National Prohibition Act, which was known as the Volstead Act for the congressman who helped to pass it, to enforce Prohibition. President Woodrow Wilson vetoed the act, but Congress overrode it.The act took effect on January 16, 1920 – the start of Prohibition. The amendment enjoyed popular support, Rorabaugh wrote, and consumption of alcohol during the early 1920s ‘may have dropped by two-thirds.’However, gangsters and the mob took over the alcohol trade and were earning enormous sums of money - for instance, a 12-bottle case of Canadian liquor went for $250, six times the price before Prohibition - by the mid-1920s, according to the book.‘Gang violence turned many Americans against Prohibition,’ Rorabaugh wrote. On February 14, 1929, seven men were shot in the morning in Chicago  on what became known as the Saint Valentine’s Day Massacre. Reportedly, Al Capone ordered the hit on his rival George ‘Bugs’ Moran and his gang. Moran escaped death, Capone was the king of Chicago but the notorious crime shook the nation.      Above, the front page of the New York Daily Mirror, owned by William Randolph Hearst, on December 5, 1933 that touted the end of Prohibition. The start of Prohibition was January 16, 1920 and it took until the ratification of 21st Amendment on December 5, 1933 for it to end.

People also imbibed at ice cream stores, soft drink shops, beauty parlors, and funeral homes, and, of course, at their homes, according to W.J. Rorabaugh\u0027s recent book, ‘Prohibition: A Concise History’          During Prohibition, speakeasies lacked signs, had bouncers to screen customers, and in some instances only admitted those ‘who knew the correct code words or had printed passes,’ according to W.J. Rorabaugh\u0027s book, ‘Prohibition: A Concise History’. They also admitted women.

He won the presidency and wasted no time after his inauguration on March 4, 1933, signing soon after the Beer and Wine Revenue Act, which allowed for the sale of beer that contained 3.2 percent alcohol. But most importantly, it levied a tax on all alcoholic beverages. The act went into effect on April 7, and the government started collecting taxes almost immediately. Above, people toasted with beer at a Chicago hotel on April 7          Some consider April 7, 1933 to be the end of Prohibition. President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Beer and Wine Revenue Act, which allowed for the sale of beer, on March 22, and it took effect on April 7. In the image above, a crowd gathers on Broadway in New York City to celebrate that act and a beer keg is held aloft toward the bottom right near the subway sign          Prohibition began on on January 16, 1920 and made it illegal to manufacture, sell or transport alcohol in the United States. Dubbed the \u0027noble experiment,\u0027 it was the attempt to make the country \u0027dry\u0027 and get people to abstain from alcohol, which was from blamed for many societal issues, such as domestic violence, crime and child abuse.

During Prohibition, law enforcement tried to enforce the ban on the sale of alcohol, and bottles of liquor as well as barrels of beer were often poured out          From January 16, 1920 until December 5, 1933, it was illegal in the United States to ‘manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors,\u0027 and the country was supposedly \u0027dry.\u0027 But people still drank and an illicit trade in alcohol flourished. In the above image, contraband beer was emptied out onto the street sometime during Prohibition          There was less alcohol consumption during Prohibition, in part because it was so expensive to buy. For instance, a 12-bottle case of Canadian liquor went for $250, six times the price before the ban on ‘manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors.’ The above image shows a tower of barrels of alcohol sometime in 1930          Above, a woman next to a sign that supported the repeal of the 18th Amendment in 1927. The ratification of the 21st Amendment - which repealed the 18th Amendment - on December 5, 1933 marked the official end of Prohibition. While initially some supported Prohibition, gang violence stemming from the mob\u0027s and bootleggers\u0027 illicit alcohol trade turned some Americans against Prohibition           When the stock market crashed in 1929 and the country was plunged into the Great Depression, the push to repeal the 18th Amendment and end Prohibition intensified. In New York, workers, above, protested against Prohibition and carried signs stating \u0027We want beer\u0027 sometime in 1930          Franklin D. Roosevelt won the presidency in 1932 partly because he wanted to end Prohibition. One of his first acts in office was signing the Beer and Wine Revenue Act, which allowed for the sale of beer, on March 22, 1933 and it took effect on April 7. The act also gave the government the power to levy taxes on alcohol, bringing in much needed revenue during the Great Depression. Above, people protested Prohibition and called for the repeal of the 18th Amendment          Women were both a force for the Temperance Movement in the early 1820s as well as later fighting for the end of Prohibition, as shown in the above photo, taken on July 3, 1930 in Birmingham, Michigan          In the above image, a woman holds beer while on top of beer barrels in 1933.

Big fan of yours!’I replied, and for the next few months, we corresponded on a regular basis.We’d chat about everything from US gun violence (she shares my horror of it) to a charity trip she made for the United Nations to Rwanda, spinning classes, calligraphy, and our joint hatred of 4am filming call-times - hers for Suits and mine for Good Morning Britain in the UK.She even started sending me early preview episodes of her show so we could debate juicy storylines yet to air – which we did, at length.Meghan introduced me via cyberspace to another Suits cast member, Rick Hoffman - who played Louis Litt – and he and I also began to regularly correspond. He described their relationship to me as so close it felt like ‘brother and sister’.In February 2016, Rick came to London and at my invitation, he appeared on Good Morning Britain.Nobody really knew who he was here, nor Meghan for that matter, but we had a fun interview and I sent the photos to Meghan afterwards - who was thrilled by them.          When her co-star Hoffman was in London in early 2016, I had him on my show - even though no one knew who he was in the UK. They didn\u0027t know who Meghan was either thenMeghan and Harry set to stay with Kate and William at Anmer...\u0027She social climbed her way out of my orbit\u0027: Piers Morgan...Samantha Markle mocks sister Meghan over claims she wanted...Share this articleIn early June, 2016, she messaged me to say: ‘I’m in London for a week of meetings and Wimbledon. Would love to say hi!’I suggested my local pub, the Scarsdale Tavern in Kensington – ironically just a few hundred yards from where she now lives at Kensington Palace.‘Serena Williams sends her love,’ she texted on the day from Wimbledon, where she was watching her friend play in the annual tennis tournament. ‘You’re very popular as it turns out. Get you!’I don’t hear those words very often, so they made an impression…Then she turned up at the pub and we had a very enjoyable time for 90 minutes or so before I put her in a taxi to a dinner she was having with friends at 5 Hertford Street, a fashionable club in London’s Mayfair.She spoke very candidly about her family - there were some private, sensitive things she told me I would never repeat because they were said in confidence - Donald Trump (she’s not a fan), and of course, Suits.She asked me for advice on her career and the media, and if she could come on Good Morning Britain next time she was over, which I said I would arrange.From the cab, Meghan sent me a series of texts thanking me and saying she was looking forward to meeting up again next time we were in the same city.She even publicly tweeted about how nice it was to see her ‘friend’ – me – in London.So at this point, I was indeed labouring under the massive misapprehension that we were friends.I was wrong.She met Prince Harry at the dinner that night, went on a solo date with him the next night, and I never heard from her again.Not a word.I’d been ghosted.          She met Prince Harry at a dinner the night we met in person, went on a solo date with him the next night, and I never heard from her again. Or her costar. I\u0027d been used. They were just rudeAnd not just by her.At Meghan’s behest, Rick Hoffman ghosted me too.I didn’t hear from him again for 18 months, then he eventually crawled out of the woodwork after attending the big royal wedding last May.‘Piers! I am very sorry for not responding,’ he wrote in a lengthy message. ‘You must understand, once I heard the news, out of respect for Meghan, I couldn’t share a thing. Now I can share fun stuff! I would love to catch up at that favorite pub of yours. Hope to hear from you pal. Love you pal. Rick.’I didn’t reply, because no, I didn’t ‘understand’.A real ‘pal’ doesn’t ghost a friend for 18 months, right?That’s just rude.In fact, I found the behaviour of the pair of them damn rude.I’d been ‘played’ by a couple of B-list actors, who were clearly just using me to advance their careers.           From the moment I read that Harry barked ‘What Meghan wants, Meghan gets! at staff in the run-up to the wedding, my heart sankBut when someone more important and influential came along, in the shape of Prince Harry, I was instantly dumped like a sack of spuds (that’s what we call potatoes in the UK).Now, on a certain level, I grudgingly admire the work.And frankly, who am I, a former tabloid newspaper editor, to take a dim view of such ruthless antics?But on another level, the whole experience left me feeling suspicious and cynical about Ms Markle.And nothing in her behaviour since marrying Prince Harry has alleviated those concerns.From the moment I read that he barked ‘What Meghan wants, Meghan gets! at palace courtiers in the run-up to the wedding, my heart sank.Because I fear that’s exactly what she’s used to getting.And anyone or anything that may not give her what she wants or gets in the way of her social climbing self-advancement gets discarded.Her first husband? Ditched as her Suits career took off.Her dysfunctional family? Banned from the wedding – all of them.Her poor old ailing Dad? Cut off and disowned for struggling to cope with media attention about his daughter.Meghan’s swapped her dreary, problematic old real world for a thrilling new fantasy world of the Queen, Michelle Obama and the Clooneys.Only her mother Doria made the cut to Princess Meghan’s AAA-list new life.          Her first husband Trevor was ditched as her Suits career took off          She ditched her family, cut off her ailing father and and only mom Doria made the list to Princess Meghan’s AAA-list new lifeBut pieces of work never change their spots.Now, there is a steady flow of negative stories streaming from Palace ‘insiders’ about Meghan’s alleged a antics.She was said to have ‘displeased’ the Queen by demanding an emerald tiara for the wedding.There are rumours of a growing rift with the Duchess of Cambridge, who was reported to have burst into tears over Meghan’s hostile behaviour during a bridesmaid dress fitting for her daughter Princess Charlotte.Kate was also reported to have complained about Meghan being needlessly unpleasant to a royal member of staff.          Now, there is a steady flow of negative stories streaming from Palace ‘insiders’ about Meghan’s antics and rumors of a rift with the Duchess of Cambridge, who she reportedly made cry. Kate has also reportedly complained that Meghan is unpleasant to a member of staffMeghan’s personal assistant Melissa Toubati recently quit after just six months in the job after also being left in tears.Royal courtiers are said to be already ‘fed up’ with her domineering and dictatorial attitude that involves daily 5am email demands and even led to her apparently insisting on air fresheners to hide the ‘musty odour’ of St George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle.It was an absurd request that was very firmly denied.When Palace ‘insiders’ start leaking this amount of damaging mud, you can be certain that much of it is true.And given my unfortunate experience with her, I’m afraid I’m not remotely surprised.It’s got nothing to do with sexism or racism, as some ridiculous commentators have suggested.No, I think it’s far simpler than that: Meghan Markle is a self-obsessed professional actress who has landed the role of her life and is determined to milk it for all she’s worth.

Ryan Coogler\u0027s superhero sensation has already notched countless records, pulverized box-office myths and set new marks for inclusivity. And now, \u0027Black Panther\u0027 is in line to shatter Oscar norms, too.All of this year\u0027s contenders have by now screened, and Oscar prognosticators generally have \u0027Black Panther\u0027 in, comfortably, as a best picture nominee. Both the pundit survey \u0027Gurus of Gold\u0027 and Hollywood Reporter awards analyst Scott Feinberg place \u0027Black Panther\u0027 fifth, behind front-runners \u0027A Star Is Born,\u0027 \u0027\u0027Roma,\u0027 \u0027\u0027Green Book\u0027 and \u0027The Favourite.\u0027 Gold Derby slots \u0027Black Panther\u0027 in at No. 7, still easily within the category\u0027s range of up to 10 nominees.   It\u0027s also up for Ryan Coogler\u0027s direction, for Joe Robert Cole and Coogler\u0027s script, Kendrick Lamar\u0027s song \u0027All the Stars\u0027 and Michael B. Jordan\u0027s performanceMuch is still in flux in the Oscar race ahead of Thursday morning\u0027s Golden Globes nominations. But unless something drastic happens, \u0027Black Panther\u0027 will next month become the first comic book film to be nominated for best picture and easily Marvel Studios\u0027 most significant Oscar contender ever.That\u0027s very good news for ABC\u0027s Feb. 24 telecast which is coming off an all-time low of 26.5 million viewers. Some 55.2 million watched \u0027Titanic\u0027 sweep the 1997 Oscars, and producers have long harbored dreams of another big-tent blockbuster pulling viewers to a broadcast increasingly dominated by independent films like \u0027The Shape of Water,\u0027 \u0027\u0027Moonlight\u0027 and \u0027Spotlight.\u0027 Usually, bigger movies mean bigger ratings.For the makers of \u0027Black Panther,\u0027 it\u0027s a new chapter for a film - with more than $1.3 billion in ticket sales, the third-highest all-time domestic gross and the biggest box-office hit ever directed by a black man - that has already filled record books. What does Coogler think of \u0027Black Panther\u0027 as an Oscar movie?\u0027Fortunately, I don\u0027t have to think about it that much,\u0027 the 32-year-old filmmaker of \u0027Fruitvale Station\u0027 and \u0027Creed\u0027 said in an interview. \u0027I\u0027ve grown to have close relationships with my collaborators, so I care about the crafts people who work on the film and the actors who work on the film. Because of those relationships, I\u0027m happy when they\u0027re happy. It\u0027s always nice when people are recognized for their work. But beyond that, I really don\u0027t worry about it.\u0027 The film is also in the running for Ruth Carter\u0027s costume design, the cinematography of Rachel Morrison and Hannah Beachler\u0027s production designYet few films will be watched more closely through awards season than \u0027Black Panther,\u0027 which is also in the running for Ruth Carter\u0027s costume design, the cinematography of Rachel Morrison (who last year became the first woman ever nominated in the category), Hannah Beachler\u0027s production design, Coogler\u0027s direction, the script by Joe Robert Cole and Coogler, Kendrick Lamar\u0027s song \u0027All the Stars\u0027 and Michael B. Jordan\u0027s supporting performance.\u0027Black Panther\u0027 has already been at the center of the uproar over the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\u0027 short-lived plans to institute a \u0027best popular film\u0027 category. The academy\u0027s move was intended to rope in more box-office hits to the broadcast, but critics said such a category would potentially ghettoize films like \u0027Black Panther\u0027 from the prestigious honor of best picture. (Coogler declined to address the category\u0027s scuttling.)While superhero films have dominated multiplexes for the last decade, the Oscars have been famously resistant to them. Ten years ago, \u0027The Dark Knight\u0027 earned eight nominations but missed out on best picture, prompting the film academy to expand the category the following year.   Coogler had a sense he wasn\u0027t alone in wanting a connection to the film, that others felt a need for it, too. \u0027But,\u0027 he says, \u0027I could never imagine to the extent that it did\u0027          With more than $1.3 billion in ticket sales, the film has the third-highest all-time domestic grossMany of the academy\u0027s members resent how superheroes have come to dominate the industry, but there have been some signs lately that anti-Marvel sentiment is ebbing. Last year, while \u0027Wonder Woman\u0027 failed to earn a nod, the Wolverine sequel \u0027Logan\u0027 became the first superhero film nominated for best adapted screenplay . This year, best animated film may also be a superhero battle, with \u0027Incredibles 2\u0027 and \u0027Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\u0027 among the favorites.But the awards campaign for \u0027Black Panther\u0027 is predicated less on its superhero DNA than on its cultural impact and on its personal nature as, despite its budget, an auteur film by one of the most widely respected young filmmakers in Hollywood. \u0027Black Panther\u0027 last week for a day played for free in arthouse theaters nationwide in an event put on by Art House Convergence and Film Comment.George H.W. Bush\u0027s service dog Sully visits his casket in...Grateful George W. and Laura Bush make a surprise visit to...Share this articleFor Coogler, making \u0027Black Panther\u0027 couldn\u0027t be more personal. It was a journey in finding his own connection to Africa. While developing the script, he visited South Africa, Kenya and the Kingdom of Lesotho - a tiny nation that inspired Coogler\u0027s Wakanda.\u0027In simple terms, the film is what brought me to the continent,\u0027 says Coogler. \u0027It was kind of a lifelong thing just to get there and see it. The thing that I found was a sense of identity as an African person. I found in those trips and through that research a definition for myself of what it means to be African. That was a question I was seeking as a filmmaker.\u0027Coogler had a sense he wasn\u0027t alone in wanting that connection, that others felt a need for it, too. \u0027But,\u0027 he says, \u0027I could never imagine to the extent that it did.\u0027\u0027Black Panther\u0027 arrived to feverish enthusiasm and debuted in the most resplendent and regal Hollywood premiere of the decade. It has been called \u0027a defining moment for Black America,\u0027 pop-culture myth-making at its best and the best big-budget studio epic in ages. Parents took their kids and kids took their parents in a groundbreaking generational event. Theaters were rented out. It was the No. 1 film at the U.S. box office for five straight weeks.\u0027We always saw it as a film to watch with your loved ones, with your friends and with strangers, in communal settings,\u0027 says Coogler. \u0027People are still interested in doing that and it feels fortunate.\u0027In a year where Netflix has a formidable Oscar contender in Alfonso Cuaron\u0027s \u0027Roma,\u0027 and fears of the diminishing of the theatrical experience pervade the industry, that may be the most appealing reason for academy members to vote for \u0027Black Panther\u0027: It proved the still-vibrant, earth-shattering power of the movie theater.

But she is far from being well known and the jury said her recent work represented a breakthrough into a new, more expansive way of working.Speaking after her win, Prodger said: “I feel very honoured, blown away really. It’s quite surreal. It feels lovely.”The artist said she used an iPhone for her work because she was on her own a lot and the phone felt like an extension of her: “Because of that ease of use and the way you can use it while you are going about the world. For me, everything is in there.”Asked what she might do with the prize money, Prodger said: “I’ll live on it. I’ll pay my rent and my studio rent and some bills. Maybe there’ll be a little treat … probably a nice jacket. Don’t hold me to that!” Alex Farquharson, director of Tate Britain, who chaired the judging panel, said Prodger’s work represented the “most profound use of a device as prosaic as the iPhone camera that we’ve seen in art to date”.Prodger, 44, won for her solo exhibition at the Bergen Kunsthall in Norway, which featured two film works, Bridgit and Stoneymollan Trail. The 32-minute film Bridgit has been on display at Tate Britain as part of its Turner prize exhibition.The film is difficult to explain. There is lots going on, a lot of it apparently randomly. It explores class, gender, sexuality and neolithic goddesses.Prodger filmed the work over the course of a year and included footage of her at home and on her travels. Her narration includes snatches of autobiography – coming out in Aberdeenshire in the early 90s, people being unable to tell whether she is a boy or girl, the assumption that her girlfriend is her daughter. She also quotes from Julian Cope’s The Modern Antiquarian.The artist has described the piece as being about the fluidity of identity from a queer perspective an exploration of the intertwining of landscape, body, technology and time.Farquharson said the jury felt Bridgit was “incredibly impressive in the way that it dealt with lived experience, the formation of a sense of self through disparate references”. He said the work evoked traditions in landscape art and had psychological weight. “It ends up being so unexpectedly expansive. This is not what we expect from video clips shot on iPhones.”It took the jury more than four hours to reach its decision. “I think the jury was united in a feeling that this work was introducing something new to the filmic medium and how it is used in art,” Farquharson said.All four nominees – three iniduals and a collective – made film work, all of it in some way political. Depending on your perspective, this year’s exhibition was either the most wonderfully captivating in memory or the hardest work. Certainly, it is not a show that should be experienced quickly the Tate recommends four and a half hours.It has ided critics. The Observer’s Laura Cumming called it the best in years, “by turns shattering, absorbing, beguiling, highly political, frequently momentous”. Waldemar Januszczak in the Sunday Times wrote: “From beginning to end, this soul-crusher of a show is unusually awful.”The favourite of many visitors had been Forensic Architecture, a collective that has been described as an “architectural detective agency” investigating state crimes and human rights abuses across the world.Based at Goldsmiths, University of London, the group consists of architects, film-makers, journalists, archaeologists, scientists, lawyers and software developers. For the Turner prize show, it exhibited the results of its investigations into deaths during a 2017 pre-dawn raid by Israeli police on a Bedouin village in the Negev desert.The Turner prize, running since 1984, often exasperates and thrills in equal measure and is no stranger to controversy. The closest it came this year was protests against the artist Luke Willis Thompson, a New Zealander of European and Fijian heritage.Some took exception to his video work Autoportrait, a silent film portrait of Diamond Reynolds, the girlfriend of Philando Castile, who was shot dead by police in Minnesota. Thompson was accused of casting a white, middle-class gaze on cases of black suffering. A group of protesters wearing T-shirts reading Black Pain Is Not for Profit sat in protest on the exhibition sofas in September.The fourth artist nominated was Naeem Mohaiemen, who exhibited two 90-minute films, one about a man living alone in an abandoned airport, the other about moments in the history of Bangladesh.The winner was decided by a jury comprising Oliver Basciano, an art critic Elena Filipovic, director of the Kunsthalle Basel Lisa Le Feuvre, executive director of the Holt-Smithson Foundation and the novelist Tom McCarthy.Last year’s Turner prize exhibition was in Hull. This year’s was in London, and next year the circus rolls on to Margate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29135c445f2377c60673816b310293b895e35f47/0_0_4724_3848/master/4724.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc652ef88dcfeded5cdac2c7ca6e6945 1010w","title":"kathmandu earthquake debt nepal","story":"Survivors of the 2015 quake that killed almost 9,000 people around Kathmandu now face another challenge they didn’t expectRatna Awale counts herself lucky. She and her husband, Prem, and their two sons survived the devastating 7.8-magnitude earthquake in Nepal on 25 April 2015 that killed almost 9,000 people.But her narrow four-storey home in Patan, a sprawling, historical city south of Kathmandu, was badly damaged. “There were big cracks from the back of the house to the front wall, and half the ground floor collapsed,” she says.The damage across the country cost Nepal an estimated $10bn (£7.8bn), cutting its already meagre economic output in half. The government subsequently offered hundreds of thousands of homeowners $3,000 (£2,300) each to rebuild their homes.The problem doesn’t stop with inidual homeowners. Durbar Square in Kathmandu is a stunning medley of Hindu and Buddhist temples, and a major draw for tourists. Many buildings, including the 18th-century Nautale Durbar palace, were badly damaged or destroyed.With the government heavily indebted, restoration in many cases is being provided for free by the Chinese and other countries. Though the Nepalese government has welcomed China’s help, Beijing’s influence over its small neighbour has risen dramatically. Some wonder whether it could lead to a so-called debt trap, as has happened in Sri Lanka, where the government has leased a key port to a Chinese company after struggling to repay it for building it.The challenges facing the authorities are enormous. Nepal is a mountainous country subject to chronic political upheaval, and only recently emerged from civil war. Repairing the damage from the earthquake is a monumental task and the $3,000 grants were never designed to fully cover the cost of rebuilding.“There are more than 820,000 houses eligible – the scale is massive,” says Siobhan Kennedy of HRRP. “It’s bigger than Pakistan in 2005 and Haiti in 2010 in terms of the number of houses that need to be rebuilt. In terms of scale, this is huge.”But just getting the money to those who need it can be difficult. “The biggest problem for us is that many people don’t officially own their own property,” says Rakesh Maharjan, an IT officer at the Earthquake Housing Reconstruction Project in Patan, which oversees the distribution of grants in the area. “They don’t have title deeds.”He says that in Lalitpur, the municipality that incorporates Patan, fewer than one-fifth of homeowners who applied for the government grant have received all three tranches.Authorities introduced deadlines that applicants had to meet to receive the payout. But that has led to unforeseen consequences: many homeowners are using the proceeds to hastily construct small, one-room buildings that are clearly unsuitable for families.For Santosh Maharjan, a 25-year-old student whose family began rebuilding their house in Patan last April, the biggest problem remains getting access to money.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c33668c2ab740faab30e074e5f0cee476b14665b/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b717ca08ade2b3d7b601462f07cd6f49","title":"the guardian view on brexit the beginning of the end","story":"Theresa May’s plan to leave the European Union is off to a disastrous start. How will it finish up?Brexit is often sold by its most committed supporters on the right as a constitutional version of the economic doctrine of Thatcherism, a clean break with the failed policies of the past. These fanatics succeeded in convincing David Cameron, who was prone to flattery but supine in the face of aggression, that a popular vote in a referendum was a remedy for the unrepresentative nature of Westminster politics. Once they did away with Mr Cameron, they installed Theresa May and carried on with legislative manoeuvring to enable an irreversible transformation of society. The hard Brexiters are ruthless about the means, and in denial about the fall-out of their desires. Yet now the game is up.The evidence is that a departure from the European Union on WTO terms would blow up large parts of the British economy. There would be a lot of pain for some far-off gain. As it stands Mrs May’s Brexit plan will not get parliamentary approval. She warns this means we will crash out as the law states the United Kingdom will leave the EU on the 29 March at 11pm. But that can be changed if a minister proposes a new law erasing that time and date and parliament votes for it. The UK has options. It can unilaterally cancel its withdrawal from the EU. The majority of MPs in parliament accept hard Brexit utopias cannot be built. It is now a question of how, not when or if, they will move parliamentary motions to demonstrate their strength. Their aim will be to get ministers to defer or rescind Britain’s departure from the European club. Mrs May, if she is still prime minister, at this point could do the country a favour and stop her car crash of Brexit continuing. If ministers refuse to bow to such a motion then we will enter a constitutional crisis whose size will dwarf anything we have seen so far in the contempt arguments over the failure to publish ministers’ Brexit legal advice.This marks the end of a long spell of party government. In 2015 the Conservative party won the majority of parliamentary seats for the first time in 23 years. Mr Cameron became prime minister. His government was responsible not to the parliament, but to Tory MPs who relied for their electoral success on the party organisation, which in turn controlled the parliamentary party. The 2017 election saw Mrs May lose her majority and MPs lose their instant allegiance to her and her machine. She ought to have dropped the hard Brexit rhetoric then and there. Instead she continued and attempted to rule through decree while pushing the biggest geopolitical shift this country has faced in decades. She factionalised her party, sharpening ideological isions between “Global Britain” and “Make Britain Great Again” Tories that have proved too wide to manage.The result is Mrs May ended up only passing bills that have complete support within her own party, which was in thrall to rightwing absolutists. The danger of this way of running Westminster is that it ends up being self-reinforcing, making for more extreme partisanship and deeper deadlock. Studies show barely two in 10 people now think the current system of governing Britain is good at performing any of its key functions. In parliamentary systems, gridlock is relatively rare. When prime ministers can no longer command legislative support, the impasse is resolved by a new election. If she attempted to do this anytime soon, Mrs May would surely be deposed. The prime minister has caught herself in a Brexit straitjacket that gets tighter the more she struggles. There is scope for a Houdini-like escape for Britain. But to achieve what seems the impossible requires a politician prepared to imagine it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2aaec51b9c279e8d512e904b792cceb70447e784/0_273_5942_3565/master/5942.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8fc7faf8136e20914f0425053c8e480","title":"drag cabaret brexit festive differences","story":"Britain is a nation ided. It’s official. Ever since the referendum we have become polarised into those who want to leave and those who want to remain, and nothing in between. Never will that be more apparent than around the dinner table this Christmas. But is that really true? Are we really a nation that will be stuck, looking down into a plate of brussels sprouts, unable to look family members in the eye for fear the B-word will spring forth from our mouths?I ended my Edinburgh show this year by saying: “We should be marching off to a bright new future, but we have never been more ided.” Then, as the audience left, I took photos with them older, younger, men, women, non-binary. “Innies” and “Outies”. “Oh I voted leave, she voted remain.”Cut to a week or so ago and I’m chatting to my doctor about some “intimate” tests. He asks what show I had been doing and I say a show about Brexit. I give a few familiar remain arguments and he replies: “But I guess it is about time we addressed the amount of people coming into the country.” Erm, excuse me, NHS sexual health clinic doctor. You voted leave? Preconceptions about the typical leave voter immediately dispelled – though it feels a bit odd erting off into a discussion about Brexit when I had a more immediate situation to deal with. But I’m guessing he probably has a much better idea of how a central London health service would be stretched so why get into a heated debate on immigration, which in truth I don’t know that much about.I myself am a lot “in” but not necessarily entirely, and think that our relationship with Europe was in need of some very serious consideration. I also don’t actually know if my doctor voted leave. I assumed he’d be remain and then he just mentioned immigration and so I assumed leave. But he might just be a bit leave, simply processing one part of a complicated situation like everyone else.My business partner is addicted to talking about it. We never really discuss politics but it’s almost with excitement that we launch into discussions over “what ifs” and “how our parents voted differently to us”. In fact, most people are willing to chat about it – not reluctantly or with any shame, but with a certain level of enthusiasm and frustration in equal measure.I worked in sales briefly and we were advised never to ask a closed question. But with regards to Brexit, “Are you leave or remain?” usually prompts fairly lengthy justification emphatically for one or the other, or general musings about lack of information, or the shit pile we seem to find ourselves in, or general ramblings about what other people think. I find if I just shut up and let other people do the talking, I learn about this person. I learn a bit more about the reasons why, and I learn that we are not as polarised as the media might make us think. The World Cup couldn’t do it. A royal wedding couldn’t do it. Certainly not one that didn’t give us a public holiday. But Brexit in its very isiveness has actually united the nation. We all have an opinion on Brexit. It affects us all and we have all played a part.It’s this collectiveness that influenced my approach to creating my All Star Brexit Cabaret. A musical about Brexit was a funny PR-grabbing idea for my Un-Royal Variety in the late summer of 2016, but it quickly provided a source rich in material for myself and Richard Thomas (the composer of Jerry Springer: The Opera) to write about. What was supposed to be a five-minute musical skit became a half-hour segment with about 13 musical numbers. A show not about facts or figures but about how we treated each other, the names we called each other, the discussions that we were having – heated or otherwise – our prejudices and preconceptions. And of course the politicians who have become caricature pantomime villains.My dad is very much a proud leave voter so I was determined that the show shouldn’t be just another vehicle for the remain point of view that recycles familiar arguments but doesn’t address the way many remainers labelled all leavers racist or stupid. I wanted space for the other side of the debate. It’s hard to allow the opposition to have a platform, especially when some of the issues seem to grate deeply with what we hold so dear. But in order to write the show I’ve had to find a way to empathise with both sides of the argument.Of course I wish the referendum hadn’t happened, but it has and there is no turning back the clock. Whatever the outcome, which will definitely not please everyone, we will as a nation have to find a way to move forwards. And it won’t be the politicians who will be healing any wounds. It’s widely accepted now that an “in or out” question was hugely inadequate for such a huge issue and the current deal on the table satisfies no one. Perhaps that’s one thing everyone can agree on this festive season?• Jonny Woo’s All Star Brexit Cabaret is at the London Coliseum on 17 December"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/970d5833b4745a2d8bd7537df2873da3525eccc5/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f57584906383dfa3d452a83b90a70e5","title":"zuckerberg tech giants facebook google apple","story":"Facebook, Google and Apple make the headlines, but there are many inspiring startups to dissipate the sense of techno-dreadA quarter of a century ago, the Canadian author Douglas Coupland published his third novel. Microserfs was the tale of a group of young Microsoft employees who decide to exit the realm of Bill Gates in Washington state and chase a dream of their own in California places that, back then, sounded like the epitome of futuristic magic: Palo Alto, Menlo Park. As well as prescient flashes of the world to come – “Beware of the corporate invasion of private memory,” warned one of its protagonists – what always stuck with me was its air of techno-optimism, perfectly crystallised right at the end, when the central character’s mother has a stroke and is rescued from silence by a set-up attached to an Apple Macintosh. She communicates via such staccato sentences as “I am here”, and “I feel U” the novel’s closing pages capture her and her family marvelling at the fact that she has become “part womanpart machine, emanating blue Macintosh light”.The book was published in 1995, when computers suddenly offered an ever-expanding window on to the world. Many of us had no doubt that the leap from old to new represented nothing but progress. By the start of this decade social media platforms were being hailed as a means of inidual and collective emancipation. But where has this faith in the future gone?We know the basic script: despite the digital utopia we were promised, our lives are now dominated by a tiny number of omniscient, greedy and essentially unaccountable tech companies. Google, Amazon and Apple all have cases to answer, but the failure to match huge power with any sense of commensurate responsibility is being most vividly played out at Facebook, amid mounting horror about its polarising effects on not just political discourse but basic social stability. Once our default setting was to accept, open, download. Now it feels like many of us increasingly fixate on the opposite options: delete, quit, cancel.Last week I was in Berlin, the city that increasingly stands as Europe’s tech capital (an honour the effects of Brexit look set to confirm). For two days the city’s south side was hosting Disrupt, one of an ongoing series of events organised by the technology industry news outlet TechCrunch. They take place in Europe and the US, offering a chance for startups to jostle for investment and attention, alongside interviews and discussions centred on where the world may be headed next.Some of what I heard was grimly predictable. An executive from Facebook-owned Instagram parried questions about the recent departure of the firm’s founders and its parent company’s problems and took refuge in the kind of bromides that now sound laughably hollow: “The user is the North star for all the decisions we make” “We want to make you feel close to people who you can’t see every day”. I heard presentations from would-be CEOs who had a depressingly familiar attitude to the magic they could blithely work with limitless oceans of personal data some of the people enthusing about data-harvesting “smart cities” seemed to be waiting for their chance to take 21st-century surveillance to its logical conclusion.All that said, European tech is rather different from its American counterpart. Insiders talk about a concern with privacy that runs much deeper than in the US, partly because of the lingering memory of Big Brother in former Communist countries. With Silicon Valley having long since colonised social media and a huge swath of online consumerism, people tend to concentrate on more finely targeted inventions aimed at businesses, the workings of government, medicine, charities or NGOs. Many tech tycoons still try to persuade us that they are here to unite humanity, with profit as a mere side-effect, but most of the attendees I met were willing to chew over the profound philosophical questions tangled up in the power and reach of digital capitalism, and the urgent necessity for governments to get to grips with them.Most importantly, I met plenty of clever people, still brimming with a belief in the future, with creations that made their optimism look entirely rational. A trio of developers from Spain, now resident in Berlin, are close to completing a navigation system for blind and visually impaired people, which forensically monitors and processes their environment in a similar way to the computers wired into driverless cars. A small team of people, split between Boston and Lisbon, explained an invention for people with severely restricted mobility, allowing them to type and talk using rapid-fire predictive text, and survey their surroundings with a 360-degree camera that comes with face recognition, so that people can be followed even when they have left the user’s immediate visual field. In the main hall, a team of people from the Lebanon wowed the crowd with an app for people with diabetes which not only monitors blood-sugar levels, but uses location data to survey restaurant menus for appropriate food options, and sends push notifications at the points in the average day when diabetics too often forget their next insulin injection.Much-misunderstood blockchain technology remains a byword for the often shady and uncertain world of cryptocurrencies, but at its heart is something with no end of other uses: a means of giving an immutable single identity to people and products, which lies beyond the reach of hackers. One startup held out the prospect of refugees using blockchain IDs to secure essential services – such as banking – rather than being faced with the usual walls of impossible bureaucracy. With a similar sense of altruistic excitement, Wassim Merheby, a former Nokia insider from Dubai, told me about Dhonor, a system he has invented with his teenage son, a passionate and talented coder, that will allow the component parts of medical treatment – from drugs, to batches of blood, to donated organs – to be indelibly recorded and verified, thereby offering iniduals and governments a way out of a world of illicit organ trading, contaminated blood supplies and counterfeit medicines.Later I saw a hoarding that said #BurstYourBubble, and spent an hour learning about a Berlin-based news platform, Nuzzera, which gently alerts readers to stories and opinions beyond their usual political frame of reference – and, if they respond positively, slowly and subtly carries on extending their horizons. “It started with Brexit,” one of its founders told me. “We were taking about that and Trump. And Alternative für Deutschland. Everybody drew it all back to algorithms and social media, and doing things differently.”As with so many of the coders, developers and cash-strapped entrepreneurs I spoke to, they had no guarantees that their creation would not either collide with the power of big tech and disappear, or be gobbled up. But their enthusiasm did its work. Since I returned home I have found myself less susceptible to techno-dread, and have reconnected to some of that 1990s optimism.“The belief that tomorrow is a different place from today is certainly a unique hallmark of our species,” wrote Douglas Coupland and in the same spirit, one might come up with a few more aphorisms. Facebook does not have to own the future. Technology is not reducible to California disgrace. And even though it sometimes flickers, the magical blue light shines on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e63abd9ece716a26fbc5825f0fef28fd0ac3a8b4/0_240_7239_4344/master/7239.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a293cbbe60eb5db279a66ffac552bf3","title":"pitt rivers museum oxford maasai colonial artefacts","story":"Western museums are full of plundered objects. So what happened when a Maasai delegation travelled to the UK to discover where their sacred belongings ended up?Around a large table in a bright room in the University of Oxford’s Pitt Rivers Museum, four members of the Maasai tribe from east Africa are inspecting a small object. It has been carefully placed in front of them by a curator wearing special handling gloves. The Maasai say that it is a bracelet, an orkatar. They talk between themselves, in the maa language, about what the bracelet is used for. “This is something that cannot be sold or given,” says Yannick Ndoinyo, a junior elder from Loliondo, northern Tanzania. The orkatar symbolises the death of a father and is a form of inheritance that passes down the generations. How did it end up in a museum in Oxford? Perhaps it was stolen from the original owner or given away under duress. According to the database, it was “donated” to the Pitt Rivers Museum in 1904 by Alfred Claud Hollis, a colonial administrator in British East Africa.This encounter between the Pitt Rivers, one of the most important ethnological museums in the world, and the Maasai is part of a process of cultural decolonisation. The relationship began when Maasai activist Samwel Nangiria visited the museum in November last year for a conference. The Pitt Rivers has more than 300,000 objects in its collection, many of which were “acquired” by colonial functionaries, missionaries and anthropologists in the heyday of the British empire. The museum itself is curated in a peculiar style – in line with the request of benefactor Augustus Pitt Rivers – with objects organised according to type rather than place of origin. This Victorian aesthetic has been consciously upheld: the Pitt Rivers is often referred to as a “museum of a museum”. There are shrunken heads from the Amazon and rudimentary tools from India a magisterial totem pole from the Haida community in Canada towers above the central, darkened atrium.Nangiria, a purposeful and diplomatic presence, expressed his displeasure to the museum’s director, Laura Van Broekhoven. She sent him a copy of the museum’s strategic plan for the future and invited him back. Keenly aware of its problematic origins, the Pitt Rivers, like many museums, engages “originating communities” – in the museum-world lingo – to allow them to reclaim the narrative around their objects. Last month, Nangiria, with four other Maasai from Tanzania and Kenya, and help from the Oxford-based NGO InsightShare, returned to do so.One purpose of the weeklong visit was to provide the museum with more accurate information. The database was littered with errors and gaps: it transpires that an object marked as a Maasai bracelet is actually an anklet a trinket made for an unknown purpose in fact plays a vital role in circumcision rituals. After a Maasai sword is laid down on the table, Marina de Alarcón, joint head of collections, tells us that the museum takes great care when holding arrows, assuming that their tips – as is Maasai custom – are poisoned. Francis Shomet Ole Naingisa, a village elder, duly confirms this: “If the poison mixes with your blood then you have five minutes left.”The relationship between European museums and the people from whom their collections were taken has never been more fraught. The same week as the Maasai visit, Tarita Alarcón Rapu, governor of Easter Island, begged for the return of the Hoa Hakananai’a statue from the British Museum in a tearful message that went viral: “You, the British people, have our soul.”A few days later came the publication of a report commissioned by President Emmanuel Macron, who had expressed his desire to see colonial-era items in France returned to Africa. Macron has his own reasons for this type of cultural diplomacy: it eases the passage of further economic and military cooperation with Francophone Africa. Nonetheless, the report is bold, recommending that France return African treasures if governments request them.Museums handle the question of repatriation as delicately as their objects. The Museum Association’s policy statement notes that it is a “complex issue involving a range of emotional, ethical, legal and political factors”. In my interviews I heard suspicion from some in the museum world about the politicised nature of state-to-state transactions, while the legal framework governing returns can be ambiguous, as has been with the case with recovering art stolen during the second world war. The British Museum has agreed to hold talks about Hoa Hakananai’a, but a likely conclusion will be a temporary return on loan, as was the case with Nigeria’s Benin bronzes.Will the Maasai be able to facilitate the return of sacred objects? Van Broekhoven tells me over email that “in principle”, and provided they find funding, the museum is ready to “learn together how we might envision new ways of redress”. The words are carefully chosen. Nangiria, ever the diplomat, suggests an alternative solution in one of our conversations: inviting elders to perform a spiritual ceremony that will “disconnect” the objects from their cultural function, allowing the Maasai to actively donate them to the museum. The museum will wait to hear from the elders to “jointly decide” on the next steps in the partnership.At a public event on the final day of their visit, the five Maasai, led by Scholastica Ene Kukutia, a women’s rights activist from Kenya, perform a ritual in the museum. Standing on the balcony overseeing the collection, sporting red shukas and bejewelled with earrings and necklaces that chime as they move, the group sing a melodious incantation that speaks of a meeting between “great cultures”. Attendees cry, as does Nangiria. He thanks the museum for “opening its doors” to them.But history always finds a way to seep through to the present, especially in a city like Oxford. The day before, I joined the Maasai at the university’s Weston Library. Enduring the November cold, they posed for a photograph on a balcony that frames the city’s skyline: implacable limestone that speaks of centuries of imperial wealth. Inside, they were shown archival maps of Maasai territory. The British engineered a forced migration, at gunpoint, of the Maasai at the turn of the century, moving them from one of the most fertile plains of Kenya to a drier part of Tanzania. Nangiria pores over the maps to see the changing contours of his people’s land."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bc4610f801db59adb24d9b1c96c8d39a7c2b589/0_287_4320_2594/master/4320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90468f3289cea45d1a180b83bc6bbe87","title":"headteacher leaves primary school after tests investigation","story":"Three Harris academy staff forced to leave after suspected tampering with Sats testsThe headteacher and two other staff members have left a London primary school after an internal investigation found that Sats papers had been systematically altered and missing answers added.A letter to parents with children at the Harris Primary Academy Philip Lane in Tottenham, north London, said the headteacher, Emma Penzer, the deputy head and another teacher would not be returning to the school, after the year 6 national test results were cancelled.An initial investigation by the Standards and Testing Agency (STA) in August found pupils had been given too much help while sitting their English and maths standardised tests in May this year.But the internal investigation by the Harris Federation, at the request of the STA, uncovered examples of direct tampering with test papers.Susan Head, the school’s chair of governors, told parents that the findings were a “shocking blow to the whole school community”, and were upsetting for parents and staff.“Among other findings over the course of the investigation, analysis of the papers showed that incorrect answers had been systematically crossed out and replaced with correct ones,” Head said in the letter to parents.“In the mathematics papers, the correct answers were given in places without any workings-out where they should have been present. For clarity, I would like to emphasise that the pupils themselves were not involved in any wrongdoing.”While the departure of Penzer and the other staff members was upsetting, Head told parents, “the findings of the investigation are so serious that we were left with no choice – any school presented with this evidence would need to take the same action”.The Harris Federation said its investigation included interviews with staff and former pupils, and an analysis of every test paper.“As a result, three members of staff will not be returning to work at the academy. The evidence we were presented with was so serious that this was the only appropriate course of action,” the trust said in statement.“The Harris Federation will put in place all the support needed to enable the academy to move on from this incident positively and successfully.”The school has been in the national spotlight since 2012, when Michael Gove, the then education secretary, intervened to force the primary, then known as Downhills, into academy status and join the Harris chain, despite strong opposition from parents and the local authority.Since then, the school has regularly been praised for its achievements, including 2017 Sats results that appeared to show it performing well above the national average in writing and maths.The trust said it could not comment on the employment contracts of inidual staff members. Emma Penzer and the other members of staff who have left could not be reached for comment.The action comes after Department for Education figures showed a continued rise in maladministration of key stage 2 national tests in England, with the STA investigating 466 cases involving schools last year compared with 430 in 2016."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e51d8bf5f912f11d828f5c5710910a7198cc403/11_375_6448_3869/master/6448.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=306b7701b85556799f2e64e78988a980","title":"an education arms race inside the ultra competitive world of private tutoring","story":"A growing number of parents and s are paying for children as young as four to receive additional tuition. What is fuelling this booming industry?As dusk falls in the Girlington district of Bradford, a trickle of cars begin to arrive in front of a small parade of shops. Parents who have just collected their children at the end of the school day are dropping them off at the Explore Learning tuition centre for extra maths and English coaching. The children sit at a cluster of computer terminals, where they log in to begin their evening studies. The atmosphere is relaxed and lighthearted. The children stay for an hour to work through their lessons, helped where necessary by a member of staff, with 15 minutes’ playtime at the end.Located next to a Domino’s and a Subway, the Bradford branch of Explore Learning is a tiny window into Britain’s booming private tuition sector, now worth an estimated £2bn. At one time, private tuition meant a weekly one-to-one session at home with a tutor, the preserve of the privileged few. It is still not cheap – Explore Learning’s standard membership costs £119 a month, plus a £50 registration fee – but it is now on offer on our high streets, in supermarkets and increasingly online, with tutors offering their services from as far afield as India and Sri Lanka. Tutees include children who are little older than toddlers, pupils at prestigious private schools and undergraduates struggling at university. All are caught up in an educational arms race, which experts say is exacerbating social inequality.The success of Explore Learning reflects some of these changes. The business was founded in 2001 by Bill Mills, a Cambridge maths graduate, and now has 139 centres around the country (plus five in Texas run by a sister company). They are located mainly in shopping centres, so busy parents can get on with their weekly shop while their offspring perfect their times tables, punctuation and grammar. Most of the children, who are aged four to 14, come at least a couple of times a week – the membership allows for up to nine sessions a month. Saturday and Sunday afternoons are the busiest times in the Bradford branch, which has 290 children on its books. The tutor-tutee ratio is one to six, but the tutors are not usually qualified teachers they may be students or mothers returning to the workplace. All are trained in the teaching materials and behaviour management.The families who use the centre come from various walks of life. Some parents have their own businesses others work at Bradford Royal Infirmary. There are families from Latvia, Poland and the Philippines. The parents talk about giving their children “an edge”, the “leg up” they never had. Among them are a shift worker, Malik Ijaz, and his wife, Ayesha, who have been bringing nine-year-old Abubakar and his seven-year-old sister, Amna, to the centre for nearly two years. It is a big expense for the family, but the children’s education is a priority. Ijaz works extra shifts to be able to afford it. A third child, four-year-old Ali, will come when he is older.“The world is very competitive and everybody is working very hard,” said Ijaz. “I know the school are doing very well, but there are 30 students in each class. It’s one teacher and support staff. They try their best to help, but I realise if I’m going to give my kids some extra help it’s going to be brilliant for their future. Anyone who does a bit extra always gets ahead.”He is ambitious for his children. “I warn my kids they should be top – or among the top five at least – in class. They are doing well. I don’t mind paying extra. I’m investing in their future. I know the importance of education. My kids love it.”Abubakar, a quiet, serious child, is planning to sit the 11-plus to win a place at grammar school. Sometimes he does not feel like starting work, “but when I’ve started I like to carry on”. Amna is a chatty livewire and wants to be a paleontologist. “I’m good at maths, but the thing I’m best at is history,” she chirps. “My brother does hard work. I’m doing the same now. I want to be the same as him.”Geoff Clayton, a retired garage worker, has been bringing his 10-year-old grandson, Brooklyn, to Explore Learning for about nine months. Brooklyn lives with his grandparents and likes football, Minecraft and maths. “He’s done really well,” says Clayton. “His reading has got a lot better, everything’s got better.” The membership takes a significant chunk out of his pension, but he is happy to pay it to give Brooklyn “a bit of a leg up”.“Nowadays, it’s all about exams and certificates and what you know,” he says. “When I left school, it was more: ‘Can you do the job?’ Brooklyn has done a heck of a lot better since coming here. Sometimes he moans, but he’s OK once he’s here. It does work if you’re prepared to put the time and effort in.”With tutoring commanding a fee of about £24 an hour, rising to £27 in London (although many tutors charge £60 or more), the trust is concerned that the private tuition market is putting children from poorer backgrounds at even greater disadvantage. To redress the balance, it would like to see the government introduce a means-tested voucher system, paid for through the pupil premium funding that schools receive to support disadvantaged pupils.“We are in an education arms race,” says Peter Lampl, the founder of the trust. “Parents are looking to get an edge for their kids and having private tuition gives them that edge. But if we are serious about social mobility, we need to make sure that the academic playing field is levelled outside the school gate.”Alexa Collins lives in Buckinghamshire, which operates a grammar school system. She could not afford tuition to prepare her daughter for the 11-plus despite being a top performer at primary, she failed the test, but has since thrived at her comprehensive, gaining nine GCSEs.Collins, who went to grammar school herself but received no coaching, says she is ideologically opposed to tutoring because it is unfair to those who cannot afford it. Although she can see the case for short-term tutoring on a specific subject when a child is struggling, she adds: “I think it’s awful, that idea of tutoring kids from seven to push them through this exam. How can you possibly put that pressure on them?”Another parent, who wishes to remain anonymous but lives in Kent, which operates grammar schools, says her son tackled the 11-plus without a tutor. “It felt morally wrong to claim an advantage by paying cash. It’s so unfair.” As she tried to coach her son, she felt at huge disadvantage. “So much depends on a parent’s skills to teach. A tutor would know the best way to teach the 11-plus concepts. I was terrible at maths at school, so I was really stuck.”“The government claims that expanding grammars will boost social mobility,” said Jerrim, a professor of education and social statistics at UCL, when the research was published. “But our research shows that private tuition used by high-income families gives them a big advantage in getting in.” One of the factors behind the increase in tuition, he says now, is the pressure exerted by school league tables and growing accountability measures. “Those schools might well be passing pressure on to parents,” he says. “It’s not a negative reflection on schools and the job that they are doing it’s more a reflection of the pressure they are under to achieve results.”A callout asking  readers about their experiences of tuition drew hundreds of responses from tutors, parents and school teachers. One tutor told of being approached by parents of children as young as three or four another had been hired to provide extra coaching for pupils whose parents were already paying for all of the privileges of private schools, including Marlborough and Eton. “We pay thousands of pounds a year on school fees,” said one parent. “If he needs a little help with certain subjects, why wouldn’t you help him?” There also appears to be a trend for university students to buy extra tuition. Most are already paying £9,250 a year in tuition fees, so why not spend a little more to ensure they get the best possible degree?The Profs, which launched in 2014, specialises in degree-level and professional-qualification tutoring. According to its website, an undergraduate teacher with a master’s in the required subject costs upwards of £70 an hour (plus a £50 placement fee) tutors specialising in applications to Oxbridge and Ivy League universities start at £120 an hour, plus a £250 consultation fee. According to Leo Evans, one of the founders of The Profs, university lecturers can struggle to address inidual learning difficulties. “Catching stragglers and helping them get on top of their studies is a useful social function. Also, for students with disabilities and impairments, it’s essential.”Other responses to our callout came from parents who were worried about schools’ increasingly limited resources due to budget cuts. Much of the additional support that was once available in classrooms is disappearing and some specialist teachers are in short supply. These parents see tutoring as a way of patching the gaps in their children’s education. “It’s only one hour a week, but the practice crammed into that time is like a full week of lessons at school,” said one parent, who is a teacher. “The ability to check every week how well the information is being retained is great. It also provides ‘real-time’ feedback that we don’t get from schools.”Some parents buy extra tuition to support children with special educational needs such as dyslexia, which mainstream schools are increasingly unable to meet. The new, tougher GCSE exams are also a factor, with some parents hiring private tutors to help children who are struggling to secure the level 4 or above required in English and maths.One mother from Nigeria said she sought extra support for her child as a practical response to racial discrimination: “Any child from a minority has to be many times better than their white counterparts to be able to get into the top schools and universities.” Another parent told of a daughter with cancer who missed a year of formal education, but got through with the help of a tutor. Another respondent claimed the shadow tutoring workforce “props up” some “outstanding” schools – private, grammar and state.Not everyone was positive about the impact of tuition. “It can cause students to not work in lessons,” said one teacher. Another said: “The need for tutoring frightens me. Schools should be able to offer students the support they need in class sizes that are manageable.” While one parent said: “I resent it when having a tutor is seen as a class crime,” another acknowledged the unfairness at the heart of the system: “I feel uncomfortable that we can afford to pay for this privilege.”The callout also revealed the appeal of private tuition for teachers, whose salaries have been depressed for years while the demands upon them have grown. Some said they did private tutoring to boost their income others, tired of the one-size-fits-all approach in schools, have quit their jobs to do it full time.Asked about the boom in private tuition, the Department for Education responded that standards are rising in schools and that the attainment gap between rich and poor pupils is shrinking. “While we believe families shouldn’t have to pay for private tuition, it has always been part of the system and parents have freedom to do this,” a spokesman said.“Tutoring is huge, it’s getting bigger and it’s not going away,” says the Sutton Trust’s Lampl. “You can’t stop people from doing it. What we’ve got to do is make it more accessible for parents who currently can’t afford it.”Clayton, the retired garage worker from Bradford, is not a rich man, but he wants to invest what he has in his grandson’s future. His hopes for Brooklyn are modest and honourable and shared by parents and grandparents everywhere. “I want Brooklyn to have a good start in life … Nobody gave me a leg up. I’m trying to do something for him that I never got. I hope he ends up being a decent person when he grows up and gets a decent job and doesn’t have to struggle.”Additional reporting by Matthew Holmes"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb7536adf76b6e7bfb5f29f69dace7270251bd40/0_207_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ee8b1618176d55f5432e420a9d70ed7","title":"how do you spend your time when youre stuck at home in winter","story":"With long nights and wet weather we’d like to hear how you stop yourself from going stir-crazy when you’re stuck at homeFrom Almaty to Zagreb, from London (England) to London (Ontario), the days are getting colder, the nights are getting longer and the clouds are getting lower.How do you cope when you can’t face the gloom, the rain, the wind or the snow, yet have already spent far too many hours at home?

Meryl Streep in Kramer vs Kramer, striding forth in a trenchcoat. Katharine Hepburn curled up in a man’s blazer. Ezra Miller in a puffer coat gown on the red carpet. Or, this winter, a child’s collection of stuffed toys. The teddy bear coat, otherwise known as the Borg, is big, cuddly, cosy and, like actual teddies, heart-meltingly cute. And it’s big news this winter.Browse for a coat anywhere on the high street at the moment and you can’t move for the soft, furry, textured fabric most associated with plush toys. There are three-quarter length ones at Anthropologie, bikers at Asos (its three-quarters has now almost sold out), boho ones at Zara (the brand says its textured faux-shearling coat and soft faux-fur coat have both been popular) and wrap styles at Whistles. The colour palette is the kind you would see in a collection of plushies proudly displayed on a six-year-old’s bed: grubby whites, the occasional pastel but, by and large, the soft browns and beiges worthy of a Steiff production line. (Sidenote: Steiff, one of the the original teddy bear companies, does make excellent coats if you really want to go literal with the trend.)Grown women dressed like teddy bears could be seen as symptomatic of the modern Peter Pan complex, a resistance to “adulting” and the next step on from the shutting-out-the-world statement of the duvet coat. There is even a new teddy bear emoji, as if to prove a point. But the teddy bear coat has a long history, dating back to cars becoming more commonplace in the 20s. Motorists took to wearing alpaca coats with fuzzy textures – the style even made it to newspaper cartoons. And the textured shearling-lite fabric known as Borg? The New York Times traced it back to George Borg, the owner of a knitting mill, who was producing deep-pile fabric for paint rollers in the 1940s. When he realised the fuzzy texture could lend itself to outerwear, he took it to New York’s garment district on Seventh Avenue. And that is the story of how the fabric of paint rollers went from DIY on Sunday to the world of high fashion.If you need more of a sell before embracing the teddy, bear this is mind. It is more than cutesy emoji dressing. It is part of the faux-fur revolution currently taking place in fashion, with brands such as Gucci, Burberry and Chanel banning fur – plus it looks a bit like the fleece fabric seen at Gen Z favourite brands Urban Outfitters and Monki.

Refrigerate while you fry the sage.In a small saucepan, heat 2cm of oil until shimmering. Add the sage leaves, frying for 30 seconds, until crisp. Drain on kitchen paper.Bring a large saucepan of salted water to the boil, then add the gnudi – you will need to do this in two batches, depending on the size of your pan. Cook for 2–3 minutes, until they float to the top. Remove from the water.Divide the gnudi between four plates, drizzle with the melted butter, scatter with the parmesan, sprinkle over the sage leaves, and finish with some black pepper.2 thick-cut pork loin chops1 lemon, halved2 sprigs lemon thyme, leaves pickedSalt and ground black pepperOlive oilFor the gratin:25g butter2 banana shallots, dicedSalt and ground black pepper1 garlic clove, halved250ml cream or whole milk150g garlic and herbs Boursin1 medium butternut squash, peeled and very thinly sliced50g gruyere, finely gratedFor something extra special, this wintry main is just the ticket. Here, Boursin has been added to the gratin sauce, creating a rich, savoury foil to the sweetness of the squash. The gratin is so good that it works just as well as a vegetarian main, served with a crisp green salad.To prepare, preheat the oven to 180Cgas mark 4 and rub the cut sides of the garlic clove around a medium-sized dish.Put the butter in a small frying pan over a medium heat and cook the shallots with plenty of seasoning for 5-10 minutes.Whisk together the Boursin and cream, or milk, until smooth, then season to taste.Layer the squash slices and shallots, adding salt and pepper to each layer in the baking dish, then pour over the milk and Boursin mixture, making sure it has seeped into the gaps. Scatter over the cheese, grind over some black pepper and cover with foil, then bake for 45 minutes.Roughly 15 minutes before the 45 minutes is up, prepare the pork. Rub with oil, season well, then, in a heavy-based frying pan over a high heat, hold the pork chops fat-side down in the pan, cooking for 2-3 minutes until golden. Fry on each side for a minute, until a little browned, then put in a small roasting tray, tucking the lemon and thyme around the chops.After 45 minutes of cooking the gratin, turn the oven up to 200Cgas mark 6. Uncover the squash, put the chops on the top shelf of the oven, then cook alongside the gratin for 15 minutes, until the cheese is golden brown, the squash is tender, and the pork is cooked.Bring a BoursinCombining a creamy crumbly texture and mouth-watering garlic and herbs, Boursin is a welcome addition to any festive buffet – and a versatile soft cheese for your party season cooking, too.

If there’s one thing we’ve learned from cinema in 2018 – A Star is Born, Vox Lux, even the PG-rated neutering of Freddie Mercury’s legend in Bohemian Rhapsody – it’s that the gleaming lights of the music industry can emit a pretty harsh glow when you’re under them, that the warm embrace of a crowd can turn to a stranglehold in the blink of a heavily made-up eye. That fame comes at a price is, admittedly, not the hottest of takes: in the movies, it goes back at least as, well, 1932’s What Price Hollywood?, the film that directly bore one of this year’s grit-amid-the-glitter case studies.In Bradley Cooper’s fourth official iteration of A Star is Born, an earthy, working-class nightclub chanteuse played by Lady Gaga is made over, more or less, into Lady Gaga: the mononymous Ally, a metallically polished, millions-selling pop a whose heart is broken and whose soul is compromised en route to true, unfettered artistry. By the time she croons, with a pained tremor in her Whitney-style pipes, the weepy ballad I’ll Never Love Again in the film’s finale – to a raptly sympathetic audience mindful of what she has lost along the way – the film aligns itself with the age-old view that great art is born of suffering, and that the best singers channel their life’s pain into their voices.That moral hinges on the film’s own rather conservative musical preferences: we’re invited to see I’ll Never Love Again, a supremely well-shaped slab of pop melodrama that any belter from Barbra Streisand to Celine Dion would have similarly nailed in decades past, as a richer, more satisfying artistic statement than any of the sassier R\u0026ampB-inflected cuts that saw her scale the charts. (“Why’d you come around me with an ass like that?” she snaps on one, in a bumping, grinding Saturday Night Live performance intended to signal her lowest creative ebb.)Some have accused Cooper’s film of an anti-pop sensibility: not necessarily true, given the film’s own expert populist construction, but its view of emotional catharsis and artistic redemption – all tied up in a stripped-back love song – is romantically old-fashioned. The new A Star is Born takes place in a world where bluesy country rockers enthrall Coachella masses and drag-bar patrons alike, where strings-soaked power ballads relaunch careers, and where social media seems not to exist: it may prove the enduring emotional effectiveness of its oft-told story, but as a snapshot of pop culture in 2018, it feels about as lived-in as Gaga’s stick-on eyebrows.It’s a world that leaves Ally bruised but not broken, head held high at her final curtain call. Whether she would so stoically survive the contemporary music industry that engulfs Celeste, the prickly heroine of Brady Corbet’s Vox Lux, is another matter. Jaggedly cynical, stripped of any semblance of romance, and painted in tones of dull silver where A Star is Born favours California gold, Corbet’s film is effectively the wicked sister of Cooper’s: both portray a gifted young female singer wounded and jaded by the commercial demands of the pop machine, emerging as a different animal in the process.Yet where celebrity leaves Ally sadder but wiser, truer than before to her scarred heart, Celeste buries her pain in its sparkly privileges. Played as an adult by an astonishing Natalie Portman – hard-faced, high-haired and snappish as a Venus flytrap – she’s a human tabloid headline, all affected attitude and high-maintenance artifice. She speaks in cryptic soundbites to family members and magazine journalists alike she seems loosest and least mannered when kite-high on drugs supplied by her loyal but toxic manager (a perfectly skeevy Jude Law). When we learn, in a grimly topical shock far from A Star is Born’s frame of reference, that one of her music videos has inspired a massacre by copycat-styled killers in eastern Europe, she seems less freaked out than her coterie of advisers: Celeste’s reality is already so foggily suspended that art-life boundaries count for little.Where celebrity creates Ally’s trauma, however, it exploits and exacerbates Celeste’s: she rises to fame in her teenage years as the sole survivor of a Columbine-style school shooting, as the earnest, moving song of mourning she writes and performs at a memorial service becomes a national anthem of healing. A record deal follows, but her minders know that tragedy doesn’t shifts units the precocious victim is swiftly moulded into a slinky pop starlet, the inspirational empowerment sentiments of her songwriting sexed up with slick synthetic beats (Sia composed all Celeste’s originals) and feline choreography.Vox Lux doesn’t show the complete transformation: rather, it zooms nearly 20 years forward to the acid-spitting final product. 2018-edition Celeste is still topping the charts with upbeat dance-pop, performed with an impressively robotic proficiency that belies the jangle of nerves, neuroses and addictions this one-time America’s sweetheart has become. “I’m a private girl in a public world,” she sings in one of her samey-sounding hits, and it’s one of her few lyrics – otherwise awash with canned self-help mantras – she seems able to express with conviction. Vox Lux, like A Star is Born, climaxes with a comeback concert: a full, seamless, blaring half-hour set that Portman barks and dances through with jaw-dropping elan. There are no teary confessionals or admissions of lessons learned here, however: Celeste tumbles directly into it from a day of catastrophic PR blunders and substance abuse, her onstage composure an odd lapse of professional responsibility before, inevitable, she falls apart again once the lights are off.Both films, then, conclude that the show must go on, though the implications of that moral are far bleaker in Corbet’s film than in Cooper’s: Ally continues because she is bound to her art, Celeste because she is bound to her industry. Is either film an apt portrait of the modern pop machine? Maybe not, if we believe what is likely to be this year’s most enduring pop artefact: Ariana Grande’s video for Thank U, Next, an airily autobiographical earworm in which the pint-size powerhouse sings through past heartbreaks – and even the death of one former lover – with blithe, unsentimental acceptance, and one steely eye fixed on the future.A cheekily self-reflexive work made to be pored over and memed into oblivion by a celebrity-fixated internet, it demonstrates a sense of humour neither Ally nor Celeste can muster – an awareness that her post-celebrity life will never be quite her own, so she will lead with packaging it and satirising it for us. The pop industry may well be as taxing and as damaging as both A Star is Born and Vox Lux suggest, but perhaps Generation Grande, cannily reared on selfies and social media, has found savvier ways to survive it. That film has yet to be made."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c84e646ad294835e432d0c85a2711d2f18fbd292/25_0_5209_3126/master/5209.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9dc344ee97f144863c2cfbe365e6a829","title":"rafael salguero bribe claims 2018 world cup","story":"A former Fifa executive said he was offered hundreds of thousands of dollars in return for his vote for the 2018 World Cup, newly released US court documents show.Rafael Salguero, a Guatemalan football administrator who served on Fifa’s executive committee, pled guilty to multiple corruption charges in 2016 as part of the US government’s sprawling investigation into world football’s governing body. But a transcript of his plea hearing in a Brooklyn federal court was only released on Tuesday with the former official expected to be sentenced this week.The redacted transcript reveals that Salguero told the court he was approached by an inidual in 2010 who offered him “hundreds of thousands of dollars” in exchange for his vote. Salguero said he was approached on a flight from Mexico to Guatemala by an inidual whose name is also redacted in the transcript. Salguero said he met with the unnamed person multiple times after their first encounter to discuss the bribe.The transcript redacts the name of the bid Salguero was told to vote for and the name of another inidual, based in Italy, who had offered to provide the cash.The 2018 World Cup was eventually hosted by Russia following a 2010 vote at Fifa’s headquarters in Zurich. The results were mired with controversy following allegations of corruption in both Russia’s 2018 bid and Qatar’s successful bid for the 2022 tournament. Russia, England and joint bids from the Netherlands and Belgium, and Portugal and Spain were considered for the 2018 World Cup.According to the newly released transcript, Salguero told the court in 2016 that although he voted for the bid he was told to, he never received the money and did not make a trip to Italy as was suggested by the unnamed inidual offering the bribe.Over 40 iniduals and entities were indicted as part of the the US Justice Department’s investigation into Fifa with over two dozen pleading guilty.

Mail us or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU“What is the heaviest defeat inflicted on a top-ision side by lower-league opposition in the FA Cup?” asks Lindsay Davis. “The best I can discover is Scunthorpe United (2nd Div) 6-2 Blackpool (1st Div) in the 1961 third round.”Scunthorpe’s six-goal slaying was a hell of an effort all right, but not quite the best of its type. Robert Salter has trawled back to the prewar years to unearth Everton 0-6 Crystal Palace from January 1922. Thomas McIntosh’s Toffees, who would go on to avoid relegation from the old First Division by the skin of their teeth, were given a drubbing in front of their own fans by a second-tier Palace side whose goalscorers included the magnificently named Bertie Menlove.The win was orchestrated by Edmund Goodman, Palace’s longest-serving manager, whose playing career was cut short after a serious injury led to him having a leg amputated. “Coincidentally the two clubs met again in the FA Cup in January 1931,” Robert informs us, “and that time Everton won 6-0 at Crystal Palace.”Malcolm Warburton weighs in with a marginally narrower win, albeit achieved by a non-league side over first-tier opposition. “In February 1906 Southampton, of the Southern League, beat First Division club Middlesbrough 6-1 in the third round.”• Know of a more one-sided upset? Mail us or tweet @TheKnowledge_GUA couple of weeks ago we were asked about clubs owned by breweries. Chris Williams chips in: “When Alton Town Bass FC was formed in 1991 it was as a result of a merger between sides Courage \u0026amp Co FC – the works side of the local Courage Brewery – and Alton Town FC. The ensuing years led to a number of name changes – Bass (Alton) FC, Bass Alton Town FC, Alton Town FC – before settling on their current name of Alton FC.”Rit Nanda has another example from India: “Two of the most storied clubs from Kolkata, Mohun Bagan and East Bengal, were both owned by breweries or distilleries until very recently, with East Bengal terminating its partnership only this year.“To enter into international competitions, these two clubs had to form companies. So in 1998, the two partnered with United Spirits and United Breweries (which were owned by the same person, Vijay Mallya). The clubs then changed their names to McDowell’s Mohun Bagan (McDowell being a United Spirits brand) and Kingfisher East Bengal (Kingfisher being a United Breweries brand).” Last month, @TheTinBoonie asked us whether any player could top Clayton Lewis’s 11,252-mile transfer from Auckland City to Scunthorpe United.Phil Lacy has us nodding in agreement from the start: “While I dearly wish that the record could belong to the gloriously named Argélico Fucks, who in 2007 travelled 11,910 miles from Canoas, Brazil to play for Zhejiang Greentown in the Chinese Super League a grand total of 22 times, sadly it does not. There are many football wanderers who left Buenos Aires for China, breaking the 12,000-mile barrier. The longest I could find was the transfer on 23 July 2013 of Pablo Nicolás Caballero, who left Almirante Brown of La Matanza Partido for Qingdao Jonoon – an incredible 12,324 miles. He played up front for them 13 times, scoring twice, before returning to Buenos Aires to sign for Ferro Carril Oeste, a journey of 12,306 miles. He’s since moved on to Spain.”James Clarke picks up on the same theme: Carlos Tevez moved from Boca Juniors to Shanghai Shenhua in December 2016, scored four goals in the single season he played there, then went back to Boca in January this year on a free. Each way that’s a 19,641km journey (12,204 miles), so he racked up an impressive transfer distance of 39,282km in barely more than a year.”“Is it true that a Newcastle United player invented the windscreen wiper?” posed Warren Rose, rubbing his eyes in incredulity back in 2009.Almost, Warren, almost. Football can indeed claim for itself a part in the invention of the windscreen wiper, but it was a Newcastle fan rather than a player who came up with the idea.It’s now more than 100 years since Gladstone Adams drove his Darracq car to Crystal Palace Park for the 1908 FA Cup final between Wolves and his beloved Newcastle United. Adams’s side were the overwhelming favourites against second ision Wolves, but the underdogs ran out 3–1 winners, handing Newcastle their third final defeat in four years.It’s fair to suggest then that Adams wasn’t in the best of moods on the journey home. And his disposition would have deteriorated further when he found himself in the middle of an unseasonable snowstorm. Back then, windscreens had to be cleared by hand and it was on one of these frosty-fingered breaks by the side of the road that Adams came up with the idea of a mechanised blade that could run while the car was in motion.Unfortunately, Adams has a fairly lonely place in the pantheon of football’s inventors. Generally, the sport has borrowed ideas from elsewhere. Turnstiles, for example, were originally used in agriculture, allowing ramblers and farmers to access fields while keeping the sheep and cows in. Shinpads, permitted in the FA rules as early as 1874, were a ripped off, cut down version of the cricket pads of the time.• For thousands more questions and answers look through our archive.“Cédric Soares scored his first goal for Southampton in Mark Hughes’s first game managing the club, and scored his second in Hughes’s last,” notes Ciaran Hannigan-Purcell. “Have there been any other instances where normally goal-shy players have scored to both welcome and wave goodbye to a manager?”“Hope Solo made over 200 international appearances for the USA, but ‘only’ 134 club appearances (according to Wikipedia),” says Nick Williamson. “Are there any other players who have played many more times for their country than for their clubs? Perhaps a perennial third-choice club keeper who represents a low-ranking nation in all their fixtures?”“I was wondering, what’s the longest sequence of competitive matches a club (or country) has played in the same kit?” wonders Gareth from Milton Keynes.“Real Madrid recently lost 3-0 to Eibar in a stadium that holds just 7,000 people,” begins Robin Tucker. “That got me thinking: have any former European champions lost a competitive match in a smaller stadium? This would be only counting results after their first European success, so games such as Liverpool’s 1959 defeat to Worcester City would not count.”“If Shakhtar beat Lyon by one goal in the final round of Champions League fixtures in December, they will qualify for the knockout stage with a goal difference of -7.

The this-is-not-who-I-am defence gets a lot of run-outs these days, as cameraphones catch non-racist people being racist on buses, non-homophobic people screaming abuse at gay people outside a nightclub, or any of the other variants that increasingly adorn the age. The point is: this is not who they are.Very occasionally, the person saying the thing is saying it on a stage, in front of a large audience and multiple television cameras, and is deploying remarks they have worked out in advance. But this, too, is not who those people are.By way of a recap, let’s journey to Monday night’s Ballon d’Or award ceremony in Paris. As presenter, Solveig was on stage when Lyon’s and Norway’s Ada Hegerberg won the inaugural women’s Ballon d’Or. (Luka Modric picked up the men’s award, while Kylian Mbappé was honoured with a new under-21s prize, the Kopa Trophy.) Alas, no sooner had Hegerberg picked up the trophy than Solveig asked her if she could twerk. When she replied “no” and turned away from the podium, Solveig was shown laughing.I would say that he engaged in this skit for reasons best known to himself – except it seems Martin doesn’t actually know the reasons why he did this. Indeed, they are not even dimly grasped by him.The aforementioned reasons did appear known to Mbappé, who was shown in a cutaway shot wearing an expression we’ll call straight-to-GIF. And they were certainly known to Andy Murray, who promptly took to social media to declare: “Another example of the ridiculous sexism that still exists in sport. Why do women still have to put up with that shit? ... And to everyone who thinks people are overreacting and it was just a joke… It wasn’t. I’ve been involved in sport my whole life and the level of sexism is unreal.”For her part, Hegerberg got through it graciously, though wearing the unmistakable expression of a woman realising that it is somehow going to be on her to manage the situation in a way that causes as few ripples as possible. It won’t have been pleasant having to do this even at one of the very highest points of her professional career so far, but it certainly won’t have been unfamiliar. Not making dickheads feel like dickheads is one of the earliest ingrained lessons.As for Solveig, he has apologised “to anyone who may have been offended”, which as everyone knows is the boilerplate non-apology. He went on to say: “People who have followed me for 20 years know how respectful I am especially with women.”That “especially” is a bit of a tell. Why would you be any more respectful with women than with men, unless you thought there was something patronisably different about them? There was a classic Tom Cruise interview where the star was banging on about how he really respected women, and when the interviewer asked him what in particular he respected about them, he replied: “They smell good. They look pretty. I love them. I do.”Yup, “I especially respect women” is a close relative of “I love women” – that weirdo blanket statement embraced by men who prefer to homogenise everyone who shares the same pronoun. Guys, how can you love the entire classification “women”? Loads of women are horrendous, same as loads of men are. If you Google celebrities saying “I love women”, you always get some Mel Gibson interview from a couple of years after he called a female cop “sugartits”, or a Chris Brown interview from a few months after he was arrested for beating up his then-girlfriend, Rihanna. Or a Silvio Berlusconi interview from basically any time. Pro tip: guys in or out of the public eye who say: “I love women,” always turn out bad, or, more usually, have already done so.As for the organisers, they suggested a landmark had been reached with the first ever Ballon d’Or Féminin. But with a sexism controversy breaking out at the very moment of presentation, perhaps the real takeout is how far there is left to go.As predicted, the annual Sports Personality of the Year award row has rolled round again – a tradition as sacred as November’s Premier League poppy row, and as moving as the rows about why England players didn’t visit a first world war memorial when they had a game within 100 miles of it.Making an incredible comeback to the Spoty row is Tyson Fury, who last starred in one in 2015, when 130,000 signed a petition demanding he be removed from the shortlist. This year, the opposite sort of outrage is being worked up, with suggestions that because the panel of experts who decided the Spoty shortlist met in November, they will not have been able to take Fury’s sensational weekend draw against Deontay Wilder into account.According to the BBC’s published terms and conditions for Spoty: “The Panel have the right to amend elements of this or other awards … provided such changes remain within the spirit of the award.”So it’s only a matter of time before you spot your first “will of the people”, and people start demanding the BBC release the Spoty legal advice. All the worst timelines of public life are converging this December, and you should stockpile eggnog accordingly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6090c2f9b185a89af0729124f965bf9ab36de8ac/0_203_2829_1697/master/2829.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5780fa01480608696b51601a5d01a33d","title":"arsene wenger unai emery arsenal","story":"The former Arsenal manager overstayed his welcome but Unai Emery, who takes a team on a long unbeaten run to Old Trafford on Wednesday, owes Arsène Wenger a lotTowards the end of Arsenal’s north London derby victory on Sunday afternoon it was tempting to look away from the swarming red shirts on the pitch, past the packed-out stands, and catch a glimpse in the corner of your eyeline of a spectral figure in ankle-length quilted gown, a shadow on the touchline, a shape perched up on the highest lip of the stand, fingers fiddling at the zipper of his anorak, a slow smile beginning to spread across his hawk-like features.Arsène: the legacy years. A few months into the reign of Unai Emery, the first post-Wenger season already looks like offering a more flattering reflection of Arsenal’s longest‑serving manager than the shared angst of his later years.Not that Wenger has been there to see it. It is a notable feature of his departure that this really has been a full stop. Wenger has been a ghost, an absence, spending his time being lionised in various exotic locales, doing TV work, and generally staying away from the reconditioned club he helped conceive, design and deliver.With encouraging results so far. If Sunday afternoon was the most energising experience at the Emirates for this new-build Emery team, Wednesday at Old Trafford represents the stiffest away trip yet, at a place where Arsenal haven’t won in the league since 2006. It is the next step in a daunting set of fixtures. As of last Sunday Arsenal have set off on a run of 11 league games to the start of February, five of which are Spurs at home, United away, Liverpool away, Chelsea at home and Manchester City away.Old Trafford is a huge occasion in that context, as it is in other, less tangible ways. Already there has been a shift here. Throughout the dog days of the Wenger years Arsenal were so often the fall guys in these heavyweight fixtures, extras in someone else’s narrative. But for the first time in a decade it is instead Arsenal who are the more fertile story here.There isn’t a great deal of interest left in this deathly Manchester United, beyond the exact detail and timing of what seems an inevitable exit for José Mourinho. This has felt for some time like another dead end, a process of entropy that has been in train ever since the departure of United’s own long-serving colossus.Talking of which, here’s an interesting idea. Perhaps Wenger left Arsenal in better shape than some may have wanted to see. It is a widespread mistake to assume Emery’s early success with this team reflects poorly on his predecessor, just as the agonies of David Moyes should reflect well on Ferguson.In reality there is a case that Wenger’s lack of pot-hunting sense, his obsession with processes and financial caution, indeed many of the things that brought such frustration towards the end, may have been perfect for succession planning, the ideal gift to his successor.If it has been easy for Emery to pull the loose threads and produce a team who are, with a little luck, unbeaten in 19 games then this is in part because he inherited an environment where the basics were already in place. The facts might not tally with the idea of Wenger running Arsenal into the ground. In reality he left the club with a strong squad of players, a fine and profitable stadium, an excellent training ground, sound recruitment structure (not all his doing) and good spirit with an absence of destructive egos. Plus, of course, no strings to bind his successor, no looming presence in the stands, just room to breathe and build from a sound base.Wenger gave a first-team debut to 10 of the 13 outfield players who beat Spurs on Sunday. He signed the league’s top scorer, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, whose movement was a striking contrast with that of Harry Kane in his current mode, which involves spending a lot of time walking backwards, reaching out with his hands for someone to grapple and spin off, like a man in search of the bathroom light switch late at night.Wenger also left some decent defenders and a good spread of age ranges, not to mention enough depth in midfield to allow Emery to become increasingly brusque with Mesut Özil. When Özil was awarded his new deal Wenger suggested this was the “cheapest” way of having a player of Özil’s type at the club. Which does overlook the option of hiring a handsomely groomed mannequin to sit on the bench or just not having a player of Özil’s type at all, which appears to be Emery’s favoured path.To his credit Emery saw instantly that this team needed a proper defensive shield. He is clearly a far better judge of that kind of player: Lucas Torreira has been a revelation, a different level of footballer to Mohamed Elneny, Francis Coquelin and other token Wenger-era midfield bolts.Emery has of course been helped in this by Sven Mislintat. The appointment of a head of recruitment may have irked Wenger at times but Mislintat is clearly an expert in talent ID, his presence making a strong contrast with United, where Ed Woodward and AN Other have presided over an increasingly scattergun process of spend and hope.These are the earliest of early days. But it does seem possible Arsenal might just avoid the angst-fuelled contortions of the immediate post-Fergie years, when the only really lasting gifts to the future were Moyes and a misleading final league title for an ageing, middling team. United are still strong enough to win on Wednesday night and ignite their own run through autumn into winter. But for Arsenal the progress made under Emery is still significant and a tribute to the structures already in place. Those more disgruntled supporters may well have “got back” their club but it still bears the stamp and shape of a manager who stayed too long, who became a little worn by the end, but whose departure has left hope rather than confusion in his place."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/254c5596a1de53531208b878e61d02d9e060bcc0/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33508abe047f166c684dbbad666815e0","title":"championship best league country premier league entertainment","story":"Whether it’s the absurdity of a 97th-minute Teemu Pukki winner, the way Marcelo Bielsa studiously refers to opposition players not by name but number, the six-point blanket that covers the top seven teams, or the pass-the-parcel manner in which six different sides have topped the table since August, the Championship’s eclectic charm has been plain this season. Unpredictable and unforgiving, it is a land of bewitching drama, which prompts the question: is it the best league in the country?The Championship is not perfect, but at a time when elite football is selling its soul and slowly losing all pride, epitomised by Richard Scudamore’s £5m “golden goodbye” and Manchester United having an official mattress and pillow partner, it is easier than ever to buy into the chillier compound of English football’s second tier. To some, it is inferior, a poor relation to the top flight, but at least it is not too big for its boots. Not yet, anyway, though a select group of clubs are determined to eke out a bigger pay packet after being angered by the latest TV rights deal.It is not quite as tight as the Romanian third tier in 1983-84, when it ended with 10 points separating 16 teams, or the 1974-75 First Division table (when the champions, Derby, finished eight points ahead of 10th-placed Burnley). But Brentford, West Brom, Leeds, Middlesbrough, Sheffield United and now Norwich have all taken hold of the baton to top the ision this season, with the lead exchanging hands eight times since September. When a manager is asked how it feels to top the ision, as Daniel Farke and Bielsa have been in recent weeks, you can understand why they have at times appeared a little humdrum.“If you look at the results after every game it’s very hard to say who’s at the top of the table and who’s at the bottom,” Bielsa said. “You would tell me the best are at the top and the worst are at the bottom but when a team at the top plays a team at the bottom, there’s not much difference. The leading teams are not that superior to the teams at the bottom.”As well as the 644 goals and counting this season and an abundance of young, exciting players, there is an odd but brilliant pick-and-mix of managers. Perhaps Chris Wilder put it best, when describing going toe to toe with Bielsa, Paul Warne and Frank Lampard. “You go from an Argentine great to a lad who has been a physio at Rotherham, to a lad who has won God knows how many Premier League titles,” said the Sheffield United manager. “But they’re all bringing great things to the table. It’s a fantastic ision and we don’t take it for granted.”There is arguably unrivalled talent too for a second tier. The on-loan Harvey Barnes, Mason Mount, Harry Wilson and Tammy Abraham have particularly excelled. John McGinn has proven himself a class act at Aston Villa, alongside one of the most gifted players in the ision, Jack Grealish. Jake Livermore was on World Cup standby for England last summer in fact, 31 second-tier players represented their country in Russia. Joe Allen is a luxury commodity at this level and it is only a matter of time before Brentford’s Ollie Watkins is playing in the Premier League.But those names only scratch the surface. Have a quick scan at the Stoke substitutes against Derby last week, for example. Bruno Martins Indi helped the Netherlands to third at the 2014 World Cup and Porto to the Champions League quarter-finals a year on. Darren Fletcher has a trophy cabinet full of major honours. Peter Crouch is still scoring goals at 37. A few days later at Reading, the Stoke bench included the Wales captain Ashley Williams and Saido Berahino, whose 913-day goal drought can be ridiculed but who has shown glimpses of the ability that led Spurs to bid £23m for the striker three years ago. And then there is Bojan Krkic.Any talk of a title race here is genuine. Who would bet against Dean Smith’s Aston Villa, nine points off the top, forcing themselves into the mix, or a frenzied Brentford making a typically late dash for the play-offs? And then what about Swansea, Birmingham or Blackburn? We may be approaching the halfway mark but, in some ways, the Championship is only just getting started.• Bolton fans feared the team’s promising start, racking up 10 points from their first four matches, was too good to be true. They have won once since, losing seven of their last 10 matches. The struggles started in pre-season, when players boycotted a friendly with St Mirren because they had not been paid bonuses for avoiding relegation last season. Off-field problems have eaten away at manager Phil Parkinson, whom the Bolton News this week reported has not been paid for keeping the club in the Championship. And last week, senior players sought clarification from the owner, Ken Anderson, over the whereabouts of absent November wages.• For Christmas, Wycombe could probably do with a fit goalkeeper. The arrival of Stephen Henderson on an emergency loan from Nottingham Forest means he will become the fifth keeper to don the gloves for Gareth Ainsworth’s side this season when they take on Barnsley on Saturday. Matt Ingram and David Stockdale have previously been drafted in on seven-day loans following injuries to Ryan Allsop and Yves Ma-Kalambay. Since Ingram’s transfer to QPR in January 2016, Wycombe have fielded 11 goalkeepers, including a seven-minute stint by the defender Jason McCarthy against Morecambe. Stockdale, ostracised at Birmingham, was keen to hang around but was recalled by his parent club."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61deffc3a8e26a9dc4da331683c22827e5a0f97b/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f3365824c06c34cc0dfc7ddcd0c9f26","title":"the 100 best female footballers in the world 2018","story":"Here are Nos 71 to 100 on the ’s list of best female players in the world.

That projection makes me very concerned and European nations and UN member states should be thinking about investing in rural transformation.”The former prime minister of Togo added: “For three years in a row, the state of food security and nutrition report shows that the level of food insecurity and malnutrition has been going up after decades of decreasing.“If those investments are not there at a time when climate change is also a pressure and when the population is growing then it is very clear that parts of the world will be left facing risk of famine.”Houngbo – in the UK to give a keynote speech at Chatham House – said a holistic approach is vital to prevent Africa’s young people being forced to migrate to urban areas or other countries because they are economically disadvantaged.“Investment in sustainable farming is essential for the livelihoods of those in rural communities and for food security but it is not enough to engage the younger generations,” he said.“That is why we need to look at the bigger picture – the priorities are decent schools, potable water and basic healthcare. I also consider access to WhatsApp to be a basic service. Young people need access to modern technology.”He said developing renewable energy would also be a consideration as some local grids are not up to the job. “If you cannot charge your cellphone or laptop, it’s difficult to do business.”With the right approach, smallholder farms can be turned into profitable businesses that supply local and national markets, generate surpluses and offer communities a pathway out of poverty and hunger, according to Ifad, the UN’s financial institution dedicated to rural areas.Action is needed by national governments, the development community and private sector partners to create the right conditions to make this possible, said Houngbo. His organisation is due to announce plans for an investment fund for young people in rural areas, available globally, but targeting young people in Africa.He said the sums would be in the region of $10,000 (£7,835) to $20,000, up to $1m – greater than the sums offered by microfinance institutions, but amounts that young people would find difficult to borrow from a bank.Ifad also wants to encourage rural startups and smallholder farms to develop resistance to climate change. The number of hungry people globally has risen for the third year in a row because of climate variability.It is currently field-testing a pilot called Cachet, which operates a hedging mechanism to protects smallholders against price volatility. It is already assisting small-scale producers of cocoa in Nigeria and maize in Senegal and aims to scale up to reach more beneficiaries in low- and middle-income countries.The scheme protects farmers against selling at a loss. Next year it will expand to use finance schemes to transfer climate-related risks.Investment in training and empowering women in rural areas is also vital to the transformation of rural economies. Research has shown that if women were to have the same access to agricultural resources as men, about 150 million fewer people would go hungry.Half of Ifad’s beneficiaries are women who struggle to access finance and land, and face challenges around inheritance and entitlement.“It’s not just about training the women, it’s about their ability to have a voice in rural life … it is essential they’re part of decision making,” said Houngbo.“It’s about changing policies and family law so women can attain equal rights. Also, it is one thing to change laws but enforcing them in rural areas can be very tricky if society has not bought into it.”Irene Nantale, 30, a local entrepreneur from Mashiaga village in Uganda’s eastern Mayuge District, was part of Ifad’s Project for Financial Inclusion in Rural Areas initiative and is testament to what women can achieve with small loans.Houngbo said her family had been struggling before she joined a savings and credit cooperative in 2013 and used her first loan to buy 50 chickens and a cow.When Houngbo visited Nantale in May she had 350 chickens, four cows, 12 goats and two employees on her farm. She had also invested some capital in opening a pharmacy in the village, filling a vital gap in local services. She plans to use her savings to send her three children to university.“We are looking beyond being food secure – we also want to generate income and profits,” explained Houngbo.The 57-year-old is no stranger to life in a poor farming community. Growing up in rural Togo, he became accustomed to missing meals and combining education with hard labour. Aged 11 he left his village because his father wanted to give him a better education in the capital.“I lived 240km away but every weekend and in the holidays I would go back to work on the farm. Vacation to us meant farming, it wasn’t a holiday,” said Houngbo.“I know what it’s like to live on one meal a day. But it is shocking to think that 50 years on that still exists in parts of the world. To me that is unacceptable and every day I have to ask myself if I’m doing as much as I can to help avoid that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9512f4dfc1ad4205735a77b98ca2a9e8f7d10f20/0_136_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efc2bd1b735b13a3a5aae9500e244616","title":"how to introduce your tweenager to online safety","story":"Parents are understandably anxious about discussing complex issues such as online bullying, screen time and the power of social media, but it’s a chat that can’t – and shouldn’t – be avoidedDiscussing the complications of being online is up there with the truth about Father Christmas and the birds and the bees on the list of conversations parents least look forward to having with their children, but it’s one that can’t be avoided.The tweenage years (10-12) are a time when children naturally begin to take more risks. This bravado is vital to their development. Combine it with a smartphone that gives instant access to a world of games and all sorts of video content, however, and you have a potentially tricky cocktail.“The internet is an amazing place and a wonderful resource, but, like all things, it has its dark side and its dangers,” says children’s commissioner Anne Longfield. “Parents have a vital role to play in making children aware of how to handle the challenges of being online.”Parents are understandably anxious and reticent about discussing some of these issues, but learning and behaviour specialist Noël Janis-Norton, who also founded calmerparenting, is adamant they should tackle the subjects early. “Don’t wait until something goes wrong,” she says. “The conversation needs to start before tweenagers even have a phone, so clear rules can be put in place.”It’s not a chat to be had on the fly either. “The more serious you can make the conversation feel, the more likely children will take it seriously,” she advises. “If there are two parents involved, both should sit down together, to make the message feel united.”Taking the issues seriously is one thing, but it’s important not to let the conversation become emotional or dramatic. “As adults we can really set the tone,” says chartered educational psychologist Dan O’Hare. “Do you want a child to learn that when they talk about subjects like this they make Mum or Dad scared and angry, or do you want them to learn that you can talk about difficult things together?”Dictating a list of how much screen time is allowed, or which apps are out-of-bounds, won’t work either. Instead, work together to agree a set of suitable guidelines or a contract – your children will be much more likely to stick to these rules. “Parents can learn a lot about the internet from their children, so it needn’t be a lecture or a telling off, but an exploration together,” says Longfield.It’s a view endorsed by O’Hare, who recommends that parents draw on the tricky online situations they’ve experienced personally. “If an adult talks about an upsetting post they’ve seen on Facebook they can then involve the child in discussing ways to deal with it. That collaborative coming together gives the young person a sense of responsibility.”How can parents know whether their messages and advice are truly getting through to their children? Janis-Norton recommends “think-throughs”, where a parent spends just a minute at a time encouraging a child to consider a situation and how they would respond to it. “Ask something like: ‘What can you tell a stranger online?’ or ‘How can you tell if somebody online is really a kid?’ to get your child thinking about things properly. Their brain will automatically start visualising what they should do, so it sticks in their mind much better.”Having set these guidelines, it’s vital that parents praise their children when they abide by them, such as by turning off their phones at mealtimes. “Parents can be so preoccupied that they don’t say anything when things are going well, and only notice when something’s going wrong,” says Janis-Norton. “Praise helps a child associate following the rules with their parents being pleased and there being a relaxed, happy atmosphere at home.”There’s a growing amount of practical tools that can help. The monqi phone management app creates a closed and entirely safe ecosystem that makes it easy for kids to get started online, using a handset such as the IMO S2 the app also enables parents to monitor what their children are up to online via their own phone, and set screen time limits. Then there’s the phone behaviour contract for families, created by tech expert Andy Robertson, and Childline’s Zipit app, which gives kids the tools to deflect unwanted online attention – with the help of downloadable gifs.Parents can take an active practical role here too. “It’s all very well telling a child to block someone on Instagram or report them on Facebook, but they need to know how to actually do it,” says O’Hare. “As adults we have a responsibility to learn how to do these things ourselves, so we can teach the children.”Of course, the discussion about online safety doesn’t end there. New tech, new trends and even new friends all bring fresh challenges that will need to be talked about and agreed upon. But by establishing open, relaxed ways of communicating about tricky issues, parents can keep healthy conversations going throughout childhood, into adolescence and beyond.Visit Tesco Mobile to find out more about the IMO S2 with monqi"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/841058cc8cd9af17a6167a3023c35614392e20a0/0_2_1960_1176/master/1960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=890f10052caff9c4a2ae349b6c2a5d86","title":"legal analytics when big data meets big law","story":"Automated data analysis has changed how scientists think about health research, and is helping uncover inefficiencies in transport systems. Now it’s making waves in the legal sectorData is invading the legal system. In January, prosecutors in Germany presented a court with data from an iPhone suggesting a suspect was climbing stairs when it was alleged he had been dragging a body down a steep bank. It isn’t the only case of its kind: pacemaker data has been used in US courts as evidence against a wearer and data from fitness trackers has been used to indicate how, for example, a person’s lifestyle has changed after an injury.The amount of data being created by the devices people carry around has grown exponentially, and had a knock-on impact across multiple professions. For criminal lawyers, it has increased the potential evidence that’s available, and this increase in data has been mirrored across all branches of law. It’s a trend that has the potential to completely disrupt the legal profession. “The biggest impact,” says James Rogers, a solicitor at Norton Rose Fulbright, “will not be caused by big data alone – rather it will be the combination of big data with other innovations, such as artificial intelligence (AI) or distributed ledger technologies.”Data created through the legal process is already being digitised and combined with other tech. It has the potential to make the jobs of lawyers more straightforward. “We will be able to find pertinent cases more easily through better recommender systems that leverage machine learning,” says Wolfgang Alschner, an assistant professor in common law at the University of Ottawa. “Another area is document and compliance review, where computers can find patterns in large amounts of texts more reliably and quickly.”Everlaw, a legal tech startup that has raised more than $25m from Silicon Valley investors, is applying AI to historic legal reports to help lawyers prioritise and analyse documents. It is using computer science to visualise data from documents and predict the most relevant cases for lawyers to inspect.For such a system to analyse court cases and predict decisions, it needs data. But this has to be the right type of data. It needs to be easily read and understood by machines – scruffy handwriting can be tough to interpret, but clear check boxes on forms are easier for software to understand. If big data is machine readable, then AI systems can save the legal industry money and time.Rogers says it will initially have the greatest impact on areas that are “relatively formulaic and process- or volume-driven”. This includes disclosure, verification, first-tier due diligence review and similar processes. However, AI won’t be using data to formulate complex adversarial arguments at any point soon. “Human elements: intuition, judgment, emotion, memory, perception and so on, are all integral to that process,” he says.It’s already been proven that data can be put to work to speed up lengthy legal processes. In one instance, the UK’s Serious Fraud Office found itself with more than 30m documents to examine during a corruption investigation into Rolls-Royce.“The program was able to interpret and understand material from a range of sources, including emails, financial records, data tables and photographs – but, unlike a human team, it could work efficiently for days on end without interruption,” he says. The SFO won the case – its biggest investigation – and Rolls-Royce was ordered by a court to pay £497m, plus the costs of the SFO’s investigation.For the moment, AI and analytical platforms create an advantage for legal firms and clients that can afford to pay for it. But it also has the potential to democratise the sector. “It will make legal services more accessible to lay people by driving down costs and by fuelling the development of self-help applications directly targeted at non-lawyers,” Alschner says. “All this will transform the role of the lawyer and their day-to-day legal practice.”Stanford law student Joshua Browder has been pivotal in improving how legal data can be combined with technology to make the law easier to comprehend. He created a chat-bot “lawyer,” called DoNotPay, which allows users to contest parking tickets they have received. Browder says the system talks people through the legal steps required to make a complaint and automatically files their issue. It has won more than 400,000 cases. The DoNotPay system has since been expanded to tackle legal loopholes used when flights are booked, to help customers get automatic refunds.But there are some concerns around the use of big data. Data scientists, across multiple fields, have shown that automated systems inherit any bias that’s contained in the data they are trained upon. In some cases, AI has replicated racist and sexist language it has seen in data sets. Alschner argues that legal data needs to be freely accessible, while also ensuring that privacy laws are respected.“Law is a public good,” he says. “But most legal texts, from court decisions to filings, are only accessible through commercial service providers that do not generally share data in bulk.” The solution to the problem? “Large legal information providers can lead the way by sharing more of their data with academics, governments and legal analytics companies,” Alschner adds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/909ed19610b6b4fa645e57ef8027363ef17dd8ab/0_117_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90237ba1b83c5e0a94a89398e554788f","title":"honduras a dam and the of berta caceres","story":"Seven men have been convicted of the murder of an award-winning environmental activist in Honduras.

The prime minister can’t keep pushing parliament away or avoiding responsible scrutiny,” he said.MPs had already voted down a government compromise, which would have referred the dispute to parliament’s privileges committee, delaying it until after next week’s crunch vote on May’s deal.With the prime minister still waiting to open the formal debate, MPs then inflicted a third defeat, passing a cross-party amendment tabled by MPs including Dominic Grieve aimed at strengthening the hand of parliament if the deal is voted down.Backers of a softer Brexit – or a second referendum on May’s deal – cheered the move, which they hope will allow them to demonstrate parliament’s support for alternatives to May’s approach.This soft Brexit compromise has been championed by the former Conservative minister Nick Boles as a plan B for leaving the European Union if Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement is defeated in the Commons.It is based on Norway’s relationship with the EU, which is outside the bloc and the customs union but inside the single market. Under the plan the UK would have to join Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland in the European Free Trade Association (Efta), which would then allow it to participate in the European Economic Area (EEA).The ‘plus’ in this option refers to a temporary customs union with the EU, which would need to be negotiated to avoid a hard border ion the island of Ireland. The temporary arrangement would remain in place until the EU and UK agreed a specific trade deal.The option has the advantage of being as close to the EU as possible without full membership, and it would do away with the need for a problematic backstop for Northern Ireland. Like Norway, the UK would be outside the common fisheries and agriculture policies, and would not be subject to the European court of justice.But it crosses a key red line for Brexiters by continuing freedom of movement, one of the preconditions of single market membership. It would also limit the UK ability to negotiate its own trade deals while a new customs arrangement is under discussion. And it would require continued financial contributions to the EU without an influence inside the bloc.Grieve said: “MPs are tonight starting the process of taking back control. No longer must the will of parliament – reflecting the will of the people – be diminished. Parliament must now take back control and then give the final decision back to the public because, in the end, only the people can sort this out.”Grieve’s amendment was supported by the Democratic Unionist party and by 26 Tory rebels, including several former cabinet ministers, some of them erstwhile loyalists, such as Damian Green and Michael Fallon. The government lost by 321 votes to 299.Asked if May still commanded a majority in parliament, a No 10 source said: “Everybody knows the parliamentary arithmetic but during the course of this administration, we have won the overwhelming majority of the votes taking place.”May went on to open the debate with a defiant speech, which some at Westminster said sounded like a first draft of her own political obituary, with the future of her government in doubt.“I have spent nearly two years negotiating this deal. I have lost valued colleagues along the way. And faced fierce criticism from all sides,” she said.“If I had banged the table, walked out of the room and at the end of the process delivered the very same deal that is before us today, some might say I had done a better job. But I didn’t play to the gallery, I focused on getting a deal that honours the referendum and sets us on course for a bright future – and I did so through painstaking hard work.”Doggedly vowing to plough on with her controversial EU deal, the prime minister insisted there was no alternative that could command public support – and warned that rejecting it would be risky. “This argument has gone on long enough, it is corrosive to our politics and life depends on compromise,” she said.The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, replying to the prime minister, dismissed the political declaration accompanying the 585-page withdrawal agreement as “a very vague wish list.”“We still don’t know what our long-term relationship with Europe would look like and that’s why so many MPs across parliament are not willing to vote for this blindfold Brexit and take a leap in the dark about Britain’s future,” he said.May faced a series of hostile interventions from her own side, with the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who resigned in protest at her deal in July, calling it “a national humiliation, that makes a mockery of Brexit”.“We are going to be rule-takers we are going to be a de facto colony – and out of sheer funk we are ensuring we will never, ever be able to take advantage of the freedoms we should have won through Brexit,” he warned.Brexiters remained defiant, despite the passage of the Grieve amendment. The former Department for Exiting the EU minister Steve Baker, who vainly sought to spearhead a no confidence motion against May last month, insisted motions passed by MPs in the wake of the deal being rejected could not be binding.Privately, pro-Brexit sources suggested they would be content if May’s deal is rejected by a margin of at least 50 votes.While the government opposed the Grieve amendment, Downing Street hopes it will focus the minds of pro-Brexit MPs, by increasing the likelihood that the defeat of May’s deal next week would result in a fresh referendum. With just a week to go before Tuesday’s vote, May is expected to spend time meeting colleagues inidually in a bid to win them over.The government is also making fresh efforts to woo the DUP by offering further reassurances over access to the mainland’s market if the prime minister’s deal is voted through.“We are talking about unilateral commitments we can give in the House of Commons to provide reassurance in relation to providing access to the GB market,” a Downing Street source said.Earlier, as Labour MPs heard they had defeated the government in the contempt motion, a loud cheer went up, with one opposition backbencher shouting: “Beginning of the end!”The attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, had argued that the public interest did not permit the publication of the legal advice and instead published a summary and took questions in the House of Commons on Monday.During the debate, Starmer said the government was “wilfully refusing” to comply with a binding order to release the legal advice on its Brexit deal, putting it in contempt of parliament.Downing Street sources later sought to clarify reports that May would publish the legal advice on Wednesday, indicating that while the government will respond to the contempt vote, it might not publish the advice within 24 hours. “The legal advice will be published. The government will respond tomorrow,” one said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6818d325ef4e67e25e732eaf50a5e6826c2f2595/167_48_1310_786/master/1310.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=471271a5c1154ba879fea531cb4ce89a","title":"may to publish brexit legal advice as tories urge change of course","story":"Papers to be released at 11.30am, after contempt vote MPs are told they will ‘live to regret’The government will release legal advice received over Brexit on Wednesday morning following Tuesday’s extraordinary three parliamentary defeats in a single day.Andrea Leadsom said the documents would be handed over at 11.30am after MPs passed a historic motion finding the government in contempt of parliament for failing to previously publish.Meanwhile, a string of Conservative colleagues urged the prime minister to change her plans for Brexit, which are due to be voted upon on Tuesday. She is facing almost certain defeat when MPs vote on the withdrawal agreement on 11 December.In a defiant interview on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, Leadsom, the leader of the House, said any MP who had ambitions of being in government at some point in the future would “live to regret” the contempt vote that forced the government to publish its full Brexit legal advice.She said Wednesday night’s defeats made leaving the EU without a deal more likely and urged colleagues to return to the deal when they voted on it next Tuesday.“Law officers themselves will be very reluctant to give advice which they might then see across the front pages of the newspapers.“Frankly, any parliamentarian who wants at some point to be in government is going to live to regret their vote last night.”Asked whether Theresa May was the right person to lead the government, she said: “She certainly is at the moment.”Leadsom, one of few long-term Brexiters who have stuck with May’s deal, argued that MPs had not properly read the deal on offer.“There has been an awful lot of misinformation about what’s in this deal,” she said.Leadsom’s interview followed that of Mark Harper, the former Tory chief whip. He told Today that the prime minister had to go back to Brussels to demand the backstop came out of the deal to eliminate a wedge between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.“She should listen to Conservative colleagues … It would undermine the UK common market and threaten the integrity of the UK by creating a customs and regulatory border down the Irish Sea,” he said.Harper urged the prime minister to return to Brussels to attempt to negotiate a new deal before the leaving date of 29 March.“There will be new facts on the table and she will have to go back to our European partners,” he said.Even if May did win Tuesday’s vote, she would not be able to govern because the DUP would withdraw support, Harper said.“If the deal goes through, we will be in office but unable to govern and we saw what happened yesterday,” he said.Justine Greening, the former education secretary and a remainer, called for a three-option second referendum to see the government through the current chaos, warning that without it “we could be debating Brexit not for the next five days but for the next five years”.“I think it has been clear since the summer that the Commons is in gridlock,” she said.“This is less about the future of the Tory party but more about how we can bring the country together.”The parliamentary veteran and former minister Oliver Letwin called for the government to move towards a “Norway-plus” deal – analternative that would keep the UK in the EU single market, through membership of the European Economic Area, the 31-country zone that covers EU member states plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.This soft Brexit compromise has been championed by the former Conservative minister Nick Boles as a plan B for leaving the European Union if Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement is defeated in the Commons.It is based on Norway’s relationship with the EU, which is outside the bloc and the customs union but inside the single market. Under the plan the UK would have to join Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland in the European Free Trade Association (Efta), which would then allow it to participate in the European Economic Area (EEA).The ‘plus’ in this option refers to a temporary customs union with the EU, which would need to be negotiated to avoid a hard border ion the island of Ireland. The temporary arrangement would remain in place until the EU and UK agreed a specific trade deal.The option has the advantage of being as close to the EU as possible without full membership, and it would do away with the need for a problematic backstop for Northern Ireland. Like Norway, the UK would be outside the common fisheries and agriculture policies, and would not be subject to the European court of justice.But it crosses a key red line for Brexiters by continuing freedom of movement, one of the preconditions of single market membership. It would also limit the UK ability to negotiate its own trade deals while a new customs arrangement is under discussion. And it would require continued financial contributions to the EU without an influence inside the bloc.Promoted by the Conservative former minister Nick Boles, the Norway-plus option also means joining the European Free Trade Area, which also includes Switzerland.Letwin told the programme: “There is a very high possibility that the deal will be voted down.“If I was a betting man, I would say that all the motions will fail.“If we have a Norway-plus solution, the whole issue of a backstop falls away.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a715529f7ed14e77ae799a38c7c258e4e53ea0ec/0_299_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4eae86523502564d36ee5f663a35c6ad","title":"brexit debate pmqs legal advice may corbyn government to publish full legal advice at around 1130am politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs and the second day of the Commons debate on the Brexit dealJustine Greening, the Conservative former cabinet minister who is now campaigning for a second referendum on Brexit, was also on the Today programme this morning. If MPs fail to pass a deal by January, then the Dominic Grieve amendment passed yesterday means that MPs could vote for a “plan B” option - which could conceivably involve a second referendum.But Greening’s interview highlighted two of the difficulties with this potential scenario.I won’t support a no confidence motion, which is what Labour would need in order to get into government. I think in all party’s it’s time to show more leadership from the front benches and do what we need to do in the national interest.I think when parliament finally takes its head out of the sand, as does government, and recognises that we are in gridlock, yes, we will have to have a government in place with a prime minister that can deliver on that second referendum.But her answer to the no confidence vote question illustrated why this may never happen.UK service sector growth has fallen to near-stagnation, with business confidence weakest since Brexit vote, my colleague Graeme Wearden reports on his business live blog.Dominic Raab, the former government lawyer who resigned from his post as Brexit secretary over his opposition to Theresa May’s deal, made the same argument as Andrea Leadsom (see 9.28am) when he was interviewed by the Today programme this morning. Asked about the Dominic Grieve amendment, he said:I think the Grieve amendment was predictable but what we need to understand is that resolutions of Parliament pass as politically have some impact, but they are not legally binding. And therefore if the deal is voted down on Tuesday I think what will matter most of all will not be what parliament says in a motion - it will need legislation to stop Brexit - what will matter is the will and resolve in Number 10 Downing Street.Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons and a prominent Brexiter, has been giving a series of interviews this morning. Here are the key points.JW: Are you saying that parliament could say, as a majority of parliament would, we don’t want to go out with no deal, but the government could say, ‘Sorry, that’s what’s going to happen’, and it would then happen.AL: Parliament can certainly say that. But the issue is that the government is committed to leaving the European Union in line with the referendum and unless government were to do something completely different to change tack, or indeed to pass this deal, then we will be leaving the EU on 29 March next year without a deal.JW: What MPs think is that they now have the power to stop it defaulting to no deal. And you’re saying, no they don’t.AL: Well, I can’t see that they do. And I think that the issue is that the default position is no deal.Going forward, not only will government ministers be very careful about what they ask law officers to give advice on, but law officers themselves will be very reluctant to give any advice to government that they might then see published on the front pages of the newspapers, so it’s the principle of the thing. And frankly I think any parliamentarian who wants at some point in the future to be in government is going to live to regret their vote last night.Among those predicting that May will resign next week is Damian McBride, Gordon Brown’s former communications chief who is now a Labour adviser. After May’s speech in the Commons McBride posted this on Twitter.Shami Chakrabarti, the shadow attorney general, was also on the Today programme this morning. She said Labour would not rule out extending article 50. Asked about the prospect, she said:It can’t be ruled out because the clock is ticking ... I think there would be time if Mrs May heard what happened in the House of Commons last night and decided to think again and go back to her European colleagues right now and not wait until next week.Jeremy Corbyn says that, if Theresa May cannot get her deal through the Commons, she should make way for Labour so that it can negotiate a better one, and for that to happen article 50 would probably have to happen anyway. Chakrabarti was just accepting something implicit in the Labour position.We’re awash with Brexit news today, but probably the most striking to emerge from all the broadcast interviews this morning is this, from Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons.That is what Leadsom told the Today programme this morning. She was also very interesting on the whole issue of whether the Grieve amendment passed yesterday, against the government’s wishes, removes the chance of the UK having a no deal Brexit, as some remainers hope. It doesn’t, she claims. I will post more on this soon.Here is our overnight story with a summary of what happened yesterday.Here is the agenda for the day.10am: Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, gives evidence to the Commons international trade committee.11am: Peers begin their three-day debate on the Brexit deal.Around 11.30am: The government publishes the full Brexit legal advice that was shown to the cabinet.12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs.1pm: Philip Hammond, the chancellor, gives evidence to the Commons Treasury committee about Brexit.Around 1pm: Sajid Javid, the home secretary, opens day two of the Commons Brexit debate.As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing almost exclusively on Brexit.

And it doesn’t have to break the bank.Scattering plants around the officeYou don’t need to be a botanist to realise the positive effect plants can have on an environment, and the workplace is no different. Plants that have been shown to have a de-stressing effect include aloe vera, peace lilies, bamboo palm, spider plants and rubber trees. Try dotting a few of these on your desk and around the office and see what the effect is on people’s moods.Allowing petsThe act of stroking a dog has been shown to increase levels of a hormone called oxytocin in both the dog and the human, while reducing cortisol levels in the person, too. Oxytocin is a happy hormone, whereas, cortisol is related to stress. So stroking dogs makes you happier and less stressed.At the UK Mars Petcare offices, dogs are a constant feature. “What’s amazing about having dogs in the office is the genuine relationship of support that can build over time between people and pets,” says Essler, who also works at a pet care company.“I often notice people taking short breaks in their day to stroke, cuddle or play with the dogs, which relieves their stress and over time builds a positive bond with the dog,” she says. “This unconditional relationship is extremely beneficial in challenging environments and often I see dogs seeking to comfort those who are having a difficult day.”Creating a stress-free zoneTaking time away from the threat – or perceived threat – that’s making you stressed has been shown to be one of the most effective ways to overcome it. This is why having a separate area that people can go to when they feel overwhelmed will help improve the wellbeing of people in your office. It doesn’t have to be anything fancy it might be a coffee area or simply a corner of the office with beanbags or cushions.Socialising“We’re only a small team, but spending time together outside of the workplace to relax, bond, laugh and reflect has improved productivity and team dynamics endlessly,” says Ben Barker, founder of cold-brew coffee company Artemis Brew.“It can be as simple, cheap and non-disruptive as you make it,” he says. His team has been to events such as escape rooms and independent film festivals, and it usually involves a beer or two afterwards.Playing musicMusic can be comforting, relaxing and it has been shown to increase productivity. Instead of having everyone listening to their own music through headphones, try playing music in your office to help people feel less stressed.“We have the radio playing in all areas of the building,” says Tracey Dawson, managing director at Daletech Electronics, a company with 14 employees.Or, if you’re in the mood for something a bit different, why not try a podcast?“We love having music on in the office, but more recently we’ve been putting podcasts on, too, which are a great alternative,” says James Gupta, founder and CEO at Synap, an online education platform.Communication is keyMaking sure everyone knows what is going on helps to manage stress, says Gupta. “At the beginning of every week, we have a team meeting to discuss what we’ll each be working on,” he says. “The development team get to see how their work is being received by customers, and the sales team have an understanding of when new features are likely to be available.”Provide healthy snacks“We try to encourage active, healthy lifestyles, so we supply free fruit and we have a company lunch together once a week,” says Dawson.Healthy eating has been shown to help stress levels decrease, and if someone is working to a deadline, having a quick, healthy snack might be exactly what they need to get through a busy morning. Offering caffeine-free alternatives to tea and coffee can also help keep tempers from boiling over and keep the jitters at bay.Celebrate success“Celebrating success is important,” says Gillian Rattray, entrepreneur acceleration manager at Royal Bank of Scotland.Recognising small wins such as hitting certain revenue targets or securing an important meeting helps even out the rollercoaster of running a business. “At the moment, we are looking carefully at celebration,” says Dawson. “As a first step, we have installed a ship’s bell that we ring each time an order leaves the building.”“In my own business, we had fizz days – we bought a bottle of sparkling wine when we made £1,000 or more in a day,” says Rattray. “The more revenue we earned, the more fizz we bought!”SEAT believes in helping people move forward by making it easier to get to the good stuff.

That was almost twice the expected amount.The one-and-a-half-page letter, written in 1954 in German and addressed to the philosopher Eric Gutkind, contains reflections on God, the Bible and Judaism.Einstein says: “The word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a collection of honourable, but still primitive, legends which are nevertheless pretty childish.”The sentence has been hailed as evidence that the physicist, one of the 20th century’s most esteemed thinkers, was an atheist. But Einstein at times said he was not an atheist, and resented being labelled as one.In the letter – being auctioned at Christie’s in New York on Tuesday – Einstein, a Jew, also articulates his disenchantment with Judaism. “For me the Jewish religion like all others is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions. And the Jewish people to whom I gladly belong and with whose mentality I have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people,” he wrote.“As far as my experience goes, they are no better than other human groups, although they are protected from the worst cancers by a lack of power. Otherwise I cannot see anything ‘chosen’ about them.”The letter was written in response to a book by Gutkind, called Choose Life: The Biblical Call to Revolt.The letter had been held among Gutkin’s papers, but it came up for auction in London in 2008. The evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins was beaten in bidding that ended at £170,000.Acknowledging his disappointment in failing to secure the item, Dawkins said: “This letter was about something very important to Einstein, I suspect.”According to Einstein: A Life, a biography published in 1996, he was devoutly religious as a child. But at the age of 13, he “abandoned his uncritical religious fervour, feeling he had been deceived into believing lies”.He said he believed in “Spinoza’s God” – referring to Baruch Spinoza, a 17th-century Dutch thinker – “who reveals himself in the lawful harmony of the world, not in a God who concerns himself with the fate and the doings of mankind”.On another occasion, he criticised “fanatical atheists whose intolerance is of the same kind as the intolerance of the religious fanatics”.Nick Spencer, a senior fellow at the Christian thinktank Theos, said: “Einstein offers scant consolation to either party in this debate. His cosmic religion and distant deistic God fits neither the agenda of religious believers or that of tribal atheists.“As so often during his life, he refused and disturbed the accepted categories. We do the great physicist a disservice when we go to him to legitimise our belief in God, or in his absence.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a13a26a30a79942075e75216fb614ee9edfd984b/0_91_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3fae44687d5e8fc029cf7173a3cfd85f","title":"jobs homes services inequality young people","story":"Young people’s health and wellbeing is being eroded by a lack of jobs, a shortage of housing and cuts to public services. A new report by the Health Foundation published today concludes that in many cases, the long term health of 16- to 24-year-olds is being jeopardised by socioeconomic factors and a lack of public services. “To be healthy, everyone needs a job, a friend, somewhere to live and education or job opportunities,” says Jo Bibby, director of health at the Health Foundation. “Conversely, not having those things increases the chances of illness later in life.”Whereas life expectancy for 15- to 19-year-olds typically rose by two to three years between 2001 and 2010, after 2012 the rate of increase stalled. A  estimation using ONS projections shows that in 2018, a 15-year-old boy growing up in the UK can expect to live until they are around 88 years old, while a girl of the same age can expect to live until 91.In the five areas in today’s report, North Ayrshire has the lowest life expectancy. A 15- to 19-year-old boy can expect to live for around another 61 years and girls of the same age can expect to live for another 66, meaning that longevity has actually fallen. In Bradford, life expectancy for males is marginally lower than it was in 2011-13 and marginally higher for females. Lisburn has the highest life expectancy: 15- to 19-year-old boys can expect to live for around another 66 years and a girl could live for around another 69 years. Life expectancy has continued to rise in Bristol, in Lisburn and for young women in Denbighshire.The World Health Organisation says that half of all inequalities in major diseases are due to social factors, such as where people are born, grow up, live, work and become old. Poverty has a major impact on health. Young people from the most deprived areas of the UK are twice as likely to be obese, smoke regularly and get pregnant under the age of 18 than young people in the most affluent areas, according to the Association for Young People’s Health.Young people “could clearly see how a precarious labour market combined with very low family income made it difficult for their parents to fulfil their role in supporting them into adulthood,” the report states. It also finds that even in more affluent places, those from poorer families or neighbourhoods said poverty affected their family life and their mental health, with some young people being reluctant to raise personal issues with their family because they didn’t want to add to the pressure their parents were under.Increasing numbers of young people do not have stable accommodation. Figures released today by the housing charity Shelter show that 131,000 children in England are homeless, the highest rate in a decade. Of these, 9,500 are living in emergency accommodation like B\u0026ampBs, with the remainder in temporary accommodation.“When children experience homelessness, we often start to see significant damage to their physical, emotional and social development,” says Greg Beales, director of campaigns at Shelter. Nutritional needs are unmet, and feelings of fear and isolation cause distress and the potential for long-term mental health issues.“To move every few weeks to different areas, away from friends and other family members to live in cramped conditions with mould, damp and rats – these are all extremely traumatising for children. Education is disrupted and teachers tell us that they start to see children struggle with both their work and their behaviour.“It is our collective failure that a society as wealthy as ours can allow the number of children who are homeless to keep rising every year. It simply doesn’t have to be this way.”It’s not just young people’s physical health that is being put at risk, researchers conclude. According to the latest figures, almost 390,000 under-18s in England a year are being treated for mental health conditions, while GPs are referring around 50,000 a month to mental health services. But cuts means young people often have to wait a long time for help. “We saw the immediate impact of the day-to-day pressures young people face at home, school and among their peer groups on their wellbeing,” the report states. “We also saw a support system that is inadequate in its ability to intervene early and meet current demand.”Cuts to public services are a particular worry for 16- to 24-year-olds across all five areas, the report finds, especially youth services. “There was one youth club in my area and I loved going when I was younger – but it has closed down now and there is nothing else in the area,” a young person from Bradford told researchers. Analysis by the public sector union Unison published earlier this week reveals that across the UK, over 760 youth centres have disappeared since 2012. And since 2016, nearly 900 youth worker jobs have been cut and at least 160 youth centres have shut down. “Youth services help with employment, training and education, potential mental health issues, and act to prevent alcohol and substance abuse, as well as crime and anti-social behaviour,” says Unison general secretary, Dave Prentis. “Funding for these services should not be cut at a time when they are needed more than ever.”Cuts to public transport, in particular buses, have also hit young people hard, reducing their ability to find and get a job or stay in education, unless their parents can take them in the car, the report finds. “The college here closed down. A lot of people can’t get to the other campus, so they just aren’t going now,” says one of the young researchers in Denbighshire.“Our findings show that young people’s health and futures are being put at risk by a lack of stable jobs, cuts to public services and a lack of affordable housing,” says Bibby. “The government needs to put investment in young people’s futures at the heart of policy. If we continue to ignore this generation’s needs, our society will pay a high price.”“North Ayrshire is a very ided place in terms of health and wealth,” says 23-year-old Nairn McDonald. “Depending on where you go, you’re either going to be told how great it is in the wealthy areas, or in the poorer areas you’re going to get told that there’s a lack of support and a lack of hope or aspiration”.The area also performs worse than the rest of Scotland on a range of health indicators. “In Kilwinning you can start off in a wealthy private estate with a high life expectancy” explains McDonald, “but if you just walk through the main street you get to a council estate where male life expectancy drops by 21 years.”“There are big problems with mental health, addiction, drug abuse, alcohol abuse and just generally being there for one another,” agrees 18-year-old Mackenzie Hollis. “It’s a good community but with drugs and alcohol and knife crime, after 5pm I wouldn’t feel safe enough to walk through the town centre”.Young people want more “safe spaces” for them to engage with each other and “relax, calm down or open up” in. They advocate a rise in the number of youth groups and the development of peer-to-peer mentoring, and training for teachers in mental health and removing the stigma around male mental health in particular. To ensure a basic level of support and opportunity, they also advocate widening the provision of the educational maintenance allowance – currently available for students under 20, dependent on financial circumstances – to include every young person in the area.Despite the challenges, many young people feel optimistic about the future. “North Ayrshire is unique because we’ll fix things rather than waiting for somebody to fix them for us” says McDonald.Hollis agrees. “The first thing I’d do to solve these problems is get the whole community together and ask them what they want and what they need,” she says. “And then I’d say: ‘how are we going to work together to do that?’”Grace Holland, 18, is busy. She is a full-time college student, cares for her mother and has a string of zero-hours jobs ranging from healthcare assistant to cleaner and waitress.On top of thatIf that were not enough, Holland has been dealing with her mental health issues for six years. “I started self harming when I was 12 due to my family breaking down. That was the trigger for me. I began worrying about finances. I didn’t know what I was feeling. I didn’t know how to explain it. Nobody believed me. They thought I was being a normal teenager, worrying about stuff, a bit angsty.” Eventually she was diagnosed as having depression, anxiety and OCD.“There are certainly a lot of challenges,” says Holland. “I think there are more pressures on young people now. Work is difficult. I have been in several jobs on zero-hours contracts where I’ve been told I have to compete for my hours with my colleagues, which isn’t something you should be doing.“Drink, drugs and smoking is a problem. I know many people who turn to them as a way to cope because it relaxes you.” Holland would like a job in mental health but needs to juggle that ambition with caring for her mother. The idea of breaking out and having her own home seems a long way away. “The only way I can see myself buying a property is if I won the lottery. It’s a pipe dream.”The cost of buying or renting has increased beyond the reach of many. And latest figures from housing charity Shelter show that 846 children and young people are homeless. “Bristol is a city that doesn’t have affordable housing for young people,” says Dom Wood, chief executive of 1625 Independent People, a charity that supports young people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. “If you are unemployed or in low-paid work you get £293 a month towards your rent. The average rent for a room last year in a shared house was £480 a month. The average flat is £780. People are being priced out of areas. Young people and their families are moving out from areas where their social networks are.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83882f4ccd86755bd7731946d0cf19212b8a2f33/0_0_4992_2995/master/4992.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41a52d77338d656d248c1beb5d7096f1","title":"private firms making big money childrens social services","story":"Companies have colonised social work, with those at the top taking the profits while families in difficulty continue to sufferThe Local Government Association predicts that by 2020 there will be a £2bn funding gap just to maintain children’s services at what is already a threadbare patchwork quilt shredded by years of cuts. Central government grants to local government have halved over the past eight years. The government intends this trend to continue, despite children’s services budgets already overspending by £800m a year. Services are shrinking but still overspending while the funding pot is being repeatedly squeezed.But there is another dimension to the children’s social services crisis. The pot is not only being squeezed. It is leaking. What had been a trickle of public funding for children’s services taken as profits by private companies is now a steady stream. The private sector has substantially infiltrated and colonised children’s social services and social work, with big money being made by the owners and senior managers of commercial companies. Just look at what has already happened in England.Almost three-quarters of children’s homes in England are privately owned and managed, and almost half of all local authorities do not provide and manage any children’s homes. Almost a third of all children in foster care in England live with foster carers provided through private agencies. In 2015, Corporate Watch reported that eight private foster care agencies (there are many more) made profits of  more than £40m while also making big payments to senior managers. One of the biggest agencies recently sold itself on to a hedge fund, with its two previous owners likely to have received a substantial financial windfall.The extent to which companies have dug into and captured children’s social work is not only deep but also wide. It includes companies being funded by central government to shape the future education and accreditation of children’s social workers and managing the short-term money the government is making available for “innovation” in children’s social services, trumpeted as additional funding but minuscule when set alongside the real reduction in government grant.Why should any of this be of much concern? First, money that should be helping children and families in difficulty is instead ending up in the pockets of those who are already rich. This is particularly awful at a time when budgets are being decimated.Second, it is undermining quality, creating fragmentation and lack of continuity. And the turnover of agency staff means the history of the children and their families is largely unknown to social workers who have little chance of building relationships of trust and care.Third, accountability and transparency have been blown away. Private companies can hide behind commercial confidentiality. The concept of local authorities as a caring corporate parent is challenged when they depend on short-term agency social workers, themselves largely unknown to the council, arranging and overseeing children’s placements.Amid poorer services costing more money, it surely would be timely to turn off the tap pouring profits to private companies. The government and senior civil servants may favour the private sector but stopping public funds being taken as private profit is a sensible step to take, and to start to take quickly.• Ray Jones’ new book In Whose Interest?

Or rather, I tried to sit down. I realised quite quickly that I couldn’t fit into the seat. It wasn’t “a bit tight” – I was absolutely unable to get my bum in between the two armrests. For a moment, I panicked. I considered if I could just, sort of, sit on the armrests. Maybe I could seem like one of those cool people who choose to sit differently on a chair to impress people, like a new teacher in an 80s teen film.I found an usher and said, “Excuse me, but I seem to be too fat for your seats.” The usher wore the facial expression of someone currently having the worst shift of his life.A few minutes later, I was led to the front of the stalls. At the end of the third row, they placed a tall chair. A stool. Throughout the show, I sat raised above the entire audience. Like a lifeguard. Or a princess. Or maybe as a warning to the rest of the audience about what will happen to them if they finish their popcorn.There is a loneliness to being fat and I am obsessed with it. I want to understand what effect it has on us fat people, when an entire society tries to find the balance between pretending that we don’t exist and making sure that it won’t accommodate us.I have just finished writing my book, Happy Fat. It’s part memoir, part self-help, part everything I know about fatness and my own fatness in particular. My friend Scottee – an artist, writer and fat activist – is one of the main people who introduced me to the idea of Fat Liberation and Fat Acceptance. He showed me that I was not alone in my fatness.This weekend, 20 fatties will compete in a beauty and talent pageant at Shoreditch Town Hall called Hamburger Queen, with me as the head judge and Scottee as curator and host. I am very excited about being a judge. I once judged a competition for new comedians. No one had asked me to, I just did. Anyways, Scottee and I met up to talk about the meaning of an event like Hamburger Queen and the meaning of fat community.I tell Scottee about my experience in the theatre. “There are these moments of fat survival that people never really have to acknowledge, right?” he says. “Going into a theatre: will I fit into the seat? Have I got an aisle seat? Is it going to be really hot in there? Having to think about the clothes you’re going to wear that night. Things like carrying deodorant around with you constantly and being really aware that you don’t want to be like the socially fat person, like, sweating and smelly.”It’s not that people don’t want to hang out with us – they do. They just don’t want other people to see. I tell Scottee about something that once happened to me: I heard a comedian on a podcast joke about how fat women can’t get laid till everyone is so drunk that they can’t see straight. The hosts laugh and, in the best bro-manner, agree with him. I sat listening to that on a bus, blinking so quickly I thought my eyes were about to fly away from my face. Approximately three weeks before the comedian said that on a podcast, he had begged me to come by his house to have sex. He was sober and he had laid rose petals on the floor and the radio played my favourite album. But maybe that’s less funny on a podcast than pretending that fat people aren’t sexual beings. I don’t even think he thought about me eventually listening to that conversation. Because somehow, fat people not being sexual beings, is somehow true, even if they’re someone you’ve slept with yourself recently.Scottee nods: “And when we’re fat-shamed, we’re often on our own. We’re often on our own in a public space, being shouted at, or we’re often on our own with our GP who’s telling us we need a gastric band when we’re just there because we’ve got an ingrown toenail or something. When we’re waddling down the high street decapitated by a news item, we’re on our own. When we’re on our own, we’re picked off.”When I talk about being fat to people who aren’t fat, people feel uncomfortable. People can only just about handle it when I preach about how hot I am, how I love my fatness, how I adore my body and how I think it’s beautiful. People either clap their hands at my “bravery”, flat out refuse to believe me or become infuriated because it goes against everything they’ve been taught.But when I talk about the negative experiences – the seats I don’t fit into, the men who mock my body on podcasts as if they didn’t just recently beg to see it naked and the abuse shouted at me in the street – their go-to reaction is to deny it. “Oh, you’re not fat” or “You have a pretty face” or “Just ignore them”. Thus sweeping the uncomfortableness and the ugliness out of sight.“The analogy that I use,” says Scottee, is “the world navigates around our bodies as if they’re twice the size … We then, because of that, have this weird body dysmorphia which tells us our body is three times the size they are because of how the public interacts with them. Travelling here, I’m on a commuter train coming from the suburbs into central London. There are no seats, absolutely no seats, people are standing, people are cramming on. But the seat next to me is free. Because people think they are going to catch diabetes or like, high-cholesterol or perhaps an interesting personality. You know what I mean? It’s so interesting. Constantly, the world is signalling to you, the whole time, that you’re too fat. We don’t want you to be seen.”I nod so hard that my head is about to come off my shoulders and all of my chins are wobbling cheerfully. Yes, yes, yes. It’s not that I’m excited about Scottee’s dreadful travel experiences, it’s that I’m hearing someone tell me about my own experience. Something I rarely get to hear. With our thin friends, we rarely get to discuss the things that hurt. Because it’s uncomfortable and swept under a rug.In 2013, when I had just discovered fat acceptance but while I was still doubting that it was something I was allowed to feel, I got an email inviting me to Hamburger Queen. A beauty, talent and culinary pageant and competition just for fat people. I was invited to be a judge. When I turned up, I saw a room full of fellow fatties. I saw fatties dress in all the wrong ways – sequins, colours, crop tops, short skirts and horizontal stripes. I saw fat people eat cake in public, I saw fat people dance and sing, I saw fat people laugh and smile. The whole evening felt like taking a deep breath for the first time in my life. Like suddenly, you’re not the only person sitting on a tall, awkward stool in a room full of normal chairs. Everyone is right up there with you.That’s the space that Scottee creates and it’s the same space I’ve wanted to create with my book. A space where we can acknowledge our fatness and celebrate our fatness. Where it’s not a bad word or something that makes people tense up. Because the fact of the matter is: Fat is a descriptive word. It’s neutral. And treating it as a synonym for “lazy”, “unattractive”, “unintelligent”, “desexual” or “bad” is both incorrect and tiring. It means that we need books and shows where fat isn’t a negative – fat is something you flaunt, celebrate, glorify (yes) and most importantly: acknowledge."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb058b4c84b60a1947ab2b4e1f4b9e57f7a8fa59/0_232_5274_3164/master/5274.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=947395587c347ddc8592c14028d2ed40","title":"share your experiences of lost footpaths","story":"More than 10,000 miles of footpath are estimated to have been lost from maps.

The first port of call is the Ramblers, whose website gives clear advice on how to identify a lost path and make an application. The method involves comparing new and old maps, plus examination of historical sources. Walking and exploration is involved, but don’t forget that a lost path has to be proven before you can use it, otherwise you are trespassing.2. It is also important to be sure you are not replicating work already underway. This government website can give you information on current applications.3. You may also know of paths that are used regularly, but are not on the definitive map (you can ask your local council to see that map). Any footpath walked by the public for 20 years without any attempt by the landowner to prevent access can be made a right of way.

But are these dark fantasies of creeping authoritarianism becoming reality?In October last year, Piotr Szczęsny, a 54-year-old chemist and father of two, doused himself in petrol in front of the communist-era Palace of Culture and Science in central Warsaw then set himself on fire. The act was a protest against creeping authoritarianism under Poland’s populist right-wing government. Szczęsny died in hospital 10 days later.“I love freedom first and that is why I decided to immolate myself, and I hope that my death will shake the consciences of many people,” he had written in a cogently argued manifesto that doubled as a public suicide note. In Poland, sympathisers hail him as a successor to Ryszard Siwiec – another Polish family man in his 50s, who set himself on fire in Warsaw’s national stadium in 1968 as a protest against the crushing of the Prague spring – and Jan Palach, the Czech student who self-immolated the following year. Yet Szczęsny’s act went almost completely unreported in the western press, with editors nervous about being seen to ascribe a political motive to his actions, an anxiety exacerbated by his history of depression.As he lay dying in hospital, audiences at the Royal Exchange theatre in Manchester sat down to watch Parliament Square, an acclaimed play by James Fritz in which a female protagonist, overwhelmed by an unspecified dark turn in Britain’s politics, sets herself on fire in front of the Houses of Parliament. The play’s run in Manchester began the day before Szczęsny’s act of protest, and ended the day before his death. What does it say that we should have paid more attention to a fictional character’s radical act of protest than we did to an identical action by a real human being that resulted in his death? And does the coincidence of the two events suggest that dystopian fantasies are becoming increasingly difficult to separate from real life?Such questions weigh heavily on Agnieszka Holland, the celebrated Polish film-maker who turned 70 last week. In 2013, Holland made Burning Bush, an HBO mini-series that begins with Palach’s self-immolation and explores the dilemmas of conformism and resistance that confronted those he left behind. Her new Netflix series, 1983, which is set in a dystopian recent Polish past in which communism never fell and authoritarianism never went away, has a similarly eerie theme.“The world of fiction is entering our reality – so many things are starting to come true that I’m starting to be afraid of the projects I am taking on,” she says, sitting in her modest top-floor apartment in the southern Warsaw suburb of Mokotów. “It shows that people focused on creative expression have some kind of premonitory feelings about the dangers ahead of them.”1983 comes billed as “the first Polish Netflix original series” and is a conspiracy thriller set in the year 2003. In this alternative Polish reality, a wave of bombings in the year of the title has consolidated the grip of the communist regime even as the iron curtain fell around it – so the country enters the 21st century in authoritarian isolation.While Polish audiences will draw obvious parallels with the country’s ruling Law and Justice party (PiS), under which the force of law and the will of “the party” are again starting to converge, Holland is keen to stress that the series also raises themes that are highly relevant across the west.“The Poland in the series is isolated – much more isolated than in the communist era. Outside influences are very rare, so the country develops its own version of modernity. Prosperity is limited, but people don’t know how it is outside so they feel safe and happy. They are manipulated by this propaganda, but they feel it is good for them.“Of course, this is very close to what PiS would love to have in Poland. But the real questions are: maybe these people are happy? Maybe freedom is overrated? These questions are important for all of us. Maybe people who are feeling lost want someone to come along and tell them what to do. Maybe we are facing so many challenges and problems and threats of modernity that we cannot bear it. This is an issue in the UK and US and other countries, not just in ‘post-communist’ countries like Poland.”While many liberals in western Europe and north America still struggle to make sense of what Holland describes as the “conservative counter-revolution”, for their Polish counterparts, especially those of Holland’s generation, the threat of authoritarianism is only too familiar. And in Poland there is a particular puzzle: why do so few young Poles seem to be joining their older compatriots on the streets in pro-democracy protests?“Throughout Polish history, the young people wanted to fight, and they had to be held back by the older people,” says Holland. “But in our situation now, the problem is that young people do not want to fight, they are not interested in the kind of fights that were traditional Polish fights – romantic opposition to an oppressive reality. Instead, they seem indifferent, and this is what irritates the older generation so much, they have the impression that they are not how Polish youth used to be.”Unlike many others of her generation, however, Holland does not consider younger Poles as constituting some kind of ungrateful generation, unappreciative of the rights previous generations fought for. Instead, she sees them as victims of a wider technological revolution that has made them, in the words of the French essayist Raphaël Glucksmann, les enfants du vide, or “children of emptiness”.“The fact that the new generation has no experience of ‘slavery’ has an impact, but I think a bigger change is the internet revolution and the existential problems it has created in terms of emptiness and loneliness. The older generation doesn’t understand those problems, they see it as some kind of spoiled caprice.”As a three-time Academy award nominee who ides her time between Poland, France and the United States, Holland is often rubbished by supporters of Law and Justice as an out-of-touch member of the global cultural elite with little sense of the challenges faced by contemporary Polish youth. But as someone who emigrated to France in 1981 and experienced the prejudices of westerners towards what they regarded as “lesser Europe”, she identifies with the feelings of inferiority engendered in many young central and eastern Europeans who moved to western Europe for work after the EU’s eastward expansion in 2004.“I knew it because I had my own experience of emigration in France. I was in the elite, I was successful, but I still knew exactly how I felt like a poor cousin in this family, and that the even poorer cousins, the children of Polish workers and peasants, would feel even worse. And it happened.”Holland is less pessimistic about Poland’s future than she was a year ago – although Law and Justice emerged as the largest party in local elections held in October, it fared less well than expected, breaking its “psychological hold” over the country. But she is less sanguine about a whole host of other global issues.“This is not just about Poland. It is also about Trump, Syria and Yemen it is also about neo-fascist movements in Germany and in Sweden it is about the threat of an ecological catastrophe. All these problems are so huge that they need some kind of radical solution, but the world is not ready to choose radical solutions.”Talk of the need for radical action brings the conversation back round to Szczęsny, Siwiec and Palach. Holland is keen to draw a distinction between endorsing such drastic acts and praising the courage of those who choose to make the ultimate sacrifice in an attempt to awaken their compatriots to the threats that may or may not be closing in on them. “Fire destroys,” she said at the time of Szczęsny’s death, “but it also illuminates. Like anger.”But she has a sobering message for those who assume that people will choose freedom when the moment of truth actually comes.“Palach’s message was that if you want freedom, you have to be ready to die for it. And he offered to the people the sacrifice of a terrible death. And the people said, actually, if freedom means we have to die for it, let’s choose slavery. They see this burning man, and they see that for freedom people have to die, and they say no, a life that is not free is better than not living at all.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcf1f4214518ac3e5197b4aa6477a3673bc40ccb/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85ec809cb518f897221431bad32ae768","title":"memory lanes the ramblers trying to save 10000 lost footpaths","story":"It’s not just walkers who get lost – paths can get lost, too.

What we have here is a missing mile to a forgotten right of way – and a very useful missing mile, because it links to other footpaths.”News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theEngland and Wales have about 140,000 miles of footpaths, but there are an estimated 10,000 more that have been lost from current maps. Even that figure looks like a huge underestimate: a recent survey in Cornwall alone identified 3,000 possible paths that had fallen out of use and needed to be checked. That work of rediscovery is being done by volunteers, people such as Howland, who has so far made 85 legal applications for the recovery of lost paths in a small corner of Hampshire. A government deadline of 2026 for such claims has given Howland’s work a renewed sense of urgency.“It sounds like plenty of time, but I reckon that in our area we’d need to make two applications every week until 2026. There is just so much to be done.”As a walker, I reflect, I’m used to losing my way. It’s a bit alarming, however, to find that paths can get lost, too.Howland chuckles. “It’s easier than you think.”If you have already found a lost footpath, how did you find and identify it? If you put in an application for a path to be recovered we’d also like to hear about it.You can get in touch by filling in this encrypted form.Your responses will only be seen by the  and we’ll be in touch if we are considering your response as part of our reporting.

Two deer watch us warily from a stubble field and the giant white dish of a radio telescope appears to hover on the horizon as we catch up with a group from the Ramblers, among them Jack Cornish, project manager for the nationwide campaign Don’t Lose Your Way. He explains how government legislation in 1949 ruled that every council should draw a definitive map of footpaths and bridleways, a laudable aim, but one carried out piecemeal.“Some parishes recorded hundreds of paths, others did almost nothing. You ended up with footpaths that led nowhere or simply disappeared.” Once those paths failed to appear on OS maps, people stopped walking them. The nettles grew, the ash and sycamore seeds blew in and, within a few years, they were invisible. If a housing estate or a major road then appeared, that path was truly lost. And it did not only happen in the countryside. The Open Spaces Society has pointed out that urban areas were often exempt from the 1949 regulations and produced no definitive maps, leaving footpaths in cities and towns particularly under threat.Howland has a rough estimate of losses from his own experience. “In my area I expect an annual loss of half a percent – mostly from new buildings and roads.”“Those missing paths can be the vital element in a good circular walk, or access to great countryside.”“These are ancient rights of way,” Cornish adds. “Rights built up over centuries. And it’s not just about walkers: cyclists and horse riders need them, too.”We reach a sign – “Private road, access only” – and ignore it. “It’s a public bridleway,” says Howland, reassuringly. One of the ramblers finds a sign lost in the undergrowth and, producing a pair of secateurs, quickly makes it visible again.Walking with Howland is to see the British landscape through a fresh pair of eyes. Where I see walls of thorny bushes, he sees a double hedge hiding an ancient drovers’ path where I see neat white posts at the entrance to someone’s drive, Howland sees a devious attempt to gull the public into believing they are on private land most of all, where I see cul-de-sacs and dead ends, he spots opportunities to discover lost routes. He reads the landscape like a detective, building the physical elements into narratives of growth and change.He shows me a patch of land on his OS map called Bransbury Common that was declared open-access land under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. Almost surrounded by a chalk stream, it was both biologically important and a local beauty spot. For as long as it has been an open-access area, the two bridges that once allowed entry have been unusable. They have never been replaced. “The public have the right to be on Bransbury Common,” says Howland. “But getting there is harder.”He has seen abandoned railways, used as footpaths and recorded as such on OS maps, summarily closed when new owners arrive. In other places, agricultural schemes such as the Countryside Stewardship demand that landowners open up paths in return for payments. When the schemes finish, these “permissive” paths can disappear overnight. On other occasions, new owners simply don’t understand local traditions. In October 2016, for example, villagers in Bratton, in Wiltshire, were astonished to find a traditional riverside path through watercress beds blocked by barbed wire and “private property” signs. A London property dealer had bought the local mill and erected the barriers. It took a two-year court battle to establish that the path was a legal right of way.“There are two ways to recover a lost path,” Cornish says. “By proving regular public use over a 20-year period without any attempt to prevent access by a landowner, and by detective work on historical maps.” What about the Markway, I ask. How did that disappear?“Almost by accident.” Howland says. “In the second world war, a Hurricane fighter base was built here and the path temporarily blocked. That order was not rescinded until 1956. By then it was too late: the last mile of the route had got overgrown and forgotten.” If not for Howland, this right of way would have permanently disappeared.We stop talking to stroll along a short section of busy road, before turning once again on to a path where spindle flowers gleam like nubs of coral in the hedge. A kestrel cuts away across the field, glorying in its freedom. We come eventually into the pretty thatched village of Chilbolton and, in the way of all good country walks, reach a pub.Over a bowl of hot soup, Howland shows me the paperwork that each Definitive Map Modification Order entails. “It does take hours of work, but a lot of the information and maps are now online. The National Library of Scotland website is particularly useful. You don’t need to be spending days in the National Archives at Kew, interesting as that would be.”The campaign has put pressure on under-resourced local councils. Hampshire’s executive member for rural affairs, Edward Heron, pointed out to me that Hampshire has seen a rise in applications from five a year to 35. “We expect that these increases will continue until the closure date of 2026.”The good news is that any application submitted by the 2026 deadline will, eventually, go through the legal process of assessment and consultation.Meanwhile Howland is planning more routes. His diffident manner masks a steely determination, and he clearly likes the elements of research and historical analysis. “It’s given me a better understanding of how the landscape changes and develops.” In theory, that research could go back to the era of Richard I. His reign, which began on 4 July 1189, is the beginning of legal time. In practice, many rights of way date back to the enclosure acts of 1750 to 1850. Either way the sense of a long game being played is palpable and Howland knows it.“A restored right of way will usually last for ever.” He smiles. “There aren’t many tasks in life that you can say that about.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

The Netherlands is one of only five governments to have established restitution bodies.The claim by Lewenstein’s heirs to a 1909 work by Kandinsky known as Painting with Houses was first made in December 2013 and it has taken five years of research and legal argument to settle.The descendants argued that the expressionist work was sold to Amsterdam’s Stedelijk Museum under duress at auction in 1940, five months after Germany invaded the country.The unnamed heirs said the watercolour was purchased for a “modest sum” and the sale was not made in good faith.The committee, which was established by the Dutch government in 2002, and comprising lawyers and art historians, confirmed the sale was made between 8 and 9 October 1940 at the Frederik Muller auction house in Amsterdam, and said the transaction should be seen in the context of the times and that the Lewenstein family would have had a clear understanding of their probable fate under the Nazi regime. However, the committee ruled that there was evidence to suggest the family had long been in financial difficulties. It said Lewenstein’s immediate family had a good relationship with the museum after the war and did not try to retrieve the painting.The municipality of Amsterdam argued in its rebuttal to the family’s claim that the piece was important to the museum as it was “on permanent display and … the essential link in the limited overview of Kandinsky’s work in the museum’s collection”.A spokesman for the Stedelijk said: “We can only stress that the museum would have accepted any outcome, as the ruling of the committee is binding for both parties, and that we realise that this painting will forever remain connected to a painful history.”The ability of the restitution committee to take into account the state of the stock of public art was introduced in 2013.Its chairman, Fred Hammerstein, denied that the move was unjust, telling the Dutch newspaper De Trouw: “This statement, which has been looked at for a long time and carefully, is not a step backwards but in line with earlier recommendations. That is why the criticism is no reason for us to move away from this weighing of interests. We are not out of step internationally.”The Dutch restitution committee is already at the centre of a lawsuit filed by an American heir to a former Jewish art gallery partnership. Bruce Berg, a grandson of the late Benjamin Katz and a great-nephew of the late Nathan Katz, brothers and partners in the Firma D Katz partnership, alleges that 143 paintings are in the wrongful possession of the Dutch government and a number of private and public museums in the Netherlands.The case being heard in the US district court of South Carolina involves works by Dutch old masters such as Ferdinand Bol, Pieter Claesz, Jan Steen and the Rembrandt school. It is claimed that the paintings were sold or traded under duress to representatives of the Nazi regime between mid-1940 and 1942.Joel Androphy, a lawyer acting for Berg and Katz, said it was taking the legal action as previous claims made to the restitution committee had been “largely denied”.He said: “The paintings were destined for Adolf Hitler’s future Führermuseum in Linz, Austria, or for the massive art collection of Reichsmarshall Hermann Göring. Göring himself even paid a terrifying visit to Firma D Katz, accompanied by armed guards, to inspect and select the paintings.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36d1eb6abd50823cba5baab7cc1f73fb52de99e5/0_18_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=812615b998b140fcf985e4834b4921f8","title":"rohingya end of monsoon prompts fresh wave of boats fleeing myanmar","story":"Recent flurry of departures is close to reaching 2015 levels, as members of Muslim minority seek to escape displacement campsA new exodus of boats carrying Rohingya fleeing from Myanmar has begun, with at least six boats carrying hundreds of refugees intercepted at sea or washing ashore over the past month.The recent flurry of voyages making the treacherous crossing of the Andaman sea to seek refuge in Thailand and Malaysia is close to reaching levels last seen in 2015, which prompted the Thai authorities to crack down on human smuggling networks.Voyages tend to stop completely during monsoon season, which begins in June and creates dangerous conditions, but the end of the rains in October often leads to a fresh wave of boats taking to the calmer seas. Since August 2017, over 200 lives are estimated to have been lost in the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea, mainly in the crossing from Myanmar to Bangladesh.On Tuesday morning, 20 men believed to be Rohingya arrived on the shores of the Indonesian island of Aceh in a small rickety boat, seeking refuge.The arrival comes after the Myanmar navy picked up 38 Rohingya, 19 men, 11 women, and eight children last week in the Andaman sea, who were heading for Malaysia. After their boat was apprehended, they were detained by the Myanmar police and sent back to Rahkine state, where tens of thousands of Rohingya are forced to live in displacement camps.It is not known yet whether the men who arrived in Aceh this week had fled Rahkine or Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh, where almost one million Rohingya refugees are living after fleeing a brutal campaign of violence by the military and Buddhist locals, which the UN has described as ethnic cleansing.“We can’t communicate with them because they don’t speak Indonesian, Acehnese, or English. So we don’t know much about them,” said Iswandi, the head of Idi Rayeuk district in Aceh where the Rohingyas’ boat washed ashore.The surge in those attempting to escape by boat is an indicator that the situation in Rahkine, where the UN says Rohingya are subject to “apartheid-like conditions”, remains desperate for the Muslim minority.Displacement camps in Rahkine are home to tens of thousands of Rohingya, who live in dire living conditions with limited access to food and no freedom of movement.On 18 November, 93 Rohingya left their villages near Rahkine’s Sittwe township and Darpaing displacement camp and boarded a small boat to Malaysia, but were found by the Myanmar navy a week later. Days earlier, two boats carrying Rohingya living in Darpaing displacement camp were discovered, both attempting to make it to Malaysia.Caroline Gluck, UNHCR spokesperson, said that while previously, most boats from Myanmar had been headed for Bangladesh, “there are now indications of boat movements resuming with different destinations”.“There are differences between the pattern of these movements compared with 2015,” said Gluck, emphasising that a regional approach was needed to deal with refugees taking to the sea. “The boats are smaller and hold fewer passengers. The disembarkation points have changed. And more robust efforts are being made by the authorities both in Bangladesh and Myanmar to prevent the boats from setting out to sea in the first place.”The renewed exodus from Rahkine throws the possibility of repatriating the 700,000 refugees living in Bangladesh further into turmoil. The tension between the Buddhist communities in Rakhine and the Rohingya has not eased and last week a group of Buddhist Rahkine held a protest against the possible return of the Rohingya and any move to give them citizenship.AFP contributed to this report"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"There is \u0026lsquoincreased vulnerability\u0026rsquo in the housing sector, says agency chairwomanReasons include overspending and non-achievement of \u0026euro150 million savingsC of I archbishop\u0026rsquos move comes after Edgar Swann warned Greystones, Co Wicklow, community being \u0026lsquotorn apart\u0026rsquo by controversyEPA in possession of no electric vehicles despite being on the \u0026lsquofront line\u0026rsquo of policingChanging wording on woman\u0026rsquos place \u0026lsquowithin the home\u0026rsquo subject of Oireachtas reportLegal system \u0026lsquocannot keep incarcerating people when there are no places\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash Clare DalyMost offences related to suspect money laundering uncovered by regulatory bodyDetective sergeant to face Gsoc inquiry for shooting man in leg during confrontationWorkers use footpaths and one-way streets recklessly, claims Cllr Mannix FlynnTenants in Tallaght scheme told they must leave at end of 18-month tenancyCourt of Justice of European Union rules on referral from Supreme Court in equality caseOral health policy fails to offer postgraduate and lifelong learning for dental practitionersDoctors would have had to record pregnant woman\u0026rsquos age, ethnicity and marital statusFormer minister resigned earlier this year amid controversy over meetings with bidderWitness took photo of man\u0026rsquos car and reported allegation to garda\u0026iacute but child\u0026rsquos father said he \u0026lsquonever resorted to violence\u0026rsquoTaoiseach posts that he has receipt to prove he paid for drinks amid social media allegations"},{"url":null,"title":"charity prints from the irish times","story":" photographers have produced a gallery of images that will make a unique Christmas gift.

His people explained that he rushed across from Government Buildings but it was too late.On Tuesday, he was missing again.In Tara Street? The ? Sure that’s within a reindeer’s belch of Merrion Street.Perhaps Leo couldn’t resist the lure of Fintan’s latest oeuvre. Although that’s been launched more times than the Dunmore East lifeboat.Actually, no. It was The Sunday Papers: a History of Ireland’s Weekly Press edited by Joe Breen and Mark O’Brien. Because Leo Varadkar adores the newspapers. That’s why he mainly communicates these days via Twitter and lifestyle orientated social media platforms.It’s how we found out the Taoiseach was at the Kylie Minogue concert on Monday night, along with every other gay man in Ireland under the age of 50. Great time had by all, according to the Twitter machine and the photographs.Then our social media elves told us some lad went on Facebook and swore he saw Leo and his entourage tucking into a free meal at the concert before going off without leaving a tip.Like he would. As a rule, he always pays his way.Gawd, but there’s so much heavy stuff going on at home and in the world at the moment you’d really need a skewed set of priorities to get upset about that random sort of thing. Wouldn’t you?Anyway, the Treeseach missed the lighting up yet again and the Oireachtas staff choir, in spectacularly good voice this year, stoically coped with his absence. (It would never have happen in Enda’s day).Maybe Leo is allergic to trees. Or staff.It was a lovely ceremony. Short, as it always is, due to the cold. Done and dusted in around 15 minutes. But it was a little seasonal treat to get everyone in the mood. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald made a valiant effort to get into the spirit by wearing a Santa hat and going on a selfie-spree. She was joined at the tree by Labour leader, Brendan Howlin along with the two women who head the Social Democrats – Catherine Murphy and Róisín Shortall.“Said the night wind to the little lamb: Do you see what I see?” sang the choir.No. No sign of Leo.The Fianna Fáil leader, Micheál Martin, raced in the nick of time to the tree, narrowly missing the switch-on but mercifully making the photo ops. “I didn’t know about it,” he protested. “I heard the carols above in my office and ran down. I’d hate to miss it.”Fine Gael couldn’t muster one senior representative to take part.Of course, the Ceann Comhairle is in charge at this yuletide event. Heaven forbid this might have a bearing on the Treeseach’s aversion to the tree ceremony.As always, Sean O’Fearghaíl conducted proceedings with brevity and eloquence.“As I think about this Christmas, I am conscious of the fact that very many people living in this country are back living the sort of frenetic lifestyle that they did during the Celtic Tiger. But I’m thinking alongside that, we have poverty and homelessness and disadvantage as we have never had before.”He said he was also conscious that people in “the Oireachtas community” know they are “at a point in the political calendar in the schedule of events where the ante is being upped” and they are under a lot of work pressure. But they also must look after themselves.“Because before we can help family and help the disadvantaged we have to be conscious of our own wellbeing. So can I just exort you all to take time for yourselves, time for your family and time for the needy.”Then the lights went on. And the choir launched into a medley of Kylie’s greatest hits.No, they didn’t. They sang a selection of traditional Christmas carols.Kylie, though, was on Leo’s mind. Or rather, the concert on Monday night in the 3Arena and the subsequent minor post on Facebook.After the book launch in the , where the canapés are supposed to have been wonderful and the wine plentiful, he found time to tweet this: “I’ve been made aware of a post on social media saying I had a free meal at a concert the other night. This is not true. There was no meal, we only had drinks and I paid. I have the receipt to prove it too.”Oh, thank God for that.Which reminds us. Barbra Streisand. Another great female artiste. Known for the Streisand Effect – where making an unnecessary fuss about something minor attracts a major outbreak of negative attention. Has the Fine Gael leader ever heard of it?Because with that tweet, he bought tickets for it.Merry Christmas, one and all!"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3720353.1543960153!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit reversal for may after house of commons defeat","story":"UK prime minister Theresa May vows to honour the Good Friday Agreement as MPs debate the proposed Brexit agreement.

And pro-European Conservatives joined the opposition to approve an amendment that will give MPs a say in what the government does if Mrs May’s deal is rejected next week.\u0026nbsp That vote could see MPs telling the government to reject a no-deal Brexit, pursue a close, Norway-style relationship with the European Union or hold a second referendum. Earlier, the advocate general of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) published a legal opinion arguing that Britain could unilaterally halt Brexit by revoking its notice to leave the EU under article 50.Opening five days of debate ahead of a “meaningful vote” on her Brexit deal, Mrs May said rejecting it could lead to no deal or no Brexit. And she told MPs that there was no way around the backstop if Britain wanted any kind of deal with the EU.“Whether you want a model like Canada’s or whether you want to see the UK as a member of the European Economic Area – any future relationship will need to be negotiated and will need an insurance policy if that negotiation cannot be completed in time.\u0026nbspPut simply, there is no possible Withdrawal Agreement without a legally operative backstop.\u0026nbspNo backstop means no deal,” she said.\u0026nbsp Dozens of Conservative MPs and the DUP’s 10 MPs have said they will vote against the prime minister’s deal, but she said it represented the best way of healing the isions Brexit has created in British society.“Don’t let anyone here think that there is a better deal to be won by shouting louder. And do not imagine that if we vote this down, a different deal is going to miraculously appear.\u0026nbspThe alternative is uncertainty and risk.\u0026nbsp“The risk Brexit could be stopped.

Photograph: AFP PhotoPRUHOGetty Before she opened a five-day debate on her Brexit deal on Tuesday night, Theresa May had suffered two humiliating defeats in the House of Commons. Her government became the first in history to be found in contempt of parliament because of its failure to publish attorney general Geoffrey Cox’s full legal advice to cabinet on the deal.The DUP joined the opposition to vote against the government, ensuring a defeat by four votes that will see ministers publish the advice within days.The prime minister’s second defeat was less dramatic but more consequential for the future of Brexit if her deal is, as expected, defeated next week. This time it was pro-European, Conservative rebels who demonstrated their strength, with 26 crossing the floor to help defeat the government by 22 votes.Dominic Grieve’s amendment will allow MPs to table amendments to any motion on EU withdrawal that would follow a defeat of May’s deal next week. MPs could vote to rule out leaving the EU without a deal, to pursue a Norway-style membership of the European Economic Area (EEA) or to call a second referendum.Such a vote would not be binding but it would be almost impossible for the government to ignore a direction of that kind backed by a majority of MPs.Earlier on Tuesday, Manuel Campos Sánchez-Bordona, advocate general to the European Court of Justice (ECJ), told the court that he believed Britain could unilaterally revoke its decision to trigger article 50. If the ECJ upholds that opinion, it will offer an important boost to campaigners for a second referendum by robbing their opponents of the argument that there is too little time to arrange a second vote.Grieve’s amendment and the news from the ECJ may have carried a dim, silver lining for the prime minister as she seeks to persuade MPs to back her deal. They strengthen her argument that rejecting her deal could lead to a reversal of Brexit if a majority of MPs rules out leaving without a deal.That majority against a no-deal Brexit revealed itself on Tuesday in a way that could help moderate Brexiteers fall into line behind the prime minister. The threat of reversing Brexit may not be potent enough to secure a majority next week but it could help to keep the defeat within the bounds that would give May’s deal and her premiership a chance of staying alive."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

lifestyles, fuelling soaring diabetes levels, new figures show.The survey of 10,000 adults found the vast majority are at risk of a premature death, because of their daily habits.Excess weight was the biggest factor identified in the Health Survey for England, with two thirds of adults found to be overweight or obese.Diabetes levels have more than doubled over the last two decades, the figures show, with a tripling in rates among pensioners.For the first time, the research examined the overall prevalence of unhealthy lifestyles.Just 13 per cent of adults were found to have no risk factors to their health.Vast majority of adults have at least one health risk factorAmong those surveyed,  17 per cent were current smokers,  21 per cent were deemed to be physically inactive, while 23 per cent drank more than recommended limits of 14 units of alcohol a week. Meanwhile, 27 per cent were found to be obese, and 72 per cent admitted consuming fewer than five portions of fruit and vegetables daily.More than half those polled had at least two risk factors, the data for England from 2016 and 2017 found.The survey asked 8,000 adults and 2,000 children about their lifestyles.The findings show a steep rise in diabetes rates between 1994 and 2017 - from 3 per cent to 8 per cent among men, and from 2 to 5 per cent among women.  The increase has been largest for those aged 65 to 74, increasing from 5 per cent in 1994 to 15 per cent in 2017.The research also compared the lifestyles of children with their parents.Children of obese parents were around three times more likely to be obese than children of healthy weight parents. In total, 28 per cent of children of an obese mother and 24 per cent of children of an obese father had such weight problems.One in 20 women in England is now classed as morbidly obese, according to the analysis by NHS Digital. Overall, 64 per cent of adults were found to be carrying excess weight.This includes five per cent of women and two per cent of men who are morbidly obese - meaning they have a body mass index (BMI) score over 40.Overweight parents are more likely to have overweight childrenIn 1993, when the survey began, just one per cent of women were morbidly obese.Susannah Brown, senior scientist at World Cancer Research Fund, said: “Unhealthy choices increase the likelihood of developing cancer, so it is worrying to see that over half of adults have two or more of these risk factors, especially as we know that around 40 per cent of cancer cases are preventable.After not smoking, eating a healthy diet, being more active each day and maintaining a healthy weight are the most important ways you can reduce your cancer risk. The responsibility to live healthily does not lie solely with iniduals – a whole-of-government, whole-of-society approach is necessary to create environments for people and communities that are conducive to healthy living, she said.Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said the figures should “shame” successive governments, accusing them of failing to take action to encourage healthier lifestyles.John Maingay, Director of Policy and Public Affairs at the British Heart Foundation, said:  “These alarming figures suggest we could be storing up a future of health problems for future generations unless we act now. Obese children are more likely to be obese adults and this, coupled with spiralling diabetes rates, could lead to thousands more people suffering heart attacks and strokes in the coming years.”Almost 4 million people in the UK have been diagnosed with diabetes, with nine in ten cases Type 2, which is linked to obesity. Dan Howarth, from Diabetes UK, warned that another 12 million people are at risk of developing the condition.“To prevent these millions from developing Type 2 diabetes, we must educate people about their risk of developing the condition, and help them minimise their risk by making the necessary lifestyle changes, which include eating better and moving more, he said. Macron mulls bringing back ultra-rich tax to halt yellow vest protestsMatthew Hedges force-fed cocktail of

And then update them again.Early next year, the company should release an update that brings a wireless charging case that allows them to power up just by being placed onto a wireless charging mat. It might also bring other changes, such as improved connectivity, an improved hinge on the door that clicks open and lets the earphones out\u0026nbspand new features, leaks suggested.That\u0027s according to a report from usually reliably analyst Ming-Chi\u0026nbspKuo, who reports that none of the new earphones will be ready for this Christmas season.Then a year later, in early 2020, the company will bring an all-new design. He did not reveal what those would look like, but previous rumours have suggested that waterproofing and always-on hey Siri could be on their way.iPhone X could come back after weak sales of new Apple phonesThe report made no mention of AirPower, the wireless charging mat that was first announced more than a year ago and has mostly disappeared in the time since. The wirelessly charging AirPods and the charging mat had been announced together, with the new case expected in part so that the AirPods\u0026nbspcould be used on the mat alongside other Apple products.Apple has not commented on a possible release date for the AirPower\u0026nbspmat. Rumours have suggested that the company might be struggling to make the technology work, and some have suggested that it might be dropped entirely.The company had even showed off what appeared to be the new AirPods\u0026nbspcase alongside its charging mat, suggesting that both would be coming soon. It\u0027s not clear if the two products\u0027 delays are related.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

With a name like Legacy, the business could be selling investment products, luxury watches or even legal services. Except the assets in question are of the flesh-and-blood variety. Legacy is a mail-order service for freezing sperm.Khaled Kteily, the young founder of Legacy, came up with the idea for his business five years ago. But it wasn’t until 2017\u0026nbspthat researchers published a statistic\u0026nbspthat made\u0026nbspmen sit up and listen. A\u0026nbspstudy found sperm counts in men from America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand had dropped by more than 50 per cent in less than 40 years. Other studies have suggested stress, smoking, obesity and exposure to pesticides and chemicals may all be at fault.\u0026nbspClimate change could lead to lower sperm count in men, study showsHe was everything I was searching for – in a sperm donorNo-deal Brexit could disrupt delivery of foreign sperm to BritainAllan Pacey, professor of Andrology\u0026nbspat the University of Sheffield, says men are becoming more preoccupied with their fertility for another reason: “In my opinion, more cases of male infertility are being seen because men and their partners are waiting until they are older before trying for a family. This flushes out cases of male infertility that would not have been seen if the couple had tried for a family at a younger age when they were more fertile.”Unlike women, men are not told that “the clock is ticking” nor are they bombarded with adverts for fertility clinics and apps from the minute they turn 30. Many men may not start thinking about their own fertility until they start trying to conceive. Yet, among infertile heterosexual couples, the man is the cause in roughly half of the cases. Pacey dislikes the idea of an “infertility industry”, but he accepts that greater awareness of male infertility has created a growing market for startups offering solutions.\u0026nbspKteily says he founded Legacy to reshape the way that men and women think about family planning. “Men are sensitive about talking about fertility, so we are focused on creating a brand for men to be proactive about fertility,” he says. Kteily grew up in Lebanon, studied in Canada and the US, and established Legacy in Geneva, in part because he wants it to be seen as “the Swiss private bank for sperm”.“For a lot of the world, Switzerland has an association with quality. Think of Swiss banks, Swiss watches and even chocolate,” he says. “We have a strong emphasis on quality, privacy and security.”Kteily had never thought much about his own fertility, until a friend told him that\u0026nbsphe had to freeze his sperm after being told he had\u0026nbspcancer at the age of 30. After this conversation, Kteily went into a clinic to freeze his own\u0026nbspsperm but found the whole process awkward. He believes other men will also be sufficiently put-off by the prospect of attending a clinic to deposit their sperm over doing it at home and sending it to a lab.Legacy offers three packages to clients, starting with the bronze package for $1000, which includes fertility analysis and storage deposit of sperm for one year. A third-tier platinum package “is designed for the man who wants to preserve his healthiest genetic legacy in light of ongoing advances in healthcare”. It costs $10,000 for up to six deposits, genetic testing, fertility analysis and indefinite storage at multiple sites.\u0026nbspCoolmen is a device that cools and maintains the temperature in the testicles to improve fertility in men (Courtesy Photo)The website also contains a note about a research programme that plans “to study the sperm of the world’s most successful men”, which\u0026nbspinvolves strict eligibility criteria and a charitable contribution. When asked for more details, Kteily says the idea to study the genetic makeup of some sperm is still in its early stages. But he agrees that Legacy was modelled in part on another genetic testing service, 23andme. This mail-order DNA testing service was valued at $1.1bn in October 2015, nine years after it was founded. Kteily makes one clear distinction between Legacy and 23andme, which has come under fire for profiting off the sale of customer data Legacy would never sell customer data, Kteily says. It assigns a unique ID to each client to anonymise the process,\u0026nbsp“just like a Swiss private bank”.The UK’s Human, Fertilisation and Embryology Authority lists hundreds of private clinics in the UK charging on average between £175 and £450 to freeze sperm per year. But Pacey says some men may prefer to do a test at home if it means they don’t have to go to a clinic.He adds that the many attempts to develop male fertility products, from underwear, to mobile phone cases, to sperm-testing kits have often failed, perhaps because of male shame. “I have never sensed that they have taken off,” he says. “I wonder if this is because men are too embarrassed to buy them, or whether or not they are simply not interested in this topic until fertility becomes an issue in their lives.”The hidden trauma of male infertilityOne new device is hoping it will fare better than the competition. Coolmen was founded in 2016 in Poland. It promises to improve male fertility by cooling the testicles using a device held in place by a waist belt. “According to the current studies, approximately 60 per cent of all male infertility is caused by too high temperature of testicles, which is the direct reason for inappropriate sperm quality,” Dorota Partyka, programme manager for Coolmen, says. “When we consider this condition, freezing sperm which is not good quality simply doesn’t make sense.”The two businesses will meet at Disrupt Berlin, a startup conference hosted by TechCrunch, where they will be the only two male fertility\u0026nbspstartups in attendance despite a\u0026nbspmarket that some analysts expect to reach $4.7bn by 2025.“The main issue with any kind of product or service like this aimed at male fertility will be whether or not it speaks to men,” Pacey says. But, with sperm counts falling by an average of 1.4 per cent per year, startups like these may find an increasing number of men willing to have the conversation.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Perhaps most intriguingly of them all is a big container that includes seeds and insect eggs and hence create living things that will have been born on the Moon.Nasa video says it is going back to the Moon –\u0026nbspand staying thereThe country’s space agency will blast off in just a few days, after\u0026nbspa series of successful tests. It sets off Saturday, 8 December, and is expected to drop onto the Moon early next year.It will head up towards the Moon, fly around it and then drop down, into a specially selected region of the Moon that will become its home.Once there, it will look to learn a whole host of things about that nearby but still largely mysterious world. It will measure the surface temperature, examine the chemicals that make up its soil, as well as looking up at the Sun.But the mission is possible because it relies not only on the lander that will touch down on the Moon. It is also made up of a set of other hardware – chief among them the\u0026nbspQueqiao satellite, which will serve as a bridge and relay information between the lander on the far side of the Moon and its engineers down on Earth.Just as with the world it will explore, much of the mission remains murky and unknown. The Chinese space agency has stayed largely quiet about details of what will happen, including where exactly on the Moon it will arrive.Its mission comes amid a new focus on the Moon – particularly as an important stepping stone on the way to other missions, deeper into the solar system. Nasa, for instance, has spoken about how keen it is to send humans back there, with the aim of eventually using it as a base for journeys to Mars.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But it adds: “We also know that in other settings this good practice is stifled by undue concerns about the risk and safety of such activities.”The report warns that without “some level of risk”, children’s natural inquisitiveness and their opportunities to learn and develop are\u0026nbspcurtailed.Amanda Spielman, chief inspector of Ofsted, suggested fears about health and safety rules were widespread among early years settings.She said: “There’s a great deal of concern about children hurting themselves, concern about children having the lumps and bumps that we know are part of childhood.”The report calls on childcare settings to take a “common sense approach” to managing risk.Ms Spielman added: “It is very important that children can develop physically, explore, do all those things that children need to do to test their physical boundaries.”Schools cannot be ‘panacea’ for rising knife crime, Ofsted boss warnsHundreds of underperforming ‘stuck’ schools are a scandal, says Ofsted\u0027Parents too busy to teach children how to use toilet before school\u0027Gill Jones, also\u0026nbspof Ofsted, said parents have contributed to this culture of fear. She said: “Some private providers have to work very hard with parents because parents want their children to be really safe when they leave their baby and their toddler in a setting.“Parents’ first concern is going to be their safety, but the provider has to ensure that children take risks. So a child climbing on a climbing frame has to be well supervised.“And there has to be the right element of risk there. But some more nervous providers will not take that risk because they are frightened of the ramifications.“They might not take children out on visits because of road safety. It is a fear thing.”She added: “A child that hasn’t had upper body strength built, who hasn’t done the monkey bars, will not have the physical strength to write. It is linked, so that is really important.”Speaking about day trips, Ms Jones said: “It is about the world around them and developing a language, an understanding, so being able to kick through the leaves and splash in puddles is really important. If children don’t get those experiences, they are not going to get the language that they need.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Theresa May has suffered an unprecedented defeat after the government was found to be in contempt of parliament for refusing to publish key Brexit papers.The Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign and People\u0027s Vote delivering to 10 Downing Street their respective petitions calling for a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal.

success after 10 attempts led to some experts doubting whether procedure would be possibleClick to followThe IndependentBaby girl, who is not being identified, was born after \u0027uncomplicated\u0027 pregnancy following world first transplantA woman born without a uterus\u0026nbsphas become the first person to give birth to a live baby thanks to a womb transplanted from a deceased donor.The baby girl\u0027s birth – weighing 6lbs – marks another milestone in fertility treatment after experts had begun to doubt if\u0026nbspusing a dead donor\u0026nbspwould be possible in the wake of 10 unsuccessful\u0026nbspattempts.While there have been 11 births using a live uterus donor, with the first in 2013, this has usually only been an option where the recipient has a close friend or family member who is willing to donate.Using a deceased donor relies on keeping the organ viable after the death of the donor and the team working with the\u0026nbsp32-year old Brazilian mother transplanted the uterus after it had been without an oxygen supply for eight hours.The success\u0026nbspcould greatly expand the number of women with uterine infertility who have previously only had the option of adoption or surrogacy to become mothers.\u0026nbspDoctors prepare for UK’s first ever womb transplants this yearWomb transplants make unisex pregnancy possible, expert saysRecipient of world’s first womb transplant is likely pregnant, saysDr Dani Ejzenberg, from Hospital das Clínicas at the University of São Paulo, who led the research said their study, published in the Lancet, provides “proof of concept” that many more women could benefit.“The first uterus transplants from live donors were a medical milestone, creating the possibility of childbirth for many infertile women with access to suitable donors and the needed medical facilities.“However, the need for a live donor is a major limitation as donors are rare, typically being willing and eligible family members or close friends.“The numbers of people willing and committed to donate organs upon their own deaths are far larger than those of live donors, offering a much wider potential donor population.”Being able to use deceased donors would decrease the costs and remove the risks of a live transplant, particularly in countries with already developed organ donation systems.The first womb transplants in the UK are due to occur in early 2019 and independent experts welcomed the fact there was now proof of success in both live and deceased donor transplants.With so many kids in care, the NHS shouldn’t offer womb transplantsInfertility affects as many as 15 per cent of couples of reproductive age, and around one in 500 women will have uterine infertility, which can be due to birth defects, injury, or conditions like infection or cancer.In this case the mother, who is not being identified, was born with Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome, a condition where parts of the reproductive system, like the womb, don’t develop though women have functioning ovaries and go through puberty normally.Surgery took place in September 2016 after the donor died of a brain haemorrhage at the age of 45, with the operation taking\u0026nbsp10-and-a-half hours to connect the donor uterus to the recipient’s blood vessels,\u0026nbspmuscles and birth canal.After the transplant the women began having regular periods, and after seven months the lining of the uterus was thick enough to transplant fertilised eggs which had been frozen after IVF before the surgery.Her pregnancy\u0026nbspwas described as “uncomplicated” with antibiotics needed to treat a kidney infection, which would pose a greater risk because of the immune system suppressing drugs needed to prevent a transplant rejection.The baby was born at 35 weeks and three days by caesarean section and the womb was removed, with no obvious anomalies, allowing the mother to come off the immunosuppressant drugs.Created with Sketch.World news

Apple has often held out on such upgrades initially, waiting until they are improved and perfected.iPhone X could come back after weak sales of new Apple phonesLike 3G and 4G before it, 5G is expected to offer a vast increase in speed and reliability. But it is also talked about in much more enthusiastic terms: it will be faster even than internet connections delivered over WiFi, and might improve connectivity in such a way as to fundamentally change the ways that phones work.Such upgrades have previously come with weak coverage and poor performance, putting customers off the new technology. 5G\u0027s proponents argue that the speed increase that arrives with the new technology will be worth such teething problems.Those backing 5G claim that it will fundamentally change how networks and communications are organised. Networks will be so much faster than WiFi that they could make the wireless technology useless, for instance, and data transfer will be so fast that it will allow people to have internet\u0026nbspconnections to places across the world.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Soviet cosmonauts Vladimir Titov and Gennady Strekalov jettisoned and landed safely near the launch pad.We are psychologically and technically prepared for blast-off and any situation which, God forbid, may occur on board, said crew commander Kononenko in a news conference.Additional reporting by Press AssociationShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

This was both predictable and forewarned.“The department is taking steps to put things right for the Caribbean community but it has shown a surprising lack of urgency to identify other groups that may have been affected.”Ministers faced a furious backlash over the treatment of the Windrush generation – named after a ship that brought migrants to Britain from the Caribbean in 1948.Windrush rowCommonwealth citizens who arrived before 1973 were automatically granted indefinite leave to remain but many were not issued with any documents confirming their status.A public outcry erupted earlier this year after it emerged long-term UK residents were denied access to services, held in detention or removed despite living legally in the country for decades.The scandal prompted criticism of “hostile environment” measures introduced to tackle illegal immigration, now referred to by the government under the heading “compliant environment”.The NAO said the Home Office “did not act on credible information about issues that may have contributed to the Windrush situation”.It cited a 2014 report by the Legal Action Group, which flagged up the potential adverse impact of immigration policy on certain groups, including Jamaicans who arrived pre-1973.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Theresa May has suffered an unprecedented defeat after the government was found to be in contempt of parliament for refusing to publish key Brexit papers.The Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign and People\u0027s Vote delivering to 10 Downing Street their respective petitions calling for a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal.

The BBC could - as ITV and Sky have proposed to do - fairly represent other viewpoints and parties in other programmes on its network.The public has a right to a genuine head-to-head debate on the Prime Minister\u0027s worst-of-all-worlds deal.If the Prime Minister turns down the opportunity of a genuine head-to-head debate, it will be clear she is once again dodging a TV debate with the leader of the opposition on the future of our country.A Downing Street spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“The prime minister issued the original challenge to Jeremy Corbyn for a head to head debate, and despite her flexibility on timing and format, Jeremy Corbyn and Labour have done nothing but raise false and flimsy objections to the BBC’s proposal.“There was a sensible and balanced proposal on the table but Jeremy Corbyn refused to take part. He is running scared of proper scrutiny, but we remain committed to holding a debate and will continue to press for a format that ensures a range of voices are heard alongside a substantial head to head.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

He predicted the government would lost the vote in six days\u0027 time by more than 80 votes.\u0026nbspWriting in the Daily , Mr\u0026nbspHarper\u0026nbspsaid: The Cabinet\u0027s proposals are not acceptable because they threaten the integrity of our country, keep us trapped indefinitely in a customs union and leave us in a weak negotiating position for our future relationship.Mr\u0026nbspHarper\u0026nbspsharply criticised plans for an Irish border \u0027backstop\u0027 arrangement.He said: The prime minister said that the EU\u0027s proposal would undermine the UK common\u0026nbspmarket and threaten the constitutional integrity of the UK by creating a customs and regulatory border down the Irish Sea, and no UK prime minister could ever agree to it.However, regrettably, the withdrawal agreement that is currently in front of us does exactly this.I\u0027m just very disappointed that as a loyal MP I\u0027ve found myself in this situation, that in order to keep to the promises we made just last year in the general election, I\u0027ve been forced to vote against the cabinet\u0027s proposals.Keeping promises in politics is important and I think many colleagues also feel they have been misled.After suffering the worst defeats in one day for a government in four decades, Andrea Leadsom tells LBC: I don\u0027t think they were embarrassing at all.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspShe adds: I think colleagues may live to regret their vote last night if they are ever in Government.\u0026nbspA number will understand the Government has to have access to frank, legal advice and now that has been put into doubt.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspShami Chakrabarti - the shadow attorney general - has said that extending Article can\u0027t be ruled out.She was asked about Labour\u0027s stance on the issue after the ECJ\u0027s advocate general Manuel Campos Sanchez-Bordona said the UK could withdraw its notification to leave the EU before its exit in March 2019 without needing the approval of the other 27 states.Ms Chakrabarti told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: It can\u0027t be ruled out because the clock is ticking...I think there would be time if Ms May heard what happened in the House of Commons last night and decided to think again and go back to her European colleagues right now and not wait until next week.\u0026nbspCommons Leader Andrea Leadsom has told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme the legal advice provided to cabinet will be published at around 11.30am today.Referring to parliament\u0027s decision to find the government in contempt, she said:It was incredibly disappointing that the House of Commons decided to vote in effect to overturn what has been decades, if not centuries, of conventions whereby the law officer\u0027s advice to Cabinet and to ministers are not even acknowledged, let alone published.The Attorney General had come to the House for two-and-a-half hours, which is also unprecedented in these many years, to answer questions to give his very best legal advice.He published a 48-page document that outlined all of the legal impact of the Withdrawal Agreement, so the vote yesterday of the House to require the specific legal advice to Cabinet we will comply with, but not without some regret.\u0026nbspPlease allow a moment for the liveblog\u0026nbspto loadThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet -

Acts are law, motions are motions. The executive still decides how to proceed.”But a motion passed after the defeat of Ms May’s plan, with the backing of the majority of the Commons for a particular course of action, would carry considerable political weight and be very difficult for the government to ignore.A report released by the People’s Vote campaign on Tuesday also set out other ways in which MPs could seek to steer government action, by amending other legislation still required for Brexit, for example.On Tuesday morning the European Court of Justice’s advocate general\u0026nbspformally advised that Britain could\u0026nbspstill cancel Brexit by revoking Article 50.The legal recommendation cited Britain’s “sovereignty” in treaty-making matters and said withdrawal “may be revoked at any time” during the negotiating period.Chris Bryant MP, champion of the People’s Vote campaign,\u0026nbspsaid: “The terms of the Brexit debate have today fundamentally shifted.“The government has long argued that the choice is between their deal and no deal. But the statement this morning from the EU advocate general shows the option of staying in the EU is still open to us.”Keir Starmer says bringing contempt motion over government’s legal advice on Brexit wasn’t done ‘lightly’Ms May’s administration lost two other votes earlier in the day at the hands of shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer, with the government found in contempt of parliament and being forced to release legal advice that it had wanted to keep confidential.Kicking off five days of debate on her Brexit plans, the prime minister then said her deal was the “only solution that will endure” and “bring the country together”.To those arguing for a looser arrangement, she said any deal had to respect the concerns of the 48 per cent who voted to remain, so as to “protect the trade and security cooperation on which so many jobs and lives depend”.She also said: “I know there are some in this house and in the country who would prefer a closer relationship with the European Union than the one I’m proposing, indeed who would prefer the relationship that we currently have and want another referendum.“Although I profoundly disagree, they are arguing for what they believe is right for our country and I respect that, but the hard truth is that we will not settle this issue and bring our country together that way and I ask them to think what it would say to the 52 per cent who came out to vote Leave in many cases for the first time in decades if their decision were ignored.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The court’s advocate general this morning issued an opinion to that effect, and the court usually follows such\u0026nbspadvice.\u0026nbspIf confirmed, this would make a new referendum easier because a vote to remain in the EU could be implemented straight away – and our membership of the EU would continue under the existing terms, the UK rebate on contributions included.\u0026nbspUK ‘can cancel Brexit by unilaterally revoking Article 50’However, the UK government would still have to apply for an extension of the Article 50 deadline so that it could hold a referendum in the first place – and that would still need the unanimous agreement of the EU27 countries.\u0026nbspSome enthusiasts for a second referendum might think that the ECJ’s likely decision would allow the UK to cancel Brexit and then hold the referendum. But that would mean, if the vote were for Leave again, that we would have to start the Article 50 process all over again. Which might fall foul of the advocate general’s opinion, which says that revocation of Article 50 notice is allowed provided it “does not involve an abusive practice”. Revoking and invoking our notice might be seen by the ECJ as precisely that: an illegitimate negotiating tactic.\u0026nbspIf the UK asks for more time to hold a referendum, the\u0026nbspEU27\u0026nbspare highly likely to agree to an extension to the timetable.So the significance of this opinion is indirect. It makes a possible referendum simpler because it would present a choice between two definite options: Theresa May’s Brexit deal versus remaining in the EU on existing terms.\u0026nbspThat would take away one of the arguments against a second referendum, namely that, if “Remain” were on the ballot paper, it would not be possible to guarantee what it meant because – without this legal opinion – we would need to ask permission of the EU27 to stay in the EU. That would probably be granted, but it might be complicated to secure an agreement to that effect before a referendum.\u0026nbspIn the next few days, as MPs debate the prime minister’s Brexit deal, the advocates of giving the people the final say can therefore propose a new referendum that seems credible and well defined.\u0026nbspThey know that, if the UK asks for more time to hold a referendum, the EU27 are highly likely to agree to an extension to the timetable. They want us to stay and want to make it easy for us to do so.\u0026nbspHowever, that EU law is interpreted in a way that suits the cause of integration – “ever closer union” in the words of the founding treaty – does reinforce the argument of Leavers that the EU will always seek to become a single superstate.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The key issue that we’re\u0026nbspsaying\u0026nbsptoday, and that’s why we’re delivering a petition signed by a million people in this country, is that those choices are ones that should be made by the British people.“Parliament is gridlocked ... This is no way to decide the most fundamental question facing Britain for the next 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years.“It is time that we now put the clear choices to the British people and allow them to decide.”Thornberry contradicts Jeremy Corbyn and insists Labour could still back Final Say Brexit referendumThe two documents were handed in to officials at 11am by Ms Greening, politicians from three other parties and The Independent‘s editor Christian Broughton.\u0026nbspLabour’s\u0026nbspChuka Umunna, a champion of the People’s Vote campaign, said: “The biggest issue that we’ve had since the Second World War is being left to MPs. And the problem we have with MPs\u0026nbspin parliament, is\u0026nbspthat they can’t come to a view of what should happen in this situation.“The bottom line is how else are you going to resolve impasse in Westminster if not by referring it back to the people. I don’t know anyone who has come up with a viable alternative.”\u0026nbspLiberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the “let’s-just-get-on-with-it”\u0026nbspattitude is a “fallacy”, because “even if we accept the government’s deal we’re not just getting on with it”.“We’ll be spending years in negotiation of what kind of arrangement we’d want with the European Union – the problem isn’t going to go away,” he said.The prime minister has repeatedly said that she will not countenance a further referendum on Brexit. But with no option carrying a majority in the Commons, a new vote has become\u0026nbspa more likely way to break the political deadlock.\u0026nbspReferring to calls for a new referendum on Monday, Ms May said: “People are talking about a second vote when we haven’t even delivered on the first vote.“I think we need to deliver on the first vote. We asked people to vote. We said ‘please decide whether we should leave or remain’.“People voted to leave and I think there’s a, sort of, democratic duty on us as politicians, having had that referendum, and having said it is your choice, to actually deliver on it. So, let’s deliver on the first vote.”Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

In recent days she has outlined how her proposals will deliver on the\u0026nbsppublic’s desire to end EU free movement.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

There is a real risk that if we don’t vote for this deal that there may be a majority in the House of Commons for a second referendum. And there is also the risk that if we don’t vote for this deal we may get a less good deal, or no deal at all. All of those are less attractive than this deal.“I actually think if there were a second referendum people would probably vote to Leave in even larger numbers than they did before. But the very act of calling a second referendum, I believe, would damage faith in democracy and rip apart the social fabric of this country.”Pressed on the Northern Ireland “backstop” – the EU’s insurance policy to avoid a hard border – Mr Gove said however “uncomfortable” it is for the UK, “it is more uncomfortable for the European Union”.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign and People\u0027s Vote delivering to 10 Downing Street their respective petitions calling for a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal.

This is particularly affecting the critical voices in civil society – human rights lawyers, journalists and bloggers.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High school students burn a barricade in front of their high school during a demonstration against French government Education reformsSully, the service dog of former US President George HW Bush in his final months, lays in front of Bush\u0027s casket at the George H Lewis \u0026amp Sons funeral home in Houston, TexasCourtesy Office of George HW BushReutersDemonstrators march in Brussels to \u0027claim the climate\u0027 as world leaders meet in Poland to discuss the Paris climate agreement targetsA protester moves to lob a tear gas canister during a protest in Paris today against rising fuel pricesUS President Donald Trump, Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Theresa May, French President Emmanuel Macron and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wave hands in front of other leaders during a family photo at the G20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires, ArgentinaFirefighters battle a blaze on Fingerfield road at the Deepwater National Park area of Queensland.

There is no point in the Government trying to hide that fact.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.At the start of a key debate in Parliament on her Brexit plan, the Prime Minister said the backstop was not a trap for Britain.The backstop is not a trick to trap us in the EU, said Mrs May.It actually gives us some important benefits of access to the EUs market without many of the obligations and that is something the EU will not want to let happen, let alone persist for a long time."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000452464646.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"winter solstice 2018 when how celebrated","story":"Along with the shortest number of daylight hours it is also when the Sun is at its lowers point in the sky, in the northern hemisphere.This year’s winter solstice is on December  at .pm.The world solstice comes from the Latin solstitium meaning Sun stands still because the apparent movement of the Suns path north or south stops before changing direction.It is the shortest day of the year.Across Europe it is known as Yule, from the Norse word Jul , meaning wheel.In the northern hemisphere it is when the North Pole is pointing away from the Sun.The day has been celebrated by ious cultures around the world for thousands of years.Most notably it is associated with the druids who mark the start of the solar year with a celebration of light and the rebirth of the Sun.The Feast of Jul was observed in Scandinavian countries around the solstice.Fires would be lit to symbolise the heat and light of the ing Sun and a Yule log was gathered and burnt in the hearth as a tribute to the Norse god Thor.Pagan homes are often decorated with supposedly sacred herbs and red, green and white colours.Holly, ivy, evergreen boughs and pine cones are usually put around the home, especially in places where socialising takes place.A sprig of mistletoe is put up above a threshold and is meant to be left there until the next Yule.Pagans see it as a charm for good luck throughout the year but has now taken on a symbolic meaning for kissing beneath it and the opportunity for romance.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The PM is in Buenos Aires rightly extolling our virtues to world leaders, but it’s hard to shake the feeling that her Cabinet are afraid that Britain cannot make it on its own. That weakness has been exploited time after time by EU negotiators.If only they shared the faith of those who voted for a brighter future.The scandalous lack of planning for a clean break, as James Forsyth makes clear on this very page, is a result of the Government only ever looking for pitfalls — rather than grabbing the opportunities that are so obviously out there for a reinvigorated Britain.It’s not too late. If the PM loses the crunch vote in Parliament, we must step up preparations to leave without a deal by several notches.And that might well see Brussels bureaucrats, for all their harsh words, coming back to the negotiating table.The disgraced tycoon Max Mosley, via his family trust, has pledged to keep funding this so-called independent body for years to come, as he continues his vendetta against the free Press.Labour donor Mr Mosley is no fan of the papers, and not just for exposing his extra-curricular activities. The media also uncovered his racist past, including pamphlets warning: “Coloured immigration threatens your children’s health.”When that bile came to light, the Labour Party promised not to take another penny from him. But he’s spent years bankrolling their Deputy Leader Tom Watson’s office to the tune of hundreds of thousands of pounds.Isn’t it time the cash was handed back, Mr Watson Ms Bibi, a Pakistani Catholic, was acquitted last month of blasphemy charges — a charge which had left her on death row. Whilst she’s in hiding, hardline Islamists have been parading around the country’s streets with images of her in a noose. It is clear she will never be safe in Pakistan.We should be proud of the fact that Britain is open to those of all religions and none, and give her a home here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

NONE of them are laying their lives on the line to get inside the European Union.Are you worried about our future  Me too.I am afraid that the ­uncertainty will drag on for years.

Mrs May, for all her decent and noble efforts, all her hard work, is offering us a future where we would be worse off than we are today.And nothing terries me more than being a colony of Brussels.For all the uncertainties around all of the alternatives, Mrs May’s deal throws away freedoms that better men than me fought and died for.Nobody has the moral right to give away our sovereignty. Nobody.Our Prime Minister has shown courage and a sense of duty.But she has also ­displayed pessimism and defeatism.She has tried to treat our “friends” in the European Union with decency and respect.All of her sense of fair play has been thrown back in her face.The likes of Herr Selmayr and Monsieur Macron are crowing that the price of Brexit is the humbling of the United Kingdom.They are bullying us.And there will be more ­bullying to come — for decades, forever —we do not stand up to them now.What  can you do with a bully What a cruel and bitter irony it would bethis ­country surrendered to a ­hostile enemy without losing a war!

They are there to teach — not to solve the obesity crisis, toilet-train kids or take knives out of teenagers’ hands.There is a growing trend in our politics and our society to take away responsibility from iniduals.Everything from the ludicrous sugar tax to banning speakers from universitiesthey dare to contradict the snowflake agenda all flow from this sinister belief that we can’t be trusted to look after ourselves or make sensible decisions.Schools being used as a catch-up service is a symptom of a culture where too often we’re told that somebody  will do it for us.More people like Ms Spielman must come out and say enough is enough.We must put personal responsibility back at the centre of all our lives. SPEEDBOAT killer Jack Shepherd is treating our justice system with contempt. It is staggering we’re paying for it through Legal Aid.Politicians continually pay lip service to making changes to the legal aid system, but case after jaw-dropping case continues to come into the public eye.It’s important that everybody has access to justice, and financial support is a key part of that.

We must be duly punished.EU leaders can see — apparently more clearly than our own abject leaders — just how well we might do and how much of a threat a prosperous, independent Britain would pose to their Grand Project.Nobody can be certain what will happen after next Tuesday’s crunch vote.A snap election or a second referendum are unthinkable but possible.Returning to full EU membership is both unthinkable and impossible.There are alternatives... the Norway Option, Canada Plus... but they are fraught with complications.Yet there is a way we could avoid Mr Gove’s “turbulence” and leave in an orderly fashion without any deal at all.We don’t have to “crash out” or drive off a clf like Thelma and Louise.Neither option would be good for Britain — or the EU.It should be possible to negotiate a  to -month window to prepare a deal which suits both sides — and pay an appropriate sum to Brussels for the extra time.First, of course, we need a new leader and a new Prime Minister.That is almost as complicated as Brexit.DISGRACED Labour MP Kate Osamor has finally quit Jeremy Corbyn’s team, but only after proof she lied about knowing her son Ishmael was a convicted drug handler.Ms Osamor told a Times reporter who confronted her with the evidence: “I should have come down here with a bat and smashed your face in.”“F*** off,” she added and chucked a bucket of water.Two questions. Is it any surprise Ishmael grew up with contempt for the law And what would have happened to a Tory MP who behaved like that to ahack Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And because it keeps us in a customs union preventing us enacting our own trade deals.Despite the persuasive efforts of Attorney General Geoffrey Cox yesterday, we just don’t believe the EU will seek to avoid the backstop — or let us leave it.It will do anything to prevent an independent free-trading powerhouse on its doorstep. And once we’ve paid our £billion “bill” our leverage is gone.Why did our negotiators not demand a way to exit this trap  Because they didn’t think Brussels would agree. Such has been the feebleness of our efforts since David Cameron first had a go.Mrs May is now reduced to claiming we CAN do our own trade deals before the backstop kicks in.

Most are keen and eager to learn. That’s why teaching can be a really rewarding job, but there’s no doubt it is also a tough one.Today I will be launching my annual report, which will show that, overall, schools in England are doing a good job.The vast majority of children are attending good or outstanding schools, which is as it should be. Young people get just one shot at childhood — leaving no room for complacency.Yet in recent years it feels like more and more is being asked of schools and teachers, which could put this improvement at risk.They are being asked to do things that should be done at home by parents, as they used to be.This is making the job of schools harder. It takes up too much precious time and stops teachers from doing their actual job — teaching.One of the most shocking examples I hear about is the growing number of children beginning their reception year still in nappies.I’ve asked about this in primary schools this year, and each time I’ve asked I’ve been told it is a real problem.This is dficult for teachers, embarrassing for the children concerned and disruptive to their classmates.Quite simply, it is wrong. Toilet training is the parents’ job. It should not be left to schools. Only in the most extreme cases should parents be excused from this most basic of parenting tasks.And this isn’t the only area that concerns me.We all know about the growing problem of childhood obesity. By the start of primary school, almost a quarter of children in England are overweight or obese. This is at the age four or five.This rises to more than a third by the time they go to secondary school.It is estimated that nearly , young people in the UK are now suffering from type  diabetes, an unpleasant disease normally only seen in people over the age of .Schools have an important role to play, teaching children about the importance of healthy eating and exercise. Kids need to get out of breath during PE.But schools can’t do it all. It is lazy for us to rely on schools to change kids’ habits.And the reality is, that as Ofsted research shows, schools on their own can’t make the dference. The answer to the obesity crisis, particularly among younger children, lies in the home, and parents need to make sure their offspring eat healthily, go outside, and don’t spend all day playing on electronic devices.There is no point in teaching about healthy choices, making sure school meals are healthy or having rules about what goes into a packed lunch,for breakfast, dinner and all weekend children have a supply of junk food.One of the saddest things I’ve heard about recently is cases where children have leftover fast food, cold chips or chicken nuggets, in their packed lunches the following day. With the best will in the world, schools cannot fight this single-handedly.Sadly, in some parts of our country, schools are also at the forefront of tackling a very dferent kind of risk: kne crime and gang culture.Thankfully most schools are safe, and of course they can help educate young people about the dangers of knives and how to avoid being drawn into gangs.But they cannot be expected to solve the problem alone. Preventing kne crime requires people working together — police, youth services, health services — to protect children and to do everything to bring those who cause harm to children to justice.However we must not forget the role of parents here either. This is about taking responsibility for your child. I accept that many families are busy and that some children have dficult and complex problems to deal with.But that doesn’t excuse parents from the basics of teaching their children right from wrong, giving them proper boundaries and security. And that means not trying to be their “best friend”.One answer may be to introduce more parenting classes. We know these can work and help parents who might otherwise be struggling.These shouldn’t be for schools to run, but perhaps to run in schools. Maybe now is the time to look again at the ambitions of the Le Chances strategy or the ideas behind the Sure Start programme.But parents must recognise they cannot off load their responsibilities at the school gate.Every minute we ask teachers to spend on these issues is time children aren’t learning the Rs, studying our nation’s history or the scientic forces that shape our world.I want schools to be able to do their proper job, and to let them do that, parents have got to step up.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Her parents orced when she was just six years old and it’s no secret that she’s now estranged from her father Thomas and his highly vocal, deliciously off-message side of the family.So, however well meaning she is, all her charitable grandstanding and repeated declarations of being “an independent woman” suggest she finds validation from being regarded as a, yawn, groundbreaking feminist role model rather than, as Kate is dismissed by some, a dutul we and mother, who toes the royal line and doesn’t make waves.But Kate has no need to virtue signal because she’s rooted in the love and respect of her tight-knit family — a set-up she’s replicating with William, who, after his own fractured childhood, clearly adores the normality of le Chez Middleton.And of course, they’re both equally secure in the knowledge that, post-“King Charles”, the top job is theirs.Harry, on the other hand, has chosen a bride who, despite her efforts at reinvention, has a chequered pastand a burning desire to be seen as more than just a pretty appendage to the sixth-in-line to the throne.That’s understandable.

a year before his death.The letter was written in  to German philosopher Eric Gutkind, as a response to his book “Choose Le: The Biblical Call to Revolt” which Einstein did not agree with.Einstein wrote: “The word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a collection of honourable, but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish.“No interpretation, no matter how subtle, can change anything about this.”The letter started off by praising the philosopher for sharing a common impulse of “striving for the improvement and

questioning the statement that Jews were “chosen people”.He wrote: “The Jewish people to whom I gladly belong, and in whose mentality I feel profoundly anchored, still for me does not have any dferent

Tuesday next week.In a further hammer blow for the PM that left her authority hanging by a thread, the rebels also included an array of senior loyalists – such as ex-Cabinet ministers Damian Green, Sir Michael Fallon and Sir Oliver Letwin, as well as grandees Sir Nicholas Soames, Richard Benyon, Nick Boles and Ed Vaizey.The centrist Tories insisted they were helping No block a No Deal outcome, which they say will devastate the economy.Mrs May’s ex-de facto deputy until last year Mr Green told The Sun: “I wanted to leave options open for the Government and others to prevent No Deal, which would be disastrous”.Former Fisheries minister Mr Benyon added: “I support the PMs deal butit fails I want Parliament to have the option to prevent UK crashing out”.But handing decision making powers to Parliament also means a simple majority of MPs could vote toStruggling to react to the blow, No refused to confirm whether Mr Grieve’s amendment would hand Parliament control of what happens next.The PM’s official spokesman would only say that any MPs’ instruction would simply “reflect the will of the House”.Senior Brexiteers called on No to stare down any majority of MPs that try to push Mrs May around.Former Tory leader Iain Duncan-Smith insisted: “The Clerk of the Commons was clear that any such vote does not bind the Government.“It will be a meaningless vote. The British people voted to leave and Parliament cannot frustrate that.”But privately, senior No admitted that while any Commons motion would not be legally binding, it would be politically impossible to ignore the will of the House of Commons.As Westminster was plunged into a frenzy after the shock vote, some loyal Tory MPs claimed the hammer blow could actually help Mrs May win round wavering Brexiteer Tory MPs to back her deal, fearing an even softer Brexitit falls.Backbench Eurosceptic Andrew Bridgen even accused No of conspiring with Mr Grieve to bring on the defeat.Mr Bridgen told The Sun: “I am left highly suspicious after observing that the Government did not appear disappointed at all when the Grieve amendment went through.“Now No can threaten Brexiteers with either her deal or Parliament saying no Brexit - but that’s a  choice.”The defeat also sparked fresh calls from fervent Brexiteers for Mrs May to be ousted.Another rebel Tory MP said: “This again proves it’s time for colleagues to get the letters in.Look what a disaster Theresa May is making of Brexit”.The drama came just minutes before Theresa May fired the starting gun on the biggest show down in Parliament in decades.A few minutes after the crippling defeat, the PM was forced to take to the Despatch Box to open the marathon five day debate on her deal.After arguing for eight hours each day, MPs then vote on the  page Withdrawal Agreement and  page Political Declaration for a future trade deal at pm next Tuesday night.Imploring the Commons to back her deal and save her Government, the PM surprised MPs by swtly signalling she could make a fresh concession to Eurosceptics on the hated Irish backstop.Separately Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn incensed Brexiteers by saying that reopening the negotiations couldn’t be ruled out.And in incredible scenes, Tory MPs turned on each other as Boris Johnson labelled the PM’s deal a “national humiliation” and said it was “finely balanced” whether Britain would be better off staying in the EU.In a passionate hour long address, the PM said she was aware of the fierce opposition to the so-called Irish ‘backstop’.And she said: “I have listened to those concerns.I want us to consider how we could go further.“And I will be meeting colleagues to find an acceptable solution.”Government sources indicated this could involve giving MPs a vote on approving the activation of the insurance plan in .The PM had earlier warned that reopening the Withdrawal Agreement was impossible – and would give EU member states the chance to wrestle back wins from the UK in areas such as fisheries.In a charged debate, Labour’s Yvette Cooper accused the PM of not being “straight” with the House on the failure to agree a comparable deal on security co-operation.And DUP leader Nigel Dodds hit back at claims his party didn’t represent the pro-Remain feeling in Northern Ireland by saying he wasn’t afraid of another General Election.Original Maastricht rebel Christopher Gill could be seen shouting “outrageous, outrageous” from the peers gallery as the PM spoke.But in a passionate address, the PM urged the House to back her deal, reunite the country and put Britain on course for a brighter future.She said: “This argument has gone on long enough corrosive to our politics and le depends on compromise.”Defending the way she has handled the negotiations, the PM insisted that while she could have “banged on the table” and “faced criticism from all sides”, she had done what she believed was best for Britain.She said: “I didn’t play to the gallery. I focused on getting a deal that honours the referendum, sets us on course for a bright future, and I did so through painstaking hard.“Because I have never thought politics was simply about broadcasting your own opinions on the matter at hand.”Defending her record, she added: “When the EU gave us a choice between off the shelf models, I won a bespoke deal.“When in Salzburg the EU tried to insist on a backstop that carved out Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK I faced them down and they backed down.And right at the end when Spain tried to make a move on Gibraltar I stood firm and protected Gibraltar’s sovereignty.”She said: “Don’t let anyone think there is a better deal to be won by shouting louder.Don’t imagine thatwe vote this down a dferent deal is going to miraculously appear. The alternative is uncertainty and risk.“I don’t say this deal is perfect it was never going to be, that’s the nature of a negotiation.Yes it is a compromise it speaks to the hopes and desires of our fellow citizens who voted to leave and those who voted to stay in.“We will not bring our country togetherwe seek a relationship that gives everything to one side of the argument and nothing to the other.“We should not let the search for the perfect Brexit prevent a good Brexit.”But in a staggering sign of civil war in the Tory party, Conservative MPs turned on Boris Johnson as the former Foreign Secretary said no MP would “sincerely believe” is a good one.In a barb at Brexit-backing members in the Cabinet he added that it appears “those sent out to support it know it is a democratic disaster”.He also called for the Government to withhold the £ billion orce bill until the EU has agreed a trade deal.

Dominic Lundon, , had gone to Parkle Festival in Manchester with MDMA stashed inside his anal cavity - which was found during a stop and search in a performance tent. Lundon, who was named Apprentice of the year by his employer Veolia UK, had a snap bag with two yellow tablets in as well as a further  tablets in a plastic egg, Manchester Crown Court heard. The court was told Lundons mother works at the Whitechapel Centre in Liverpool, helping drug users at the centre which supports homeless people in the city. A sentencing hearing heard that Lundon, from Liverpool, had gone to the festival last year with eight of his friends, reports the Manchester Evening News.  David Lees, prosecuting, said the drugs were found when he was stopped and search in a performance tent. After being arrested, Lundon told police that the drugs were for his personal use. But they also seized his mobile phone, which uncovered texts going back a month in which drug dealing at the festival was discussed. At one point he complains about the cost of the coach fair, but is reassured he will make it back, Mr Lees said. Prosecutors said that there was also evidence that Lundon had dealt drugs at other festivals. “It’s clear that he can’t use mitigation that this is the only time he has done it, Mr Lees added. Carmel Wilde, defending, said: This offence is very much out of character for this young man. She said that Lundon had not initially told his mother about what happened, and when he did she was in a state of absolute shock. Ms Wilde said that looking back it now makes sense to his mother, as his behaviour had changed.  The barrister said that Lundon had took to binging on drink and drugs as a way of coping following the death of his father in . Since his offending he has become drug free, the court was told. He is very well respected at work and won the apprentice of the year award at waste management company Veolia UK, Ms Wilde said. But Judge Michael Leeming said a deterrent sentence was needed, as it was an aggravating factor that the drugs were being sold at a large festival. He said: You are a young man of immense talent, highly intelligent and well thought of by those who know you well. This was a series of judge poor decisions made by you over a period of a few weeks. This is not isolated but planned offending, as those texts plainly demonstrate. Your family are in complete shock that you behaved in this particular way. You have only got yourself to blame for putting yourself in this position. Lundon, of Hedgecote, Liverpool, was jailed for two years and seven months after pleading guilty to one count of possessing MDMA with intent to supply.

Brad, , has more than , subscribers on YouTube and is known for pulling pranks on his other half.

The term Cloutlighting was coined as a combination of clout which is a type of social media fame and gaslighting where an abuser manipulates their victims into doubting themselves. The more extreme the prank, the more likes or followers the prankster gets thereby increasing his clout or fame online.

The tampon prank video, which was recorded in , was one of Brads more shocking pranks.

And that terrible quest to look a little dferent has ended in her death from a cardiac arrest following a bottom op or ‘bum lt’ at a clinic in Hungary. She’d initially only wanted a tummy tuck, breast lt and liposuction. But the offer of a freebie bum lt was presumably too good to resist.  There are few of us in our late s who’ve been through the ravages of childbirth and all that follows who don’t wish we were a little more taut or toned. .

It threw her Brexit plans into disarray and created further chaos. Labour’s Ian Lavery said: “The Tory Government is in office but not in power. It’s clearer than ever May has lost the respect of Parliament and all authority.” May is losing control of her Brexit strategy, Labour said yesterday as the Prime Minister suffered a triple blow in the Commons. Following a day of high-stakes votes, ministers will be forced to publish the full legal advice on the PM’s Brexit deal after MPs found the government in contempt of Parliament for refusing to do so. And MPs will get a greater say in what happensher deal is defeated in a crunch vote next Tuesday.  Labour said Mrs May was “in office but not in power” as she suffered three setbacks in just over one hour:.pm: MPs vote by  to  to block a government bid to boot the legal advice into the long grass. .pm:  to , finding the Government in contempt of Parliament by refusing to reveal the advice. .pm:  to  for an amendment by Tory remainer Dominic Grieve, giving MPs a greater say in Brexitthe PM’s plan is defeated next week.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told MPs: “This Government is not taking back control, it is losing control.”  Labour chairman Ian Lavery told the Mirror: “The Tory Government has made history today for all the wrong reasons. It is on office but not in power. It’s clearer than ever that Theresa May has lost the respect of Parliament and all authority”. The defeat on the Grieve amendment was the biggest blow to the PM and will ensure Parliament can seize control of what happens in the crucial days after the vote. The vote won the backing of  remainer Tory MPs, including six former cabinet ministers: Ken Clarke, Michael Fallon, Justine Greening, Nicky Morgan, Dominic Grieve and Damian Green – the latter a personal disappointment to the PM as he was her former deputy. MPs are concerned about Mrs May’s Plan B, with her chances of winning next week’s “meaningful” vote looking highly unlikely.  Mr Grieve wants to make sure that when ministers come back to the Commons to set out their next steps, they can be amended by MPs. He said: “MPs are tonight starting the process of taking back control. No longer must the will of Parliament – reflecting the will of the people – be diminished. More and more MPs are concluding that the Government’s proposed deal is not what was promised two years ago. “It’s a much worse deal than the one we’ve already got in the EU and,approved, would mean Brexit goes on forever because it leaves all the big questions unanswered.” However, Brexit-supporting MPs claimed they were relaxed about the proposal as it would not force the government’s hand. Former Brexit minister Steve Baker, said: “Whatever the outcome of the amendment, it is not legally binding on the PM”. No sources suggested otherwise. The row over whether ministers should publish the full legal advice culminated in the historic and unprecedented vote in which MPs found the government in contempt.  Attorney General Geoffrey Cox published a summary of his advice on Monday but claimed full publication would not be in the national interest. But the Commons defeat means the full advice will have to be made public, possibly as early as today – including the view the UK would be permanently stuck in the Northern Ireland backstop. The nine DUP MPs who voted for the Labour motion along with two Tories were enough to crush the PM’s fragile majority. Opening five days of debate on her Brexit plans, Mrs May told MPs: “There are some who’d prefer a closer relationship with the EU than the one I’m proposing, indeed who would prefer the relationship that we currently have and want another referendum. “But we will not settle this issue and bring our country together that way. I ask them to think what it would say to the % who came out to vote Leave in many cases for the first time in decadestheir decision were ignored.”  She added: “There are others who’d prefer a more distant relationship than the one I’m proposing. But we won’t settle this issue and bring our country togetherin delivering Brexit we don’t protect the trade and security cooperation on which so many jobs and lives depend, completely ignoring the views of the %.” Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told MPs: “I really can’t believe there is a single member of this House who sincerely believes this deal is a good deal.” European Court of Justice legal advisor Campos Sanchez-Bordona said the UK could abandon Brexit without the agreement of other EU states. At the end of her most humiliating day since she lost her majority at the general election, Mrs May urged MPs to compromise on their beliefs.

Born with debilitating microcephaly during the  Zika virus outbreak, he reached his third birthday on Tuesday. But as people in the village of Apipucos celebrated, doctors feared a new epidemic could explode after three new cases were discovered in just two weeks. Dr Camila Ventura, one of the world’s leading Zika experts, said: “These new instances are incredibly worrying. There is a fear Zika may be back.” I cradled Pedro in my arms again this week after meeting him and his mum Daniele, , during the  outbreak.   We have both put on weight since then – in his case for the best. He is still unable to walk, talk and interact with others, but the community’s love for him has given him a le once unthinkable.Daniele’s husband walked out shortly after Pedro’s birth, unable to cope with his screaming interrupting his TV viewing, but she gets lots of help from friends and villagers. It is more vital than ever for Daniele, who was recently diagnosed with cancer. As she attends hospital appointments, Pedro is cared for by his “auntie”, -year-old Elinevza dos Santos. “He is such a lovely little boy,” she says. “When Pedrinhowas born, we knew how tough it would be on Daniele, but none of us gave it a second thought in helping out. “The whole village loves him likehe was their own. People come from all over just to see him, sit with him and make sure he has everything he needs. “Daniele has brought Pedrinho and her older daughter up alone as a single parent and done an amazing job.”  Apipucos is in the state of Pernambuco, which became the world’s Zika virus epicentre in .The mosquito-borne disease spread to more than  countries in the Americas and was declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization. The biggest concern was its impact on babies developing in the womb, and the surge in microcephaly. The three new cases in Apipucos – a girl and two boys who are all just weeks old – are the first all year and the only cluster since the virus died down in . Pregnant women are still advised not to travel to countries where there is a risk of Zika and couples who have visited them are advised not to conceive for at least six months. During the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s recent tour, pregnant Meghan wore repellant while in Fiji and Tonga, where Zika had been detected. Dr Ventura is a resident at Rece’s Altino Ventura Foundation, which treats most of Brazil’s infected kids. “For so long through education and the use of repellant we had managed to gain somewhat of control of Zika,” she said. “We have not had one case all year and very few in the last few.”   The Brazilian government authorised hundreds of millions of pounds to states to fight Zika in  but much of the money was misused. The foundation relies on a grant from the US to fund its work into Zika, which will end in . America ploughed millions of dollars into research fearing the epidemic could reach its shores. Dr Ventura’s team was chosen because Rece experienced the effects first and in the greatest numbers. Around  children and their families are being cared for by the Foundation’s US-backed Semear Programme. Graziella Taes’ mother, Inabela, brings the three-year-old for physiotherapy and eye treatment twice a week. Children with microcephaly are born almost blind – although they can see bright colours as a blur. Physiotherapist Lissa Wanderley works with the children, many of whom still struggle to lt their heads and unclench their fingers. “In children with microcephaly, it is very dficult for them to pick things up as able-bodied take for granted,” says Lissa.  “We work with them to try and loosen the muscles, so they have some use of their hands. “It is a long journey they face but we are committed to helping each and everyone as best we can.” Families wealthy enough to afford hydrotherapy have seen considerable improvements but the foundation cannot afford a pool.Locals have called their abandonment by their politicians a “disgrace” accusing them of lining their own pockets from the money intended for the children. After a day in Apipucos, it is clear to see why Zika spread. Broken sewers and humidity after heavy rain provides the perfect conditions for mosquitoes to thrive. A lake’s warm, rubbish-filled waters create a perfect breeding grounds for the insects, which only need  hours to reproduce. Locals say they have seen more than usual recently but many cannot afford repellant. Daniele’s abandonment by her husband is common among men who father babies suffering microcephaly. Many mothers who find themselves giving around-the-clock care to a child who may never walk or talk are struggling to get by on a monthly disability payment of just over  reais . At the foundation, we saw dozens of women comforting each other. Many confessed to despair and depression and some say they considered suicide. But they share a fierce love and protection for their children refusing to leave their sides. Inabela speaks of the deep bond between the mums. “We are like sisters,” she says. “When Graziella was born, I felt so alone. Like I was the only one with such problems. “Now though we have an unbreakable bond. Together we have and will continue to get through this.” The Union of Mothers of Angels provides advice and logistical support for mothers of children with microcephaly.

It is believed Kates skirt was a design by Emilia Wickstead and her black top was by luxury Scottish Cashmere label Brora.Kensington Palace said the couple wished to deliver a message of support to deployed personnel and to acknowledge and honour the fact many are away from their families at this time of the year.Addressing the room, the Duchess of Cambridge said: As someone whos husband has served, I know hard it feels when a loved one leaves home for the job they trained for. When William served in the Falklands or with Search and Rescue, I remember how it felt. But I cant imagine how it feels when your loved ones are away on active service.

But Camilla Tominey, an insider, today said: Harry and Meghan really enjoyed staying at Anmer Hall last year, especially spending quality time with Prince George and Princess Charlotte, and theres no reason why they wont want to do the same this year, especially as Meghan is going to be heavily pregnant.Its the best of both worlds in that they can take part in all the festivities at the big house, while retreating into their own space when needed. There would be total astonishmentHarry and Meghan dont stay with William and Kate, she told. Meghan, who is around five months pregnant , may be joined by her mum Doria Ragland at Anmer Hall, according to reports.Buckingham Palace was earlier forced to deny claims of a row between Meghan and Kate, saying: This never happened.

This Tory Government is a shambles. I am reminded of this every time I walk into the House of Commons and look at the Tory frontbench. Do they see the country as we do  Do they care that young families are living off foodbanks  How do they explain to their kids why more and more people are sleeping on our streets  Can we trust the Tories with the future of our country  Since  the answer has been no. And that’s why Labour MPs will vote against this Tory Brexit next week. We have to end the need for foodbanks.  We have to get people off the streets. This should be the priority for towns all over Britain. Until there is a solution to that, no one should trust the Tories on our future. Worse than that though, May’s Brexit deal isn’t even a plan. Brexit has already taken up two long years in which the Prime Minister couldn’t even get the Tories in her own Cabinet to agree, let alone her MPs. The House of Commons is in deadlock. That’s why all she is offering now is a vague ‘political statement’, which tells us nothing about the future. If we vote for it, we will be voting for two more years of wrangling and greater uncertainty. It will drag on and on and on. Many Labour members and voters are coming to the conclusion that the only way out of this mess is to let the public have the final say.  Parliament has ground to a halt. Meanwhile poverty is rising. If we can’t boot the Tories out with a general election then let’s take power form their hands and give the final verdict to the public. Has Brexit been a resounding success  Do we trust the Tories with our country  I think we all know the answer to that.

They’re places to go for the personal touch, service that goes the extra mile or just a familiar face. But as online sales soar, the great British high street has dwindled. The Mirror aims to stop it in its tracks and with our High Street Fightback campaign. And, among the slew of Christmas adverts from the likes of Amazon, tempting customers to head online, one stands out from the crowd - and stands up for the smallest of business that make Britain great. We spoke to the stars of the Visa campaign featuring small business owners who are proud to be independent, to see how they remain at the hearts of their high streets and why this Christmas is so important. The Toybox When Loiumlc Lecoutour, pictured above, was told he would be out of a job in just five days when the shop he worked in closed, he knew he didn’t have a moment to lose. The -year-old immediately got started on a business plan to open his own business instead. But Loiumlc knew he would desperately need money - and a lot of it. So, on his last day, at the shop’s closing down sale, he asked every customerthey’d be willing to invest in him and his idea for a toyshop. He said: “The owner of the shop gave me five days notice it would be shutting. She told me on the Saturday morning and the last day would be Wednesday.   “I hadn’t been paid. I was overdrawn. I went into panic mode. “Woolworths had just closed down a few months earlier, it was , right in the middle of the recession but that night I downloaded a business plan and filled it completely. “I realised I had an idea in my head.” What he didn’t have were the pound, start up costs until his idea of asking for help paid off and several people agreed to invest. But it would take time and Loic was out of work. So, the local shopkeepers helped him with temporary shts in their shops, allowing him to pay the bills. And just three months later he set up The Toybox in Victoria Park, London. Loiumlc, now , and originally from Normandy, France, says: “There’s quite a few schools around so weekly, people are invited to birthday parties. So a toy shop is a very practical idea for everyone concerned. “It makes me feel unique saying I have a toy shop. I like making people happy and being useful and I don’t feel like I have to be a salesman. “If you come into my shop, I try to be myself. I like to make people laugh, I try to be myself. I’m the crazy - or eccentric - French toyshop man. I bring the character people want to see.” The record shop   Loyalty is one thing but when Barry Everard heard one customer saying they wanted to be buried under his record shop, it was clear he must be doing something right. His Record Collector store in Sheffield has been a staple on the Broomhill high street for the past  years. Barry knows his customers and his customers know Barry. He says: “We are in the University district of Sheffield, which I think has become more of night-time economy area. Supermarkets have moved in and it’s less of a -degree shopping street. “We’ve gone from one of the youngest members to one of the oldest.” And in a era of ever-present online music, Barry said it’s important to have high street record shops to discover what people otherwise wouldn’t. He said: “I personally feel a sense of importance in keeping culture and music alive on the high street. “In a shop you have a huge selection, we are the biggest record shop in South Yorkshire. “People come in here and find things, we stock the obscure and the unusual and the hard to find. The high street has changed signicantly in the past  years according to Barry - and as a record store they’ve had to keep up through CDs and digital downloads. But they haven’t stopped selling in the entire  years - something Barry is proud of. He says: “Vinyl is back in style, there’s something that happens every year called Record Store Day. It results in a bonanza for shops like ourselves and we get queues a couple of hundred yards long. “We are on a crusade to convince people shopping is fun and we can still be competitive to prices on the internet.” The bakers  When it comes to carrying on a family tradition, Christopher Freeman knows he’s got a lot of history on his side. He may have spent  years as chairman of Dunns Bakery but the whole family have certainly done their time since it started with his great great grandfather in . His dad came into Dunns bakery in , with Christopher taking over in . And his grandson Lewis, , is continuing the tradition by being managing director. Based in Crouch End, North London, Christopher and the shop are valued parts of the local community. He says: “I think the high street is vital to so many local communities. Not everyone has time to go and do huge shopping, lots of people want to shop locally and have a good relationship with traders and shopkeepers. “It’s just a nicer way of le.” Christopher says he has seen many changes since he started running the bakery and feels shops and customers want to move back into the high street, rather than shopping centres. He says: “You can give people personal service to choose what items they want, you can make bespoke things. People like to feel valued and feel important instead of simply a number in a supermarket where you can walk around and not engage with anyone at all. “A high street contributes to the local economy. A pound spent locally stays local - it benefits everyone.” The most popular items Christopher sells include sausage rolls, doughnuts, breakfast rolls and danish pastries. The florist  Elizabeth Blanck has seen an entire generation of customers pass through her florist shop - from couples getting married, having children and seeing those children grow up. The -year-old has run Fitzroy’s Flowers in north west London for  years, after setting it up with her mum. Elizabeth says her customer base has remained loyal over the two decades she’s been open but she has seen changes to the high street, mainly independent shops being replaced with estate agents. And while she is unable to bulk buy like many bigger chains do, Elizabeth says personal service is key. “A bunch of tulips may only be a pound cheaper in the supermarket” she says. “You get a personal service with us too, we buy the best quality stuff out there. “We are in the shop to serve customers - that’s it. We need you, we need shoppers, we need people to come in and buy from us. “You are supporting families so it makes sense to buy from a local shop.” Elizabeth says her own shopping habits have changed since owning the florist and she always tries to buy from a small business to keep high streets alive. She says: “If we don’t have a high street we lose communities. Certain people might not see someone, might not have any family nearby.” The gt shop   The appeal of online shopping is no mystery for Sarah Marshall and Angela Cooper, after all it’s where they started. The pair, who have been business partners for  years, first set up their shop The Dotty House online, creating personalised canvases as gts for kids. But four years ago, they were able to move into physical shop premises and in May this year onto their high street in Gateshead. Sarah, , says: “We both had quite stressful jobs and young children and decided we wanted to change and set up a business closer to home so it made it more flexible for us. “We’ve been in business on the high street since May and we’ve seen a huge dference. We’ve had people come in, we know them, they know us. “We’ve taken a shop that was quite run down and revitalised it.” The Dotty House sells personalised gts and North East specic presents. But Sarah says one of the key things about the high street is the customers can give back. She says: “We look at what people locally have been asking for. One lady was walking past the shop, dropped in and said she writes poems and askedshe produced them as a print, could we sell them  “And it’s actually been one of our best selling products.” "},{"url":null,"title":"storm etienne weather forecast 17","story":"NewsUK weather forecast:  HOURS of rain - will it fall in your area The Met Office has issued yellow weather warnings for ice and rain, with up to two inches expected in some placesShareCommentsByChris kitching:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video its-going-chilly-wet-watch-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBritain is set to be pummelled with  hours of heavy and persistent rain and some snow in colder places.

Theresa May’s dogs dinner of a Brexit deal looks almost certain to fall on Tuesday, not least because MPs know that it hands far too much power to the EU after  March. With no appetite for an economy-shattering No Deal, her own cabinet ministers must now persuade her to pivot to the only other feasible Brexit option Norway Plus. Let’s be clear. The Norway option is a strong compromise. It would respect the result of the referendum – the : vote was an instruction to move house, but to stay in the same neighbourhood. Aside from a few loud voices on both ends of the spectrum, the silent majority of people – Leave or Remain – recognise that we must leave the EU but maintain a close, practical, working relationship with those countries.  On the doorstep in Aberavon I hear that my constituents are fed up of politicians bickering and want a Brexit that can move our country forward. Joining the European Free Trade Association and the European Economic Area would mean an exciting future for Britain where we lead a group of countries outside of the EU, free from pressure to join the Euro or a European army, but still with access to the job-saving Single Market. Importantly Norway’s Prime Minister and Iceland’s Foreign Minister say they are happy to have us, while the EU’s chief negotiator has offered the EEA, plus a form of customs union , as a route forward. Some claim Norway Plus would make us a ‘rule-taker’, but the truth is that the EFTA court which we’d be joining is far preferable to the more powerful European Court of Justice which we’d be leaving, due to the fact that EFTA has the power to erge from ECJ rulings and, crucially, respects national sovereignty.  Then there’s the question of managing immigration. Norway Plus would represent a signicant step forward because the EEA agreement contains an emergency brake on freedom of movement and a chance to reform the system. By providing Britain with a lever to pullnumbers get too high the EEA agreement consequently ends the seemingly limitless nature of freedom of movement that was such a key factor in the referendum. And what about Norway’s payments to the EU  Well, EEA countries simply pay for the EU institutions they have access to, which seems fair, and pay far less per head. The time has come for adult politics. Norway Plus is a sensible bridge-building Brexit that can and will re-unite our deeply ided country.

The low pressure front is forecast to blanket parts of the country in up to eight inches of snow, with strong gales bringing further chaos. The plunge in temperatures could bring disruption to thousands of travellers due to ice, rain and snowfall. And now, it is now travelling towards the UK. Throughout the course of tonight and into tomorrow morning, the storm is predicted to slam into the Cornish coast, before moving north and into Scotland.  Across the Pennines and higher ground of southern Scotland, rain is likely to fall as heavy snow at times. A yellow weather warning for wind has been issued by the Met Office, saying: A spell of very strong winds on Friday could bring some disruption. Road, rail, and ferry services may be affected, with longer journeys times and cancellations possible. Some roads and bridges may close and there is a slight chance of some damage to buildings, such as tiles blown from roofs. There is a small chance injuries and danger to le could occur from flying debris, as well as large waves and beach material being thrown onto sea fronts, coastal roads and properties. While its predicted to lose power over the next two days, Etienne will go on to bring miserable weather to parts of the north east.  Parts of Wales are also likely to be hit with  hours of heavy rain thanks to the storm. Scotland could see temperatures dip to a biting - and possibly - in the Highlands tonight. Etienne arrives into the UK just days after Storm Diana brought chaos to many parts - including Bristol which saw severe flash flooding. Parts of North Yorkshire have already seen heavy snow and roads blocked thanks to wintery showers.

Dogs assume they are tasty treats - but the substance is toxic and can kill them. There have already been reports of the waxy white lumps turning up in the last few days on storm-lashed beaches in Devon, including Babbacombe beach at Torquay.  A Torquay council spokesman warned the blobs are contaminated with bacteria and other poisonous substances which have killed several dogs recently. The National Trust has reported more blobs coming ashore on popular winter-time dog walking beaches in Norfolk.

We are currently investigating but dog owners please be aware and do not allow your dog to pick up and eat anything off the beach. We will update later.

Silvano P Colombano, a computer scientist at NASA Ames Research Centre, says humans may not have even noticed the extraterrestrials arrival on earth due to the vastly dferent looks. Colombano says the aliens could have arrived to the planet in the form of something other than carbon-based organisms - meaning they would go undetected. In a research paper, he wrote: I simply want to point out the fact that the intelligence we might find and that might choose to find usmight not be at all produced by carbon-based organisms like us.  The size of the ‘explorer’ might be that of an extremely tiny super-intelligent entity, reports The Independent. If we adopt a new set of assumptions about what forms of higher intelligence and technology we might find, some of those phenomena might fit specic hypotheses, and we could start some serious enquiry. Colombano also says it is worth re-considering what civilization may look like across the universe. He said scientists should consider further that technological development in our civilisation started only about , years ago and has seen the rise of scientic methodologies only in the past  years.  He added that because of this as humans may have a “real problem predicting technological evolution even for the next thousand years, let alone six million times that amount.” Scientist Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock also said extraterrestrial le could look very dferent than expected. Basing her theory on how le began on Earth, she believes the mutants would be large marine-type animals with metallic skins and orange backsides.

And one woman definitely went beyond the point of noas she was planning her big day, as her wedding planner recently revealed. The problems, she claimed, all started when the brides sister fell pregnant.   Writing anonymously on NotAlwaysRight the wedding planner says the sister had been trying for a baby for three years, before finally conceiving. But when the bride found out about the pregnancy, she kicked her out of the wedding party and banned her from being a bridesmaid. Reportedly, she exclaimed: Well, then, I guess you cant be in my wedding, because I dont want to deal with the problems your pregnancy will cause. The problems mainly included altering the dress to fit her sisters inconvenient baby bump.   Instead of being happy for her sibling, the bride threw a strop and eventually her sister left without saying another word. Attempting to remain levelheaded, the wedding planner, who had heard the heated encounter, says she put on her best retail face and continued to do her job. But a few months later things took a turn for the worse. Recalling the awful day, the planner explained: Bridezilla and Bridezillas mom are with me and Bridezillas mom gets a phone call.   Bridezillas mom excuses herself and left to answer. She spends most of the meeting on the phone. Towards the end, Bridezillas mom comes back, slowly putting her phone away. It looks as though shes been crying. Tragically she goes on to reveal that it was the sister on the phone and shes lost her baby. The wedding planner feels heartbroken for the entire family, she doesnt know what to say but feels sympathy tears brimming in her eyes.   The bride on the other hand doesnt seem fazed by the news at all. Instead of sharing shock or sadness, she simply comments: Oh. Well, I guess she can be in my wedding, then, since shes not pregnant anymore. Her comment outraged her mother, whose reaction the wedding planner describes as absolutely terrying. I have never seen something snap behind another persons eyes before, she admitted.

The site was disguised as a business that hired elite brand children’s clothing which were worn by underage models. Media reports in Moscow say it was offering girls and boys aged from five upwards to sex perverts for an hourly rate of pound-to-pound,. The website was blocked by Russian law enforcement and a probe is now underway by criminal investigators into who was behind the paedophile ring. One model pictured was said to be just eight years old. One hour’s rental was priced at , roubles - or pound. The wording suggested this price was for hiring clothes - but the innuendo indicated it was for abusing the child. In the same way, another “model”, aged five, was priced at , routes , or pound,.  One picture showing a six-year-old boy put the cost of his clothing at , roubles - or pound. A seven-year-old had the same price for one hour’s rental. Yulia Ivanova, spokeswoman for the Russian Investigative Committee, said: “According to the media, the creators of the website advertising clothing for children were in fact making a profit…. offering services renting out children for prostitution”. The website indicated the hourly cost of rent and also offered a delivery service outside Moscow. While the site showed branded kid’s clothing, reports said this was a mask for advertising children for sex. “Everything suggested child prostitution,” one media report claimed. “Photos of children, their ages and names, prices, detailed information about delivery of the product and opportunities to order a comfortable place for using the product -unambiguous references.” The site’s operators took steps to remain anonymous. “Payment for services could be made only with a cryptocurrency.” Deals were negotiated by a web messenger known for its secrecy. “There was also a photo of an absolutely naked child on a beach holiday,” said the report.  TV reported that the service was created for Muscovites. The organisers were “delivering little victims of violence in a car - and taking them back in the same car”. Children could be brought to the door of clients living outside the Russian capital “for an additional payment”. One page on the site - before it was blocked - offered “delivery across Moscow and Moscow region around the clock with no days off. “We deliver rented clothing in our own transport that we use to take [it] back. “If you have no opportunity to use rented product at your , we have our own comfortable spaces in Moscow.” The site contained the name CPidzhak - with the letters ‘CP’ seen as standing for ‘child porn’. Reports said two grotesque “references” supposedly from clients made clear beyond all doubt that the website was offering child sex. One user called “connoisseur”, stated: What is offered by cpidzhak website is a lot more pleasant than any CP video or photo! “Trust me! Its like heroin! “Now you dont need to watch child porn…. or CP, just choose the product in the shops catalogue and contact managers through the website or .” The revolting post continued: “If you use the services, unforgettable joy not compatible to anything  is awaiting for you!” Another ‘reference’ claimed ‘everything was to top standard’. “I had unforgettable time and I wanted to express my sincere gratitude,” it read.

The miracle baby girl was born in Brazil via caesarean section at  weeks and three days, weighing around lbs. The transplanted womb was removed during the procedure, and no anomalies were seen. The recipient was a -year-old woman born without a uterus due to a congenital condition. She had one IVF cycle four months before the transplant, which resulted in eight fertilised eggs. Do you have a miracle birth story  Email webnews@mirror  The -year-old donor died of a stroke. Previously, there were  other uterus transplants from dead donors attempted globally, but this is the first to result in a live birth. Previously, uterus transplants from a live woman were the only option, but donors are in short supply. Research leader Dr Dani Ejzenberg, of University of Sao Paulo in Brazil, said: “The use of deceased donors could greatly broaden access to this treatment...for women with uterine infertility.  “The need for a live donor is a major limitation as donors are rare, typically being willing and eligible family members or close friends. The numbers of people willing to donate organs upon their own deaths are far larger than those of live donors, offering a much wider potential donor population.” The details of the September  procedure have been published in medical journal The Lancet.

It can really hurt teams,” said Jim.“We didn’t utilise Jesse and Calvin’s pace nearly enough at Hibs but they are still young and they are still learning their positions.“We have that pace, though, andyou take our three midfielders last Saturday, although Paul McGowan doubled up as a striker because of the system we wanted to play, you look at Martin Woods, you look at Glen Kamara you look at Paul McGowan, every one of them can pick a pass.“They are clever players and they can spot a pass, sowe make the runs early enough we can use that.

I could say ‘I’m going to change things’ and the team knew that, the coaching staff knew that and the club knew that as well but ultimately it comes down to results.“Outside influences can be strong and the club felt they wanted a change.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"south argyll schools reach bowl final","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowSouth Argyll Schoolstravelled to Eastwood High School in Glasgow on Tuesday November  to play in the Scottish Schools Bowl semi-final.The game was played in good conditions and the team were looking forward to building on their recent quarter final performance.The game started with an early converted try for SAS but they were pulled back to - by half time.

His daughter, Kirsty, had elected to fill the silly seat for this event and they, after a few first stage detours, managed to keep speaking right to the end and brought the class one pocket rocket home in th overall and a brilliant second in class. The mind boggles as to what the result could have been , as Kirsty was heard to remark, she had #someone who would listen to her#.Jonothan MacDonald and Chris Wareham were out in the beautully prepared Mull of Kintyre Cheese sponsored Peugeot . Their pace was good enough for th overall and fourth in class three.Mull pair Malcolm MacDougall and Stuart MacLean were out in the class one Vauxhall Nova and were getting visibly quicker as the day went on, a trend that had repeated itself over the course of the year with confidence and technique increasing with every stage mile covered. They finished th overall and a commendable fourth in class one.There were three Argyll co-drivers directing their pilots around the airfield. Ian Parker, recently announced as one of seven # and the only Scot # co-drivers to be selected to join the MSA Academy for , was back in the Honda Civic of Fraser Smith. The Civic screamed its way round the stages with minimal fuss, other than perhaps a lucky trip on two wheels after clipping a tyre, to finish in nd overall and fourth in class two.The final Argyll man out was Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan who was shouting left and right for Greg Inglis of Montrose in his quick and agile Lotus Exige. Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages. They got the hammer down over the last three and were to finish fth overall and first in class three.They were beaten only by the Kirkaldy brothers, both in Escort MkII#s of the highest calibre, and two WRC cars driven by Brian Watson and Reay Mackay.Last but not least, Oban#s Angus MacNeil was out with Sam MacFadyen in Brian Watson#s Mitsubishi Evo  binging it home unscathed in th overall.The event was won by Alan Kirkaldy in a freshly built Escort MkII, followed by his circuit racer brother Andrew in secondand Reay Mackay taking the last podium place in his WRC Fiesta. This was a fitting finish to the Championship at Leuchars with very fast stages and a good test of manand machine in equal measures.Photographs by West Coast Photos."},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"abandoned bird left cage inside","story":"NewsAbandoned bird left in cage inside a carrier bag beside Ayr bus stopThe bus stop is close to the Pets at Home store so the forgetful owner may have been getting food or vet treatment.ShareByStephen Houston:,  DEC News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA daft bird fancier left their canary while waiting for a bus.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"college go bust in few","story":"NewsCollege will go bust in a few yearsSenior sources say at least  full time posts face the axe amid a financial crisis.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsAyrshire College jobs are under threat as bosses battle to save its future. \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyrshire College will go bust “in a few short years,” it has been claimed. Scores of jobs are under threat as bosses battle to save its future. Senior sources say at least  full time posts face the axe amid a financial crisis.  Staff have been given the stark warning by outgoing Principal, Heather Dunk. It comes as the college leaks cash on a costly PFI deal for its campus at Kilwinning. A source said: “Mrs Dunk announced to staff that the college will run out of money in a few short years. “She blamed this entirely on the funding council, the Scottish Government and the PFI at Kilwinning. “In a blatant attempt to essentially threaten staff against pursuing the cost-of-living pay rise, she made clear that at least  full time jobs would need to go to pay to keep the college afloat.” The warning comes as Mrs Dunk prepares to step down in the Spring. And a row has engulfed management as they prepare to appoint her successor. We told last week how the recruitment agency leading the search includes the we of college chair, Willie Mackie. A College spokesman said: “The Principal recently met with all staff to provide an update regarding the financial challenges facing the college due to increased staff costs arising from national bargaining and the excessive costs of the PfI campus in Kilwinning. “The College is working with the Scottish Funding Council to find a solution to the dficult financial position, however,additional funding is not available, the outcome may be the loss of jobs to reduce expenditure. “The Principal continues to update the trade unions, the student association and staff on a regular basis to ensure openness and transparency. “All staff are aware of the challenges the Colleges faces and have contributed to a consultation regarding potential efficiencies and opportunities for income generation.” Ayr MSP, John Scott, wants to see the college backed by the Scottish Government until the end of its PFI contract. But he said: “Unfortunately, the response I have so far received from the Scottish Government to this request has been negative. “But I will continue to argue the case for additional funding to be allocated to the College in order that their ongoing commitments can be met and the loss of staff avoided.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"famous tower blocks almost certain","story":"NewsFamous tower blocks almost certain to be flattenedThe trio of -storey Riverside Place towers have been a landmark since .ShareByStephen Houston:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsThe only towers in South Ayrshire are doomed \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr’s famous tower blocks are almost certainly to be flattened after a repair bill landed for up to pound MILLION of work. The astonishing figure - which works out at pound, for each flat - is being seen as hopeless to fund. The trio of -storey Riverside Place towers have been a landmark since .   Their destruction will mean the loss of  one-bedroom flats and tenants will have to be farmed out to new homes. An insider at owners South Ayrshire Council said: “The price is too high and unless there is a money miracle, they will come down. “Officials have been taken aback at how much money they need. To save them would be financially ridiculous.” Ironically the council has already sanctioned pound million worth of initial work which has already begun. Housing staff say that to build a brand new flat either on the same riverside site or where in the area is just pound,. Each of the blocks has  homes and  have been deliberately left empty as the scale of repair emerged. One-to-one consultation is to take place with the tenants - most of whom are elderly - over the next six months. Councillors heard about the state of the “essential and advisable” works at a meeting yesterday . These include the removal of the external cladding, existing timber and aluminium windows, and pitched roof covering new insulated render system full rewiring new heating and hot water systems upgrading the sprinkler system and upgrading passenger lts. One long-time tenant told the Post: “If it is going to cost about pound, to build a new flat for me to rent, I have a money saving plan. “Give me pound, and I’ll buy my own we place in Ayr. Job done.” If repairs were sanctioned tenants would need to be decanted for a year. Housing boss Donald Gillies said: “As we consider what happens next with the high flats in Ayr, our tenants will continue to be our focus at all times. That’s why we’re asking councillors to approve a formal consultation where we can sit down on an inidual basis with each and every one of our tenants in Riverside Place and discuss their specic needs and preferences. “If Councillors agree, we’re also seeking approval to appoint two dedicated officers to lead on the consultation and engagement exercise, which would get underway in the new year with a further report to Councillors in June. “It would only be then that any decision on the future of the flats would be taken and tenants would be involved in discussions every step of the way.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"health bosses agree only one","story":"NewsHealth bosses agree there will only be one major cancer unit in AyrshireChemo treatment is to be axed at either Ayr or Crosshouse Hospital, a health board meeting heard on Monday.ShareByAyrshire PostSarah Hilley:,  DEC NewsAyr Hospital\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThere will only be one main cancer unit in Ayrshire. Chemo treatment is to be axed at either Ayr or Crosshouse Hospital, a health board meeting heard on Monday. Heath bosses at NHS Ayrshire  Arran are considering a huge shake-up of cancer services.  Previously it was proposed Crosshouse Hospital would be home to the cancer unit but bosses insist they are now considering Ayr too. Peter Maclean, clinical director, cancer services, said: “The next stage is to determine where the site will be.” The NHS Ayshire  Arran health board meeting was told a new model for cancer treatment is being proposed across the whole of the West of Scotland. Non-executive board member Ian Welsh said there is concern about moving services away from Ayr. As well as the main cancer unit, new outreach treatment hubs could be available where but they would only cater for low-risk cases. Nurse director Professor Hazel Borland said the outreach service could be located at Ayrshire Central Hospital in Irvine. She added: “For the next  to  months there will be no change. It continues as it is.” Councillor Joe Cullinane raised the issue of consultation and said any change at Ayr would become political. He added: “At the end of the day cancer touches most people’s lives in our community.” Chief executive John Burns said the ambition was to deliver the “best care we can to our population”. He added: “We need to think of it as a pathway, not just a building.” Councillor Laura Brennan-Whitefield wanted more information on the outreach cancer treatment. She said: “There has been a question mark over Ayr Hospital since . For me it is such a big thing. We have to have a sight of what the final result will be.” The chosen hospital would undergo an upgrade to host the cancer unit. A paper presented to the board said it was proposed: “NHS Ayrshire  Arran would have one cancer unit and should seek to determine optimal provision of outreach services as appropriate.” The proposed West of Scotland service model was endorsed by the board.

Alexander MacKenzie, , of Galloway Avenue in Ayr, was caught with a sick collection of illegal material involving animals and others showing children thought to be as young as one-year old. Police discovered the sick creep had a total of approximately  images. One involved two women and a black dog. And images displayed naked kids – the youngest aged between one and three. Ayr Sherf Court heard at an earlier hearing that police carried out a search on September  last year and uncovered a USB stick and HP computer terminal storing MacKenzie’s disgusting collection. Officers attended at the home MacKenzie shares with his elderly mother. She stated he was at work and told officers she only used the computer for online banking. His mum told officers that MacKenzie used the computer everyday – to go online, for Facebook and “something to do with animals”.  Mackenzie, who has a previous conviction, appeared at court last Wednesday for sentencing. Solicitor Chris Munro said: “This is something that has spiralled, causing him to possess the images. “It’s a fairly low volume of images. “This is a matter of possession rather than distribution. “He appreciates these are particularly serious matters and custody may be on your lordship’s mind. “He resides with his mother and Mr Mackenzie is her registered carer. “She clearly would face some problemsMr Mackenzie was sent to prison today. “He has a relatively close bond with his mother.” Sherf Desmond Leslie replied: “[I have] concerns with the previous conviction and the superficial appreciation of the disposal that was made at that time.”  Mr Munro replied: “There is clearly a risk here but that can be managed in the community.” Stepping back from custody, the Sherf imposed a y community payback order. The perv was sentenced to three years supervision and as a requirement must attend the Moving Forward Making Changes programme. He was tagged for nine months where he must remain in his home address from pm - am. And he was also placed on the sex offenders’ register for five years. MacKenzie pled guilty to being in possession of a quantity of extreme pornographic images depicting in an explicit and realistic way bestiality between adults and animals between June ,  and September , . He also admitted having in his possession indecent photos or pseudo-photos of children from June ,  and September , .

It was utterly disgraceful and incomprehensible.\"Defence lawyer Sophie Russell said that in the light cold light of day when her client was sober that he was \"very remorseful\".She added: \"When he has a drink in him he can become quite loud and inappropriate.\"The lawyer said the female would have been quite shaken at what had happened.Sherf Peter Paterson imposed a night time home curfew at Howdenburn Court, Jedburgh, between the hours of pm and .am as well as ordering Field to pay the female shop assistant pound, in compensation.He said:\"If you are back in court for an offence of this nature, the attempt to humiliate a female while under the influence of alcohol, you will go to jail.\"If you dont address your dficulties with alcohol then that is what is going to happen.\""},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-to-be-next-town-in-borders-to-get-new-school","story":"Galashiels is to be the next town to geta new high school.Officers are recommending the council spend pound.m on a cross-generational campus for Gala, which would be due to open in .Plans for campuses in Hawick, Selkirk and Peebles willthen follow in that order.However, the plans weremet with fury by opposition councillors from other areas, who claim their areas have been overlooked.Councillors also raised concerns over the cost of building four campuses, at a cost of poundm, over a -year period.At a meeting of Scottish Borders Council today, Hawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer spoke out against Hawick being passed over in favour of Galashiels: ldquoWas there ever the slightest chance that Hawick or indeed any of the others would be next on the list ldquoThis is not about pitching Hawick versus Gala or Peebles or anywhere  itrsquos about fairness, itrsquos about need, itrsquos about a future for a community that is quite simply feeding from the bottom of the tank.ldquoHawick High School is not only not fit for purpose, but its current condition is an embarrassment to modern education and the youngsters and teachers who are required to attend this utter shambles are being let down by all in here who will not support them.ldquoAnd letrsquos be absolutely clear, with new high schools in Duns, Eyemouth, Earlston, and Kelso, and with work about to start in Jedburgh, when you agree this prioritisation for Galashiels today to you slam the door shut on any prospect of Hawick attracting teachers when they have a choice of modern versus old and dilapidated.ldquoThis action today is a further step in annexing the southern Borders and is not acceptable to those who deserve more from this council.Councillor McAteer then introduced an amendment, supported by fellow Hawick councillors David Paterson, Stuart Marshall and Clair Ramage, which asked for the council to delay its decision until a complete report had been submitted by education officers.Tweeddale West councillor Heather Anderson and Selkirkshire councillor Elaine Thornton-Nicol also spoke out against the plans and highlighted the need for new schools in Peebles and Selkirk respectively.Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell, who serves as leader of the opposition, cast doubt on the claim the council could afford to build four schools: ldquoThere is something financially unviable and deeply unfair in this paper,the costings and timings are added up for four campuses, then over  years you get an incredible poundm.ldquoWersquoll probably receive around half, and will have to find the other half.ldquoThere is no way that can be paid for, even in the unacceptable timetable of -plus years.

However, when the fall of communism led to the break-up of Yugoslavia, war came to Bosnia in , driven in part by Serbiarsquos desire to create a lsquoGreater Serbiarsquo, including large parts of Bosnia, from which they planned to remove Croats and Muslims in what became known as lsquoethnic cleansingrsquo.Our delegation leader Resad Trbonja was , living in Sarajevo. On April , , he woke to find his city under siege, surrounded by Serbian artillery and snipers on the mountains overlooking the city. The siege would last four years, the longest in modern warfare, longer than Stalingrad. An average of  mortars landed in the city every day, , on the worst day.Resad, who lived through, and fought in, the siege, explained that Sarajevo regressed two centuries overnight ndash no water, no electricity, no phones. The Serbian army allowed minimal UN aid into the city sporadically but nothing .The survival of the siege is a story of human courage, spirit and defiance.Our first visit was to the remnants of a tunnel, dug under Sarajevo airport to reach Bosnian-held territory on the other side. This tiny tunnel was the only way in or out for four years.Through this tunnel extra aid came, for example from Edinburgh Direct Aid, who drove lorries of supplies from Edinburgh to help Sarajevans. My own predecessor, John Home Robertson, then MPfor East Lothian, spent several Parliamentary recesses as a volunteer lorry driver. It was dangerous work and one of his colleagues died on the notorious road known as lsquoSnipers Alleyrsquo.Perhaps the most affecting visit in Sarajevo was to the War Childhood Museum, where those who grew up in the siege display the things they kept to remind them of what it was like, and tell their story.A homemade cardboard knightrsquos breastplate made by a brother who later died a cuddly toy from a UN delivery, cuddled threadbare because it was the only toy a homemade lsquounormrsquo for a childrenrsquos choir which rehearsed and performed in defiance of bombs and bullets the remains of a playpark lsquojungle gymrsquo kept to remember the day a mortar tore it apart and killed your friend ndash no one who visits this museum will forget it.That is true too of Srebrenica. This was supposedly a lsquosafe havenrsquo protected by UN troops. Yet on July , Serbian paramilitary units overran it. Thousands of Bosnian Muslims sought refuge in the UN base at a disused factory.When we visited the museum now sited there, survivor Hasan Hasanovic explained to us how UN soldiers stood by as women and children were herded onto buses and deported, while their men were separated and removed in lorries. They were systematically murdered nearby. Thousands more who tried to escape through the forest were hunted down, shepherded into a meadow, and shot. In all, , Bosnian Muslim men and boys were slaughtered at Srebrenica.Finally, the international community acted. In a matter of days, air strikes lted the siege of Sarajevo, drove Serbian paramilitaries out of much of the territory they had occupied, and forced agreement to a peace deal signed in Dayton, Ohio.Srebrenica was not the only genocide in this war, but it is emblematic because it happened under the noses of the UN and because of the bravery of the Mothers of Srebrenica, who ed home to find out what happened to their husbands and sons, refused to be silenced, and demanded justice.This led to the International Commission on Missing Persons and the forensic anthropology unit in Tuzla, where we saw the incredible work done to identy remains using DNA. More than , victims of genocide have now been identied, allowing their families to grieve and to bury them at the final stop of our visit.We arrive at the cemetery at Potaceri, outside Srebrenica, as the sun sets. On the hillside, , stark white tombstones bring home the enormity of what was done over only a few days a mere  years or so ago.More than , died at Srebrenica , perished in Sarajevo , women suffered rape as an act of war millions fled their homes, some even finding their way to the refugee reception centre at Cheylesmore Lodge in North Berwick.All the survivors I met asked the same question: why did so much suffering have to happen before the international community acted to stop it  In telling us their story, they relived their own pain. They did so in the hope that we learn the lessons of Bosnia. We need only look at Syria or Yemen to know that we have not.That is why we must remember Srebrenica.If any local groups would like to hear more about the work of Remembering Srebrenica, please contact my office on  ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/9133737.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"new-car-market-fell-3-last-month","story":"Some , new cars were registered in November compared with , during the same month in , the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traderssaid.Registrations are down .% this year compared with the first  months of last year.Modest -.% decline for November UK new car market https:t.co PypyyKCko pic qDWnbvNYmdash SMMTDecember , SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said: ldquoModel and regulatory changes combined with falling consumer confidence conspired to affect supply and demand in November.ldquoThe good news is that as supply constraints ease, and new exciting models come on sale in the months ahead, buyers can look forward to a wide choice of cutting-edge petrol, diesel and electried cars.Sales of petrol models increased by .% last month, while diesels fell .%.Demand for alternatively fuelled vehicles such as hybrids and pure electrics increased by .% to take a market share of .%.Fleet and private registrations fell by .% and .% respectively last month, while business sales rose .%.Mr Hawes added: ldquoItrsquos now critical that a Brexit deal is secured to boost consumer confidence and provide a stimulus to the new car market as we enter the new year."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/9135481.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"edinburgh-trams-festive-strike-called-off-after-deal-reached","story":"The agreement with Unite ldquooverhauls the companyrsquossickness and capability policies.The union held a ballot which overwhelmingly backed the industrial action, in a row over alleged hostile management from Edinburgh Tram bosses.Regional officer Lyn Turner said:ldquoOur members are satisfied that the company has listened to their concerns and has agreed to change practices which will halt strike action.ldquoThis is the best outcome possible for all those involved.ldquoEdinburghrsquos citizens and tourists will be relieved to hear that fruitful talks have led to the withdrawal of strike action.ldquoAn agreement has been reached through positive consultation and negotiation rather than hard-nosed posturing.ldquoEdinburgh Trams must be under no illusion about the strength and resolve of our members who deserve to be treated fairly and with dignity and respect.The strike had been due to take place in the ldquorun-up to Christmas and last until the end of the year.Almost % of Unite members favoured industrialaction, with an % turnout for the ballot."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/9135571.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"brexit-anxiety-saps-momentum-from-service-sector","story":"The closely watched IHS Markit CIPS UK services purchasing managersrsquo indexshowed a reading of . last month.This was lower than the . recorded in October and below the . reading economists were expecting.

Within the next two years that will rise to  for everybody, with both the Labour and Coalition governments agreeing down the years that such changes are necessary to help deal with the burden of an ageing population.The arguments in favour of the move are sound. When the first state pension was introduced over a century ago, the cost of providing it was relatively small, with just one in four people living long enough to receive it and those that did generally only surviving a further nine years once theyrsquod started to draw it. Fast forward to  and le expectancy is so high that women in particular can easily expect to live at least  years in retirement, with the cost of providing the state pension expected to balloon from pound billion a year at the moment to poundbn in the s. As the bill for state pensions is met out of current year taxation, the intergenerational impact of that will be immense. Anything that can reduce that burden while also removing a rare historical inequality that favoured women over men is to be welcomed.Yet while the change will affect all working women in the long run, it is only those born in the s that are really feeling its impact. Indeed, while phasing was deemed the fairest way to effect the increase to , it has meant that while a woman born in April  could retire at ,she had been born three years later she would have had to wait until she was . Not only that, but with legislation passed in  speeding up the rate at which equalisation was achieved while also raising the overall state pension age to , a woman born in December  has seen her own retirement date sht first from December  to September  and then on to December .No wonder the affected women are irate, with campaign groups such as Women Against State Pension Inequalityand Backto accusing the Government of robbing them of their retirement dues. Yet while Backto last week won the right to challenge how the Government handled the increases in the courts, it seems unlikely that they will achieve their ultimate goal of having the pension-age increases reversed.Nor should they, particularly when the arguments being put forward by the women are taken into account. While at first the s women claimed their pension age should not be raised because they had not been given adequate time to prepare for the change, more recently they have argued that everything from career breaks to pay inequality make them entitled to earlier and longer payments than men.Their points about historical inequalities are are certainly valid. Thanks to huge societal shts in the past few decades we are getting to a position where women - and men - can just about have it all. Indeed, with men taking on an ever-greater share of household responsibilities, women have been freed up to pursue their career ambitions and that in turn has enabled men to enjoy a better work-le balance. That is to everyonersquos benefit.Yet, as gender pay gap statistics show, the near-equality that so many of us enjoy in the home is not being reflected in the workplace, with men continuing to dominate the most lucrative senior positions while women in general continue to fill lower-paid ones. Not only does that put women at a financial disadvantage when it comes to saving for their own retirements, it also means their careers suffer when there is a child or elderly relative to be cared for: regardless of how committed we are to achieving gender equality, household economics will almost always dictate that the lower salary is the one worth being partly sacriced. That in turn reduces the amount that women can channel into a private or workplace pension, exacerbating the long-term gender pay gap and reinforcing gender stereotypes in the process.But these are problems that affect women entering the workforce just as much as those preparing to leave it and, unless something drastic is done - and fast - they will inevitably go on to impact the working lives of the girls yet to begin their working lives too. Crucially, these are not problems that the state pension - a benefit designed to provide everyone with the same foundation income in retirement, regardless of their other means - can, or should, be used to solve.Yes, the Government has a role to play in helping eradicate inequality, and it must be held to account for that.

Amendments have been tabled by two Labour MPs to extend the time for debate.- What are they debating The Withdrawal Agreement negotiated by the Government, which outlines the terms on which the UK will leave the EU and the desired future relationship. MPs are being asked to approve this by supporting a motion tabled by the Prime Minister.- Can MPs change what has been put forward Yes. Speaker John Bercow can select up to six amendments which MPs can then vote on.- What are the amendments Various amendments have been tabled. Labours official proposal would decline to approve Mrs Mays Brexit deal and explains this is because it fails to provide for a permanent UK-EU customs union and \"strong\" single market deal. It also voices concerns over Northern Ireland.Labours amendment also outlines that MPs will \"pursue every option\" that prevents the UK leaving the EU on the terms of Mrs Mays deal or leaving without a deal.Tory and Labour backbenchers have also tabled an amendment which seeks to reject Mrs Mays deal while also avoiding a no-deal Brexit.- What will happen with the votes Its hard to say. Some  Conservative MPs have said publicly they will vote against Mrs Mays deal,  have said they will not vote in favour and more than  have said they are unhappy with it.With Mrs Mays minority government allies the DUP also expressing their own concerns, the chance of the deal being approved with a simple majority of  of the  MPs eligible to vote is highly unlikely.Any amendment would need to appeal to a wide enough group of MPs to receive the required votes to be successful. Abstentions are likely on all votes.- How does the debate work Ministers are expected to open and close each day, with the Opposition frontbench also having their say. MPs will be chosen by the Speaker to make speeches although their seniority - including positions previously held in government - usually influences the running order. A time limit is likely on backbench speeches, with MPs fearing it could be as low as four minutes.It is the decision of the MP speaking on whether they accept interventions from others during their speech.- What does a vote involve MPs walk through ision lobbies - in essence, rooms either side of the Commons chamber known as the ayes and noes. They have eight minutes to reach the ision lobbies when a vote is called.They register their vote on a tablet device and the result is usually announced within  minutes of the vote being called.If there is more than one vote, MPs tend to wait in the chamber and the process is repeated.- What about the House of Lords They will spend three days debating the deal on December ,  and ."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-to-publish-full-legal-advice-on-brexit-deal-after-commons-defeat","story":"The Prime Minister caved in moments after MPs decided her ministers were in \"contempt\" of Parliament.A motion tabled by Labour, the SNP, other opposition parties and the DUP which argued ministers were in contempt due to their failure to fully publish advice given to Cabinet by Attorney General Geoffrey Cox was approved by  votes to , a majority of .It also ordered the \"immediate publication\" of the legal advice.Andrea Leadsom, the Commons Leader, said: \"Weve tested the opinion of the House twice on this very serious subject.\"Weve listened carefully and in light of the expressed will of the House we will publish the final and full advice provided by the Attorney General to Cabinet but recognising the very serious constitutional issues this raises I have referred the matter to the Privileges Committee to consider the implications of the humble address.\"MPs had earlier rejected a Government amendment to the motion, which Labour argued sought to kick the issue into the \"long grass\" until after the vote on the Brexit deal, by  votes to , a majority of just four.This amendment asked for the Privileges Committee to question whether ministers were in contempt of Parliament over the issue and could have delayed any publication of the advice."},{"url":null,"title":"msps-call-for-a-better-alternative-as-they-prepare-to-reject-draft-brexit-deal","story":"The Greens, Labour, LibDems and SNP will unite in a symbolic vote that rejects both Theresarsquos May deal and a No Deal, and calls for an unnamed ldquobetter alternative.:David Mundell: Nicola Sturgeon could go on post-Brexit trade missions with Theresa MayHowever the Tories will say theirs is the only party backing the UK-wide result of the EU referendum, and claim the vote is being used to promote independence.Tory MSP Adam Tomkins said: ldquoThe Scottish Conservatives will, alone, oppose the motion set out by the SNP, Labour, Lib Dems and Greens today.ldquoWe know what the SNP and Greens are trying to do with this needless debate - they want to use it to manufacture yet more grievance as part of their push for a second independence referendum.ldquoThat Labour and the Liberal Democrats have once again fallen into line with the nationalists is disappointing but hardly surprising.ldquoWillie Rennie and Richard Leonard are Nicola Sturgeonrsquos little helpers.SNP Constitutional Relations Secretary Michael Russell said the vote was a \"historic opportunity\" for MSPs to show united opposition to Mrs Mays deal and No Deal.He said: \"The UK Governments own analysis, as well as the detailed assessment from the Scottish Government, shows why the draft Brexit deal is unacceptable - it would make us poorer while extending uncertainty.\"It would take Scotland out of the EU against our will, removing us from the Customs Union and the European Single Market of m people - eight times larger than the UK market alone - and place Scotland at a serious competitive disadvantage with Northern Ireland.\"Iwelcome the cooperation we have seen so far in the Scottish Parliament.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned. David calls himself a jazz film-maker and doesnt really like to spend too much time planning it all out. Its very much part of his style.\"Jims mother, Beryl, still lives in Thurso and said she is \"immensely proud\" of her sons achievements.Wednesday  Dec  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"December ,  at : amA draft strategy which will underpin the development of mental health services in Orkney is expected to be in place by summer .

Golspie is operational   three days a week.\"The writer states that the letter represents the feelings of paramedics and technicians in Easter Ross, and they are calling for six more staff to make Alness and Tain   and ldquogive the residents of Easter Ross a fighting chance in their hour of need\".The Scottish Ambulance Service hit back however. A spokesman said: ldquoThe claims are untrue. We have ambulances working a   sht at Dingwall, Golspie, Lairg, Wick and Thurso ndash a crew is also available at either Tain or Alness stations and often both at the same time, depending on sht patterns.ldquoPatients in this part of Scotland can also rely on the air ambulance helicopter, a team of emergency response doctors based in Tain, Dornoch and Dingwall, and our teams of community first responders to provide an emergency response within a matter of minutes.ldquoWe closely and continuously monitor our staffing levels, through our demand and capacity review, to ensure we can provide safe patient care in all parts of Scotland and continue to invest in our workforce.Contacted for comment, Highlands and Islands Labour MSP Rhoda Grant said: ldquoStaff have raised concerns with me which I in turn have raised with the ambulance service. I believe that we do require more ambulance resources throughout the Highlands and Islands.ldquoCrews have to travel long distances to transfer patients and with specialist services becoming more centralised that will only increase.ldquoIt is right that crews who are fatigued sign off and ideally we should have more stations covered without the use of on call staff, who are in greater danger of becoming fatiguedthey have already undertaken a long transfer.ldquoI know from SAS that they are using Inverness crews to do some of these transfers where that is clinically safe.ldquoObviously in an emergency the nearest crew must respond.

It is best not to talk about the creatures of the night, and how we engage with them, other than with one’s psychoanalyst and, at a push, one’s more tolerant friends. The absurd world of dreams is neither here nor there – which is why the memory of our dreams fades very fast. Of course, there are exceptions. The dream recounted by Freud’s Wolf Man still makes for entertaining reading, and any dream we have of seven fat cows and seven thin ones should be perhaps be mentioned – just in case. But, in general, dreams are a private inconsequential business best kept to oneself.So, it is with considerable hesitation that I mention the dream I had last night. It is, I think, a dream that others might have had. It could be, in a Jungian sense, a manestation of some collective unconscious. That is perfectly possible, indeed probable. Having reiterated the self-denying ordinance of not revealing dreams, I hesitantly write about it here, knowing that not many people read my column anyway, and so this is virtually a private reflection.In my dream I was in Brussels. How did I know that  Well, the dream was preceded by one of those images that they use in film to signy location. A London scene is usually preceded by an image of Big Ben, or possibly Trafalgar Square. Passing double-decker buses may remind the dozier members of the audience of the milieu to which they are being transported. Paris is easy: the Efel Tower is spotted in the distance and there is French accordion music. But Brussels  In my dream there was a large road sign that said Bruxelles. That made the location of what followed quite clear.It being a continental dream, there was a pavement café. I looked for a table, but could find none and was about to turn around when the waiter summoned me to offer a seat at a table where a large woman in a voluminous blue dress was already seated. In the normal – or the normally abnormal – dream, Freudians would unhesitatingly tell you that this figure is your mother. Of course it is. Except in my dream it became immediately clear that she was in fact Europa, we of no less a personage than Zeus. We do not hear much from Europa these days, but she is there, deep in our mythic consciousness, often riding on a white bull. Every so often she surfaces.: Alexander McCall Smith: Should there be second referendums on Brexit and independence Europa was very welcoming, and offered to buy me a cup of coffee. I asked for decaffeinated and she said that this would be perfectly possible. I should not think of her as a threat, she said. If you want decaffeinated coffee, you can have it. But then she added, “But you must have coffee.”I was a bit taken aback by this. Could one not sit at her table and not drink coffee  No, she said. That is not possible. That is a fundamental demand. My coffee arrived. It was delicious. “There,” she said. “See.”Now I must add another detail. It is not important, but it did give texture to the dream. Dreams with texture are generally better than those without. In this case, the texture-conferring detail was this: Europa looked terribly like Mrs Merkel! That, I think, is purely co-incidental, and would be of no interest even to the most symbol-sensitive dream analyst. There are plenty of women who look like Mrs Merkel. Some people even have mothers who look like her. As I sat there with Europa, I felt a certain sense of embarrassment creep over me.“I must say how sorry I am about all this business,” I said. “You do know, don’t you, that Scotland behaved dferently ”She nodded. “I’ve heard as much,” she said.“And I wouldn’t want you to think that Scots voted that way largely because we rather enjoy voting the opposite way from that in which the Government in Westminster tells us to vote.”Europa smiled. “Of course not!” And then added, “Perish the thought!”“I liked the coffee,” I said.She smiled again. “Good. And please don’t feel in any way awkward. No damage done. Or not too much. You’re going to vote again, you see.”I thought I should clary the situation. “You mean a general election ”“Oh no,” said Europa. “Another referendum. You’ll vote again and voilà, a dferent result. You can’t leave, you see. Look at history. The consolidation of states prevents that. Germany used to be a whole lot of little entities, as did Italy, France and so on. Look what happened to the kingdom of my son, Minos. Existing countries become passé. That’s what’s happening here, you know. We are witnessing the creation of a new state. And every such creation involves birth pangs, and one or two protests. We’re feeling those at present, but everything will be all right. Reason will prevail.”“Are you sure ” I asked. “Perfectly,” she said. “You’ll see.”I have no idea of the meaning of this dream. Even as I write about it, its memory fades. I mentioned it, though, to a friend.

He’s already made the move from playing rugby to acting with a role in the latest season of Outlander, and now he’s moving ahead of the pack with a new Bollywood film, Shamshera. Right now he’s on the phone minutes after his flight from Mumbai lands, catching a connection to Scotland where he is due for a bout of fight training for his latest role.“SorryI sound a bit tired and jetlagged.” He doesn’t, in fact. He sounds on a high after a week of meetings and rehearsals for the action adventure film, walking and talking  to the dozen in his warm Paisley tones as he cuts a swathe through the airport, all sculpted beard, Matchless leather jacket and jeans. In four short years, he’s made the move from working as a sports consultant to acting in films, this latest being made by Bollywood giants Yash Raj Films. Directed by Karan Malhotra, Shamshera stars Ranbir Kapoor, Sanjay Dutt and Vaani Kapoor as well as McGinlay playing the lead villain.“It’s been a bit of a whirlwind in Mumbai,” he says. “I’ve never been there before and I’m just getting used to it. I’m back for a week here, then back to India and we’re filming until July.”We’ll catch him while we can, when he’s back for a bit of dreich weather to cool him down after the heat of India.“I like dreich-ness,” he says, “the fresh air.” He’s upbeat and positive and why wouldn’t he be  He’s running with the ball, taking his chances without getting ahead of himself. With his muscular physique he’s action hero villain material and has played both so far, honing his sword skills and horsemanship as well as his acting. Guy Ritchie cast him as good guy Sir Percival in last year’s King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, which starred Jude Law and Charlie Hunnam. Then he nailed lead villain Aldred in Knightfall, a historical drama about the Knights Templar on the History Channel alongside Tom Cullen. He packs a punch too in the season two opener of the Edinburgh-filmed BBC  student thriller Clique, before playing a baddie again in Outlander. “I play a horrible guy called MacNeil and the army of Outlander fans on Twitter have been at me over it,” he laughs. “No, there’s been a lot of positive feedback. I never really thought I was gonna play villains because I always loved watching Superman and James Bond and I thought action hero roles were for me. And I do still want to do those, but the latest three have been villains, so it’s nice to do that too.“This is my first Bollywood film and I didn’t know much about it,” he says. “But I do now. Bollywood just gets bigger and bigger and bigger. It was daunting, but it’s been amazing. I’ve worked on big sets – King Arthur and Outlander were massive – but I’ve been blown away by this. There are  people on the sets in India just now, building forts, castles, docks, caves, it’s incredible.” McGinlay didn’t expect to break into the Bollywood market, but after Guy Ritchie finished King Arthur, he moved on to making Aladdin, using a lot of Bollywood actors and the same casting director who was working on Shamshera.“There was that initial connection: it’s a small world,” says McGinlay, who knows to take his chances when he can, and put in the hard work when he is given an opportunity. “I’m playing a British soldier and I’ve been doing screen tests, rehearsals, stunt work with horses and fitness and soldier training. “And I’m doing some fight training now with Seoras Wallace who did the fight choreography on Braveheart, Gladiator and Highlander. I’m also working with my friend Roger Gracie Gomes, who is a Brazilian jiu-jitsu fighter. So it’s a real adrenalin rush movie, it’s going to be fun.”But McGinlay is not all action and no words – in fact he’s learning Hindi for the part, something a bit dferent to go alongside his swashbuckling skill set.“I speak a little bit of Hindi in this so I’ve been doing intensive language training. I would never have thought I would be learning another language for a movie any time soon, but I’m really excited about the challenge and enjoying it so far.” Not that he’s been out and about in the sprawl of Mumbai to practise his vocabulary. With a schedule that consists of am pick-ups and full studio days of rehearsals, Hindi training, screen tests, costume fittings and horse riding, he’s hardly been out of the studio.“I’ve only been out to go to meetings and do muay thai training at Soho House, although that has phenomenal views of the beach! Once we start shooting I’ll be there for a long time, so maybe I’ll get to walk along it.” Among the on-set discussions has been the question of McGinlay’s appearance, from hair colour to moustache, beard or no beard. “They’re trying dferent looks, dferent hair colouring, moustache, no moustache. We’ll see. If a director wants something, I give it a go, whether it’s having a moustache or dferent hair colour or having to go skinny or bulk up, learn a language… The exciting thing for me is the challenge of trying to become the character.”The grooming issue is something McGinlay has been brushing up on since he started acting and did a bit of modelling too. He picked up Breakthrough Star of the Year at the  Scottish Style Awards and was named as British GQ Rising Star last year, requiring him to get red carpet ready.“It’s all a bit of a change for me from shorts, T-shirts and trainers, which is what I wore before. It’s a bit of a learning curve,” he laughs.Shamshera won’t be released until , but McGinlay is on our screens at the moment in Outlander, season four of the Starz and Amazon Prime International hit which features Sam Heughan and Caitriona Balfe. Based on Diana Gabaldon’s historical time travel novels following the adventures of Jacobite Highlander Jamie Fraser and Second World War nurse Claire Randall, the new series sees them building a le in th century America. It’s a time of slavery and colonisers encountering Native Americans, with Scotland doubling as North Carolina. McGinlay plays Andrew MacNeil, a Scot who leads a racist mob. “He’s not a nice guy – a horrible character and a horrible situation. I thought Outlander dealt with the slavery issue very well, and these issues should be raised. It was a tough episode to film and it hit home how bad that situation was. There were a couple of people crying on set, and you do feel emotion. The hairs were standing up on the back of my neck.“Because there’s a massive Outlander fan base you want to do these characters justice, but I was such a small part of this beast of a machine that is Outlander. It was amazing to be part of it.”McGinlay was pleased to be involved not least because he sees the “Outlander effect” as building momentum for the establishment of a Scottish film studio. “Outlander is sparking ripples throughout Scotland. You see it at the Baftas, in the press, all the talk of building a film studio. It would be a massive positive because there are so many talented, passionate people in the industry here who are just dying to get in there – we could do some good stuff.”Now  and based in London, McGinlay is modest about his success so far, although ambitious to make the most of the opportunities that come his way.“I’m still new to acting and I’m learning all the time,” he says. “I wasn’t sure how some actors might take it, because I’m not trained in acting and I’ve obviously moved quite quickly within the last two and a half years. It’s early stages…” One of the actors whose path he has crossed is fellow Paisley Buddy Gerry Butler, who he first met at a film festival last year in Ischia, Italy. “I’ve only met him two or three times, so don’t know him well, but he’s been really kind, given me some good advice and introduced me to a couple of people. And obviously the guy’s from Paisley, and doing really, really well, has an amazing career.”At one time McGinlay was destined for a rugby career, playing for the national under-s team in the World Cup, but was forced out by injury in . “I dislocated my shoulder playing in a World Cup in Italy and had two operations. I could probably have come back and played as it doesn’t cause me any hassle now. I liked the game, but I probably didn’t love it enough.” Determined to stay in sport, McGinlay did a sports science and physiology degree at the University of Stirling and after graduating started working with professional athletes. Setting up his own consultancy, he worked with professional footballers and rugby players, focusing on general fitness and doing sports massage. He trained athletes for the  Delhi,  London and  Commonwealth Games, working with the hockey, badminton, swimming, cycling, weightlting teams. “Then they took the ones I was working with to make an advert for the Games and said the weightlter was a little bit too short, would I step in  Why not  I had to pull on this tiny one-piece weightlting outfit and was out in the cold by the Squinty Bridge [in Glasgow] with everyone looking, thinking, ‘What is this idiot doing, lting a bar above his head’, doing a clean jerk.” He laughs. “Anyway, the ad came out and randomly a director saw it and I got a lead role in a short film that randomly won best thriller in LA and Calgary so I went out for the premiere. It wasn’t Hollywood or anything, but it was a great experience and I hadn’t done anything like that before. I loved it.” Back home in Glasgow, McGinlay signed up with an extras agency and did a couple of adverts, one being for the Haig Club whisky, starring the brand collaborator David Beckham and the stunning Scottish landscape, directed by Guy Ritchie. “It was just five days’ shooting, but I got to know Guy quite well and that was a turning point for me. I was standing in Glencoe looking down at Guy behind the monitor and [cinematographer] John Mathieson behind the camera and [film pilot] Marc Wolff taking shots of Beckham riding his motorbike up Glencoe, and that was it for me. So many great movies were made there, like Skyfall, and it felt so cinematic, although it was an advert. I decided: when I come off this I’m gonna go back, quit my job, move to London at least give it a go. If it doesn’t work out, then, you know, it’s not worked out…”But it did work out: within four months McGinlay had an agent, auditioned for Ritchie’s King Arthur and landed the part of Sir Percival. “It was very hard to give up my job because it was going well and I did love it, but I can always go back. I wanted to keep going with the wave, having done the advert, met Guy, wanted to keep the pace going and move to London. So that was another turning point: I moved down and did King Arthur, then got Knightfall.” With Chris Pine famously watching Scottish rugby captains on YouTube to prepare for his role of Robert the Bruce in Outlaw King, McGinlay has the advantage, being the real McGinlay and able to jink the middle man. For him, the worlds of rugby and acting are not so far apart. “There are similarities, things like bulking up and getting fit and ‘in the zone’. How I prepared in the dressing room as a rugby player is still how I build up for a fight scene or any kind of fight choreography. You pump yourself up for it. Outlander was the same, marching at the head of a mob, you’ve got to get yourself into a zone and turn yourself into a dferent character. “Running out onto a sports field you have to play a character a bit as well. You’ve got to make that last tackle, be aggressive, stand up for yourself. Rugby’s about teamwork and it’s the same in acting – costume, hair, make-up, director, producer, writer, everyone’s trying to do their best.”As someone who never seems to stand stillit’s time for McGinlay to catch his next flight. “I’m not in any way there or where I want to be yet. It’s very early stages. I’m still massively learning. I’ve had a few good short film roles, three good roles in three big productions so far and this is the fourth one now, so it’s going well, but I’m still way, way short of where I want to be. “I’ve not made it or anything. I still have a long, long way to go and I’m very ambitious. If I quit my job to move into this, then I’m not in it for a laugh, I’m in it to go as far as I can.” Craig McGinlay can currently be seen in Season  of Outlander, available to watch now on Amazon Prime.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

leisure pool since the end of August when access ended because of a funding wrangle.Macdonald Hotels chairman Donald Macdonald and deputy chairman Gordon Fraser met with the councils new chief

November, in which Councillor Ian Cockburn put forward a motion whereby the local authority would determinefunds were available for design work to begin on replacement options to the bypass. This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean.

The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady. He took part in many operations during the Tan War and was arrested and imprisoned in England. On hishe took the Republican side in the Civil War and saw action against the Free Staters.John James Kelly was a man of the left - he spoke often to his son about Lenin. In the s and s, because of his Republican views, he found it dficult to make a living but he remained in the IRA and was elected to its Executive Council. He was  years old when he died.CharlieMcCafferty was OC of the IRAs st Tir Conaill Battalionat the time of his death. He was born in  and he too joined the IRA at a young age. In  he was arrested and sentenced to six months in Derry Prison for possession of firearms. He worked as a barge loader on the Strabane-Derry Canal and he was known as a quiet man with an abiding interest in the history and folklore of his area.Jimmy Joe Reynolds was from Leitrim. He was the OC in that county and had been for a time OC of Britain. He had been sent to Donegal as the representative of the IRAs General Headquarters Staff and it was he who transported the bombs - three in all - to Stranamuck.Jimmy Joe had been active in the IRA for many years. In  he was charged along with six other men, including his twin brother, John Joseph, with the assassination of a rack-renting landlord, More OFarrell, at Edgeworthstown, Co Longford. After two trials the case was dismissed and there were bonfires for fty miles around to celebrate their escape from the Free State hangman.All three Volunteers received huge funerals with full IRA honours. They were buried eighty years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27501  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna“We already have all-island teams that demonstrate that we can achieve great success when we work on an all-island basis.

Mr Junk says he has no problem selling the book and is not hostile towards the DUP, but feels its right to take a stand against the partys stance on same-sex marriage.Critics on social media have accused him of a publicity stunt to promote his funding campaign, but he said: \"Theres much more to it. The LGBT thing is a personal issue for me because it affected someone dear to me.\"Suggestions that this is a publicity stunt are understandable, but its about getting this story back into the news and people talking about it.\"I want there to be a discourse and hopefully an accommodation where LGBT people are not discriminated against.\"Asked how this dfered from the Ashers case, he said: \"First of all, Ashers existed and this is hypothetical.\"Its not about boosting our crowdfunding - the press coverage hasnt moved it by one digit at all.\"If that was the intention, then its a pretty bad job on my part.\"Mr Junk also alleged that in an area of \"serious blight\", DUP representatives were a rare sight.\"The DUP deputy leader, Nigel Dodds, has his office about  metres down the road and Ive never seen them out apart from election time,\" he said. \"The community needs this, not just leaflets through their door.\"Pointing to several empty fields surrounding the shop, he said that delays in building much-needed new housing were another concern.Any future ban on the DUP using his proposed cafe would be ltedthe party allowed its members a free vote on same-sex marriage, he continued.\"I think theres lots of people in the DUP who have no issue on LGBT and same-sex issues,\" he said. \"This is about the POC , not the DUP. If they would give a free vote to their members, they would be welcome to the cafe.\"Since opening in , he said the premises has become as much an advice centre as a book shop, adding that the frustration he hears from local residents has made him consider running in the local council elections next year.The DUP was contacted for a response, but declined to comment. However, one of its MLAs, Christopher Stalford, said on Twitter: \"Apparently as a DUP elected representative Ive been banned from a bookshop cafe. The fact that the bookshopis yet to actually open and the people behind it are crowdfunding is beside the fact.\"I wonder would the owners of this non-existent shop also ban books they dont like \"Ulster Unionist councillor Doug Beattie also opposed the potential DUP ban, describing it in a Twitter post as \"counterproductive\".So far £ of the £, cafe target has been raised, and Mr Junk concluded thatit does open, \"Nigel Dodds aint going to be cutting the ribbon\"."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit would uk membership of the eea work","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But in the wake of the High Court ruling that senior civil servants did not have to power to approve the controversial the Arc  waste incinerator, DfI opted not to mount a defence.It meant vesting orders and the direction to start the project issued in November  were no longer valid.But the DfI confirmed yesterday that it would retrace its steps and use the new legislative powers introduced by Parliament in October to unblock the logjam created by the collapse of the Stormont Executive. In a statement, the DfI said that, subject to \"further issues that emerge\", construction on the initial phase of the scheme between Newbuildings in Londonderry and Strabane in Co Tyrone \"could commence on site in late \".\"The A remains a very high priority for the department and it will now move immediately to carry out the necessary work to enable a fresh decision on the project to be taken during ,\" said a spokesperson.The DfI said that the re-run of the process would involve a six-week public consultation process as well as an addendum to the existing environmental statement.Construction Employers Federation managing director John Armstrong said the department had moved speedily.\"As this decision is, ultimately, tied to the passing of the Northern IrelandAct and its associated guidance, it is now critical that all government departments follow the lead of the DfI by seeking to utilise the powers of the new legislation to bring forward a range of capital works, both public and private sector, which are currently unable to progress for a iety of reasons,\" he said.\"It is also critical that we see consistency in application of the Act and its associated guidance by all government departments as it must, in the continued absence of ministers, be the means by which greater certainty can be applied to all levels of public sector construction works.\"Since September ,  people have died along the full stretch of the existing A road.

It has even been shared on Australian media. The lighting show will continue to run at pm, pm and pm every day until January  in effort to enhance community spirit and lure shoppers into the city.

Leafy plants have been carefully pruned to create an angelic atmosphere around the slimline tree, which has been beautully wrapped with thousands of tiny bulbs. Theyve even added wings of light and a halo to a carefully crafted tree as an angel looks out across the Co Tyrone town. Cookstown remains as impressive as ever with trees lining the longest and widest main street in Ireland.Elsewhere its the usual set-up, but not everyone has been left feeling the festive spirit - the Christmas tree in Castledawson has caused local residents to scowl at the scraggly structure which is tangled up in a few dozen lights and baubles. \"This sorry sight is a laughing stock around the town and beyond,\" one local man wrote on social media, and it follows last years spectacle which was also branded \"embarrassing\".

BelfastBrexit survey: Have your say and you could win a £ Amazon voucher UUP leader Robin Swann said his party was prepared to look at all the alternatives to Theresa Mays \"unacceptable\" current deal but he stressed that any solution must be \"UK-wide\".Sinn Fein said the DUP couldnt negotiate their own agreement and there already was a Brexit deal on the table. NI boss is called ‘Tory cow’ for May support Speaking to BBC Radio s Today programme yesterday, Mrs Foster said she would not support calls for a second Brexit referendum, as the UK had already voted to leave and \"we respect that\". Repeating the DUPs opposition to Mrs Mays deal, she urged the Prime Minister to \"not waste time\" on it and instead look for a better solution to the border question.She hinted thatthe current Withdrawal Agreement failed to get through the House of Commons, her party could be open to a Norway plus style arrangement, where the whole of the UK stayed in the customs union until an agreement with the EU is reached on future trading relations. Would membership of the EEA work  Ms Foster said the DUPs \"one red line\" was to make sure Northern Ireland was not dferentiated from the rest of the UK in terms of customs and was \"not prescriptive\" about other potential options on the future relationship with the EU.But a Norway plus-style arrangement has been rejected by the TUV leader.Mr Allister told the Belfast : \"It would retain us fully within the EU single market, subject to all Brussels-made rules - adjudicated by the European Court of Justice - and maintain free movement of labour and require ongoing payments to the EU. That is not Brexit. Brexit: Ulster Farmers Union remain amenable to alternate Withdrawal Agreement proposal \"But for us it would be worse, because the Norway plus that is being talked about would additionally keep Northern Ireland in the customs territory of the EU - completing the repudiation of the Brexit that was voted for. Thus, the backstop would essentially still apply.\"Mr Allister continued: \"The core of the backstop is that Northern Ireland alone remains part of the customs territory of the EU.\"With the EU likely to only agree a Norway-style deal which had this add-on, it would leave us incarcerated in the EU in perpetuity.\"The UUP did not appear to rule out a Norway plus style arrangement. Mr Swann said: \"The Ulster Unionist Party cannot give our support to the Withdrawal Agreement and its disastrous backstop. However, we will look at every option and assess its merits - but the bottom line for the Ulster Unionist Party is that any solution must be UK-wide in its entirety.\"Sinn Fein MLA Mairtin O Muilleoir said: \"There already is a deal on the table - its not perfect but it avoids physical infrastructure on the border.\"The DUP cannot negotiate their own deal. Nor can they back a deal that isnt there.\"The EU has recognised that a unique solution is needed for the north because of our historical and geographical concerns. The backstop recognises that - that must be maintained.\"Mrs Foster told Radio  that Mrs Mays deal would see Northern Ireland \"erge off from the United Kingdom\" and she urged the Prime Minister to \"look for a better deal\" that \"takes back control of our money, of our borders and of our laws\".The DUP leader said: \"All the things that made us vote for Brexit are the things that are going to be imposed on Northern Ireland.\"Reiterating that the DUPs  MPs would not back the Withdrawal Agreement on December , Mrs Foster said it would create a \"huge democratic deficit\" in Northern Ireland.Mrs May yesterday rejected a suggestion that the failure to get a deal with the EU would see the UK stuck with the Northern Ireland backstop plan permanently.She was responding to Andrew Murrison, the Tory MP and chair of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, who compared it to a \"post-war pre-fab\".He said: \"Its sold as temporary, its built to last, and its likely to outlive us all.\"However, the PM dismissed his comments and told the House of Commons Liaison Committee it would only ever be a temporary solution.She added: \"Neither side thinks the backstop is a good place to be.\"Mrs May admitted that it would not be possible for the UK to unilaterally withdraw from it, though. But she said this was a guarantee to the people of Northern Ireland there would never be a hard border in place.Mrs May also rejected the claim that passing her Brexit deal in Parliament without the DUPs support would lead to the end of her partnership with Mrs Fosters party.\"Actually, the DUP have themselves said that the confidence-and-supply agreement remains in place,\" she stated.Mrs May refused to be drawn on what would happenMPs down the Withdrawal Agreement. But she insisted a second referendum was not an option as it could not be held before March ,  when Britain leaves the EU."},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh trams festive strike called off after deal reached","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The inexplicable scoring of severely disabled people has also caused considerable and understandable public anger.“As well as challenging the department on this situation, Sinn Féin is also calling for both the Public Services Ombudsman and the Auditor General to probe the way the assessments are being carried out because it is our view that the department and Capita are failing in their duty of care to vulnerable people.“A Sinn Féin delegation met with the Ombudsman  and had a positive discussion about the possibility of a unilateral investigation being launched.“We welcome the fact that the Ombudsman is now exploring the possibility of launching such an investigation because it is absolutely clear that the roll-out of PIP assessments needs to be probed and these cruel and unnecessary checks brought to an end.”"},{"url":null,"title":"u2 drummer bbc presenter join hosts celebrities campaign save","story":"Thousands of people, including high-profile celebrities such as Larry Mullen from U, have signed a petition aimed at preserving an ancient woodland in Derry.The petition was set-up by George Mclaughlin and Damien Martin of the Prehen Historical and Environmental Society with support from BBC presenter and conservationist, Chris Packham.He and around , others are adamant that planning approval should not be granted for any future development at the Prehen Woods site ‘ever again’.Protestors have fought against the development since  in order to preserve the ancient woodland and protect an endangered colony of red squirrels, along with other wildle for future generations.The four houses are situated adjacent to Prehen Woods but a road connecting the new development to Prehen Park had to be constructed which campaigners said resulted in the removal of ‘scores of trees’ from the ancient woodland.A petition was posted on Change.org to highlight the ‘anomalies’ throughout the planning process and ‘disregard’ shown towards the revocation order, Mr McLaughlin said.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshIt has garnered around , signatures thus far, including those from Chris Packham, wildle TV presenter and conservationist, actress Dame Judi Dench, Larry Mullen of U, James Nesbitt, creator of Derry Girls Lisa McGee and The Undertones.Chris Packham filmed in Derry recently and has taken a great interest in this campaign as well as the wider need to save ancient woodlands.In a statement, Mr Packam, pictured above with local campaigner George McLaughlin, said there had a ‘catastrophic failure’ in terms of accountability in relation to the plans.“This is not just about four houses and one beautul old wood full of bluebells and wonderful wildle,” he said, “this is about a catastrophic failure in the accountability of politicians, greed and idiotic short-termism. “We must preserve space, green space for the benefit of future generations, space which benefits our physical and mental health, space to ensure that we can retain the al ecosystems we rely upon to produce our food and other resources. “To progress here would spit in the face of democracy, tarnish the reputation of the council forever and ruin the sanctity of a precious part of our planet and set a precedent for a cascade of further abuses of power.”"},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOFxcXC8xMlxcXC8wNDE0MjQ0MVxcXC9DQ0kucG5nXCIsXCJ3aWR0aFwiOjY0NyxcImhlaWdodFwiOjM0MCxcImRlZmF1bHRcIjpcImh0dHBzOlxcXC9cXFwvd3d3LmRlcnJ5bm93LmNvbVxcXC9hc3NldHNcXFwvaVxcXC9uby1pbWFnZS5wbmc_dj0xXCJ9IiwiaGFzaCI6IjVjZWVjYmFlOWE2MGU1M2U5YjgxODU1NzcwNDhjNWU0YTY2NTE2YzAifQ==/cci.png","title":"voting now open final shortlist derrys 12 windows christmas","story":"Voting is now open for the annual  windows of Christmas competition where local businesses are recognised for the effort they put into their festive window displays.The competition, run by the City Centre Initiativehas now been whittled down to the  and voting is now open.They are -

Conor Kelly was the only signicant absentee, with Richard Reaney taking his place on the wing.Banbridge were without most of their Ulster contingent, fielding the team which had propelled them through the leagues over the past few seasons, and they will feel that they should have beaten a jittery home side.Defence dominated an attritional match and both sides were guilty of giving away penalties when in strong positions. Nelson kicked his side into the lead after five minutes, following a positive start, but Banbridge cranked up the pressure and had an excellent ten minute spell. They were held up over the line following some excellent driving play and continued to pile on the pressure, a charge down leading to a succession of m scrums. Despite some heroic defence, Banbridge scored when Stevie Irvine was driven over in the nd minute.Ballynahinch followed this with their best spell of the match, with excellent carrying from forwards and backs, pinning Banbridge in their own . When it seemed they had finally stretched the Bann defence to the limit, a knock-on gave the away side some respite.As lsquoHinch began to build another wave of attacks, scrum half Rhys OrsquoDonnell spotted a gap around the ruck in the centre of the pitch and ran under the posts untouched for an excellent try.Nelsonrsquos simple conversion made it -, but lsquoHinch failed to push on and there was more defending to before half-time. Banbridge missed a penalty just before the break and the home side turned round with a narrow three-point cushion.McPhillips replaced Hilton Gibbons at half-time and knocked over an excellent penalty early in the second half to stretch the lead to six points. However, Banbridge had already shown their intention to move the ball and they looked increasingly dangerous with ball in hand, especially from scrums.Centre Andy Morrison looked dangerous every time he received the ball and Banbridge upped the tempo with lsquoHinch looking increasingly nervous. A yellow card for number  Conall Boomer in the rd minute following a collapsed maul invited pressure and only sensational home defence with  men kept them out.The home try line was eventually breached in the th minute when Morrison went over following a missed tackle in midfield. The missed conversion gave Hinch a leline and despite more pressure form a superbly well drilled Banbridge team the final score remained -.

A motion on the issue will be tabled at next monthrsquos meeting of the local authority.The council chairman was presented with a consultancy report on the merits of the proposal and the minor costings of delivering the scheme which have not yet been made public.The delegation was led by Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright, who was joined by David Flinn, from the Ulster Ramblers Association.The report on extending the existing Quoile River walk into Rowallane was commissioned by the Downpatrick-based Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, which was represented at the meeting by Anthony Trainor.Also taking part was Peter Smyth from the Downpatrick Community Collective, a body which represents all community and residentsrsquo associations in the town. It is also supporting the proposed initiative.Cllr Enright described the off-road paths proposal as a ldquosimple, affordable and detailed plan to restore linkages lost in the s and s.He continued: ldquoIt has long been the desire of all political parties to restore the Ulster Way and reconnect Killyleagh, Delamont Country Park, Downpatrick, Castle Ward and Strangford.ldquoImplementing the reported does not require actual money at all, but simply the local council using its powers under the Countryside Order to remove some of the obstructions that have grown up in recent years.Cllr Enright said the network of paths would reconnect Delamont and Castle Ward with Downpatrick. He explained the route would require two or three short sections of boardwalk similar to those near the Belfast Road to reconnect paths or overcome boggy ground.ldquoAll this needs is a resolute approach by council management to reflect cross-party consensus over the priority of this project, he added.Cllr Murnin said the loss of official Ulster Way status in  for an area stretching from Killyleagh to Downpatrick and from Downpatrick to Strangford was a ldquohuge blow to East Down.He continued: ldquoSince then, local authority staff have intended to re-assert off-load links to recreate these vital routes, but this project has not been prioritised.ldquoWe can re-establish East Down as the centre of a network of off-road community trails that would be both regionally and nationally signicant. I will be lending my support to the cross-party motion in council to prioritise these three inter-linked routes.Mr Smyth said funding for the off-road paths study was obtained though the Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, with the project supported by the Downpatrickrsquos Collective which surveyed hundreds of users of existing pathways around Delamont and the Quoile River.He added: ldquoThere is clearly overwhelming public support for this proposal that would cost a small fraction of the money recently invested in providing so-called greenways in the Newry, Warrenpoint and South Armagh areas to link into the Cooley mountains..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Congratulations all round at Saintfield High School  ","story":"SIXTY years of providing outstanding education are being celebrated at Saintfield High School.The school proudly opened its doors in  as Saintfield Secondary Intermediate School with  pupils and five teachers.The school has seen many changes, including extensions and additions, the subjects offered to pupils, the ied members of staff and, of course, the generations of pupils.Miss Sarah-Lucy Hynds, principal, said the th anniversary was being marked ldquowith a real sense of pride in our past, and an excited and positive outlook for the future.She continued: ldquoIt is an absolute honour and privilege to lead such a thriving and active school community a school with a highly commended academic, pastoral, sporting and cultural history.The school has been instrumental in the development of the wider community during the last  years mdash in the citizens that it has produced and in the many and ied achievements of pupils, both past and present.Mr Johnston Young was appointed as the schoolrsquos first principal in .

When he was included in the play, he was absolutely lethal and too hot for Killough to handle.Alas, Killough were masters of their own downfall. They had the major share of possession throughout a feisty encounter, but were never going to be as ruthless as Celtic up front with too many chiefs in midfield and not enough Indians up front and any time they did threaten, goalkeeper Nathan Curran was there to deny them.Celtic started in a hurry and were - up after only four minutes. Stevie Galbraith, who led the line with distinction, linked up with McCoubrey out on the left before cutting inside Chris Fryer.He had only one thing on his mind as he entered the box and an angled right-footed curler, that seemed to take a bit of a deflection, beat Gerard Gormley all ends up.Killough tried desperately to get back on level terms and with seven minutes gone they went close when Fryer let loose from just outside the box. Curran did well to take the sting out of the shot and did even better to retrieve the loose ball ahead of the lurking Tony McIlhone.Two minutes later at the other end a McCoubrey cross was met at the back post by Sean McMahon, but he failed to get a good connection with his head and the chance was wasted.With  minutes gone the same combination dovetailed perfectly again, but McMahonrsquos cross hit the crossbar. McCoubrey was back in the thick of things minutes later when he had a shot well saved by Gormley, but Killough continued to threaten at the opposite end as well with McIlhone again being denied by Curran.Killough were starting to edge midfield and with  minutes gone Curran prevented Liam Graham from equalising after a tidy pass from Michael Burns. Just as Killough started to believe they could get back into the game, they shot themselves in the foot.As they dithered at the back, getting the ball forward, Celticrsquos pressing game bore fruit and McCoubrey took full advantage to race away and beat Gormley with a clinical strike.Four minutes into the second half McCoubrey made it - after Galbraith picked him out with a delightful pass that split Killough wide open.The exciting teenager could have added to his tally on a couple of occasions as Killough gamely tried to get back into contention, but he was out of luck with two cheeky efforts that went narrowly wide.McCoubrey eventually completed his hat-trick in the th minute when Celtic again caught Killough napping at the back and there was only going be one outcome when the talented youngster raced through to beat Gormley.Celtic Bhoys: Nathan Curran, Sean Megahey, Conor Doherty, Matthew Carson, Michael Rice, Jordan Curran, Jordan McCoubrey, Ricky Kerr, Stephen Galbraith, Sean McMahon, Chris Mullan, Subs: Terence Bell, Caolain Boyd, Andy Baggley.Killough: Gerard Gormley, Chris Fryer, Conor Black, Michael Burns, Colm Stranney, Kevin Groves, Liam Graham, Tony McIlhone, Ross Armstrong, Gareth George, Jack McLaughlin.

A comprehensive design scheme would also have to be worked up.NI Water officials have also confirmed Saintfield is one of a number of towns across the Province which requires signicant investment to upgrade the existing infrastructure to carter for current and future demand.Rowallane politicians fear the moratorium on new development in Saintfield could potentially be in place for two years and have urged senior NI Water officials to do all they can to expedite the work that is required. They say the current ban will not only have a major impact on residents and developers, but the townrsquos economy.NI Waterrsquos Stephen Blockwell confirmed to Newry, Mourne and Down councillors that the drainage study will not be completed until next December. He said the study will look at the causes of the current issues in Saintfield and outline solutions.Pointing to sewage spills at the Old Grand Jury Road, Mr Blockwell, NI Waterrsquos head of investment, said the study was part of NI Waterrsquos approach to wastewater capacity and described it as a tool ldquoto get timely solutions.Mr Blockwell continued: ldquoIn terms of the drainage plan we need to get the right analysis to come up with solutions and the model we are working on will be ready in December . It takes time to do this work and analysis and get the right solution. If there is available funding, we will be able to bring schemes forward.ldquoThere are under capacity issues across Northern Ireland in relation to wastewater treatment works but there are parts of the Saintfield area like Darragh Cross where development is not restricted.Mr Blockwell added: ldquoUnfortunately for some current residents in Saintfield when there is heavy rainfall, there is restricted toilet use. This is very unpleasant and we sympathise with them. We will work to ensure everything is in place to develop a solution to this issue.Rowallane councillors Billy Walker and Terry Andrews have urged officials to ensure that the study is not only completed on time, but that money to implement its ious recommendations is available. They argue it is not unrealistic to suggest that the development ban could be in place for up to two years.ldquoIt is very concerning that work on the study will not be completed for another  months with no guarantee that the money needed to provide a st century sewerage system in Saintfield will be available, said Cllr Walker.ldquoThis is a very serious issue and one that must be urgently addressed. The ban is impinging on the future development of one of this districtrsquos leading towns and we currently have situation during heavy rain that raw sewage is backing up into peoplersquos gardens.Cllr Walker said it was his understanding that Saintfield is one of  towns in Northern Ireland which requires major investment to upgrade sewage treatment plants and the sewerage network.He added: ldquoSaintfield must be at the top of NI Waterrsquos priority list and the money needed to upgrade the sewerage system must be available. Given that the study will only be completed next December, by the time it takes to draw up detailed designs and secure money to carry out improvements, the development ban could be in place for at least two more years. This is unacceptable.Cllr Andrews said Saintfieldrsquos existing sewerage system could not cope and there were major questions over the long term future of the townrsquos treatment plant.ldquoThe preparatory work to identy solutions must be completed as soon as possible and the money required to signicantly upgrade the system must be made available, he said.ldquoI believe a new treatment works is required, but it will take time to deliver such a strategic capital investment scheme. People in Saintfield are looking for answers to questions they have on the future development of the town. This is an extremely serious issue..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17218586.daffodils-group-the-perfect-way-to-kick-start-the-week/resources/images/9123726.jpg","title":"yacht club claim proposed new boathouse site by rnli would be a waste of donations","story":"Lough Erne Yacht Clubhas accused the RNLI of changing its mind over a proposed site for the building of a new boathouse and have claimed that the project would be a ldquowaste of donations.The LEYC has hosted the RNLI temporary boathouse on its site for the past  years but says that the proposed new site would ldquohave a detrimental effect on the club and sailing in the bay.Now, however, the RNLI has made a planning application for a new leboat station at Gublusk Bay and in a letter to members, seen by the Impartial Reporter, the LEYC has said that it will be objecting.In its letter, by Commodore John Carton, the LEYC has said that it is ldquodisappointed that the RNLI have decided to go ahead with their application to build a boathouse on the shore of Gublusk Bay.The letter goes on to say that the situation is ldquoespecially disappointing since the RNLI were originally given a site one mile away which would give them more visibility.In a statement the RNLI said: ldquoThe RNLI have submitted a planning application for the building of a new leboat station for Enniskillen RNLI, comprising a boathouse and associated facilities, including the erection of slipway, installation of holding tank, landscaping and associated site and access works on a site at Gublusk Bay. It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Photo: Stefan Rousseau PA WireHe said: “Over the next seven days can I urge the Brexit Secretary and the Prime Minister in the strongest possible terms to redouble their efforts to find a way to give real reassurance that we the United Kingdom in future could leave the Northern Irish backstop in the event that we have had to join it.”The member for Altrincham and Sale West added he was not alone among Conservative MPs in holding that opinion, adding: “Many of us are hoping to hear that reassurance, and are willing the Brexit Secretary and the Prime Minister well in the process.”Mr Brady’s comments came as Theresa May has made a last-ditch attempt to rally MPs behind her Brexit deal after suffering the historic humiliation of seeing her government found in contempt of Parliament.In dramatic scenes at Westminster, the government bowed to pressure to publish the “final and full” legal advice to Cabinet on the deal after MPs voted by  to  that its failure to do so amounted to contempt.The prime minister’s DUP allies — along with Tory MPs Philip Hollobone and Peter Bone — joined opposition parties in the unprecedented move.It is the first time in modern history that any government has been found in contempt and means the highly sensitive advice provided by Attorney General Geoffrey Cox will be published, in contravention of long-standing practice.Ministers are expected to set out today how this will be done.We would be happy with a general election, says DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds during key Brexit debateDundonald girl with epilepsy is first in UK to be prescribed medical cannabis Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The vote came shortly before Mrs May kicked off a five-day debate ahead of the December  “meaningful vote” with a speech lasting more than an hour in which she told MPs she had delivered “the very best deal for the British people” and backed it “with my whole heart”.Before the prime minister appeared at the despatch box, her government had gone down to defeat for the third time in an hour.MPs backed a move that could put Parliament in the driving seatthe Brexit deal is rejected on December  by giving the Commons the power to amend a motion that Mrs May would be required to make within the following  days to set out the government’s next steps.Some  Tory MPs — including former ministers Sir Michael Fallon, Damian Green and Sir Oliver Letwin — rebelled on the amendment tabled by ex-attorney general Dominic Grieve.This could open the door for the Commons to throw its weight behind a Norway-style soft Brexit or even a second EU referendum, though prominent Leave-backing MPs questioned whether any such vote would be binding on ministers.Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the finding of contempt was “a badge of shame” for the government, with “huge constitutional and political signicance”.“By treating Parliament with contempt, the government has proved it has lost its majority and the respect of the House,” Sir Keir said.“The prime minister can’t keep pushing Parliament away or avoiding responsible scrutiny.”Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable repeated calls for a second EU referendum, saying: “Theresa May’s majority has evaporated and the credibility of her deal is evaporating with it.”AskedMrs May still felt she could command a majority in the Commons for the crunch vote next Tuesday, a Downing Street source said: “Everybody knows the parliamentary arithmetic.“The fact is, during the course of this administration we have won the overwhelming majority of votes that have taken place on the floor of the House of Commons.”Opening debate on the deal she struck in Brussels last month, Mrs May warned: “Don’t imagine thatwe vote this down another deal is going to miraculously appear.“The alternative is uncertainty and risk - the risk Brexit could be stopped, the risk we could crash out with no deal.”She said it would not be in the “national interest” to block the Withdrawal Agreement, adding: “The only certainty would be uncertainty.”MPs’ decisions over the next week would “set the course our country takes for decades to come”, she said.Mrs May told them: “I promise you today this is the very best deal for the British people, I ask you to back it in the best interests of our constituents and our country.“And with my whole heart I commend this motion to the House.”In a speech repeatedly interrupted by MPs attacking her deal, the prime minister pledged to give Parliament and the devolved administrations a “greater and more formal role” in forthcoming negotiations with the EU over trade — but declined to say whether MPs would get a vote on that deal.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mrs May’s deal would “make this country worse off”.• Morning View, page JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy  Cookies Policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimage/1.7083089.1544001994!/image/image.jpg","title":"opinion","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to Johnston Press# Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Opinion   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Opinion Politics Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Offbeat News Politics Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Opinion      David Campbell: Pan nationalist front should help press for a trade deal with EUMichelle O#Neill#s comments on behalf of the new pan-nationalist front of Sinn Fein, SDLP, Alliance and Green Party that the Brexit backstop is the only way to protect the Belfast Agreement is abject nonsense.

.removeAttr  .html  .html.valThe DUP#s Westminster leader has said he would be #happy# to have another general election to prove the party has support in Northern Ireland for blocking the PM#s Brexit deal.Nigel Doddsreiterated his party’s opposition to the current proposals, saying in the House of Commons yesterday: “In terms of the views of the people of Northern Ireland I’m quite happy to put it to a test any time.DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds MP“We will happily go to the electorate and put our views to the peopleneeds be, and I’m quite certain we would be ed in greater numbers than today.”The comments were in response to independent MP Lady Sylvia Hernon , who said the pro-Brexit DUP does not represent the views of the majority in Northern Ireland.Mr Dodds added: “So I’m quite happy to take on the challenge that has been put down.”Mr Dodds also said it is not the job of a government minister to decide what is in the national interest, as Theresa May’s administration was held in contempt of Parliament for failing to publish its full legal advice on Brexit.The North Belfast MP was speaking during yesterday’s debate, after his party joined forces with Labour, Liberal Democrats and SNP MPs to force the government to disclose the Attorney General’s advice in full.While the DUP deputy leader praised Attorney General Geoffrey Cox for offering the “unnished truth” as he was grilled by MPs in the Commons on Monday, he added: “This does not fulfil the order that was passed by this House, which was for the final and full advise provided by the Attorney General to the Cabinet to be published.”Mr Dodds told MPs: “The government may not like the fact that this was passed by this House, but it can not simply wish it otherwise.“Surely this is one area where the government must respect the will of Parliament.”He said that one of the arguments against publishing the full advice – that it is protected by privilege - was “bogus”.“I have heard the argument that this is privileged, but of course in the lawyer-client relationship, privilege belongs to the client, not the person giving the advice. If the client waives that, then the lawyer is quite at liberty to disclose,” Mr Dodds said.“It is not the duty or the job for any government minister to decide the national interest, the House has decided what it wishes to do and it is not for a government minister to override that.”Gunned down in front of terried school kidsMPs need reassurance over ending the Irish backstop says powerful Tory MP in Brexit debate Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"He added that parts of the legal advice had already been leaked to the media by members of the Cabinet, so therefore MPs should be entitled to see it as well.DUP Brexit spokesperson Sammy Wilson said that government had “scored an own goal” by refusing to release the legal advice.The East Antrim MP told the Commons: “This secretive approach only confirms in people’s minds that there is something to hide.”try catch     .               ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A figure above  indicates growth.November saw the worst performance since July , when business sagged following the result of the referendum on Britainrsquos membership of the European Union. Excluding July , it was also the worst performance since February .The survey suggests that Brexit anxiety has weighed on business activity and sentiment with companies more risk averse when making spending and investment plans following reports that Britain could crash out of the EU with no deal.Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said: ldquoA sharp deterioration in service sector growth leaves the economy flatlining in November as Brexit concerns intensied. Measured across services, manufacturing and construction, the survey results suggest that the pace of economic growth has stalled.ldquoThe surveys are so far consistent with .% GDP growth in the fourth quarter, thanks to the expansion seen back in October, but growth momentum has since been lost and risks are clearly tilted to the downside.He warned that unless demand revives, a ldquoslide into economic decline at the turn of the year is a distinct possibility.ldquoBoth the slowdown in current business activity and the deterioration in business optimism were primarily caused by an intensication of anxieties over Brexit. Uncertainty in relation to the withdrawal agreement and the possibility of no deal was often reported to have caused companies and customers to cancel or postpone spending and investment decisions, Mr Williamson said.ldquoClarity in relation to Brexit arrangements is therefore urgently needed to help ensure the current stalling of growth does not translate into a downturn.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at EY Item Club, said overall, the purchasing managersrsquo surveys published in November point to UK economic activity struggling markedly in the fourth quarter and suggests that the Bank of England will hold off from another interest rate hike until after the UK leaves the EU in March..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Brexit anxiety saps momentum from service sector article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Burnt out houses remain un-cleared sitting beside those that are still inhabited creating an atmosphere of dereliction and a breeding ground for rats and other vermin. Walkaways between houses have not been cleaned and neither have communal car parking areas.“Houses are in a poor state of repair with garden fences rotting and broken and window frames that have not been upgraded and are beginning to rot. Where it is clear some of these homes are private dwellings the question needs to be askedthere is any form of grant available to those occupants andso what efforts have been made to ensure they know about them.A derelict part of Craigavon“Without a doubt Legahory Court and Burnside are some of the most deprived areas not only in Central Craigavon but throughout the whole of Upper Bann. Those that live there must feel that they have been forgotten by the authorities and dare I say it politicians. If this situation was in central Lurgan, Portadown or Banbridge there would be an outcry from local civic leaders and community groups that would enable change, yet Legahory Court and Burnside remain forgotten, derelict and in need of serious investment. “As more and more money is invested in Craigavon improving the wealth and lives of all those in the area through jobs and wellbeing it is important that the ink spot of investment reaches these deprived areas. In calling for an urgent meeting of those responsible for this area I want to see something that will fundamentally change this area in the medium to long term.”Kate Evans said: “I have never seen anywhere in the local area in such a bad state of repair as I did while walking around Legahory Court and Burnside. As a mother I would have real concern letting my daughter out to playI resided there and genuinely believe that the poor state of some of the homes leaves the places looking like a slum. Yet nomore than  meters away millions of pounds is being spent on infrastructure projectsto improve the aesthetics of central Craigavon, to help with health, wellbeing, job opportunities and a better standard of living for the whole area.”Parts of Craigavon are poorly maintained says UUP MLA Doug Beattie£.m boost to deal with winter ailments Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey. Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/les_1.jpg","title":"a word from the wise les mccracken","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business Name: Les McCracken Position: Managing director, McCue Crafted Fit How did you get to the position you are in today I’m a big believer in work ethic. When I was young,  or so, I had a summer job on a farm. I would have milked  cows, morning and night, in addition to general duties around the farm. I was probably working  hours a week at that time, plus cycling five miles back and forth. It has stood me in good stead throughout my le. If you apply yourself, you can do anything.What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  In short, people. They are the greatest assets to a company but they can also be the biggest challenge. I’ve been fortunate enough to build a fantastic team around me at McCue but that has taken time. I’ve been here over  years and we’ve organically grown over that period from  employees and a turnover of £, to  employees and £m. It is also worth noting that in our sector there is a lack of skilled people, when you train them up some leave, which is disappointing but you have to train them and hope they stay. More must be done to engender the younger generation in to these skilled jobs. Too many are still going aimlessly in to third level education not knowing what they want to do, whereas they can earn as you learn in a trade, and that is much needed across the manufacturing sector.How would you describe your management style  I like to think I have a good management style, most of the time I’m very easy going and I do believe in autonomy. I expect those with responsibility to be capable and willing to do their job to the highest of their ability. I also have an open door policy allowing anyone to come and discuss problems but please bring with you a solution too.This allows my team to complete projects around the world from Vienna to Milan to Stockholm. We’ve been very fortunate to work with great brands, both in retail and hospitality, and on some fantastic projects from Ten Trinity Square in London to Danske Bank in Belfast and around Northern Ireland.What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  Of course, who wouldn’t say things could be done dferently, and better  Nobody is perfect, there’s always room for improvement. If I was to work until I was  years old, I would still learn something new every day.Have you done it all on your own  No, of course not. Who does  After  years I’ve a fantastic team who are very competent and trustworthy. But it has taken hard work and graft to get here. Today is very dferent to  years ago and for me I chose the right path. Today, you can enter this sector via a trade, an apprenticeship or a university background it’s about the right fit and enjoying what you do.How would you like your business to be remembered  McCue Crafted Fit is bigger than I. It’s been going for  years and providing unquestionable quality work. Like Jimmy McCue, who set this company up, when I choose to go, I hope to be remembered as a good leader who left the company in the best possible shape. Thirty years is a long time to be managing director and I have seen many changes in skill base, technology from hand drawn floor plans to full colour D fully explosive plans. It certainly has been an interesting three decades or so. I’d also like to note that McCue weathered the recession very well. I took some strategic decisions in  and , which ensured we not only held our own, but grew as a company.What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you Be patient. Time will come.

And boss Brendan Mooney says it is “disappointing” that a political argument around Brexit is “over-shadowing” the business case, which is largely supportive of the withdrawal deal currently on the table. The company, which has it headquarters in Belfast, saw adjusted pre-tax profit rising % - from £.m to £.m, in the six months to the end of September. It says much of the increase is down to the expansion of its Workday business throughout Europe. It says “to support the continued expansion with our Workday-related business, in Europe we continue to grow from our recently established offices in Frankfurt and Copenhagen, alongside our existing offices in Amsterdam and Gdansk”. “In North America we continue to expand our presence in Boston and Atlanta and we will open an office in Toronto in the next few weeks.” Brendan Mooney, the firm’s chief executive, told Ulster Business “There is no single reason or new reason .” He said the firms government commercial work was still a very strong part of the business, with a move towards digitalisation. “In Workday, as it rolls out across the world, there is great demand for the service as well. “There is underlying geographical expansion and signicant revenue outside the UK – we are seeing growth across Europe.” The company has grown its workforce to , – up again on the previous year, and has continued to grow. Of that,  workers are based at its Belfast and Londonderry offices which Brendan says “are a very important part of our business, and that trend will continue”. On Brexit, from a company perspective, Brendan says the services it provides to government are “not linked to Brexit”. “For us, it doesn’t get impacted by the Brexit direction – we are pragmatic on that. “In terms of Northern Ireland, the reality is… conversations about a political impact, they are over-shadowing what businesses are talking about and that’s disappointing.” He said looking forward at the next five years, the rise in demand for areas such as machine learning could form a much bigger part of the business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/223.jpg","title":"lunns opening m rolex store in city","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by Ulster Business Luxury watch and jewellery business Lunn’s is opening a new £m Rolex store in Belfast city centre.

Earlier this year, it was announced that Queen’s Arcade would undergo a major £m facelt. Peter Lunn, chairman of Lunn’s Jewellers, said the decision by Rolex to open in Belfast is “a huge endorsement for the city”. “Rolex is one of the world’s true super-brands and to have their store on Donegall Place, the city’s main retail thoroughfare, is a major expression of confidence. The store will offer customers a truly immersive experience of the brand. “We are also very excited to be opening a fully accredited Rolex workshop, which will help owners to maintain the value and ensure the quality of their watches by having them serviced by skilled technicians on site at Queen’s Arcade. It represents a big investment in Rolex parts and machinery, but we believe it is an essential part of the authentic Rolex experience.” Richard de Leyser, managing director, Rolex UK, said: “I’m delighted that Lunn’s continues to invest in our partnership and excited at the prospect of expanding the Rolex offering in Queen’s Arcade. “The plans to extend the space dedicated to Rolex and provide a new and engaging customer experience will perfectly position Lunn’s to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing retail environment. “The contemporary space will complement the historic architecture of Queen’s Arcade and provide a fitting home for Rolex.  We are proud to partner Lunn’s in this new development which will further enhance the unrivalled service to our customers in Northern Ireland.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/chamber_1.jpg","title":"outline your alternative to brexit deal says ni chamber president","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew It’s now time for political leaders opposed to a draft withdrawal agreement on Brexit to “outline alternative proposals” as an overwhelming majority of Northern Ireland’s business community back the plans, an industry leader has said. Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”.

We are growing our EBITA from the £m average to about £m.”Pre-tax profits have cracked the £m mark in the last year, while turnover has soared by almost £m to £m.Nick says he turned his attention to attracting back some of the farmers which it has lost to other competitors.“At one point we had a billion litres of milk, now it’s around  million. We hadn’t been paying a particularly good milk price. “What ithad done is invested in itself quite heavily, and invested in the future, and had made a really brave strategic decision in , long before I came here, to get out of producing milk powders, and getting in to cheese and whey.“Now, that cost them £m to do that. That was really brave.“The first thing we did was get out to farmers, and explain to them what their business was.“We have paid a leading milk price, and that has brought genuine pride.“We needed to get into the business. The most fundamental change – it’s a people agenda. We were a very centralised business and all decisions came from the top, and went out.“Now, we have put the business into seven strategic business units and we are getting more adept with strategy, day-to-day, and developing people within the business to take ownership.”Nick says it’s about getting the right people into the business, and helping mentor and develop strong teams to ensure Dale Farm’s success.“We have spent a lot of money on additional people in the business. It’s not about numbers, it’s not about capacity, it’s about capability. We are really trying to find world-class people. gtHe said the firm will spend another £m on its people this year. Meanwhile, data and decision making is another area it’s expanding and developing. gt“We have a little bit of latency in the business, and I’m saying how do I get live information to those people ”That includes looking at new markets and products. Nick says the business had been focusing on the macro, and perhaps missed potential opportunities.“We have massive opportunities for growth,” he said. “The EBITA growth isn’t necessarily about growing your top-line, although it will grow a bit. We process  million litres of milk. Are you making sure you are making products which will give you the most profit from that – the answer to that is no.“We can switch categories and products, and we can make a whole lot more money with the  million litres. “It’s looking at consumer trends by getting out of commoditised type products and getting in to more value-added products. That’s about understanding your consumer.”He said the business has made “serious traction” in the last two years, as a company. As for growth in the future, with March  around the corner, Nick says it will continue “as long as there isn’t something mad and disruptive from Brexit”.“That could happen. A ‘no deal’ and no transition Brexit is mad and disruptive and changes everything. I don’t think people have really looked at it, and really understand what it means. We have looked at it, and it’s very challenging.”For Dale Farm, Nick’s Brexit concerns centre around staff and people – with around % of the workforce EU nationals.Nick says the company has struggled to get lorry drivers when milk supply is at its peak.But for Dale Farm, and other food processors, there is a concern over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says.“For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t.“It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate.“I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now.”“Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.”Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy output goes to the EU and the rest of the world. “In milk, milk keeps flowing. We can’t say to farmers ‘we can’t sell the product, can’t get the certicates, tell the cows to take a break for a few weeks’. It doesn’t happen.“I’m going to have to reassess... ‘how long can I survive not selling my % of dairy off the island ’“If there is a no-transition no-deal Brexit it will be really bad for business. Supply chains will be severely disputed and you’ll have a shortage of products everywhere.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sk_123.jpg","title":"more than  of business group members back brexit withdrawal deal","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s business community has overwhelming thrown its weight behind a withdrawal agreement on Brexit – with almost % of one major lobby group’s members in favour, it can be revealed.The CBI, Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce, Federation of Small Businesses and IoD are among the groups which have backed the deal on the table. Meanwhile, farming unions in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK have also issued their support for the deal.It would essentially provide a backstop, and create a deeper customs union between Northern Ireland the EU, along with a closer alignment in the single market.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI says that the agreement is “the only show in town.”He said a poll of its members showed .% of those who replied were in support.“This is the only show in town. The rules are clear – in order for the UK to move to the most productive discussion on what the future relationship will be, we need a withdrawal agreement. The options are the agreement, or no deal,” he told Ulster Business.“Business in Northern Ireland and agri-business have made it clear that no deal is not an option.”Other business groups backing the proposed agreement include the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI, Hospitality Ulster and the Freight Transport Association.Writing in the Belfast , Prime Minister Theresa May said Northern Ireland will thrive under the proposed Brexit deal, and its position as part of the UK “is guaranteed”.She said her agreement with Brussels “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future”, and moved to reassure unionists that “Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is guaranteed.“Under this deal the future is certainly bright for Northern Ireland.”On the backstop, Ms May said three things made it “an acceptable insurance policy”.She said the transition period could be extended instead of entering the backstop, regulations would be the same across all of the UK, and Northern Ireland would not be treated dferently.Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said:“The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before. This opportunity needs to be taken.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
