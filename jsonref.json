At the same time, the volume of disinformation from doctored photos to false rumours and hoax videos spreading online has grown at a worrying pace.In etymological terms, the word “viral” comes from the stem word “virus”. And the viral misinformation can be a danger in itself. Just think of the recent petrol bomb attacks on 5G phone masts because of a widely believed – but unfounded – link to coronavirus.There’s so much noise on social media that false theories are easily spread: whether that’s forwarding an email attachment containing a computer virus without reading it properly, or sharing a faked photo because you’re in a rush.The claim: “5G mobile phone towers emit radiation that attacks the immune system, thus affecting those vulnerable to the coronavirus.”The truth: There is no evidence that 5G weakens immune systems or is harmful to humans, with international radiation experts reminding us that Covid-19 has spread in many countries that don’t have the high-speed phone system, such as Iran. The cause of the disease is still unknown, but appears to have started in a Wuhan food market where wild animals were illegally traded.See also: Other false claims about the causes of coronavirus, such as eating bat soup a manmade bioweapon for population control and fortune cookies.If in doubt ... Don’t trust information on social media if you don’t know where it came from one video claimed new £20 notes show symbols of 5G towers, and dozens of phone masts have been vandalised, including one serving Birmingham’s NHS Nightingale hospital. If a cause is confirmed, it’ll appear in reports issued by the World Health Organization (WHO). Rather than trusting celebrities or influencers, try Googling the information to see whether trusted sources such as reputable news organisations like the BBC or the  have reported it.The claim: “Gargling water mixed with salt or vinegar can wipe out coronavirus.” Or so a post shared many times on email and WhatsApp tells us, often accompanied with information that “holding your breath for 10 seconds can prove there’s no fibrosis in the lungs”.The truth: At present there is no cure or treatment for Covid-19.See also: Bogus claims that coronavirus can be cured or prevented by: oregano oil, lemon juice, sunbathing, using vodka as hand sanitiser, or drinking bleach.If in doubt ... Check the latest advice on the NHS website, the WHO website or the Q\u0026ampA page on the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.The claim: In March, a photo emerged on social media purporting to show troops clad in army fatigues walking around London’s Clapham Junction. Many wrongly interpreted this as evidence that the military had been deployed to ensure people stayed home.The truth: The “soldiers” were actually students at a nearby military preparation college and had nothing to do with Covid-19, something confirmed by the Ministry of Defence and the college.See also: Other fabricated photos and videos, such as footage of a man in Wales wiping his hands on a public lift (actually filmed in Bangkok), or the picture of worshippers crowded outside a mosque (taken before lockdown, 23 March).If in doubt: Remember that many doctored photos and videos, plus images with misleading captions, exist online. You can trace the possible source of the photo with a simple image search online.What’s happening: Despite global demand for face masks, a quick online search reveals vendors apparently offering to sell protective gear in bulk.The truth: Hundreds of bogus websites have been set up by criminals since the crisis began, many claiming to have face masks for sale. Police recently revealed British firms and iniduals have lost more than £1.86m to coronavirus-related fraud from bogus companies with no intention of selling masks.See also: The websites recently caught selling fake hand sanitisers or unregistered coronavirus testing kits - another scam.If in doubt ... Never purchase anything from an unverified website - check the padlock symbol in the address bar that indicates a secure connection and report any misleading websites, emails or text messages you think may be suspicious.The claim: “The government has been sending texts alerting people that they’ve been fined for ignoring social distancing measures during lockdown.” For example, one text reads: “You have been out of your house three times today, you are in breach of government guidelines. Your £30 fine will automatically be added to your bill.” A link leads to a non-governmental website asking for bank details.The truth: Hackers have spied an opportunity in the many people working from home, attempting to access their networks or steal login and password details. Up to 21 April, Action Fraud had received more than 1,000 coronavirus- related reports, with losses topping £2.3m.See also: Any email that asks you for personal information such as passwords or credit card details.If in doubt ...

As all attention is focused on Covid-19, plans have been submitted for a gargantuan new arena, conference centre and hotel complex on the banks of the River Tyne, which could change the face of Newcastle-Gateshead for ever. The timing is striking. Just as the future of conferences and other mass events is being called into question, the developers are pressing ahead with one of the biggest people magnets the north-east has ever seen.Billed as bringing “another landmark destination” to Gateshead Quays, the £260m project will occupy one of the most prominent sites in the region, slap bang between the Sage concert venue and the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art. Designed by arena specialist HOK, with AHR architects, the scheme is set to bring a 12,500-seat arena, 300-room hotel and three vast exhibition halls to the 10-acre waterside site, along with shops and restaurants, all packed inside a crumpled mishmash of competing structures. It looks like the compromised result of design-by-committee, employing a plethora of materials and awkward angles in a vain attempt to break up the lumpen mass. Public reaction has been caustic. “They’re proposing to build something from scratch that looks like the result of multiple awkward extensions to a 1970s shopping centre,” commented one Twitter user. Another was more damning: “What is this bollocks – Dignitas North East?”The project is all the more disappointing given the time it has taken to get this far. For almost two decades, the heart of Gateshead’s waterfront has been scarred by a great windswept wasteland. On one side stands the Sage, a isive building – variously compared to a metallic peanut and a swollen slug – but one that seems to unite all opinions with its world-class acoustics. It was designed by Norman Foster in the early 2000s, at around the same time that he was conjuring vanity monuments for central Asian autocrats, and it has always seemed cast adrift, marooned up a slope on the edge of a car park.Across the other side of the windswept tarmac expanse, down several flights of stairs, across a road and down yet more steps, stands the Baltic, a 1950s flour mill transformed into a gallery in the Tate Modern mould, opened in 2002. Together with the winking Millennium Bridge, which cleverly pivots to let boat traffic through, these projects were an impressive symbol of Gateshead’s culture-led regeneration programme during the New Labour years – only let down by the great unplanned mess between them.“We always held it up as an example for our students,” says Mark Tewdwr-Jones, professor of town planning at Newcastle University, “of how not to do planning. That site has been a cause célèbre for planning disasters.”While the Newcastle side of the river was subject to a Terry Farrell masterplan, led by the former Tyne \u0026amp Wear Development Corporation in the 1990s, the Gateshead side never had an overarching idea in place. John Devlin, Gateshead council’s development director at the time, says the Sage and Baltic were conceived as “anchor tenants” that would then encourage private development for the space in between. In 2004, Taylor Woodrow built an S-shaped flank of cheap-looking apartment blocks that loom immediately behind the Baltic, but their plans to continue across the rest of the site ran out of steam. Other proposals came and went over the years, but nothing stuck.“We could never make it stack up,” says Peter Udall, director of economy, innovation and growth at Gateshead council. “We have long had the ambition for a conference centre on this site, but we could never find the right operator. This is about the third attempt to get something that works.”Following an open OJEU tender process, developer Ask Real Estate and German investment manager Patrizia were selected to work with the council to bring forward plans for the site. As the duo behind Manchester’s uninspiring First Street development, where the cut-price arts venue Home is hemmed in by a tacky hotel and offices, it is not an auspicious choice.The resulting design betrays the piecemeal nature of its evolution, with AHR architects in charge of the boxy hotel and HOK attempting to cram the rest of the facilities on the steeply sloping site, linked by a clumsy series of terraces and steps. In an attempt not to drown out the “iconic” status of its illustrious neighbours, the architects have resorted to a language of banal blocks, jazzed up in places with jaunty angles and faceted rooftops, wrapped in a busy palette of brick, slate, concrete, glass, Corten steel and expanded metal mesh – the latter material listed as “to disguise”, as if in the hope that people might not notice the hulking great pile.In the planning application, the architects describe how brick is used to “draw on the industrial heritage of the site” while the roof of the squat river-facing block has a “sawtooth movement leading to a gradual crescendo” towards the Sage. “The organisation and massing of the large scale components has been carefully curated to complement the immediate context and neighbouring buildings,” they continue, in garbled platitudes. “The expression of the buildings take visitors on a cognitive journey through the site and give clues to the usage and communicates to the visitor at each interface.” By attempting to be both landmark building and background filler, the only journey the architects offer is a one-way ticket to cognitive dissonance.The council is in a bind. While the Sage, the Baltic and the Millennium Bridge were all the result of international design competitions, and led by the council, for this project it has handed over control to the private sector, with predictable results.“The process is very different,” says Udall. “We were the client for the other three projects and were a lot more involved in the detail of the brief. With the arena and conference centre, we feel we can still maintain our influence, but the choice of architect is up to Ask and Patrizia.”Why not insist on an architectural competition, given it is such a prominent site? The complex will be centre stage in views from the Tyne Bridge, and confront anyone looking across the river from Newcastle for generations. “I think we’d have lost the developer if we had insisted on going down the competition route,” says Udall. “It’s such a massive building with so many commercial constraints for the operator. A grain of sand can derail this kind of project.”In the calibre of its design, the proposals sadly call to mind the Trinity Square development nearby. Once home to Owen Luder’s brutalist car park, featured in the 1971 film Get Carter, it was demolished to make way for a comically bad Tesco with student flats on top, shortlisted for the Carbuncle Cup in 2014. As Owen Hatherley wrote at the time: “With this demolition, we’re exchanging architecture as a physical experience for buildings as a mute, grinning, lobotomised accompaniment to consumerism.”It is true that development economics in Gateshead are not comparable to London or Manchester. The town centre is full of vacant retail units, while half of the population has a total household income of under £30,000. The local authority clearly has more urgent priorities. But that’s no excuse to see the waterfront desecrated with such mediocre fare. Enjoying the rare position of being a major landowner, and having a recent history of commissioning brave buildings for the arts, Gateshead council must have the confidence to insist on better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/255aa66c69773a408888ea458e54249cabaa355b/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1193ab036fecfd3134e9310fa2df83a2","title":"april jobs report us unemployment rate","story":"More than 20 million people in the US lost their jobs in April and the unemployment rate more than trebled as the coronavirus pandemic shuttered the world’s largest economy, triggering a financial crisis unseen since the Great Depression.The job losses swept across the economy, hitting all industries. Leisure and hospitality lost 7.7m jobs as the sector was hit hard by quarantine measures. But 2.5m jobs were also lost in education and health services, where dentist offices shed 503,000 people. Retail lost 2.1m jobs and manufacturing employment dropped by 1.3m.“These are truly mind-blowing numbers,” said Jason Reed, professor of finance at the University of Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business. “We haven’t seen anything like this since the Great Depression.”The figures probably undercount the true impact of the outbreak as state unemployment offices have been overwhelmed and millions have yet to have their benefit claims accepted.“The employment situation report confirms what we already know about the economy. Regardless of the official number, we know that one in five workers filed for unemployment insurance. This is a staggering,” said Reed.Friday’s report follows the news on Thursday that another 3.2 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week. The number of filings has been declining on a weekly basis but remains at a historically high level. More than 33 million people have filed claims in the last seven weeks.States including California, Ohio and Washington are weeks away from running out of funds to pay claims.Washington state said it approved Ivan Schierling’s unemployment benefits on 27 March, but seven weeks later, he still hasn’t received a payment. In the meantime, bills are piling up for his credit card, healthcare and car payments.“This doesn’t include just paying to live,” Schierling, 34, said. “I can’t pay for my milk or for gas to get around. I’m kind of frozen.”A $1,200 government stimulus check immediately went to paying off bills and his former employer doesn’t know when they will be able to hire people back. “There’s nothing I can do, I’m just sitting, slowly running out of cash,” Schierling said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94c1d6f62dbb7d7126aef229e6aa323d9f6e3f49/0_253_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cccf0bb76f39323b175efd56a02ac196","title":"renters evicted june tories pledge coronavirus landlords","story":"The coronavirus-related freeze on evictions is ending – and the new ‘pre-action protocol’ relies on the kindness of landlordsWhen the lockdown ends what will happen to tenants? Almost nine million households, more than a third of all families in Britain, rent from a private landlord, a council or a housing association.Because of coronavirus, many are now in financial need. Nearly two million claims for universal credit have been made since lockdown measures were announced in the UK. Welfare claimants are entitled to payments equivalent to housing benefit. But, as a result of changes made to benefits over the last decade (like the bedroom tax and restrictions to local housing allowance), it is increasingly rare for housing benefit to pay all of a tenant’s rent.Others, although ineligible for universal credit, are also in difficulty: because they have received a redundancy cheque that will soon be spent, or their self-employed grant hasn’t arrived yet. Then there are furloughed workers, paid now, but waiting for news of redundancies from their employer.Right now, all possession hearings – the main step in evicting a tenant – are “stayed”. This is the legal equivalent of putting food in a freezer. The cases are still there, ready to be thawed out at any moment.Where a tenant is behind with their rent, landlords can issue them with a notice instructing them to leave, but (for the moment) the tenant can ignore it. On 25 June the housing courts will reopen for business. Judges will have to determine thousands of stayed pre-coronavirus cases, and the even greater number of new claims for possession arising from the lockdown.Ministers have grasped that hundreds of thousands of homes are at risk. Earlier this week the housing minister, Robert Jenrick, announced that the government was working closely with judges to draft a “pre-action protocol” for when the stay is lifted.He told MPs that the protocol will “enable tenants to have an added degree of protection, because instead of embarking upon the eviction proceedings immediately, there will be a duty upon their landlords to reach out to them, discuss their situation, and try to find an affordable repayment plan”.The problem with the protocol is that it is toothless – essentially depending on the benevolence of landlords.The two most common ways landlords seek possession are under “section 21” and “ground 8”. Section 21 provides that where a landlord has complied with certain procedural requirements (like issuing a notice using the correct form and waiting for a prescribed time before applying to court) the court must order possession.The statute does not require a landlord to have complied with the government’s proposed pre-action protocol. For that reason, even where landlords have rushed to issue proceedings, and have ignored requests from tenants to defer payments for a short time, judges will be required to approve evictions.Ground 8 provides that where a tenant is in rent arrears (eight weeks if the rent is due weekly), both when the landlord serves a notice on them and when the hearing takes place, the court must order possession.Again, the court takes no account of the landlord’s conduct it focuses simply on the amount of the tenant’s arrears. In these circumstances, if the new protocol is as the minister describes it, it will not protect tenants at all.There are alternatives. In last year’s general election, the Conservatives committed to abolish section 21 as part of their “better deal for renters”. The government reaffirmed that commitment in the Queen’s speech, announcing a renters’ reform bill to include the abolition of section 21. They should be held to that promise. As for ground 8, it too needs to be abolished. Or, if that is impossible, rescinded for such time until tenants have had a chance to reduce their debts once they’re able to go back to work.Abolishing or rescinding ground 8 would not prevent landlords relying on other grounds of possession. But, without it in place, judges will be free to order possession only if reasonable – thereby giving effect to the tenant defences the government says that it wants in place. One further advantage of abolishing ground 8 is that courts can turn to other possession proceedings in which possession orders are made but suspended, while tenants are given the chance to repay arrears to a realistic plan. Muddling on without the abolition of section 21 and ground 8 will lead to millions of people forced out of their homes. It will send those evicted scattering – some to stay with elderly relatives, some into local authority housing (although it is at breaking point) and many into homelessness.The government accepts that street homelessness speeds the transmission of coronavirus: this is the grim calculation that underpins the government’s granting of resources to councils to house rough sleepers. Drifting into a future where huge numbers of people lose their homes needlessly would be just as dangerous – for those who are evicted, and for everyone else.• David Renton is a housing barrister at Garden Court Chambers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/976fd7170f978e8f40ed036f89182da8e0b924a9/115_406_3112_1867/master/3112.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=179877c103597ddd29d35e56816c502d","title":"the pubs have gone so why are we drinking as much as ever","story":"People who love boozers always said it was the atmosphere, not the alcohol, that attracted them. The lockdown has proved us rightSome forgotten heroes – or mistreated victims, if you prefer – of the coronavirus outbreak are pubs. People who love pubs always said it was the atmosphere, not the alcohol, and people who didn’t love them thought we were just spinning them a line. Now we have proof, because we are drinking as much as we ever did and yet we complain almost constantly.That debate has ended, anyway, because the people who miss pubs now talk only to each other. We start off complaining about the pub, then segue, almost shyly, into: “Are you managing to drink quite a lot?” “Jesus Christ, you should see the state of my recycling bin. It only got collected two days ago. Today I had to climb into it to compress the cans with my body weight.” “I actually can’t carry as much beer as I want to drink,” said one friend. “One night, I ended up buying a bottle of gin.”Gin is the go-to spirit when you haven’t really dabbled in hard liquor since the vodka years, but aren’t yet ready to go quietly into a whisky soda. It has its own peculiar evocations. Another friend in the young-childcare phase – peace be with her – said she had banjaxed the classic parenting yardarm – walking upstairs at bath time with a nappy in one hand and a corkscrew in the other – and started having a really strong gin and tonic at 5pm. She said she stood at her kitchen door, feeling a deep connection to the generations of desperate, gin-soaked women that went before her – her mother, her grandmother, all the way back to those hags of Hogarth. It was so poetic that it reminded me of about nine books, all of which end up with someone in prison.Pubs were a useful corrective in the world of hedonism. You couldn’t drink more until all the other people had finished. You didn’t want to disappoint the barman. Beyond a certain age, you didn’t want to push it all the way to closing time. They were what we had instead of a moral compass.

The parallels today are strikingThe world I grew up in was always circumscribed by war: I was five years old when it began, and it was all I knew. There were lots of rules. The world was black – no chinks of light from curtains, or someone would come knocking no street lights, shop windows, tiny hand torches to find your way. Just total blackness, so the bombers wouldn’t see.They came anyway, lighting up the sky as our nearest city, Manchester, burned. We would huddle safe in our underground shelter, grabbed from my bed in the dark by my father, nestled among soil and spiders. As I grew older we played hiding from Germans in the wheatfields, and swapped pieces of fallen shrapnel. We were aware of mysterious worried chatter among the grownups. My father’s Home Guard rifle stood in the hall.Then suddenly, in May 1945, there was this explosion of light: brightness was everywhere. And excitement, laughter, joy. Everything was allowed. “It” was over. Even our teachers relaxed, laughing too. The great deadly cloud of threat lifted. We knew from the song that, “Somewhere over the rainbow skies are blue, and the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true”. And they had. It was our Over the Rainbow moment.From my village, Hazel Grove, south of industrial, smoky Stockport, the clanging tram would take me to school and back every day. But VE Day was different: a corporation tram was decked out with lights on every surface, glittering like Cinderella’s coach. As the evening darkened it came rattling down the track, through cheering crowds. At the terminal we were all gathered: families, shopkeepers, teachers, doctors. Even the vicar.For the first time I was allowed to gallivant off with friends. Suddenly all the young people joined hands, circling the now stationary tram, and skipped and danced round it into the night. Yes, the world would never be the same again: a future without war, without bombing, rationing, fear, damage, death. Today, 75 years later, I ask myself: will it be like this when the coronavirus is defeated? Our release, when it comes, will be slow, conducted out of sight by scientists, measured and sometimes clumsy. But though we can’t expect that instant euphoria, there are larger parallels.The war taught us many things: fellow feeling, shared values, resourcefulness. People grew their own fruit and veg, kept chickens. Of course, there was a black market petty crime increased, and the rich dined at the Dorchester. The rest of us took our ration books when we went on holiday. But we knew it would end, and the world would be changed.Above all, we appreciated the power of the state to organise for the benefit of everyone: even the royal family was said to limit their bath water to 5 inches deep – a requirement instinctively obeyed by us all, even if unpoliced. A vast infrastructure of recruitment, to the services and factories, the commandeering of transport on roads and ports, was all part of the war effort. “Don’t you know there’s a war on?” was a good-humoured response to anyone complaining.But something else was afoot. The years before the war had seen the Great Depression and suffering among working people. Today we acknowledge the damage the recent years of austerity did to the lives of the poorest, and in that sense to us all. With both the war and the pandemic has come the resolve, hardly formulated today but widely shared, that we can’t go back to the old ways. There is a drive to make things better.During the war, improvements were already being mapped out: in 1942, William Beveridge (a Liberal) published a report attacking what he called the five giants: idleness, ignorance, disease, squalor and want. He first used the phrase “from cradle to grave” to describe universal provision, and his study would be a blueprint for the postwar welfare state.In 1944 Rab Butler ( a Tory) saw through the Education Act, which completely transformed schooling in Britain by abolishing fees for all state secondary education. It also introduced the 11-plus exam, splitting educational options: I, the granddaughter of factory workers, passed, and went to a grammar school. This was all happening even as we battled the enemy in the Mediterranean and Normandy. It was based on creating a more equitable society, and there was a wide consensus this should be so. It translated into a Tory defeat in the 1945 general election. Churchill was shocked: hadn’t he won the war for us? But change was pressing forward.Will change on a similar scale come to us in the coming years? Who is doing the planning right now? Who is setting out the blueprint for a fairer society?The ever growing disparity of wealth – between iniduals, between countries – is probably the major blight of our present world order. It is, like Covid-19, a global issue. In confronting the one, as we already are doing, we could also seize the chance to confront the other. It is an opportunity that may not come again.• Joan Bakewell is a broadcaster, writer and Labour peer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91f425cedbd8a55b9a509d8ee6523a95aaf54b80/0_113_4549_2730/master/4549.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29f0d6e740e9dbc710143d67ccb563e6","title":"finding sanctuary in nature during lockdown","story":"Determined to find an uplifting moment every day, the Yorkshire photographer Rebecca Cole has been in search of images that bring spring to her family and friends in lockdown. She has been sharing a daily image with them via Blipfoto for the last six and a half years, but photographing nature has provided a particularly welcome escape in recent weeksCutting short our holiday to Cuba as Covid-19 took off, it was an eerie feeling transferring through an emptying Paris Charles de Gaulle airport in the middle of the day with the shutters down on duty free. I wasn’t sure what to expect when we got home but, while life felt uncertain, I knew my wildlife - my haven - would still be there. The countryside around Burley-in-Wharfedale, my home, has become my daily sanctuary, now more than ever.One stick, five gates. Living in a village, we have the luxury of the countryside on our doorstep, but with it, comes the challenge of multiple gates, now being handled by multiple people. A carefully chosen single-outing stick is doing the trick nicely for every type of opening.Walking much closer to home and for less time, I’ve been worried that I wouldn’t be able to find my moment with nature anymore, but something always turns up. Here a tawny mining bee fell out of a tree in front of my lens 300 metres from home.I’m finding moments arriving as if on cue, just when I need them the most. The last time I saw a brimstone butterfly was 2017, so imagine my delight at spotting this one glaring at me in the sunshine in front of a deep gorse dell.Normally I just enjoy happening on butterflies as the season warms up, but this year I’ve taken utmost pleasure from looking out for which one is due to emerge next - from the hibernating overwintering adults to the first to emerge fresh from their pupae. The green hairstreak is a local favourite of mine - surprisingly easy to miss!Even this elusive chiffchaff seemed willing to be on film. Perhaps having recently arrived and being hungry, this one was less cautious about being captured as it picked off tiny bugs from budding trees.I call this one “crouching toad, hidden dog”. Our dog can’t walk as far as she used to, but I managed to time one of my few walks up onto the moors since lockdown perfectly for the day the toads got active. Perhaps the out-take should have been my record as one clambered onto my glasses when I took a moment to read the settings on my camera.It seemed trivial to be photographing a bee on the day after it was announced that Boris Johnson was in hospital with coronavirus, but I’ve concluded that everyone has to hang on to their sanity in their own way.In Yorkshire we can’t have been luckier with the weather recently. We’ve had the luxury of days on end of blue skies and the birds have been making the most of it too.It’s been the colours and the shapes of nature as well as the expressions of wildlife that have given me a daily smile in these uncertain times. In particular, I’m finding the spring colours of lemons and limes giving me a real boost. This willow warbler taken through gorse is my recent favourite. Wildlife has always been and will continue to be my sanctuary.Over time, I’ve found a few local nooks and crannies to keep an eye on at different times of the year. This is one of them in a beautiful woodland back garden I walk past. This kestrel seemed to be owning the space here, but in the last few days the jackdaws have moved in and the kestrel has reluctantly moved two metres upstairs into another box. They live with physical distancing as the norm. It works. I’ll hold onto that thought."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0b677bf8cefd8d576f623474afc66026df496f9/0_54_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f80efdaf55033bd3442947c5d829438c","title":"pollutionwatch breathtaking views vanish build better coronavirus","story":"Only government action will preserve the clearer, bluer skies gifted to us by the coronavirus lockdown Many of us will have noticed differences in traffic noise and air pollution during the lockdown. Startling images have come from India where, for the first time in a generation, the Himalayas have been visible more than a hundred miles away. Something similar happened in the UK in 1921 when coal shortages during a miner’s strike led to newspaper reports of distant landmarks being visible as never before. In the UK we too have been able to look up at clearer blue skies, less impeded by air pollution and not crisscrossed by aircraft contrails. This helped Germany to break a solar power record.In Beijing, air pollution controls for the 2014 Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting also brought a return to blue skies. The term “APEC blue” emerged in Chinese social media and was nominated as Beijing’s top environmental phrase for the year. Later it took on a tinge of sadness, to mean something wonderful, but brief.

Some may have to be abandoned altogether as they cannot be defended,” said co-author Stefan Rahmstorf, from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.In the worst-case scenario – with rising emissions and global heating of 4.5C above pre-industrial levels – the study estimates the surface of the world’s oceans in 2100 will be between 0.6 and 1.3 metres higher than today, which would potentially engulf areas  home to hundreds of millions of people.By contrast, if humanity succeeds in cutting carbon dioxide and holding the increase in temperature to 2C, the rise would be a more manageable 0.5 metre.The figures for both pathways are more pessimistic than those outlined by the UN intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC), which predicts the worst possibility is a 1.1-metre rise by 2100.The gap reflects advances in climate science and differences in approach. The IPCC works largely through consensus among scientific working groups, which tends to produce relatively conservative estimates.By contrast, the new survey – published in the journal Climate and Atmospheric Science – aggregates the views of 106 specialists, who were chosen because they have published at least six peer-reviewed papers on the subject in major academic journals. As a result, the predictions are more representative of a range of views in the field.The higher estimates highlight growing concern about the world’s two biggest ice sheets, in Antarctica and Greenland. Satellite data and on-the-ground measurements show these regions are melting faster than most computer models predicted. Many of the scientists said there was now greater understanding of the risks posed by marine ice-cliff instability, which can lead to the collapse of ice shelves.The study was led by scientists at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore with support from seven research institutions across the world, including Durham University in the UK, Tufts University in the US and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.The lead author, Prof Benjamin Horton of the university’s Asian School of the Environment, said the research aimed to condense the growing mass of academic studies about sea-level projections into a simple overview. “It is useful to survey leading experts on the expected sea-level rise, which provides a broader picture of future scenarios and informs policymakers so they can prepare necessary measures,” he said.The authors said the results showed how much warming – and sea-level rise – could be avoided if governments fulfilled their 2015 Paris climate agreement promises to cut emissions of the gases that are heating the planet. Most countries are far off reaching their goals.“Like in the Covid pandemic, timing is critical to prevent devastation. If you wait until you already have a serious problem, then it is too late. Unlike with corona, sea-level rise cannot be stopped for many centuries or even millennia once ice sheets have been destabilised past their tipping points,” Rahmstorf said.But, without deeper structural changes, the reduction is likely to be temporary and will make little difference to the build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The Met Office predicted on Thursday carbon dioxide measurements at the Mauna Loa measuring station would rise 2.5 parts per million this year.“Although emissions are reducing this year, this does not mean the build-up of CO2 in the atmosphere will reverse – it will just be slightly slower” the Met Office’s chief CO2 forecaster, Richard Betts, said in a blogpost.“An analogy is filling a bath from a tap – it’s like we are turning down the tap, but because we are not turning off the tap completely, the water level is still rising.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1382436018688668c5b68dd554d9f19ccaa122e/0_0_3924_2619/master/3924.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f49b2dfee273e9cdc8727f7aa242457 720w","title":"how to dress in lockdown jess cartner morley","story":"The latest trends may not matter any more, but there is a whole new set of influences on what we wearI know, I know – there are more important things to think about than clothes at the moment. I get that. On the other hand, I don’t see that me squinting at graphs or scrolling through headlines is going to make a vaccine come any quicker. So thinking about clothes is no less constructive than pondering logarithmic scales or contact tracing approaches, really.I have pretty much checked out of fashion, in the sense of trends, during the period universally known as This Difficult Time. For those of us fortunate enough not to be at the sharp end of the crisis, lockdown is a little like living in a freeze-frame, and the “spring trends” that were scheduled to be happening in our wardrobes now – Bermuda shorts, crochet dresses, waistcoats – feel like outfits for a party that got cancelled. Fashion in the this-week’s-must-have sense feels like a radio station that’s still broadcasting, but with no one tuning in.But I think about clothes as much as ever, because there are an entirely new set of rules to navigate. For instance: right now, we are much more likely to be looked down upon for going out in public looking dressed up, than we are for going out in public looking scruffy. To avoid glares of disapproval, you need to either be in exercise gear or supermarket-appropriate utilitarian get-up. If you have a dog, you can wear your dog-walking jacket, but be careful only to be seen in it once a day, otherwise someone might report you. Leaving the house wearing anything that suggests fun or glamour is now deeply suspicious – although full hair, makeup and heels are permissible for Thursdays between 8pm and 8.05pm, now that The Clapping has become established as the key emotional and social moment of our calendars.At home, the novelty of working in tracksuit bottoms wore off a while ago. I don’t like the way joggers develop a knobbly kneed silhouette when you sit down in them for more than half an hour, and without wanting to sound like Karl Lagerfeld, an elasticated waist doesn’t speak to the We’ve Got This mood music of the hour. Hence these faux-leather trousers. Comfortable enough to sit on my very non-ergonomic kitchen chair all day, but dressy enough to feel like I’m repping the public-facing version of myself, at least up until the time I snap the laptop shut. Trends don’t matter right now. But feeling like you’ve got your act together? That’s everything."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82715f75f1f762159aadd8dad3270c9fcdbc3ebb/0_224_5195_3117/master/5195.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c048b78520507086a78055ad70930b5a","title":"abel ferraras lockdown choices film and tv","story":"The director of King of New York, Bad Lieutenant and The Funeral recommends film and TV for a coronavirus age, in the hope that ‘the light becomes more evident in the darkness’The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956)Ten Seconds to Hell (1959)It’s All True (1941, the “natives rowing to sea” segment)The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant (1972)Hour of the Wolf (1968)The Goalie’s Anxiety at the Penalty Kick (1972)The Lady of the Camellias (1981)The Gospel According to St Matthew (1964)Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983, the George Miller segment)The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street (The Twilight Zone, 1960)Why now?

He’ll convince you, tooThe pre-eminent film in Sir Roger Moore’s non-Bond oeuvre was released in 1974, between Live and Let Die and The Man With the Golden Gun.I was born in 1978, so I was far too young to see Gold in its first flush of youth, let alone mine. So was my friend Tom.But Gold was Tom’s favourite film when he was 12 years old, and he’s convinced me it should’ve been mine. What follows is his explanation of why:Like many others born in the late 70s, Roger was the Bond for me. I was taken to see Octopussy in the summer of 1983 and that was it: an unconsummated love affair that continues to this day, despite Roger’s passing almost three years ago.It wasn’t just the excitement and the impossible-to-describe plot. It was something about Roger himself. The underdog absurdity of this 56-year-old playing Britain’s top secret agent. The sheer amount of hair he had managed to retain. The measured pace of his movements, which John Barry conducted the incidental music to fit ... it all spun its web for me.And so, naturally, I watched the rest of the canon. But by the late 80s, I’d seen all seven of his Bonds, again and again and again. I could quote the scripts, sing the songs, name the cinematographers. I read books about Moore – authorised and not – and mastered most of the dates of his various marriages. The usual stuff 10-year-olds get up to.Biographies listed his other films. I hungered for them. But it was the 80s, and if you wanted to watch a film no one else did you had to wait and wait for it to appear on BBC2 at 2.35am on a Tuesday in March, then pray the video timer would work.Was there any agony deeper than finding you had recorded either a blank screen for two hours or part two of the Joan Collins miniseries Sins? You only got one chance. You had to be ready. No mistakes.Slowly but surely I found them: The Wild Geese, The Sea Wolves, North Sea Hijack, Escape to Athena, Shout at the Devil. But never Gold. Why? What the fuck was Michael Grade, or whoever was doing the scheduling, up to?Then, finally, it arrived. Gold (1974). Thursday. BBC2. 11.45pm. “South African mining thriller.”The timer was set. Somehow, it worked.Somehow, the film ticked all the boxes.Roger as a maverick mining engineer. An absurd plot to flood a South African gold mine in order to raise the price of gold and make a huge amount of money for a syndicate of villains. Roger sharing champagne and a bath with Susannah York. Intrusive incidental music, a couple of truly absurd songs and a climax at Pinewood studios. It was practically a Bond film, Roger-style. Except not many people knew it. It was my Roger adventure. It was private. I felt I had an edge over his other fans. I didn’t, of course.Who does? This is the movies. We cherish our illusions. And now it’s 2020, and in the grip of a pandemic, locked down, we turn to our certainties, our treasures, our gold. By email, from stricken Manhattan to prostrate Hither Green, I asked Tom the question at hand: does Gold still shine?The quick answer is: “No.” The longer answer is that it depends on your expectations. If you feel certain you are about to watch an execrable film, you will be pleasantly surprised: Gold is a perfectly serviceable thriller, with some tense moments and a genuinely exciting climax in the flooded mine at Pinewood.One of the reasons the film isn’t as shit as it should be is that it was made, in no small part, by members of the James Bond team. Peter Hunt directs – he was editor of the early Bonds and directed On Her Majesty’s Secret Service. John Glen, later to direct five Bonds, edits and directs the second unit. The production designer is Syd Cain, who did From Russia With Love, OHMSS and Live and Let Die. Those guys are responsible for making two men and a dinghy floating around at Pinewood seem an exciting climax.Then there’s Roger’s character, Rod Slater, a maverick, woman-chasing commitment-phobe ultimately prepared to die to save the mine (and its miners), which he almost does. There’s a suggestion a genuine relationship may be on the cards with Terry Steyner (York), whose evil husband has conveniently died a few minutes earlier and who is on hand to look after Rod in an ambulance.It’s definitely one of Roger’s best non-007 performances. This was 1974, so he hadn’t established his Bond persona. Hunt pushes him to be as serious as possible. I certainly believe he’s a miner. And that he’s younger than his 46 years – he’s in good shape, the hair’s more tousled than usual and there’s a bit more sweat than Bond. And he gets quite badly injured at the end. Or at least his arms do.My sense is that York fought hard to be more than just another Bond girl, making her character as strong as possible. There’s a great scene where she flies Moore back to the stricken mine in her plane (she’s rich) and he accuses her of being involved in the conspiracy. She’s outraged: she won’t take any shit from Roger. As it happens, she is involved in the conspiracy, but she doesn’t know that yet.And the villain? We’re very much in the “speak quickly with a slight smile” stage of Sir John Gielgud’s film career but there’s a wonderful moment where one of the sub-villains tells him they’ve commissioned a survey that shows just how close the mine is to water but have cleverly replaced every mention of the word “water” with the word “gold”.“Ingenious”, says Gielgud, without the smile.There’s also the brilliantly intrusive score by Elmer Bernstein, a crucial reason the action sequences are so tense and exciting. The song Jimmy Helms belts at the start and the end is magnificently absurd too.I truly think this is Roger’s best non-Bond. Others tout The Man Who Haunted Himself (1971), in which Roger does actually have to do a fair bit of acting, playing a good guy and his evil doppelganger. That probably is his best performance. At the end of his life, knighted, Sir Roger certainly thought so. But I think Gold is the better film. The bar isn’t high, but Gold is a perfectly enjoyable romp one could happily sit through, some warm self-isolated evening.Gold was the film to which Tom introduced me 10 years or so ago, when we were writing for The Fitzrovia Radio Hour, a cultish thing that did reasonably well at the Edinburgh fringe. I loved it immediately, almost equally deeply. Over a curry, we took the plot, switched the action to Cornwall and named the whole thing Tin!As an absurdist 1940s radio play, done on a shoestring budget, it worked surprisingly well. The man from the Sunday Times spotted the debt to Gold, and approved.Tom’s work, I think, was done."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f8194b6d65f8aeba129d063a67f206555907e51/544_399_4742_2845/master/4742.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc848d9f14098c0e87aae1939166d82b","title":"anna jones recipe lemon drizzle layer cake and other jammy ideas","story":"Jam is a handy fallback when fruit is in short supply, be that in an eggless cake, or as an accompaniment for cheese, pancakes, granola and more ...Whenever I visit my parents, I bring them a jar of jam. It’s taken until now (we are staying with them) to realise that they eat only marmalade, so we have an accidental stockpile. A convenient one, too as we’re shopping less frequently, our fresh fruit supply is limited, and jam makes a good – if rather sweet – substitute. Used sparingly, and mixed with a little lemon juice, jam steps in for cooked fruit in bakes, breakfasts, pancakes, puddings and as a sidekick for cheese. This layer cake takes the best bits from a victoria sponge and a lemon drizzle, while these five quick ideas for new ways to use the jam in the cupboard.This is easy as anything: egg-free cake is made from things that I expect most of you have in your cupboards. I’ve tried to keep the recipe as flexible as possible, so use whichever sugar, flour, jam and citrus you have around. You will need two 20cm round cake tins.350g plain or spelt flour250g sugar (caster is best, granulated or light brown also work)2 tsp baking powderA pinch of salt350ml milk of your choice (I used oat)120ml flavourless oil (such as vegetable, sunflower, light olive, coconut)2 unwaxed lemons or limes, zested and juiced (about 8 tbsp)For the yoghurt-jam filling4 tbsp thick yoghurt (thick coconut or Greek) or cream cheese4 tbsp icing sugar4 tbsp jam of your choice (I used apricot)For the drizzle syrup2 tbsp sugarGrease both cake tins and line the base with discs of baking paper. If you don’t have baking paper, grease the tin, add a tablespoon of sugar, then tip the tin and shake it around to cover the surface, shaking off any excess.Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)350Fgas 4. In a large bowl, mix the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt with a whisk.In another bowl, whisk the milk, oil and half the citrus juice. Add the wet ingredients to the dry and mix well with a wooden spoon.Add the zest from the citrus fruit. Beat well, until the ingredients are thoroughly combined and the mixture is smooth.Spoon the cake mix evenly between the lined tins, spread to level it out with the back of a spoon, and bake on the middle shelf of the oven for 30-40 minutes. Transfer to a rack and leave to cool completely before removing from the tin.Meanwhile, make the drizzle syrup, combining three tablespoons of the remaining juice with the sugar, then carefully and evenly spoon it over the top of just one of the cakes – this will be the topping.Once the cakes are cool, make the filling. Combine the yoghurt and icing sugar, and mix the jam with a tablespoon of lemon juice. Put the bottom cake on a plate, spread over the filling, dot with the jam, then make sandwich with the sugared cake on top.Let it down with lemon, orange or lime juice for a spoonable compote to top your morning granola or porridge if you have run out of fresh fruit.My friend, the food writer Georgie Hayden, rightly points out that apricot jam is a perfect pairing for halloumi. Warm it with a little lemon juice and spread it on top of crisp, fried or grilled halloumi.Goat’s cheese, feta and soft, rinded cheese such as brie make a great partner for some jams – sharper ones, such as blackcurrant or blackberry, work best.Any jam warmed in a pan with a little citrus juice or water makes a great quick topping for most pancakes and puddings.Sandwich a cake, as in today’s first recipe, or some cookies with it – or bake it into these delicious crumble bars."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f02d99c0c61e788e3b293f24b7c0872233e70252/0_23_2640_1584/master/2640.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19d15be356d8504c1772e06c728df81b","title":"world cup questions zinedine zidane head butt 2006 berlin france italy marco materazzi","story":"Using the Fifa archive we rewatch a series of memorable games in search of answers we didn’t find at the time“It was like knocking four quick times on the door of unhappiness” – Albert Camus, the OutsiderThe World Cup final, France v Italy in Berlin’s Olympic Stadium. It’s still humid under the lights. The score is 1-1, the players wide-eyed but still running.A World Cup that began a month ago in Munich is entering the final moments of overtime. Marco Materazzi puts his hand on Zinedine Zidane’s back, seeming to guide him quite gently out of the way. Zidane turns, says something and walks away. He has two minutes and 10 seconds left of his career as a footballer.Everyone knows what happens next. Zidane’s red card is one of the much-storied moments of modern football. We remember it as the decisive turn in a World Cup final as a discordant endnote to a great career and its aftermath as a wider narrative of loyalties, brands, attitudes, even personal politics.It was always part of Zidane’s appeal that he remained to some degree an outsider superstar even in his pomp years. Zidane turned 24 while playing (unremarkably) for France at Euro 96. He’d spent six seasons in Ligue 1, brilliant but brittle, by the time Juventus took a gamble on this silhouette of a football genius.Italy made Zidane. The fitness, the tactical discipline and the influence of Marcello Lippi pushed him right out into the far reaches of his own talent. Sport loves an easy narrative arc. In Berlin it seemed fitting that his final game as a footballer should come with Lippi on the touchline, on a night when Zidane’s expressive, balletic brilliance was matched against a team of definitive Italian defensive resilience.Was this a moment of hubris? Of downfall and fatal flaws? Was Zidane exposed in Berlin? Or ennobled? At times in sport there is a feeling the drive for meaning comes from a kind of desperation. Let’s face it, there really are a lot of people watching here. This has to mean something.Two things stand out now. First, Italy always seemed to be winning this World Cup final from about 20 minutes into the game. France played like a team with an air of destiny around it without actually, it turns out, having an air of destiny. Zidane’s sending off was not material to the drift of this game, to its sense of natural justice. The red card deprived France of a first-choice penalty taker – but correctly so. It also deprived Italy of the chance to win the World Cup final without an asterisk.And secondly Zidane looks wired from the start. The Fifa film is a high-resolution number. As the teams walk out the camera pans to show the wonderful sweep of the stadium, crammed with conflicting shades of blue. These are two of the great national anthems, accompanied by a camera-pan down a thrilling row of row faces.What a team France had. Patrick Vieira stands with eyes closed, an arm around Thierry Henry, who has an arm around a 23-year-old Franck Ribéry. Zidane is at the end of the line, the star of this show already. He was brilliant in the quarter-final against Brazil. In closeup he even looks like the World Cup, that huge sleek rounded skull filling the screen. Even when you know the end note here, the empty clang of forehead into chest, the sense of glory in waiting feels inevitable. Marchons, marchons.The pitch is cut in beautiful wide green stripes. Even the people in the stands seem to gleam with youth and wealth. This really was the most prosperous of modern-day World Cups, a World Cup drenched in Euro boom times, in Germany’s success, in the age of Wags and headline-grabbing haircuts, a cult of celebrity that still felt oddly innocent.Zidane’s first touch is a dinked outside-of-the-foot pass to the left. Seconds later Henry is knocked almost out cold in a collision with Fabio Cannavaro’s shoulder. Smelling salts are produced. With four minutes gone Gianluca Zambrotta is booked for hacking down Vieira as he glides away with the ball. Italy aren’t mucking about.But they’re soon behind. Henry heads the ball inside from the touchline and suddenly Florent Malouda is haring in on goal. Materazzi goes to tackle, then pulls his leg away. Cannavaro stays close but resists making contact. Malouda falls over. It’s a pretty soft penalty kick.Zidane takes the kick. And of course it’s ridiculous. A Panenka penalty in the seventh minute of the World Cup final against one of the best goalkeepers ever to play the game. Who does this?It’s also a poor Panenka, floating on to the bar then bouncing down and just over the line. It’s a goal. But it feels like an embarrassment to the occasion, the act of someone not entirely in control.In the stands Jacques Chirac bounces and yelps. France have held on to a 1-0 lead in their last two games. Italy have now conceded their first goal scored by an actual opponent in this tournament – the only other was Cristian Zaccardo’s own-goal in the group-stage draw against the USA. But they soon start to press back.What have Italy got here? For a start they have Mauro Camoranesi, who wouldn’t get anywhere near the French team, who is a stubby little scuttling pest of a midfielder, but who doesn’t give a damn about any of this, or about the occasion, and just keeps on snapping around Zidane.They have Andrea Pirlo, a sublime talent too, and seemingly always able to execute those skills in these huge games. Pirlo looks calm, buzzing up and down the left, twisting about chipping intricate little passes, asserting his own rhythms. It’s his corner that makes the equaliser, a precise delivery on to the head of Materazzi, who leaps above Vieira and batters the ball past Fabien Barthez, his forehead striking the leather like a fist.The score is 1-1. Italy are just about in charge now. Fabio Grosso gallops down the left and punts a cross over the bar. Grosso isn’t a great left-back. But he had a great World Cup. This is what Italy do, a way of playing that ennobles and vindicates every other team’s victories. You want this? You want your moment in time? Fine. But you’ve got to come through us to get there.Henry has recovered by now. He runs past Francesco Totti and slides Ribéry in on the right. He fends off Gennaro Gattuso with a regal dip of the shoulder. Mention is sometimes made of the fact Henry played in nine cup finals and scored zero goals. A few months earlier he left the pitch raging in Paris after defeat by Barcelona in the Champions League final. There is no significance to this. Henry is an extraordinary footballer and a leader too, driving to the left and setting up the pattern of France’s attacks, with the wide players surging inside and Zidane playing very high at times as a genuine No 10.Italy’s success in this game lies in the way they interrupt this flow. Every time Zidane gets the ball within 40 metres of goal Gattuso charges into his space. Zidane can have the ball in the centre circle. Anywhere else: compress, bite, bring him down. When they have the ball Italy play diagonal long passes to Luca Toni. The plan is clear. Shut Zidane down. Keep possession. Get behind the French full-backs.With 35 minutes gone Toni heads Pirlo’s cross against the bar. Moments later Zidane turns and starts to dribble but Materazzi comes sprinting out and performs an astonishing tackle, taking he ball at full stretch with a deep booming thunk. Zidane gets up. No complaints. But Italy are dominating as half-time arrives.The second half is gripping. Malouda should have another penalty in the 53rd minute after he’s bundled down by Zambrotta. Vieira goes off injured. Toni heads a deep free-kick past Barthez from the edge of the box with thrilling power, but he’s offside.As the game enters the final 10 minutes of normal time Italy are playing through a kind of triumphant rage, defending furiously, keeping the ball, passing it backwards to cheers from their support. Zidane has injured his shoulder. He has it sprayed and wanders back on. He’s still running hard, even if by now his goal feels like it happened in another life.Even the break before extra time seems telling. Lippi is pointing and yelling and bollocking his players. Raymond Domenech takes Zidane to one side and speaks to him quietly. Zidane listens then walks away. Fair enough. What exactly, are you going to tell him here anyway?Ribéry finds space and has a shot at goal. David Trezeguet, scorer of the winner against Italy in the final of Euro 2000, replaces him. Zidane does something brilliant, jinking away from the blue press, then haring into the middle to head Willy Sagnol’s cross. Buffon palms it over. Zidane screams. And then it happens.There are 12 minutes left of extra time. Italy have cleared the ball upfield. Materazzi touches Zidane’s back. It seems like nothing much. Words are spoken. Play continues. Zidane and Materazzi are a few metres apart. Zidane turns, thinks about it. The incident is passing. It’s almost gone. But not quite. Zidane comes closer.It looks like an excellent butt from a technical point of view: shoulders swivelling, neck wrenched, forehead rammed into the breast bone. It’s not exactly “shockingly violent”, as the commentator suggests (Materazzi just gets up) more shockingly weird and out of place.Play continues. But this is too big to pass. It’s a footballing Chernobyl. It can’t be glossed or hushed. The reactor core is open. And the fallout is already starting. Italian players are pointing and haranguing the referee. There are animated conversations, figures scuttling across the pitch.It takes two minutes of earpiece-clutching for a response to come. Zidane is sent off. He puts a hand on the referee’s shoulder, says something, then walks away. On the touchline Domenech performs furious sarcastic applause. Zidane ambles past the trophy. And that is pretty much that.There are still two main mysteries here. First, why did he do it? Zidane suggested afterwards that his mother had been insulted. Some English newspapers even ran a story that Materazzi had called his mother “a terrorist whore”, apparently based on lip reading experts, but then had to apologise, retract and pay libel damages when Materazzi denied it.Is it enough? Does any part of this add up? There has been so much noise, so much temptation to portray Zidane as either a fatally-flawed hero, a defender of personal rights, a human agent in a world of athletic units. Really, though, the main feeling is one of crushing mundanity, of mild absurdity even. Is this really it?The second mystery surrounds the call to send him off. Lippi suggested initially help had come from a Fifa official with a TV monitor. This would have been a breach of protocol. The Fifa line is that the fourth official, Luis Medina Cantalejo of Spain, saw the butt in real time and told referee Horacio Elizondo through his head set.The referee has even given a TED talk on this subject. Apparently Cantalejo told him: “Dreadful, Zidane’s head-butt on Materazzi was dreadful … Fuck! Zidane head-butted Materazzi. When you see the video you will not believe me.” Cantalejo mentions video here, unnecessarily. Conspiracy fans will perhaps wonder why.Does it matter? This was entirely the right decision. Although, it also feels a little odd even now. Football changed in that instant: a moment of progress, but also of intrusion, a moment when professional sport edged closer to becoming an arm of our shared 24-hour digital surveillance.To follow high-level football now is to experience an endless loop, an endless argument about details. Some see this as a triumph, progress towards the elimination of error and perfectibility. This is perhaps the case. But it also forgets the elements of play, of muddle, of intrigue that distinguish “sport” (look up that word) from data, from a line of numbers, from a courtroom transcript, from drudgery, from an absence of human mess and human muddle.So to penalties. Pirlo hoists the opening kick in the roof of the net, a kick so decisive you know at this moment Italy are going to win. Materazzi takes one, of course, and scores easily. In fact everyone scores except Trezeguet, who smashes his with pointless power against the crossbar. The ball bounces down and out, a mocking echo of that Panenka. “The BIGGEST SIX INCHES in French football HISTORY,” the Fifa commentator says, admiringly.Italy just keep slotting them. Alessandro Del Piero never looks like missing through every one of the 50 steps it takes to get to the spot. Grosso puts one in the corner. And that is it. The blue shirts come haring on, leaping and jumping, eyes wide, spooked by their own moment of history.In France there was an instant urge to find some kind of meaning in Zidane’s headbutt, not just as a reason for defeat, but as some wider cultural force. “Zizou On T’aime” was scrawled across the Arc de Triomphe. Chirac would announce his love and admiration for Zidane (who lost his temper and butted someone) in a speech on the team’s return. The butt was made into a sculpture (“Coup De Tete”) and displayed at the Centre Pompidou.Some of his teammates were less than pleased. Sagnol didn’t speak to Zidane for two years. And for that team this was a moment when something passed. A World Cup win would have been France’s third major trophy in eight years, a run to enshrine that team with the true greats.Half of the class in 2006 had been there for the whole . In the event that brilliant generation is left with a home World Cup, a Euros in the country next door, the implosion in South Korea and defeat to Greece at Euro 2004: a fine champion team but not quite an all-time great one.Zidane’s sending off brought a feeling of entropy, but also of absurdity, an act pulled out from all that heat and light that seems to mean less the more you look at it.It seems significant that Zidane himself has never appeared to be tortured, or aggrieved, or even that bothered by his final moment as a footballer. What does seem certain is that Italy’s win reasserted in its own way the value of the team in an age in inidualism. And that they were, all white noise aside, entirely deserved winners."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02bcceddbb609d0c17aaa1679d6f046b7d4728ac/0_123_5315_3191/master/5315.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7f7f04815044d925ffbe97d62a3aefa","title":"my favourite game arsenal v newcastle 1998 fa cup final","story":"A trip to Devon meant updates were via a classmate’s radio but it gave me my first real glimpse of the power of footballIt seems a little odd pitching a game I’ve not seen for this series. I wasn’t at Wembley, I didn’t watch on TV and I didn’t listen to it on the radio. How, then, I hear you say, can the 1998 FA Cup final between Arsenal and Newcastle possibly be my favourite game?I had always been an Arsenal fan, I didn’t have a choice. I grew up in a council flat in Hackney where if you left the windows open on matchdays you could faintly hear the Highbury goal celebrations. I went to a primary school in Islington. My dad supported Arsenal, so did my grandad.When George Graham’s Arsenal won the league in 1991, I was four. I cannot remember the Graham era, I have vague memories of Bruce Rioch’s sub-50 games. In reality, the 1997-8 season is where football, beyond the playground, began for me.A first league title, that I could remember, ensured I was well and truly a child of Arsène Wenger’s Arsenal. The chance to do the Double for the first time since 1971, when my dad was 10, felt magical. At 11, it was my turn.Except I wasn’t even in London for the final. As Arsenal prepared to field a side without an injured Dennis Bergkamp and a not-quite-fit-to-start Ian Wright, I, in my final year of primary school, was on a coach heading for a week-long trip in Devon.When matchday came, we begged the trio of teachers to let us watch or listen to the game but they refused because it would mess up the day’s schedule. My class of little Gooners had to wait.One of the group, though, had sneaked out a pocket radio. I have no idea where we were going to, or coming from, or where we stopped off during the course of the two hours from kick-off to final whistle, but as a train of schoolchildren weaved along a narrow pavement in the middle of nowhere a stream of Chinese-whisper match updates would trickle down the line.When Emmanuel Petit swept the ball into the path of Marc Overmars, who slotted between the legs of an onrushing Shay Given, an excited murmur filtered down the pairs of kids. We felt exhilarated by our small act of rebellion, and stealthy. Looking back, it’s hard to believe the teachers were not very quickly aware of exactly what was going on, a kind blind eye, perhaps, allowing us to keep the magic alive.When the 19-year-old Nicolas Anelka coolly scored from Ray Parlour’s delightful ball over the top from the halfway line, we believed. On the final whistle all pretence was gone and the small herd of north London kids erupted in celebrations next to a thick hedge on a slip of pavement.When I ask him, out of the blue, if he remembers that day, a former classmate and fellow Gooner, Paul Jackson, sends me racing back to us being allowed to watch the trophy being lifted on the small TV back where we were staying afterwards.That game set off a golden few months (and then years) of memories: wobbling precariously on a crowd barrier on the back of a flatbed lorry to catch a look at the Double winners on parade, the women’s team who had completed a League Cup and FA Cup double atop the bus behind gasping and being convinced, for a split second, that a shattered trophy would be across the back pages when Wrighty threw the FA Cup high into the air from the window of Islington town hall before catching it to mad celebration falling in love with players that would light up the summer’s World Cup.More than that, though, the 1998 FA Cup final gave me my first real glimpse of the power of football. I hadn’t watched it, I hadn’t followed it directly, but my god did it matter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e06b51429a66ca514214df0e2f8504b7310635a/0_0_8525_5115/master/8525.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea6c1abce408cf069503c50ec1a7f413","title":"no posh bread no fancy cheese and certainly no mayo the seven unwritten rules of eating baked beans","story":"From that initial cold forkful to just the right amount of cheese, we’ve settled it – this is how you should be enjoying your beansForget whether the dress was blue or white, or if there was room for Jack on that floating debris – the most heated debates of our generation revolve around food. Does the jam or cream go on a scone first (and how do you pronounce scone)? Does pineapple belong on a pizza? And should your Heinz ketchup be kept in the fridge? (For the record: jam then cream rhyme it with “gone” certainly not and yes, definitely. Glad we cleared that up.)But few foods have triggered so many lengthy debates as the satisfyingly saucy baked bean. A British icon, the fierce loyalty these delicious legumes stir up is unparalleled. Which is the best bread to put them on? Is it OK to eat them cold? And should they really be touching other food on the plate? We’re here to solve these saucy conundrums once and for all. (Please note: the editor’s decision is final.)1 Beans should be enjoyed cold as wellWhile it’s traditional to heat up your Heinz Beanz, there are purists who swear by eating them cold, usually straight out of the tin. While we suspect their argument is partially based on sheer laziness, this is an easy one: either way of eating them is fine, but the best path to take is both. The true baked bean connoisseur snaffles a few tasty forkfuls after opening the tin, before heating the rest up.3 Acceptable toppingsThe beauty of baked beans is their versatility, which in turn can lead to tough decisions about which toppings, if any, are the best. We’ve heard cases for cooked chorizo, crispy bacon, hot sauce, chopped parsley, dried herbs and (of course) enough cheese to fell a horse. The short answer is that all these toppings, including none at all, are acceptable (except for non-cheddar cheeses, more of which later). Although, if you stir ketchup, brown sauce or, God forbid, mayonnaise into your beans, somebody needs to stage an intervention.4 The cheese rulesDespite their workmanlike appearance, cheesy beans are a thing of great beauty and delicate balance, and must be properly executed. The rules are as follows: cheddar is the only acceptable cheese. None of your gruyere or feta nonsense here, please. At a push, you might crumble in some Wensleydale, but cheddar offers the correct tanginess to offset the beans’ sweetness, and can be finely grated so the cheese drifts on to the beans like a soft, tasty blanket. Thickly grated cheddar is also delicious, but tends to stubbornly sit there, refusing to melt. Finally, while cheese stirred into beans is undoubtedly delicious, it’s simply not the correct way – the light dusting of cheese must melt into the beans on its own.5 No napkins, embrace the sauceDo you want to be that person with the napkin tucked under their chin in the work canteen? Do you? No, you do not. Beans, by their nature, love to throw themselves off your fork and bounce their saucy way down your clean shirt, like a stone skimmed by a champ. Wear your day-glo stains as a badge of honour. Your lunch was better than anyone else’s.6 Set the beans freeOf all the baked bean debates, the one about whether it’s OK for them to touch other foodstuffs in a full English breakfast is the most controversial. While there’s no question beans are an integral part of the meal, some people prefer theirs on the side, to avoid the sauce infiltrating any of the more absorbent items (eg bread, hash browns). Let’s be clear, though: serving your baked beans in a rubbish little ramekin is entirely unacceptable. If you really must separate them, the correct protocol is to create an edible holding pen fashioned out of sausages and bacon.7 The right type of breadThere are more ways to eat baked beans than there are beans in a tin (on average, 465 in total)! But although baked potatoes, crumpets, waffles or a bowl straight from the microwave are all acceptable vehicles for getting baked beans inside you, the classic accompaniment is toasted, buttered bread. When you pour your beans on to the toast, a corner must be left bean-free, to be saved for juice-mopping duties. And the correct bread choice is white or wholemeal and pre-sliced: no arguing. If you want to go really fancy, we’ll allow an uncut bloomer. But this isn’t the time for posh breads: none of your rye, pumpernickel or sourdough should be getting involved.

Blankly staring at the forks in your cutlery drawer wondering why they have four prongs and not three.Instead, the past few weeks have shown that being shut away could be making us more connected with each other. Thanks to strong internet networks and an array of digital apps and video communication software, we’re spending more quality time with loved ones, rehabilitating old relationships and forging new ones.

Taking capacity from commuter hotspots such as Waterloo to expand capacity in the suburbs is one way networks such as Vodafone are adjusting their behaviour. With internet connectivity remaining robust, here’s some inventive ways to escape the lockdown funk and embrace webcameraderie.The shutters might be closed on the nation’s pubs, but that hasn’t stopped people excitedly cheersing each other in brilliantly-named virtual pubs such as The Stay Inn and The Quarant Inn. Sequestered merrymakers have also been improvising cocktails from dusty bottles of crème de menthe and kumquat-flavoured vodka found lurking in their drinks cupboards (see the #quarantini hashtag on Instagram). For many, these sofa-based happy hours are preferable to the real thing: after all, there’s no five-deep bar queues, plus you can do a covert French exit by pretending to have accidentally snagged your socks on some cables.Online rendezvous: The Red (On)Lion: a cyber pub from real ale aficionados Camra.

You’ve noticed, for example, how quickly all those online yoga classes and Zoom cocktail gatherings, intended to add some lightness to lockdown, began to feel vaguely like a chore. (You’re not imagining “Zoom fatigue”: experts say video conversations really are more tiring.) Likewise, “self-care” practices easily turn into new duties, so people end up forcing themselves to be kind to themselves, which doesn’t make much sense.This is why what I think we probably ought to be doing, to whatever extent possible, is having more fun. Not meditation or gratitude journalling or jogging (unless you find those fun). Not things you think are supposed to be fun. I mean the things you actually find fun. This distinction matters, partly for the aforementioned reason that self-care, however important, isn’t synonymous with fun. But it’s also because in the modern attention economy, all sorts of things – celebrity memoirs, bad new TV dramas, expensive consumer goods – want you to believe they’re the funnest thing you could be doing. Conceivably, for any given person, they might be. But true fun – “deep fun”, as the fun scholar Bernie De Koven called it – is a subtle and personal thing, and not necessarily in anyone else’s commercial interests.To be clear, I’m not advising that you consciously try to spread fun that always backfires. I just mean having fun, and thereby adding to the planetary quotient of fun. For me, in recent weeks, that’s meant taking very hot baths, listening to old Ricky Gervais podcasts, banging out piano-rock tunes in a mediocre fashion, and reading philosophy books. (Not all at once.) I’m aware this might make me sound like an unrelatable dork, but that’s a clue: one way to reconnect to fun might be to ask what you do that would make others think that about you. I think often about last year’s revelation that Sir Rod Stewart has been at work for decades on an intricate model railway layout of a 1940s American city, requesting an additional hotel room for it when he went on tour. It’s a hobby so at odds with the image of a gravel-voiced rock star that you know he must do it out of love.Alternatively, ask yourself Carl Jung’s question: “What did you do as a child that made the hours pass like minutes?” And, in fact, this doubles as useful parenting advice for those who find themselves spending much more time with small children at the moment: consider selecting activities based on what you – not the kids – would find most fun. (“You can only have fun helping other people have fun if you’re having fun doing it,” as De Koven put it.) Surprisingly frequently, it works.Oh, and there are numerous studies showing that fun will help your relationships and health – lowering stress, boosting intelligence and the capacity to learn. But if I said much more about them, I’d risk encouraging you to seek fun for those reasons, rather than because it’s fun. Deep fun is its own justification. And only you can know, for sure, what counts for you.Your favourite book. Your actual favourite book, even if you’d be embarrassed to admit it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/794e599209ec581349043835bb6ffc0ada1fa38e/0_0_5354_3213/master/5354.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc9cbb66bf5ea24448bc1b5261b91f2a","title":"i got intimate with one of my lodgers and now im in turmoil","story":"I have always maintained a professional relationship with my two female lodgers but spending more time together recently led to a lapse in judgmentI share my house with two female lodgers.

I have also started to resent people with partners, children or cuddly pets (which I have not done before).I cannot enjoy my many usual activities away from home, and without these prompts I have to make a real effort to give my day some structure. I am coping and am not especially vulnerable, but the many words written on the difficulties of being shut at home with a family are starting to make me feel invisible.You are certainly not alone in how you feel. But while it is normal and understandable, it doesn’t make it any easier to cope with. Three things jumped out at me from your letter: being widowed (my condolences), your use of the word “should”, and your newfound resentment, all things I felt were worth exploring.Your letter displayed no self-pity and you sound as if you take responsibility for yourself (that’s a major plus, as many don’t). But your use of the word “should” belied that you feel you ought to be fine, but you’re not. And isn’t that OK? To not feel fine, to not cope at times? Are you worried this is the new you? Because I don’t think it is.It sounds as if you’ve managed to control your feelings – of grief, loss, maybe anger and fear – until now. In lockdown, life is necessarily small and shrunken, and perhaps the negative feelings we’ve managed to keep in abeyance can suddenly loom large. I think this may also explain why you are now feeling resentful of people having things you don’t. This is completely understandable and not a sign of a change in your personality – rather a reaction to a very difficult, but transient, situation.With regard to resentment, Wood flagged something important, of which we should all take note in these days of social media, when others can appear to have a better life: “Envy can start as a sort of admiration for others but can end up with us begrudging people for what they have. Envy thrives when you can’t check out the reality, and one of the things about isolation is that you can imagine everybody else is in happy families together, doing enjoyable things and that makes your aloneness feel much more painful and more acute.”Even within these restrained times, it’s important to look at what makes us feel better, what makes us feel like us. It’s different for everyone. Like you, I need routine, so I’ve been careful to implement one. Can you try to think of things that might make you feel better? And then work out what is achievable? (I realise hugs and physical closeness can’t happen now.)It’s great that you talk to people regularly. Wood wondered if friends ask what they can do to help might it be an idea to ask them to ring at the same time every day to give a sense of structure? I am not a fan of video calls but in these last few weeks they have been life-affirming. I know one man who uses them to read his grandchildren a story every night, which makes him feel connected and useful, and gives his son 10 minutes of breathing space at bedtime.“It’s incredibly important,” said Wood, “for us to be connected and to be seen, not just in a physical sense but seen for who we are, and, in a way, what isolation is asking us is to be invisible.”Do you thrive on helping? Is there some way you could help those in your community? These connections make us human, and if there’s some way you can achieve that it may make you realise that, while you are not as visible just at the moment, you are still vital.• Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.

I ventured to our local shop to get the required items (as part of our shop for essentials, so don’t tweet me). I joined the socially distanced queue, having done the thing that everyone does of speculating whether the spacings are big enough before doing so.I was in that queue for about 40 minutes. I have no problem with that in itself, but the issue was that 40 minutes is sufficient time to engage in numerous conversations with other people in the queue. Small talk is awful at the best of times but in lockdown it takes on new levels. The other day, on our government-authorised walk, a man across the road engaged me in conversation. What followed was some chat along the lines of: “It was OK at first wasn’t it, but now it’s getting a bit much, not sure when it’s going to end.” As we walked away, my eldest son said, “That was the most boring conversation I’ve ever heard.”Lockdown queue conversations consist almost entirely of craning your neck, tutting at the queue ahead and saying something along the lines of: “Doesn’t really seem to be moving… Why is this taking so long… You’d think people would move quicker through the shop in the circumstances.” I am writing this as if I did not get involved, but I have to confess that I was guilty of shaking my head and shrugging at the other waiting customers. They would shrug back, and if we felt a connection had been made, we might even tut, as if the people shopping inside were being deliberately slow to spite us.This was all well and good, but it did have the effect of building up some pressure once I got into the shop. The anxiety I felt at potentially being accused of taking an inconsiderately long time meant that I basically whipped around throwing stuff into my basket like I was on Supermarket Sweep. The pressure was compounded by all the signs explaining the one-way system and how you are not supposed to go back on yourself. My son had asked for some crisps, and I was in such a rush I walked past them and felt too scared to go back.My only delays were when I had to keep my distance from someone who was having some sort of existential debate about which bread to buy. I had to stand at a distance and silently watch her flit from bread to bread for what felt like 10 minutes, all the while suppressing the urge to shout: “Maybe you should have thought about what bread you might want before coming in here!”Once she had made her choice, I whipped off again, racing around as if expecting the queue to applaud me for getting my shopping done quickly. Obviously that didn’t happen. What actually happened was that I came out, and a woman tutted at me because she’d been waiting in the queue for ages, and didn’t know of my sacrifice. I may as well have taken my time.This feeling was reinforced when I returned home and was subject to a roast by my family, as my wife went through the things I had bought, and they all laughed and took turns at gags about the choices I had made in the heat of the moment. As they tore me to shreds I found myself missing the times I used to shake my head and tut with my queue friends. Good times."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c830edd0e5b43d1d93849c9f7bec97e4f9589e2d/0_56_5176_3106/master/5176.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2688a5751e7f2c8f1f46d71947ef56a","title":"rupert murdoch bonus news corp loses 1bn three months","story":"Huge losses driven partly by fall in valuation of Australian pay TV service Foxtel and decline in news advertising revenue Rupert Murdoch’s global media empire, News Corp, lost US$1bn in the three months to the end of March and is expecting more financial pain as the economic fallout from the coronavirus crisis continues.The chief executive, Robert Thomson, said there was a fresh wave of cost-cutting ahead for the group, including a “strategic review of our Australian newspaper holdings” that could signal further job losses at the company’s smaller mastheads.He said he was giving up three quarters of his bonus, while Murdoch, who is executive chairman, had forgone his entire bonus.News Corp said the mammoth loss was primarily driven by the company’s decision to slash the valuation of its troubled Australian subscription TV business, Foxtel, which has been struggling to compete against streaming services, and reclassify its US coupon business News America Marketing as an asset held for sale. (The business was sold earlier this week, after the end of the quarter.)Thomson said the results “demonstrate the strength of News Corp and the power of our premium content”.He said the company had US$1.4bn in “cash and cash equivalents” on hand and the ability to borrow an additional US$750m.Following the sale of News America Marketing the company was “continuing to simplify our company to highlight the intrinsic value of our core businesses, including the strategic review of our Australian newspaper holdings, focusing on our larger brands and our digital reach”, he said.“Clearly the pandemic will have an impact on our results in the fourth quarter, but all of our businesses are embarking on cost-cutting programs intended to deal with short-term need but also to ensure that the company is well-equipped to prosper in a decidedly different business environment after the crisis abates.”The hunger for information about the coronavirus has sent readership numbers skyrocketing during the pandemic, but many news organisations have struggled to convert the extra attention into dollars due to the devastation the shutdown has wrought on big advertisers such as retailers.News Corp last month suspended printing 60 regional Australian titles after real estate, event and restaurant ads dried up.In March the chief executive of News Corp Australasia, Michael Miller, warned staff it was “clear that some job losses will be inevitable” due to the crisis.To cut costs, some staff have also been asked to take leave or work a shorter week.However, Thomson said subscriptions were up at News Corp’s Dow Jones ision, which includes its financial masthead, the Wall Street Journal. The Journal “reached approximately 3 million subscribers in the last week, a new record, with over 2.2 million that are digital-only”, he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98294134d254fe5412b541a1933866049b0d1fb3/0_390_5184_3108/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04e2e576cc388f72b4dc774611f142bf","title":"homebuyers plotting move to country amid increased home working","story":"Estate agents report rise in buyer registrations around Winchester and BerkshireAfter the lockdown, the exodus. Estate agents are reporting a surge in the numbers of would-be homebuyers plotting a move out of the city to a rural area or smaller town as people conclude that home working is here to stay.Firms said that during the last few weeks they had seen a big increase in enquiries about well-connected countryside and “out of city” locations – ranging from English market towns to Scottish fishing villages – where people could split their working week between home and office once life starts to return to normal.The upmarket estate agent Savills said locations that had seen a rise in buyer registrations included the areas in and around Winchester in Hampshire, Newbury in Berkshire, Canford Cliffs in Dorset and the East Neuk of Fife on the east coast of Scotland.Lockdown appears to be prompting many people to reassess what is important to them, whether that is a desire to continue working from home for part of the week once normal service resumes or wanting a bigger garden for their children to play in.The pandemic has effectively pushed the UK housing market into a temporary deep freeze, with people being told by the government to postpone moving until a later date, and there have been claims that several hundred thousand home sales will be abandoned this year.Andrew Perratt, the head of country residential at Savills, said it might be easy to dismiss an increase in web visits as largely being down to “bored dreamers” sitting at home surfing the internet, but he added: “What is most significant for me is the jump in new buyer registrations.”Perratt said the big demand was for properties in “the country markets around the major cities,” which included villages and market towns.The mass switch to working from home had proved that “you don’t need to be in London, or another city, five days a week,” he said. “I think there are lessons to be learned for all of us in terms of the number of times we need to visit a city during a working week.”This prompted the firm to talk about a potential “rural renaissance”. Winchester has reasonably good rail links with London, with a journey time of just over an hour, and lies at the western end of the South Downs national park. The average house price there is £419,000, compared with £477,000 in London, according to the most recent official Land Registry data.Newbury is well known for its strong transport links, lies on the edge of the Berkshire Downs and is surrounded by attractive villages such as Highclere and Hermitage.Perratt said his theory was that Canford Cliffs, an affluent suburb of Poole in Dorset, was an area where some wealthy Londoners were lucky enough to already own a bolthole to escape to, and that some may be looking to “flip” their life so that this becomes their principal residence instead of London.Similarly with the East Neuk of Fife, which includes picturesque fishing towns such as Anstruther, people might be looking to swap their Edinburgh townhouse for a smaller flat and use the proceeds to buy a bigger home on the coast, he added.At the Douglas Allen branch in Brentwood, Essex, manager Reece Giles said interest from potential buyers in nearby London boroughs looking to relocate to the area “has kind of gone through the roof”. The Brentwood area includes villages such as Navestock that offer the benefits of rural life but are within an easy commute of London.The Savills research also found that one in six respondents were ready for a longer commute, with the firm saying it believed some people would be prepared to put up with a two-hour journey to work if they were only going into the office for a couple of days a week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5777c704694e54f6e256bc1e30037de59df566d4/0_238_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f4b37b33c0b92a1cc34c80cab9aa6b5","title":"ty dextrous artist uk rap culture coronavirus","story":"Ty, who has died aged 47 of coronavirus, was a sharp and witty MC who ably nourished the UK hip-hop scene despite being ignored by the mediaThe death of British rapper Ty, aged 47, to complications from coronavirus came as a shock because it had appeared he was on his way to recovery after being moved out of intensive care. And for those of us who grew up with Ty’s voice circling our bedrooms, the shock resonates: this is an artist who touched so many with his humour and sharpness on the mic.While all eyes were on grime in the early 2000s, Ty was charting a journey to a frontier that had yet to be fully explored. In 2001, he released his debut album, Awkward, on Big Dada, one of the few labels that would give a home to UK hip-hop acts such as Roots Manuva, Juice Aleem and Speech Debelle. It was the year of era-defining US albums such as Jay-Z’s The Blueprint and Nas’s Stillmatic, when the mainstream had gone the way of the shiny suit. But across the Atlantic, Ty ushered in the UK’s own hip-hop golden age, leaning towards the genre’s soul, jazz and funk origins.Ty was a bridge. He showed that the isions between UK hip-hop and the upstart genre, grime, were illusory his music conjures memories of the Kung Fu club night at Camden’s Underworld, where you’d see grime and hip-hop heads shoulder to shoulder. He understood that many of the young MCs coming up in grime came from the same blocks and streets as the rappers in the hip-hop space. His appearance alongside Skepta and others on the remix of Bashy’s Black Boys showed this guest spots on other tracks such as Let It Go by Rukus – which flirts with the borders of grime and hip-hop – also revealed just how ambidextrous his flow was. By now it was 2007, and fans had firmly drawn lines between UK hip-hop, grime and road rap. But it was evident in Ty’s collaborations that all genres were of the same genealogical tree.At the same time, it’s important to acknowledge Ty’s staunch criticism of an industry that has historically failed to give UK hip-hop its proper due. UK hip-hop first made waves in the 80s with the likes of London Posse – Ty would later work with Posse member Rodney P as part of supergroup Kingdem with Blak Twang – but it struggled for attention in British media, first amid the Britpop indie boom, then later as grime had the shock of the new. As recently as 2018 Ty was complaining that “our music is considered ‘unclassic’ by mainstream British culture. It’s considered throwaway and vague.”He also criticised some within the scene, drawing comparisons between more commercial rap music and what he saw as the greater integrity of hip-hop. In 2006 he said the British scene “deserves the cold shoulder it’s getting because it’s not pushed forward … what people are doing … is really rap music, which just focuses on the production of the music. Hip-hop is the whole thing.” He concluded: “I am treated like a little child in the UK because I do hip-hop.”Arguably, though, the scene thrived out of plain sight and remained unadulterated. He could create comedy sketches informed by life experiences we could all relate to, such as on Hercules, about the acute anxieties of the school playground: “Bazooka Bubblegum, Space Dust and Wham!  Technicolour bed fluff meant I wasn’t the man  For kiss chase, now that was a real trauma  girls would break down and cry if I caught them in a corner.” Few songs carried depth and potency quite like The Nonsense from Awkward, with its bruised psychedelic soul, or The Willing from his Mercury-nominated second album Upwards, featuring the late Tony Allen, who died just last week.For someone like me who grew up second-gen in a Nigerian household, hearing Ty work with someone who could have been his father, or grandfather, spoke to how intergenerational UK hip-hop has always been, and how Ty advocated for that. He founded a hip-hop education programme in the 1990s called Ghetto Grammar, but the work didn’t stop when he signed to Big Dada – last year he hosted an event, Pass the Torch, a showcase of talent with Ty nourishing the next generation of MCs. On social media there’s been an outpouring of love from artists such as Awate, Children of Zeus and Akala who all saw him as a mentor of sorts – the tributes pouring in show just how many people Ty poured his wisdom into.There’s an unsettling irony in Ty receiving so much love and praise in his passing when he was ignored for so long. But it’s clear that, away from the media, he was the soundtrack to a lot of people’s lives in the early 2000s and beyond, and it was the potency and depth in his lyricism and storytelling that drew us closer. Ty’s work showed how much of a fallacy the ides in British rap have been – we would do well to do as he did and strive for excellence regardless of genre.There is no comparison to him the old patronising framing of “the UK version of (insert US name here)” won’t work. Ty’s artistry was unique, bound by his own lived experiences and the way he saw the world, communicated through his gift of repartee and sharpness. When the time comes to weave the tapestry telling UK hip-hop’s whole story, Ty has to be one of the key threads."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ff969f20f624a89c5585d3811598674ac134743/0_12_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74704683d58599724162bdf64e619e5e","title":"reopening mississippi americas poorest state begins lifting lockdown podcast","story":"Despite rising coronavirus case numbers, the US state of Mississippi is moving out of lockdown and reopening parks, restaurants and other non-essential shops.

It’s Simon Murphy here taking over the UK live blog from my colleague, Matthew Weaver. There has been a sharp rise in the number of people being moved on by Police Scotland because they are not adhering to lockdown guidance, according to the latest figures released by the force.Some 13,717 people were asked to disperse from a public place in the fortnight from 23 April to 6 May, taking the total since the emergency power came into force on 27 March to 18,357. An additional 2,851 people were dispersed with a police warning, taking the total to 41,999. A further 101 were returned home using reasonable force, taking that total to 212, and there have now been a total of 143 arrests and 2263 fixed penalty notices issued.Speaking at the Scottish government briefing this afternoon, chief constable Iain Livingstone acknowledged that there were more people on the streets now than at the start of the lockdown. He said: “I do think there have been remarkably high levels of consent, support and compliance but undeniably in recent weeks there are more people in public.”The six-week-old baby announced to have died in an English hospital is the youngest victim of the outbreak in the UK so far (see earlier). PA has this background:While it is much less likely for children to suffer severely from Covid-19 compared with adults, Friday’s NHS England figures show 12 deaths so far for hospital patients aged 0 to 19 who had tested positive.Some nine, including the baby, had a pre-existing health condition, while three did not. The youngest victim with no known underlying health issues was Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab, who died in March aged just 13.After his case emerged, one expert called for research into deaths which have occurred outside of patient groups believed to be at higher risk.Dr Nathalie MacDermott, an academic clinical lecturer at King’s College London, said at the time: It is essential that we undertake research to determine why a proportion of deaths occur outside of the groups expected to succumb to infection as it may indicate an underlying genetic susceptibility.Determining if this is the case could help us to learn more about the interaction of the virus with the immune system and subsequently what further treatments may be suitable in patients with severe infection.”People of all ages with underlying health problems are believed to be at higher risk from the effects of the virus. But a major British study of almost 17,000 patients with severe Covid-19 found that only a very small number of children fall seriously ill.Public Health Wales has announced another 28 coronavirus deaths taking the death toll to 1,090 in Wales. Earlier the first minister, Mark Drakeford, said the Welsh government estimates there will be another 800 deaths in Wales by 7 August if the R number stays at its current level of 0.8. If it increases to 1.1 the death toll would increase by 7,200 by August, he warned. Another five Covid-19 related deaths have been reported in Northern Ireland, the Department of Health said. It brings the total number of deaths to 427.Dr Andrew Freedman, reader in infectious diseases at Cardiff University School of Medicine, says it too risky to significantly lift the lockdown in Wales or the rest of the UK.Although we had all hoped that it might be possible for a more substantial relaxation of the lockdown restrictions at this stage, it is clear that the daily level of new infections is still too high and the R value too close to 1 to allow that to happen safely. We are clearly past the peak of this first wave, but a more major easing of the social distancing rules now would risk a large second wave a few weeks down the line, with increasing hospital admissions and deaths.It seems unlikely that these minor measures announced today by the First Minister for Wales will have any significant detrimental effect on the rate of new infections. We know that the risk of the infection being transmitted is much lower outdoors so exercising more than once a day should not pose a risk.I would expect similar measures to be announced by the other UK nations.Research by Citizens Advice suggests many vulnerable workers are having their health put at risk by their employer not furloughing them on the government’s scheme.A press release on the study said: The charity’s frontline advisers are helping workers in the shielded group, such as those undergoing chemotherapy, who have been denied furlough despite instructions to stay at home and avoid face-to-face contact. Many have been left relying on £95.85 per week from statutory sick pay and any additional benefits they might be entitled to. Employers are currently allowed to furlough people for any reason arising from the coronavirus pandemic, including to protect employees’ health. Citizens Advice is calling for the most vulnerable workers to have a right to be furloughed if their work would require them to breach public health advice. This should include people in the shielded group or who share a household with someone in the shielded group. These workers should also be able to retain access to the Job Retention Scheme for as long as public health advice requires them not to work.Food shop key worker Colleen, 55, is in the shielded group as she has Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. She has been denied furlough and instead put on Statutory Sick Pay. Her husband works as a carer and so can’t return home.“Being on SSP means I take home over £200 a month less than if I was working. I’m struggling to pay my normal bills and buy things like food. I’ve had to sign up to get food parcels as I just don’t have enough money. My friend has dropped me bread and beans to get by.”Plans to ramp up rail services have been brought forward by a week and will start from next Monday, a union is claiming, PA reports.Services were expected to be increased gradually from 18 May as part of an easing of the economic lockdown.The Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) said it had discovered that the plans had been brought forward to start on Monday 11 May.Officials said the industry had been told to be ready to begin a last-minute mobilisation to accommodate an increase in passenger numbers from Monday in reaction to the prime minister’s address on Sunday.The RMT said the move overrules a planning document sent to the unions on Thursday by the Rail Industry Coronavirus Forum, a rail industry and trade union body established to put in place arrangements to protect passengers and workers.The document said services would be increased in phases, with a “stepped” increase from 18 May, said the RMT. General secretary Mick Cash said: “We have it on good authority that the rail network has been put on notice to begin a last-minute mobilisation to accommodate an increase in passenger numbers from Monday.”A pilot on the Isle of Wight for the new contact tracing app appears to have got off to a bumpy start – with emerging signs of a generational ide.Although most locals told the  they were broadly supportive of the idea, questions have been raised about glitches on some phones and the potential lack of takeup among the island’s older, less tech-savvy residents.And just as the NHS Covid-19 app was unveiled to the island on Thursday morning, it was dealt a further blow when a parliamentary committee warned it must not be released in its current form without increased privacy and data protections. Meanwhile, it emerged that Downing Street is leaving open the prospect of ditching the app entirely and instead opting for a “decentralised” model favoured by Apple and Google.By late morning on Thursday, 33,000 of the Isle of Wight’s 140,000 residents were undeterred and had downloaded it, with 28 logging symptoms, the local Tory MP Bob Seely said. (Key workers had access to the app earlier in the week.) Later in the day, downloads topped 40,000.Here’s the top part of PA’s take on Nicola Sturgeon’s press conference:The four UK nations may need to move at different speeds on easing lockdown, Nicola Sturgeon said as she urged Scots to stick with the current coronavirus restrictions.Prime Minster Boris Johnson spoke with the leaders of the devolved nations on Thursday, ahead of an expected announcement on easing parts of the lockdown in England on Sunday.Wales’ first minister, Mark Drakeford, has announced three “modest adjustments” from Monday to restrictions there.But Sturgeon has said the only change in Scotland would be allowing people to leave their house for exercise more than once a day.Speaking at her daily coronavirus briefing, she said there was a “helpful recognition” in her call with the prime minister that the “four UK nations may well move at different speeds if our data about the spread of the virus says that that is necessary to suppress it”.Sturgeon said after talks with the PM on Thursday about his plans that she expected any differences between the nations to be initially “quite minor”.She stressed: “I wouldn’t anticipate a radical departure in the immediate term, if the sense I am getting from the UK government now turns out to be the reality.”But she added that planning and messaging would continue to be co-ordinated.The Scottish government said its data suggested the R-number was higher in Scotland than the rest of the UK - with this estimated to be between 0.7 and one in Scotland, compared to between 0.5 and 0.9 in the UK.Almost 3,000 male prisoners in Wales are being held in shared cells despite the threat from coronavirus, Plaid Cymru has discovered.These are shocking revelations that show a deeply dangerous lack of action to protect those that work in prisons as well as inmates.Keith Neal, emeritus professor of the epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham, says the modest easing of the lockdown in Wales poses “very little, if any, risk of new infections” and the Welsh government should have gone further. It is disappointing that other forms of leisure and exercise have not been included to improve people’s physical and mental health. The evidence against other leisure activities not being allowed where social distancing can be maintained easily should be published to justify this decision. This particularly applies to fishing and sunbathing in a park.Recycling centres have already reopened in England and the nature of these sites intrinsically allows social distancing if site specific measures are put in place.Garden centres have always been near the top of the list for re-opening. Zoos are also large open spaces which would readily allow even more social distancing and it is a pity there has not been more consistency.If libraries can open, presumably with social distancing, it is difficult to see why shops of similar sizes can’t also reopen.The decision to maintain most of the lockdown is warranted but given more evidence on the analyses of lockdowns across Europe and lifting in many countries we need to see the evidence on why these decisions have been made and this will maintain confidence in following the science. The different UK administrations say they want to work and stay in line and keep the messaging consistent but announcing different measures or the same measures two days early needs to be justified and explained.Given the epidemic is really a series of multiple epidemics across the UK it is likely one size does not fit all and therefore different approaches are warranted. This particularly applies to various smaller islands around the UK, rural vs cities and also Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to work as one body.Here’s a roundup of the latest developments on coronavirus in the UKUK scientists’ fury over attempt to censor Covid-19 adviceGovernment scientific advisers are furious at what they see as an attempt to censor their advice on government proposals during the Covid-19 lockdown by heavily redacting an official report before it was released to the public, the  can reveal. The report was one of a series of documents published by Sage this week to mollify growing criticism about the lack of transparency over the advice given to ministers responding to the coronavirus. However large blocks of text in the report, produced by SPI-B, the Sage subcommittee providing advice from behavioural scientists on how the public might respond to lockdown measures, were entirely blanked out.Baby among 332 more victims in English hospitalsNHS England said a further 332 people have died in English hospital after testing positive for Covid-19. It brings England’s coronavirus death toll in hospitals to 22,764. The youngest victim was a six-week-old baby with underlying health problems, NHS England said. The oldest victim was 103.Wales unveils modest easing of the lockdownThe first minister, Mark Drakeford, says it is too soon to ease the lockdown in Wales but announced three modest adjustments. Schools will not be opened at the start of June, Drakeford confirmed. He also revealed the R number in Wales is estimated to be 0.8 and if it stays at that level 800 people will die in Wales by August. If it increases to 1.1 an estimated 7,200 will die in Wales. Sturgeon warns against easing the lockdown Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said she was only considering relaxing the restrictions on exercising, saying the R number in Scotland was too close to 1 to contemplate any other easing measures. She also announced a further 49 deaths in Scotland taking its death toll to 1,811. She said: “By easing restrictions prematurely we would risk undoing all the progress that we’ve made, we would risk allowing the virus to spread out of control and that would cost lives.”Rail services set to increaseTransport sources have revealed plans for a gradual easing of the lockdown from 18 May. The Department for Transport confirmed a “range of options” were being considered. Union leaders stressed they wanted to make sure their members’ safety was protected, with one saying lifting the lockdown was “fraught with danger”.Calls to ease lockdown for angling, shooting and bowlsAnglers, game shooting enthusiasts and bowls clubs are increasing the pressure for the lockdown to be eased for their sports, arguing that they can resume them while remaining physically distanced. Lobbyists for fishing and game shooting claim that continuing strict lockdown restrictions for their pursuits could cost the UK economy millions of pounds and lead to thousands of job losses.Nine Chelsea pensioners have died from Covid-19The Royal Hospital Chelsea, the retirement home for British military veterans, which has 290 residents, made the announcement before VE Day on Friday. Five of the deaths occurred in the home, and four died while receiving hospital treatment elsewhere. A total of 58 of its residents, known as Chelsea pensioners, have recovered from the disease."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9571ab7d45736d98a5a8babe8926d5f17ade36a1/0_126_5228_3137/master/5228.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=520c25091d623ed6ce402630ba81bf55","title":"who conditionally backs covid 19 vaccine trials that infect people","story":"‘Challenge’ studies would deliberately give coronavirus to healthy volunteers Controversial trials in which volunteers are intentionally infected with Covid-19 could accelerate vaccine development, according to the World Health Organization, which has released new guidance on how the approach could be ethically justified despite the potential dangers for participants.So-called challenge trials are a mainstream approach in vaccine development and have been used in malaria, typhoid and flu – but for these diseases there are treatments available if a volunteer becomes severely ill. For Covid-19, a safe dose of the virus has not been established and there are no failsafe treatments if things go wrong.However, there is a growing consensus among scientists that such trials should be considered, with the WHO becoming the latest body to indicate conditional support for the idea.“There’s this emerging consensus among everyone who has thought about this seriously,” said Prof Nir Eyal, director of Rutgers University’s Center for Population-Level Bioethics in the US.The prospect of infecting healthy iniduals with a potentially deadly pathogen may sound counterintuitive. But, according to Eyal, the risk of death from Covid-19 for someone in their 20s is around one in 3,000 – similar to the risk for live kidney donation. In this case, the potential benefits would extend not to a single inidual, but thousands or millions who could be protected by a vaccine.“Once you give it thought, it is surprisingly easier to approve than dispatching volunteers as part-time medical workers and other practices that we’ve already accepted,” he said.In new guidance, issued this week, the WHO said that well-designed challenge studies could accelerate Covid-19 vaccine development and also make it more likely that the vaccines ultimately deployed are more effective. The WHO lists eight criteria that would need to be met for the approach to be ethically justified, including restricting participation to healthy people aged 18-30 and fully informed consent. Strikingly, the guidelines do not rule out challenge trials in the absence of an effective treatment, instead stating that the risk could fall “within acceptable upper limits” for such research.“The big news is that WHO doesn’t say challenge trials are forbidden. It specifies reasonable steps on how they can be deployed,” said Eyal.Vaccines are typically tested using a large group of people whose infection rates are compared with a separate group of unvaccinated controls. However, waiting for enough people to be exposed to an illness can take months and require thousands of participants. In a fast-moving pandemic situation, there is a risk of trials grinding to a standstill as infection rates fall in some regions. Challenge trials side-step this problem, allowing efficacy to be established within weeks using just 100 or so volunteers.However, for Covid-19 a safe dose would need to be established – enough to cause illness, but not severe illness, which could be a very fine line – through initial dose escalation studies. Such studies would need to be conducted in secure facilities to avoid unintentionally infecting anyone outside the trial and would pose uncertain levels of risk to participants.Prof Andrew Pollard, who is leading the trial of the vaccine developed by the team at the University of Oxford’s Jenner Institute, said there is “huge interest” in the possibility of challenge trials among those working on vaccines against coronavirus.“At the moment, because we don’t have a rescue therapy we have to approach challenge studies extremely cautiously,” said Pollard. “But I don’t think it should be ruled out because, particularly in a situation where it’s very difficult to assess some of the new vaccines coming along because there’s not much disease around, it could be one of the ways we could get that answer more quickly.”Others are more cautious and say it would be impossible to launch such a trial in the absence of robust treatments.In the US, a campaign group 1DaySooner, has set up a website to demonstrate public support for challenge trials, which has signed up more than 14,000 volunteers from 102 countries who say they would be prepared to participate.Sophie Rose, a Stanford graduate who co-founded the campaign, who is currently based in Oxford, said she was motivated by the potential for widespread suffering and loss of life posed by the pandemic. “As a young, healthy 22-year-old, I feel that volunteering to participate in a challenge trial … could make a non-trivial positive impact on society,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50bb2ef31d4f3962349f2993a008836d3158b457/150_74_2757_1655/master/2757.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b370aba356a26fbc51d4ae415216e3d","title":"the eddy review damien chazelle netflix","story":"Far from La La Land, Damien Chazelle’s Netflix series struggles to meld its story of poverty and precarity in the Parisian underbelly with its extended musical interludes If you come to The Eddy (Netflix) with hopes for a reprise of its executive producer and lead director Damien Chazelle’s Oscar-winning La La Land, you should set them quietly aside. Look elsewhere for your sunlit musical romcom needs, and save his new eight-part series for your darker moods.The Eddy is set in Paris. Not in the city’s sparkling centre but in the grittier, graffitied margins. The title takes its name from the jazz club owned and run by virtuosic jazz pianist Elliot (André Holland) who fled New York for Europe when his young son died, and his friend Farid (Tahar Rahim), whose ebullience and optimism are in stark contrast to his withdrawn and wounded friend.It’s a world of hustlers and immigrants, united by their ability to come together and make music – if not quite enough money. There are glimpses of hope, when respected managers appear at the back of the audience to cast an appraising eye on the talent but it never amounts to anything more than a word of encouragement or an exhortation for Elliot to get up on stage himself and return to what he does best.His club is struggling. Bands play to half-empty rooms and Elliot has added another complication to his business venture by having – and breaking off – a relationship Maja (Joanna Kulig), the singer of the best band they host. Feelings twang like a untuned double bass and although Farid does his best to restore harmony, the musicians and everyone else are unsettled and frustratingly – sometimes literally – out of sync with each other. To this mess is added Elliot’s rebellious teenage daughter Julie (Amandla Stenberg) who arrives from New York to spend some time with her dear old dad, and possibly to escape her drug habit and her stepfather.The only remotely happy character is Farid, a devoted husband and father whose tender, sexy relationship with his wife (Amira, played by Leïla Bekhti) springs to life beautifully in just a handful of scenes. So it is of a piece with this unrelievedly sombre and melancholic series that Farid is soon killed. He had borrowed money from criminal gangs to try to save the Eddy from financial ruin. In a way, the plan works – at least temporarily – as the club fills with gawkers and ghouls eager to spend an evening at a murder scene.Each episode centres on a different character and their more-or-less bedevilled backgrounds, involving drug abuse, poverty and various forms of chaos that the semi-itinerant musician is susceptible to. The Eddy sustains them – it is a place of relative calm (at least for those not charged with keeping it afloat) where they can rest and gather themselves to create a few minutes of magic on stage before the current of life snatches them away again.There is little narrative light or air let into its eight hours. What it has instead is large pauses to let the cast – who are almost all accomplished musicians or singers, many in their first acting roles – play full jazz numbers. All the tunes are original (written by Glen Ballard and Randy Kerber), and the performance and rehearsal scenes dominate they are filmed at such length and in such loving detail that it is obvious where the creator’s heart and interest lies. Chazelle may only have directed the first two episodes, but he sets the tone.And the sessions are brilliant. But they don’t serve the slow, slight plot and for anyone whose interests lie more in the drama than the music, these extended interludes may well tip the balance into outright tedium. Call it the Treme trap.The script, by Bafta-award winning Jack Thorne (This Is England, National Treasure, the recent adaptation of His Dark Materials and much outstanding else besides) is not one that shines, though it does dip in and out of multiple languages, and give a great sense of the deeper bond among the people who end up in the Eddy together, even as they struggle and clash on the surface.True jazz fans may find it the perfect riff on the basic gangster plot. The rest of us, perhaps, not so much."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/491a5067512d5d7904c54e250de36a52b4c2978d/0_52_4810_2888/master/4810.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68972cc0ac38bb28a2ecfdfac1358788","title":"coronavirus face mask exercise outside","story":"It’s important to get fresh air and exercise – but do we need to wear masks while running, walking and cycling? We asked some expertsTo mask or not to mask while getting fresh air is the question many of us are asking ourselves. According to the CDC, we should wear masks in “areas of significant community-based transmission”, such as grocery stores and pharmacies. While the CDC doesn’t list the outdoors as a high-density space, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s OK to exercise outdoors mask-free.Because breathing harder may release more virus into the air, Ben Levine, physician and director of the Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, told NPR we should double our distance while exercising outside.Alex McDonald In short, yes. Taking deeper and harder breaths when exercising likely causes more viral shedding, especially if exercising outside where the wind can blow and dissipate the virus. Taking that into consideration, it is likely that due to increased viral shedding iniduals that are exercising should probably be more than 6ft apart.Jessalyn Adam We don’t have an answer. The recommendation of staying at least 6ft apart under normal circumstances is actually based on what we know about the flu. While coronavirus behaves differently, we’re doing our best to make inferences.That said, experts are recommending that while running you stay at least 13ft away from others. To minimize the risk as much as you can, put as much space between yourself and others as possible while biking.Adam If you’re totally alone or just with people from your own household then that’s fine to go without. However, if there are other people on the trail, wear your mask as you approach and while passing and do your best to try to put as much space as you can between you and the other person. If the terrain doesn’t allow you to put a lot of distance between yourself and the other person, turn away while passing so you’re breathing in the opposite direction.If you’re just passing another person and particularly if you’re just walking and not breathing heavily then I think it’s pretty low-risk.Kelley Vargo The purpose of the mask is more to prevent you from spreading the virus as opposed to keeping you from getting it. If you are feeling sick or “off” you should forgo going on a public trail. Consider exercising at home until you’re feeling OK, because this isn’t just about protecting yourself from the virus – we also don’t want to infect other people.Vargo Training with a mask, especially a homemade mask or an N95 mask will not replicate the effects of altitude training. If you really want to get an edge on your cardiovascular performance as it relates to altitude training, you should train at high altitude.Responses were edited for length and clarity"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29a962165ef5955d285bfbf5fdbf940c1a419763/0_113_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f7c93636ee2798e144dac5fc5d5b563","title":"do you believe you were infected by coronavirus at a big event in march","story":"We’d like to hear from those who attended events between the end of February and early March such as Wolves v Eyol and Cheltenham FestivalWe’d like you to help us document the spread of coronavirus due to some of the mega-events that went ahead between the end of February and the first couple of weeks in March.

Yet their disappointment is tempered by the same stoicism that got them through the war.“I can’t tell you how disappointed I am,” said Marie Scott, 93, who as a 17-year-old wireless operator heard first-hand the “bombs, gunfire, shouting and mayhem” of the D-day landings over the telephone in Portsmouth. “But in the present circumstances I think: what am I moaning about? All I’ve got is disappointment, whereas a lot of people have got far, far worse.”Scott, a retired secretary and grandmother, should have been in the Netherlands this week with the Taxi Charity for Military Veterans, marking Dutch Freedom day with others. There was to have been a parade, too, in central London, and a service at Westminster Abbey, followed by afternoon tea in a hotel and a meeting with old comrades, she said.She joined the million-strong crowd in central London on VE Day “where you were swept up with this sense of excitement and exhilaration”. “There was lots of hugging and kissing, all totally indiscriminate”. She remembers being alarmed by the density of the crowd, and fearful of being crushed.Now, on Friday, “I will probably be alone,” she said, “ though there will be masses of phone calls, and I’ve got my tiny little union jack.” At the end of the two minutes silence, at her flat near New Malden, south-west London, she intends to “raise a glass of something pleasant”.Ron Johnson, 98, from Shrivenham, near Swindon, was also expecting to be in Wageningen, in the Netherlands, with the Taxi Charity for Military Veterans, where he and other veterans would have be cheered by tens of thousands on Freedom Day. The retired businessman and grandfather has been before, “and it’s the most terrific experience, with people coming up to shake your hands.”“But, it’s gone. Kaput. It’s completely understandable. The world has shut down because of this virus,” said Johnson, an infantry officer with the Essex Regiment, then a glider pilot, who survived the bloody Battle of Arnhem despite being wounded by mortar fire and hit by a sniper’s bullet.Taken prisoner, he spent six months on a near starvation diet at Spangenberg Castle camp, then escaped when the Germans marched them out, and hid in hills for eight days until he was picked up by Americans. He arrived home in Grays, Essex, two days before VE Day.“On VE Day I got dressed up in service dress and headed into London, feeling smart though a bit thin and worn through lack of food.” He headed to Buckingham Palace, then he and two comrades went to a pub, in the company of “three young ladies from Scotland”.He thinks he will spend the anniversary mainly alone, although his daughter will visit. “And I shall be thinking chiefly about the terrible loss at Arnhem, which was really shocking, but not to dwell on it or to be too sad,” he said. He hopes to visit the Netherlands again in the future. “But, I’m 98 now, and it might have been my last opportunity.”Jim Healy, 95, a D-day veteran, missed VE Day as he was onboard HMS Persimmon in Bombay’s docks, preparing to head to Burma and “have a go at the Japanese”.“It was half-time for us,” said Healy, a former Royal Marine and retired printer from Middleton, Manchester, who lives alone.“The announcement came over the tannoy from the prime minister that they’d surrendered. It was quite joyful, to say the least.” They had to wait until the following day for their rum ration, “then it was quite a noisy party, but we were brought down to earth very rapidly because we were preparing for Burma.”He was to have been in London on Friday for the Royal British Legion celebrations and parade. Instead, his family will pay a distanced garden visit, and he plans to join the national singalong of We’ll Meet Again.“It would have been a joyful day. We missed the celebrations on VE Day, but saw pictures of people going mad in Manchester, London and Liverpool. I was looking forward to the anniversary. It would make up for what we missed when we were in India,” he said.For Jack Bracewell, 97, VE Day was spent in Schleswig-Holstein, in northern Germany. The following day, while visiting the house of a German family he had befriended, the door opened and the couple’s son entered in German uniform. No longer enemies, the two men shared “several drinks”. “It was over. And he was just another soldier,” recalled Bracewell, a D-day driver with the Royal Armoured Service Corps who experienced heavy fighting in Caen and at the Battle of Falaise.The retired driver, from Morecambe Bay, Lancashire, had hoped to attend three days of celebrations in London organised by the Royal British Legion. But his daughter and her husband, with whom he lives, are still pulling out all the stops.There will be bunting, bubbly, afternoon tea on the front lawn and 1940s music. Bracewell intends to wear a union jack sequinned bow tie. And though he can’t see his old comrades in the flesh, they will catch up on the day through video calls. “I’d love to have seen them. We were brothers. But, we can’t risk it with this virus,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3aa96924773bdb2c5ff2f45258986277e857b1b6/0_264_2941_1764/master/2941.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30d3178d389ed3a231bbd83697f8bad4","title":"ve day 75 timetable prince charles to lead event with two minute silence","story":"Prince will read from George VI’s diary, followed by doorstep singalong, Churchill speech and Captain Tom documentaryThe Prince of Wales is to lead the nation’s two-minute silence to mark the 75th anniversary of the ending of the second world war in Europe.Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall will pay their respects from Scotland at 11am on a day of celebration and commemoration that also includes an address by the Queen and a national singalong of the wartime classic We’ll Meet Again.Charles will later read extracts from the diary of his grandfather, George VI, written on 8 May 1945, to be broadcast on BBC One during the afternoon.

Manufacturers’ warehouses considered low risk for the virus could reopen as well.The new guidelines were announced by the California governor Gavin Newsom, and move the state into the second phase of a methodical four-step process to full reopening. They also allow some local governments to move faster with reopening than the state overall if the counties meet certain testing and tracing requirements and have a healthcare system that can handle a potential surge.“These counties that want to move deeper into the second phase have to do so with concurrence with their hospital systems, board of supervisors. We’re interested in their argument and will try to provide some flexibility. But it’s a health-first frame,” Newsom said at his daily briefing on Thursday.In many cities, the changes did not lead to immediate dramatic changes. Several local governments have announced they will take more time to open up, and many smaller retail stores have already organized curbside pickup. In the Los Angeles region, where half of the state’s Covid-19 deaths have occurred, officials are maintaining most restrictions and making only “minor adjustments”, allowing some brick-and-mortar business to start curbside pickup, including music stores, bookshops, florists and clothing stores.The county, which remains the primary coronavirus hotspot in California, was also reopening some popular hiking trails and golf courses, but have said residents must continue to practice social distancing and wear face coverings if near others. This first phase, LA officials said, is the beginning of “a slow and gradual change to a new reality” for Angelenos.The beaches in Orange county, which Newsom shut down after they drew massive crowds last month, are also reopening, but officials are keeping many parking lots closed and only allowing “active recreation” like running and swimming while banning sunbathing and stationary hangouts.The city of San Francisco said it, too, will allow some businesses to open with curbside pickup, but was delaying that move until 18 May. Like LA, bookstores, florists, and music stores will be the first merchants allowed to operate storefront pickup, the city said.“Giving businesses the option to reopen and provide storefront pickup will provide some relief for everyone in our city – allowing some people to get back to work, while still protecting public health,” the mayor, London Breed, said in a statement. “The last thing we want is to see a spike in the number of cases or hospitalizations, so we’re going to be keeping close track of our key Covid-19 indicators and will be ready to make any adjustment needed to keep our community healthy.”Some rural counties in northern California didn’t await the governor’s decision. Modoc county was the first last week to allow its only movie theater resume operations. Yuba and Sutter counties started opening up businesses such as retail stores, gyms, salons and tattoo parlors on Monday, prompting a warning from the governor they were making “a big mistake”.In Yuba City and Marysville on Tuesday, few customers wore masks when they entered stores or strolled along the sidewalks. The counties’ public health commissioner warned the business communities the next day to make sure employees and customers adhere to social distancing guidelines and wear face coverings. “It has become clear a number of businesses are not enacting required protocols to ensure the safety of the community,” Dr Phuong Luu said.Businesses across California, America’s most populous state, are eager to follow suit. Since the stay-at-home order was issued on 19 March, more than 4 million Californians have been put out of work. Newsom projected on Thursday the state will have a budget shortfall of $54.3bn because of the economic devastation wrought by the coronavirus.Small groups of protesters have gathered in cities across the state in recent weeks, urging Newsom to open up.Public health officials have cautioned, however, that the state has not seen a sustained decline in Covid-19 cases, and that its capabilities to test people and trace who might have been exposed to the virus are nowhere near those of countries like South Korea and Germany that have successfully eased restrictions.By Thursday, California had recorded more than 61,000 confirmed cases and 2,500 deaths. If the numbers continue to decline, the next phase in the governor’s plan could see salons, gyms, movie theaters and in-person church services resume. That phase, however, could be months away. Phase four would end all restrictions and allow for large gatherings at concerts and sporting events.Jefferson Wagner, owner of Zuma Jay surf shop along the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, put up a sign that said “no mask, no service” as he prepared to reopen Friday, allowing customers to order in advance and pick up surfboards, apparel or other items in the parking lot. “We’ve got full inventory. We’re well stocked after two months of doing nothing,” said Wagner, 66, who is also a longtime Hollywood special effects operator. “We’ve gotta get these businesses open … though in LA and Malibu, we’re not the kind to run around and carry banners and firearms to protest.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8799bfe3e0773c21480e58da0b82fbbe8bf97556/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=21dd02ce7585284abbfdc7634d518d78","title":"his head wasnt in the world of reality how the plot to invade venezuela fell apart","story":"Deeply flawed from the start, the audacious plan to overthrow Nicolás Maduro unravelled spectacularlyAs get-rich-quick schemes go it was unusually complicated. Invade a foreign country you know little about. Abduct its president to the US. Collect a $15m bounty from the US government – and maybe an even bigger payoff from the people who then seize power.The plan to overthrow Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, and bundle him off to Florida to face drug trafficking charges seemed foolproof to a former US army staff sergeant, Jordan Goudreau, as he mapped it out in a luxury Miami apartment in late 2019. The 43-year-old Canadian-American was certain his years as a green beret in Iraq and Afghanistan had prepared him for the task.And for the opponents of Maduro he was addressing, it must have sounded convincing – even after the failure of a previous coup attempt in 2019.Representatives of Juan Guaidó – the opposition leader recognised as Venezuela’s legitimate president by the US and most of its allies – signed a fat contract engaging Goudreau to overthrow Maduro.But in interviews with the , a senior opposition figure said they grew to doubt Goudreau and eventually broke with him months before he launched a disastrous raid this week that echoed the botched 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba.The flaws in his plan were laid bare as two bedraggled ex-US special forces soldiers were paraded alongside other members of the ragged invasion force. Airan Berry and Luke Denman were captured at sea before they even set foot on Venezuelan soil.Eight people were reported killed in the botched invasion and more than 100 others arrested. Berry and Denman later appeared on Venezuelan state television outlining the supposed plan to seize the presidential palace and whisk Maduro to the US.Goudreau announced what he called a “daring, amphibious raid” on Sunday afternoon. It was codenamed Operation Gideon after a biblical story symbolising the victory of a small military against a much stronger opponent.“Our units have been activated in the south, west and in the east of Venezuela,” he said, dressed in a golf shirt and standing next to a former Venezuelan national guard captain wearing body armour, Javier Nieto Quintero.But by then the plot had already fallen apart, not least because two days earlier the Associated Press had published a long investigation exposing the plan. If the AP knew it is likely the Venezuelan government did too.Goudreau served in the Canadian military in the 1990s and studied at the University of Calgary before joining the US green berets. He spent 15 years as a medical sergeant, doing several stints in Iraq and Afghanistan.After leaving the military Goudreau founded a security contractor, Silvercorp USA, in 2018. The company’s original plan was to provide guards to protect American schools from mass shootings.Silvercorp’s website trumpets a series of overblown claims including that Goudreau led “international security teams for the President of the United States” (he had provided private security at Trump political rallies).Early in 2019 Goudreau was providing security for a concert in aid of Venezuelan refugees on the Colombian border organised by Richard Branson, the billionaire owner of the Virgin conglomerate. There he met Cliver Alcalá, a Venezuelan former general who defected to the opposition. The pair began talking about how to overthrow Maduro.By September the plotting had progressed to a meeting in Miami between Goudreau and Juan José Rendón, a Venezuelan exile appointed by Guaidó to strategise ways of taking power.Rendón was well known in Latin American politics. He resigned as a strategist in then-Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos’s re-election campaigns amid allegations that he accepted bribes from drug lords. He was also accused of attempting to manipulate Mexico’s 2012 election. He has strongly denied both allegations.Guaidó had set up an advisory group to brainstorm ways to end the Maduro regime. Rendón’s job was to advise the commission on how to make that happen.He said the commission explored all legal means of ousting Maduro, including piracy laws. The commission also interviewed security consultants, mostly ex-soldiers offering specialist services for astronomical fees.“There were no limits – $1bn, $1.5bn,” Rendón told the .Goudreau’s firm was asking for far less – about $213m from Venezuela’s future oil earnings and a $1.5m retainer.“He was supposedly preparing something in Venezuela that would have gone through the Colombian border,” Rendón said.Goudreau told the Venezuelans he had 800 men ready to invade.A handful of meetings resulted in an agreement in October for “an operation to capturedetainremove Nicolás Maduro … remove the current regime and install the recognized Venezuelan President Juan Guaidó”.Goudreau has made public pages from the agreement – one of them ostensibly signed by Guaidó. The would-be president has said that it is not his signature and has previously denied any involvement..Rendón took the relationship seriously enough to pay Goudreau $50,000 of his own money to cover expenses. “He complained to me that I was a wealthy person and he was not and he was spending money,” Rendón said.Under the agreement Silvercorp had 45 days to train and equip the invasion force before teams of men would infiltrate Venezuela to seize key locations and buildings, and encourage a general uprising.But Rendón soon came to doubt that Goudreau had the military resources or competence he claimed, and grew concerned by his erratic behaviour – including his repeated demands for money.Rendón showed the  copies of increasingly angry texts he said were from Goudreau, demanding a $1.5m advance. “I will get the 1.5 the legal way. What a shame,” one text said. “We gave this to you on a silver platter and you fucked the whole thing up.”“Your credibility in DC because of this is gone,” another text said. “You are a multimillionaire. Shame on you for not fixing your country. You don’t deserve to live in the USA.”Neither Goudreau nor his lawyer returned calls seeking comment.As the abortive raid was under way, Goudreau told Factores de Poder, a Miami-based Youtube channel: “They kept promising to pay week after week. So that lasted about a month but then we kind of realised that nothing was going to happen.”Rendón said he lost confidence in Goudreau because of his “character, his moods” and “lack of respect”. He said Guaidó also began to suspect that Goudreau was talking too much.“He was meeting with people in Colombia before meeting with us that were related to groups that we don’t engage with – because they are related to the regime,” said Rendón.The dispute over the $1.5m retainer came to a head in a blazing row in November when Goudreau, Nieto and other exiles confronted Rendón at his Miami apartment.“That conversation got heated, heated, heated and at the end Nieto intervened and we went to my balcony to chill,” Rendón said.Goudreau left without his money. Rendón said he heard nothing more until April when he received a lawyer’s letter demanding payment of the $1.5m.Rendón was not the first person to back away from a deal with Goudreau. Drew White, who served with Goudreau, Berry and Denman in the Middle East, helped set up Silvercorp. But he pulled out in 2019 when Goudreau started cooking up the plan to abduct Maduro, deciding it was too far fetched.“As supportive as you want to be as a friend, his head wasn’t in the world of reality,” White told the Associated Press. “Nothing he said lined up.”Ephraim Mattos, a former US navy Seal, who trained some of the would-be combatants in tactical medicine, told the Wall Street Journal he had tried to stop the operation.Goudreau decided to press ahead anyway.Preparations on the ground began to unravel in late March when Colombian police stopped Jorge Alberto Molinares driving along the Caribbean coast. His Renault Duster was packed with assault rifles, flak jackets and military helmets he was moving to a safe house in Riohacha, 55 miles from the Venezuelan border.The authorities had begun watching the house after the landlord complained that the plotters had missed rent payments. Molinares told investigators he was delivering the shipment to a man known as to “El Pantera”, or the Panther, who Venezuelan authorities said was Robert Levin Colina Ibarra – subsequently killed in the botched invasion.Goudreau’s plans were further complicated when his ally Alcalá, the former general, was indicted on the same drug trafficking charges as Maduro is facing. Before turning himself over to authorities Alcalá told the  that he was working with the knowledge of “American contractors and the Colombian government” though he would not go into further details.Unveiling the indictments in March, US authorities also offered a $15m reward for information leading to Maduro’s capture and prosecution.With the big payoff agreed with Rendón dead, that made a potential payout from the US government all the more important for Goudreau. (The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, raised eyebrows this week by denying “direct” involvement in the plot.) Berry, one of the captured American mercenaries, told state television that the plan was to abduct the president from his 19th-century official palace in the heart of Caracas, although he was uncertain how they wold carry that off. Denman told television that he was to secure a nearby military airport and bring in planes to carry Maduro out.After the would-be liberators of Venezuela were herded ashore on Sunday, Maduro claimed that his agents had infiltrated the operation long ago and were ready to pounce. “We knew everything,” he said. “What they ate, what they didn’t eat. What they drank. Who financed them.”Guaidó said that if the Venezuelan president let the operation go ahead in that knowledge, he had blood on his hands. “Nicolás Maduro you are responsible. They knew about the operation, they infiltrated them and waited for them to massacre them,” he said.Goudreau sounded more sanguine even as Operation Gideon collapsed around him.“I’m out a lot of money, a lot,” he said this week. “A lot of us came together to do this. I’ve been a freedom fighter my whole life. This is all I know.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d584a698b4d25fcd2c2157c506f482fd1dd3079/0_358_5100_3061/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96b3b3feb8e55ea90ed57e6985370665","title":"how are you marking the 75th anniversary of ve day in lockdown","story":"We’d like to hear from people about how you’re remembering the anniversary of the end of the Second World War in Europe Friday 8 May will mark 75 years since the end of the Second World War in Europe.

We’re fed up. This has got to end.”As of Thursday, there were 2,757 confirmed cases for the Navajo Nation – whose rural territory stretches 27,000 square miles over the south-western Colorado plateau across Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. The official death toll stood at 88 – higher than 13 states – though the actual number of fatalities is likely to be much higher as the sickest patients requiring ventilators and intensive care are transferred to state hospitals.The virus has spread rapidly among the Navajo since the first case was confirmed at the end of March, even though the tribal government was among the first to issue a stay-at-home order, lock down schools and business, and impose evening and weekend curfews.Despite the unfolding crisis, it wasn’t until Wednesday that the Nation received its portion, around $600m, of federal coronavirus relief funding. It came six weeks after it was promised and a week after the government missed a congressional deadline for distribution, and only after being sued over who is eligible for the money.“We don’t have the resources of New York and New Jersey and yet it’s taken six weeks for tribes to see this money,” said Nez. “The federal response has been too slow.”This slow, inadequate response by the government is nothing new.The US has repeatedly violated its treaty obligations by failing to adequately fund healthcare, education, housing, economic development and agricultural assistance for tribal nations, according to the National Congress of American Indians.As a result, the Navajo Nation is beset with widespread structural, economic and health injustices which have helped coronavirus spread and hampered efforts to curtail it.Take housing. It’s been extremely challenging to quarantine infected iniduals because of inadequate basic infrastructure and widespread overcrowding, according to tribal council delegate Amber Kanazbah Crotty.In part, the latter is down to cultural norms which mean multiple generations often live together, but it’s also due to chronic housing shortages, complex federal restrictions on construction, high unemployment and poverty on the reservation.“We don’t have enough hospital beds for iniduals to recover, so we’ve had to send people home where the virus is spread,” said Nez. After multiple family outbreaks, up to 150 coronavirus patients will now be temporarily housed in three converted community gyms, instead of being sent home.“Social distancing isn’t simple, when people have to move to survive,” said Kanazbah Crotty.As a result, the average age for coronavirus cases among the Navajo is just 45 years old, according to Crystalyne Curley, spokeswoman for the operational command centre.Unsurprisingly perhaps, the lack of running water increases the risk of infectious diseases. But the crisis is also linked to childhood obesity – the number one risk factor for type 2 diabetes, which is seven times more common in native youth than the general population, according to Dr Allison Barlow, CAIH director.“The clash of historic traumas, accumulated stressors and poor social determinants cannot be underestimated in what we’re seeing now with coronavirus. There’s such a complex constellation of risks piled up and chronic underfunding is part of that puzzle,” said Barlow.According to Laura Gammitt, an infectious diseases specialist, the emerging epidemiological data suggests Covid-19 infections are more common and more severe in younger Navajo people than the general population. This is partly linked to underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease and respiratory conditions – which are more prevalent among younger Native Americans than non-Natives. The average age of those who have died is 66 – significantly younger than in the US as a whole.The tribe continues to struggle to obtain enough testing kits and PPE, especially gowns and masks, and has been forced to rely on private donors including the actor Sean Penn. Contact tracing is also still very limited, though a training program is now under way.Still, Nez has come under pressure from some local mayors to reopen tourist attractions, as states look towards easing lockdown restrictions despite public health warningsNez added: “Lots of states are risking second spikes by not following professional advice. I love my people and we are not going to reopen prematurely.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71f1295dfa24e9717c0823284152fba8747ef2d3/0_58_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=5fee9f09430135a16f178928ad227abb","title":"pinochet great niece chile womens minister","story":"Macarena Santelices has praised the ‘good side’ of the 1973-90 dictatorship in which over 300 women were raped under tortureChile’s rightwing president, Sebastián Piñera, has prompted a firestorm of criticism after naming an open supporter of Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship as the country’s new minister for women’s rights and gender equality.Controversy over the appointment of Macarena Santelices – who is also the dictators’s great-niece – has focused on a 2016 interview in which she praised the “good side” of the 1973-90 dictatorship in which more than 3,000 people were murdered or disappeared by security forces and many thousands more imprisoned and tortured.She also came under criticism for her outspoken comments against immigrants.Taking office on Wednesday, Santelices denied she had ever “endorsed or justified” human rights violations and appealed to Chileans to “judge me on what I do from today onwards, as a woman”.But activists said her comments about the period of military rule – during which at least 316 women were raped while under torture, 11 of whom were pregnant – were entirely incompatible with her new role.“This appointment is a flagrant provocation and demonstrates the government’s total disdain for what the Chilean feminist movement is demanding,” said Romina Parada, co-founder of the feminist collective Baila Capucha Baila.“As far as our collective are concerned, we still don’t have a minister for women’s rights and gender equality,” she said.Santelices studied journalism and worked for several national media outlets before becoming the mayor of Olmué, a small town in the lush valleys of central Chile, in 2012.She resigned in October 2019 to run for the governorship of Valparaíso under the banner of the rightwing Independent Democratic Union – a party founded in 1983 to preserve the political and economic legacy of the dictatorship.The post had been vacant for 54 days since Santelices’s predecessor, Isabel Plá, resigned after months of criticism that she had been ineffectual in the role.“We are extremely concerned by the government’s continued appointments of non-specialist ministers who are wholly unqualified and unprepared for this role,” lamented Bárbara Sepúlveda, the executive director of Chile’s association of feminist lawyers.“This is a decisive step backwards for women’s rights and sexual ersity in Chile – it cannot be the case that civil society organisations such as ours continue to bear the weight of upholding the country’s commitment to international human rights standards,” she said.Santelices’s appointment comes amid a growing wave of women’s activism in Chile, two months after more than a million women marched in Santiago on International Women’s Day.In March, Piñera signed a new law that broadened the definition of femicide to include perpetrators known to the victim rather than just formal partners or cohabiters.“During a period in which patriarchal violence has increased, the president has appointed somebody with no experience or training in gender issues,” explained Javiera Manzi, a spokeswoman for the Coordinadora Feminista 8M organisation.“We will not allow a person who embodies everything we stand against to lead this ministry, and as such demand her immediate removal from the role.”The hashtag #WeHaveNoMinister has trended on social media since her appointment and several other feminist and transgender rights organisations – including Sepúlveda and Parada’s collectives – have joined calls for Santelices’s resignation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/203e5e88d713be4e799f083a78227eef6c48d430/138_0_4371_2624/master/4371.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4b0e0629f4ad66d0ef0d3202eef947a","title":"us reopening coronavirus trends","story":"While countries such as Spain and Italy that are lifting restrictions have forced the trend of infections down, in the US cases are risingThe US may be moving to loosen social distancing restrictions around the same time as several European countries but it remains in a far different, and worse, stage of the coronavirus pandemic.While infections and deaths from Covid-19 quickly raced to terrifying peaks in Italy and Spain, both countries have managed to arrest the increase and are now forcing the key trends downwards.Certain shops have reopened in Italy, which has suffered more than 29,000 Covid-19 deaths, while Spain, where nearly 24,000 people have died from the virus, will return to a “new normality” by the end of June, according to the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez.In the US, more than half of the states are also pushing ahead with plans to restart economic activity, urged on by Donald Trump, who has said that “we have to get our country open, and we have to get it open soon.”But the Covid-19 trends in the US are starkly different from the European countries hardest hit in the early stages of the pandemic. Not only has the US suffered the most deaths worldwide, at more than 75,000 people so far, it has also failed so far to bend the curve of infections downwards.The US peaked at around 30,000 new confirmed Covid-19 cases a day in April but rather than this rate sharply dropping, it has simply plateaued. Outside New York, a global hotspot for the pandemic that has managed to bend its curve downwards after weeks of societal restrictions, the rate of new cases is actually climbing in America.Comparing the journey of the pandemic in the US with other nations is instructive – while new cases and deaths in Italy, Spain and France rocketed, they then plunged back down to more manageable levels ahead of plans to restart the patterns of normal life. The trend lines in the US show sharp climbs before a flattening to a stagnation, rather than quick decrease.Public health experts have warned that the US is at risk of prematurely removing social distancing restrictions and encouraging a second, stronger wave of infections. One disaster management specialist has said the reopening of several states, devoid of the mass public testing required to safely do so, will hand a “death sentence” to many more Americans."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4248404.1588938673!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cancelling the leaving cert i can finally breathe","story":"The Leaving Certificate Exam has been postponed and pupils will be offered the option of receiving calculated grades, Minister for Education Joe McHugh has announced.

Students will be awarded predictive grades based on their classwork instead and those students who are unhappy with their graded results may be able to sit the exams at a later stage. We asked readers for their views. The following is a selection of the responses we received.Caoimhe Culleton, County Dublin My eldest daughter who is 19 was to sit her Leaving Cert this June. She has a love of the Irish language and had visited the Gaeltacht for the past 6 years so the first blow was the cancellation of the orals. The second blow comes today she has not stopped studying despite lockdown- up every morning hitting the books with a drive I respect and admire. Her school exams and mocks produced average results - the exams were an opportunity to move the grades up a notch - that is now lost. Her chance to go to Trinity does not seem achievable - I think the students most affected are the middle group who may have been borderline with their grades but needed higher points for their desired course. In addition, will the likes of the grind schools give all of their students H1’s to ensure success on the school league table? Where will be the fairness? But today we want closure- we are exhausted with the bickering of the politicians trying to score points with populist views - I am sad today with this outcome and the lost opportunity for so many students.Aimee Cosgrove, County Dublin I am extremely pleased with the cancellation of the Leaving Cert. Throughout my school career I have suffered with high anxiety due to having autism and generalised anxiety disorder. This anxiety has always spiked around exams and I have never performed to my full capacity. As you can imagine, my anxiety has been sky-high through the lockdown and there hasn’t been a time where I have taken a full deep breath and relaxed. The constant upset stomach has worn me down and I have recently barely managed to do one piece of work a day. I was reaching my breaking point and I could not continue for two more months. News of the cancellation has lifted a weight off of my shoulders. I can finally breathe and enjoy family time without the guilt of not studying. Now I feel as if all my hard work over the past two years will be accounted for and I will get the grades I deserve. I think they are choosing the fairest option that will help improve the mental health of students all over the country.Mary Brennan I’m a repeat student. I’ve only been in my school a few months. Predicted grades are the worst outcome for me. I can’t repeat again and they’re saying you won’t be able to sit exams until 2021.Marta Solli, Cork I personally think that using predictive grades is a much fairer choice. I worked hard for two years and I think that all my effort and hard work should be considered. Cancelling the Leaving Cert will definitely ease the stress all students are experiencing at the moment. We need to keep in mind that many sixth-year students might be stressed out for many reasons other than the exams. For example, I am an exchange student who spent the last two years in Ireland staying with a host family. My family lives in Italy, a country devastated by the coronavirus. I am, of course stressed out because of the whole situation beyond just the Leaving Cert. I live in a foreign country without my parents at the age of 17 and knowing that my relatives are in danger breaks my heart. I haven’t seen my parents in months and the only thing I want is to go home and spend time with them. Students who are not happy with their predicted grades will be free to sit the exams. Being able to choose means everyone will do what they think it’s best for them.Matthew Gardner, County Clare Somewhat disappointing that the Leaving Cert has been taken out of my hands. However, it seemed to me that this is the option that the majority of students I know had hoped for. The prospect of further delays and the air of uncertainty around the exams was causing a lot of stress for students. \u0026nbspAlthough I am not completely happy with the decision made, I understand that this was the best option and not everyone was going to be happy no matter what is decided. Despite its flaws I do believe this is the correct decision considering the circumstances of Covid-19.Kyle Murphy, Cork I believe that any decision made today will be a step in the right direction for this year’s exam. Being a sixth year student I am acutely aware of the stress and pressure that we experienced which has only increased with the global pandemic. I think that a predicted grades system would be the best way for the Leaving Cert this year as it minimises the risk of infection for 60 thousand students along with countless superintendents and staff. It also takes into account the mental health of the students after months of uncertainty.Damien Sloan, County Waterford My son is really upset. He studied hard all along and wanted his Leaving Cert mark based on exams as that’s what they had almost two years to prepare for it The not-so-conscientious ones want predicted grades as they haven’t done the work. All his friends want to sit the exams too.Daniel Reade, Dublin My name is Daniel and I’m a current Leaving Cert student. I haven’t had the most stereotypical journey through secondary level education, missing 1st and 2nd year due to a physical illness, and homeschooled for all of 3rd year. I have been attending school for 5th and 6th year but my attendance has varied from weeks of absence to half days. Again this is due to an ongoing physical illness and on top of that the stress and anxiety caused by the uncertainty of the current crisis, it is hindering my ability to focus at home. Thankfully my physical health is improving and I am able to put a lot more work into my studies than previous months. I think the Government has made the right decision in the best interest of the country’s physical health with the proposed cancellation of the exams. But it does leave me wondering what a fair alternative would be.\u0026nbspI personally am anxious as I haven’t been fully present for a lot of my time in secondary school, missing class tests and some exams. So my question to the Government is how are teachers going to fairly predict the grades of students like myself who haven’t been able to prove their capabilities throughout the last few years? Although this is a serious worry for me, all I want at the moment is clarity and certainty on the situation and for something to be sent in stone. I don’t envy the position of the Government in this present time but students have been waiting too long for decisions to be made that could affect their whole lives. Hopefully a plan of action will be decided upon in the coming days.Harry Willis I think that everyone should be given their first CAO preference. I know that would mean a lot of people who should not get their course will but at the end of the day if you’re not able for your course then you can’t blame the government. This way colleges still get fees, everyone is happy that they got their course and there will be no lengthy lawsuits taken against the government that the predicted grade received was wrong. It will only be a once off thing for a once off crisis.Sylvia Hart, County Dublin I don’t agree with predicted grades because how am I going to redeem myself without sitting the exam? I have been studying during quarantine and have improved so much. So when the results come out I wouldn’t be happy. And I’m not comfortable with the fact that my future is in the hands of a teacher. It is only the brightest students that want predicted grades because they know they would do well. I would say give students the option of sitting the exam or opting for predictive grades in July.Éabha Hughes, County Dublin The cancellation of exams was necessary, that much is clear. The majority of people wanted them replaced with predicted grades. However, there is still a minority that wanted the exams to go ahead - and they should be given the opportunity to do so. Sitting the exams if they don’t want their predicted grades should be an option. This can be done by following social distancing measures in August, especially seeing as there will over 75 per cent fewer students taking the exams, and with enough time to correct so everyone can start third level together. Pushing the re-sits out to as late as early 2021 is almost like punishing the students. I don’t understand why the Government can’t listen to what the students actually want - yes we want predicted grades, but we don’t want to see those unhappy left in the dust either. I don’t know if people have forgotten, but this is the biggest year of many of our lives so far, and with the emphasis put on the Leaving Cert throughout our young lives there is no doubt that some people are distraught and inconsolable over this decision.Barry Quinn, County Dublin I’m doing my Leaving Cert this summer and I’m an external candidate. Where does the decision leave me because I am not assessed on anything? I am not attending college, just sitting the exam on the day.Stephanie Murray While I believe that a system of predicted grades will be suitable in the vast majority of cases, there are a significant number of students who would be assessed on less than a years’ work- those repeating the leaving cert, those who missed fifth year due to illness, and those who transferred to grind schools for sixth year. For these students, it is imperative that exams take place, and preferably as soon as possible. Since the numbers of students opting to receive a predicted grade will significantly lower the number choosing to take an exam, it should not be impossible to hold socially distanced exams, in August, for example. This would enable those students who cannot rely on predicted grades to begin college this year. For those repeating the Leaving Cert, waiting until 2021 to begin their courses is demoralising and unfair.Leslie Hammond, County Dublin Am despairing at who is making the decisions with regard to the Leaving Cert. It makes no sense to have an option to sit at a much later date. Predicted results should easily be out by middleend June with those that aren’t happy sitting on 29th July. This is not rocket science! If a restaurant can open using socially distancing measures, exams can be held. The playing field needs to be level and fair, which won’t happen if some students aren’t happy with predicted grades and are expected to sit around for another 69 months before doing the Leaving Cert. Never mind the fact that it will just be adding more pressure on places next year as they will be competing with the current 5th years. Am despairing at who is running the show vis-à-vis the Leaving Cert.Ann Marie O’Dwyer At long last the students’ voice has been heard. Since 12th March when schools closed the Leaving Cert was compromised. The list of problems were endless, my daughter has been working hard since 5th year towards the exams in June, then suddenly online classes which didn’t happen. She only had one teacher who came on at class time to do her class. Teachers sent videos, most sent homework. She had four subjects not completed on 12th March including honours Maths, Physics, Geography and English. Teachers didn’t contact their students, didn’t correct homework. It became very disheartening but she continued on. Mr Varadkar’s “by hook or by crook” statement really upset her and she hoped that the Department of Education would clarify matters but things only got worse. At that stage she believed the only option was cancellation of the exam and predicted grades so she and her class could continue with their lives.Danielle Clarke, County Dublin This is highly irresponsible in the absence of the actual detail of the planEilisha Downes I am a Leaving Cert student and I think that the idea is brilliant and should have been done ages ago. All of this going back and forth, will itwon’t it, is unhelpful for students, teachers, parents and anyone else who might be involved. While I do agree with the cancellation, I am worried about my education next year as I am hoping to start a PLC in Galway this September but because of Covid-19 I never got the chance to interview which should have been held mid-May.\u0026nbspI am grateful to my teachers and the hard working men and women across the board who have helped to make my Leaving Cert year as close to normal as possible. They have all put in a huge amount of work and I am thankful (just don’t tell my teachers)Ryan Kelly, County Cork I am a Leaving Cert student and I believe that, although it’s not ideal, cancelling the Leaving Cert was the best option. We find ourselves in a situation that has never been seen before and in these extraordinary circumstances exceptions to the normal Leaving Cert should be expected. The pandemic has caused hardship and challenges for millions around the world. I don’t think it would have been possible, or at least feasible, to hold exams while the pandemic continued. There were too many possible problems that could not be accounted for and risking the health of our most vulnerable was not worth it when there were other options available. Furthermore I have great faith in our hardworking teachers across the country that they will provide fair results for their students. I feel an immense pressure lifted from me now that I can rest assured the work I’ve put in over the last two years will be accounted for and I do not have to carry the pressure until late July.Megan Ní Laighin The amount of stress this alternative will lift from students nationwide is simply phenomenal. I wouldn’t feel remotely comfortable participating in contact classes for two weeks prior to written exams seeing as both of my parents have underlying conditions. Overall, provided a reasonable alternative can be out in place, canceling the written Leaving Certificate exams in July is undoubtedly the right decision.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4248529.1588951407!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"q a am i better off opting for exams or predicted grades","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tStudents will not have to choose between predicted grades and written exams. File photograph: Bryan O’BrienAm I better off opting for written Leaving Cert exams in the coming months or predicted grades?Students won’t have to choose between the two. All Leaving Cert candidates who were due to sit this year’s exams will be entitled to receive predicted grades if they so wish.The option of sitting the exams - possibly later this year or early next - will also still be there for students.Students may also opt to sit an exam for an inidual subject if they are unhappy with the result of their predicted or expected grade.The  understands that internal Department of Education estimates are that up to 20 per cent of candidates may end up sitting the exams, but this is just guesswork at this stage. How will predicted expected grading work?The Department says students’ grades will be awarded based on a combination of their coursework, assessments and in-school tests over the past two or three years.Teachers will be asked to take this range of information and make a “balanced judgement” on what the student would have scored in the exam. A student’s rank order in class will also be taken into account.Groups of teachers will assign grades in a process overseen by school principals and senior management following national guidelines, which have yet to be published. These results will be sent to the Department of Education, where it will feed into a process where a “bell curve” is applied. This refers to the way the marking process is adjusted each year to ensure similar proportions of students secure the same proportions of grades.School profiles may also be used. In other words, grades may be adjusted to fit the typical profile of student achievement in inidual schools.Will there be any safeguards to prevent undue pressure being placed on teachers or schools?This will be a major issue. Teachers and schools may well feel conflicted or unduly pressurised into awarding students higher grades. However, the Department of Education insists grades will be issued by schools rather than inidual teachers. It says there will be detailed national guidelines for teachers to follow, including how to handle conflicts of interest.Will I be able to appeal my predicted results?There will be an appeals process for anyone unhappy with their results. Students will get to see some details of what their school sent to the Department of Education. The appeals process will involve the department, rather than schools. Students will also get a chance to sit the written exams later in the year or early next year, depending on when public health advice allows.If I decide to sit the written Leaving Cert exams, will I be able to go to college in the coming year?No. It seems likely that the written exams may be in late 2020 or early 2021, depending on when public health advice allows. Higher education sources say this will be too late to take up courses in the coming academic year, but students could take up a course in the follow year. Will CAO points for courses go up or down due to these changes?It is very difficult to say. CAO points are based on supply and demand for inidual courses.The fact that thousands of international students will not be taking up undergraduate college places will free up places in higher education and should lead to points reductions in some programmes.However, the extent to which this will happen will vary dramatically. For example, universities such as Trinity, UCD and the RCSI have relatively high proportions of international students, especially in areas such as medicine. This, in theory, should see points fall.There are relatively few international students in other programmes and across institutes of technology generally. This, in theory, should means points won’t vary dramatically.However, it’s not that simple.There may be grade inflation on foot of predicted grades, which could see points rise in competitive courses.More students may also end up opting for higher points courses on foot of these changes, which in turn could lead to upward points pressure on courses.When will students get their results?The plans is to mirror the normal pattern of results and offers, insofar as this is possible.This should mean students getting their results and offers in mid-August. However, these details are still being hammered out, according to the Department of Education. Is it likely college will begin later for first years?Until recently, plans were that first years would begin college in November. However, the process of providing predicted grades should mean first years will be able to start college much earlier.Higher education officials are still working these details out, but their hope is that first years will begin in September.Many students have applied for college in the UK and Europe. How will the changes impact on them?These students have been hugely affected by uncertainty over the timing of Leaving Cert results. It is estimated that about 2,000 are planning to go to college abroad.It will come as a relief to many that Department of Education sources say predicted grades will arrive in time for these students in order to take up courses abroad.What about students studying subjects without a formal teacher such as Russian or Polish?Many students - especially those born abroad or whose parents are non-Irish nationals - take minority languages. In many cases, they do not have a formal school teacher.It is difficult to see how they will be catered for under predicted grades, as sources say these grades will depend on a teacher  school applying them. There are still unanswered questions on this point.I sat the Leaving last year but am applying for college this year. What will will happen to me? Early indications are that students’ Leaving Cert results from previous years will still apply.Sources say the use of a bell curve for this year’s students will aim to ensure these students will not be disadvantaged by grade inflation. However, we will know more as the details are ironed out. What will happen to students in grind schools?Under the Department of Education’s databases, these students - in many cases - are still linked to their original school. It remains to be seen how this will be resolved.Similarly, in a given year there are many external candidates without a teacher or school. Again, we await details on how they will be catered for."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4247918.1588915652!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"car bans and pedestrianised college green part of radical covid 19 plan to re open dublin","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIt is understood the measures will remain in place for at least 12 to 18 months, with some likely to be retained on a permanent basis. Photograph: Cyril ByrneThe Dublin’s College Green is set to be pedestrianised – and cars restricted throughout the city – under plans to reopen the city centre as Covid-19 restrictions are lifted.A joint report from Dublin City Council chief executive Owen Keegan and Brendan O’Brien of its traffic department said “the same level of vehicular traffic cannot be accommodated in the city as before”, and in a number of locations “motorised vehicles” would have to banned after 11am each day.The report describes the proposal as a “temporary mobility plan” which would be introduced over the next three to six months in line with the Government’s road map for reopening society, published last week.However, it is understood the measures will remain in place for at least 12 to 18 months, with some likely to be retained on a permanent basis.Some measures already undertaken by the council to increase space and social distancing for pedestrians, including priority setting on traffic lights to guard against footpath queueing, “actually preclude a return to previous high levels of private car use”, the report says.Last year 46,000 private cars travelled into the city centre during typical morning peak times. By March 31st that figure had dipped to around 14,000. However, the measures prioritising pedestrians at traffic lights would alone mean traffic would have to be reduced by 40 per cent on last year’s levels.Working groupA council and National Transport Authority working group has been established to oversee the changes. The report said changes may mean removing vehicles after 11am, “ which will assist businesses to reopen by allowing more on-street space for tables and chairs, and also for waiting areas”.“The temporary closure of College Green and the temporary widening of footpaths along Dame Street would provide space within the city centre for pedestrians, cyclists and for businesses to be facilitated to reopen.”A full report on the range and location of measures which will “reflect the new reality” will be published in the next two weeks. It will also include measures to widen footpaths on the main corridors, provide for cycling, ensure public transport is safe to use and providing increased space for boarding and alighting at bus stops in the city centre.“The requirements of social distancing, the reduction of emissions and the encouragement of the active modes require that our temporary mobility plan for the city is not based around any increase in private car traffic,” the report said.“The changes in our traffic light system to assist pedestrians and avoid build ups of pedestrians at crossings actually preclude a return to previous high levels of private car use.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4248363.1588932900!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sea level could rise 1m by 2100 if emissions targets missed experts","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are important indicators of climate change. Photograph: iStockSea level could rise by more than 1m by 2100 if carbon emission reduction targets are not met, according to a survey by 106 global experts.The latest projections exceed previous estimates by climate scientists under the UN International Panel on Climate Change.The study found the global mean sea-level rise could exceed 1m by 2100, and 5m by 2300 – if global targets on emissions are not achieved. It was led by scientists at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore and included an input from a mathematician at Maynooth University.It is based on the informed opinions of sea-level experts “and underlines the critical importance of pursuing a low emissions policy to limit sea-level rise,” said co-author Dr Niamh Cahill, assistant professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Maynooth.They applied projections under two climate scenarios low and high emissions. By surveying a wide range of leaders in the field, it offers broader assurance about its projections for the ranges of future sea-level rise, she explained.In a scenario where global warming is limited to 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels, the specialists estimated a rise of 0.5m by 2100 and 0.5 to 2m by 2300.In a high-emissions scenario with 4.5 degrees of warming, they estimated a larger rise of 0.6 to 1.3m by 2100 and 1.7 to 5.6m by 2300.Prof Benjamin Horton of NTU Singapore, who led the survey, said sea-level rise projections and knowledge of their uncertainties “are vital to make informed mitigation and adaptation decisions”.“The complexity of sea-level projections, and the sheer amount of relevant scientific publications, make it difficult for policymakers to get an overview of the state of the science,” he said.To obtain this overview, it was useful to survey leading experts on the expected sea-level rise, which provided a broader picture of future scenarios and informed policymakers so they could prepare necessary measures, Prof Horton said.StudyPublished in Nature Partner Journals Climate and Atmospheric Science, researchers from the University of Hong Kong Durham University (UK) Rowan University (US) Tufts University (US) and Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (Germany) contributed to the study.“We know that the planet will see additional sea-level rise in the future,” noted co-author Dr Andra Garner of Rowan University.“But there are stark differences in the amount of sea-level rise experts project for low emissions compared to high emissions. This provides a great deal of hope for the future, as well as a strong motivation to act now to avoid the more severe impacts of rising sea levels,” said Dr Garner.The experts were chosen as they were among the most active publishers of sea-level studies – at least six published papers in peer-reviewed journals since 2014 – and identified from a leading publication database.They identified the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets as “the greatest sources of uncertainty”. They are an important indicator of climate change and driver of sea-level rise. Satellite-based measurements show the ice sheets are melting at an accelerating rate. However, they also underlined the magnitude and impact of sea-level rise can be limited by successfully reducing emissions.Prof Andrea Dutton of the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the US, who was not involved in this study, said: “One of the key takeaways is that our actions today can make a profound difference in how much our coastlines will retreat in the future. That knowledge is empowering because it means that we can choose a better outcome through our actions.”A separate study published this week shows coastal zones in Europe contain large human populations, significant socio-economic activities and assets, and fragile ecosystems and are particularly vulnerable to sea level rise of 1m or more.Coastal communities will face increasing risk of floods as climate change could cause extreme sea-level rise by 2100, it concludes. Coastal adaptation, however, could prevent 95 per cent of the projected economic losses.The findings are in an EU Joint Research Council study in Nature Communications. In the absence of climate action and with continued demographic pressure and urbanisation along coastlines, annual damages from coastal flooding in the EU and the UK “could increase sharply . . . to almost €1.6 trillion by 2100, with 3.9 million people exposed to coastal flooding every year”, it said."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Matt KavanaghGarret FitzGerald was forced to flee when gardaí batons charged a crowd trying to break into Trinity College Dublin on the eve of Victory in Europe (VE) Day, according to a previously-unpublished diary.The former Taoiseach’s exhaustive diary entry for May 7th into May 8th, 1945 has been made available by his son Mark to mark the 75th anniversary of the end of the Second World War in Europe.In it, his father, who was then a 19-year-old second year arts student in UCD, details his day from when he hears about the German surrender at the end of the Second World War (2.05pm) to eventually going to bed at 4am the following morning (VE Day).The diary entry includes a reference to his future political rival and fellow Taoiseach Charles J Haughey who is listed as a PS at the bottom of the typed diary: “At 9.19 (pm) on way back to College, at bottom Grafton St, we met Charlie Haughey, Mary Pat, Nancy Nolan and Brendan Nolan. ”Mr Haughey and Mr FitzGerald were contemporaries in UCD at the time. The Trinity incident is famous as the first time that Haughey came to public attention as he was allegedly the leader of a crowd of incensed UCD students who tried to storm Trinity after students there hoisted the Union flag on the roof and burned the Irish tricolour.Mr FitzGerald, who later became famous for memorising European train timetables, lists all of the 24 people he met that evening and everything he ate and drank including champagne at the Buttery restaurant at 10.30pm and gooseberries and milk at a friend’s house at 2.35am.Having heard the surrender announcement, Mr FitzGerald went to a friend’s house to listen to the radio. That evening he returned to UCD for the English Literature Society inaugural committee in the main hall of the university which was then located at Earlsfort Terrace.The inaugural was interrupted by students in procession. At their head was a student named Bertie Burke carrying an Irish tricolour who was being chaired down the street.The tricolour was most likely in response to the actions of the Trinity students earlier that afternoon.The UCD students passed by College Green where Trinity is located and Mr FitzGerald followed them. He went to the GPO to make a phonecall to his future wife Joan O’Farrell who was also a student in UCD.Mr FitzGerald then attended a meeting of students in Middle Abbey Street where feelings were high over the tricolour burning incident. There had already been clashes between pro-British Trinity students and pro-Irish UCD students.The meeting ended and the UCD students headed back to Trinity with a view to storming the gates. They were baton charged by the Civic Guards (the gardaí). “The three of us (the other two are not listed) had to flee for our lives up the street and into College Street,” Mr FitzGerald writes.He waited at the junction of Suffolk Street and Grafton Street for Joan and saw a fellow student, Ellie Beatty, wearing a red, white and blue ribbon in her hair. “We beseeched her to remove it and she did”.He eventually met Joan and they headed back to UCD where the inaugural was still going on and a few rowdy students with tricolours were told to leave.At 10.30pm, a group of them, he lists 17 in all, went to the Buttery pub where most ordered gins and limes and sherrys, “but I saw champagne going and managed to collect enough to give us all who wanted it at 5- a time … we sat and toasted everything and everybody until 10.50pm”.Mr FitzGerald’s night did not finish there. After having a bottle thrown at them in Grafton Street, Mr FitzGerald went to the Green Rooster restaurant in O’Connell Street near the Parnell monument where he had soup with mashed potatoes in it. On Westmoreland Street he borrowed 26 off a friend and went back towards the college where some students were asleep on the steps.He and Joan cycled home, he with a mutual friend, Mary Joyce, on the crossbar. After leaving Joan home, he went to Mary’s house, had gooseberries and cream and milk “and looked at the china”.Gallantly he cycled back to the college to pick up Mary’s handbag that she left on the railings. His last port of call was Independent House where he bought a newspaper, returned home to his parents house in Airfield “and after finishing the paper, to bed”.Mark FitzGerald has also released a note from his father’s papers which are in UCD listing all the people who would be available for a VE Day celebration.Garret FitzGerald’s diary account of meeting Charles Haughey on the eve of VE Day is different to the version he recalled years later in a documentary about Haughey’s life. He recalled Haughey escaping from gardaí by “jumping over bicycles and going up Trinity Street. My views and his views would have been different. I was strongly pro-Allied”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4248538.1588947138!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus number of people satisfied with life plummets","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAlmost two-thirds of respondents to the CSO’s survey said they were concerned about someone else’s health during the pandemic. Photograph: Getty ImagesThe number of people who reported a high satisfaction with life has plummeted during the coronavirus pandemic, according to figures from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) published on Friday.Last month just 12 per cent of people rated their overall satisfaction with life as high, a huge drop compared to 43 per cent of people in 2018.Younger people aged between 18-34 were the least likely to report being satisfied during the national lockdown, according to the CSO figures.The number of people who said they were highly satisfied with their personal relationships fell from 60 per cent in 2018 to 42 per cent last month.Married couples were the most likely to still rate satisfaction in their personal relationships as high.More than a quarter of people reported feeling lonely over the past four weeks, in interviews for the national survey last month.Nearly one third of respondents reported feeling downhearted or depressed during the Covid-19 pandemic, compared to 13 per cent of people who felt the same in 2018.The number of people who said they felt happy all or most of the time fell from 80 per cent in 2018, to 62 per cent in April 2020.Almost two thirds of those surveyed said they were very or extremely concerned about someone else’s health during the coronavirus crisis, and a quarter were concerned for their own health.Some 76 per cent of respondents said they were concerned about stress levels in their household due to the coronavirus restrictions on non-essential movement.

Photograph: David DaviesPA WireThe Leaving Certificate has been postponed and students are to be offered the option of receiving calculated grades, Minister for Education Joe McHugh has announced.The Cabinet approved the decision to offer students the option of sitting the exam at another date in the future, which sources say could be as early as November.The decision was taken following an assessment of public health advice.The announcement will be a relief to many of the 60,000 students who were due to sit the exams in June and their parents who have seeking certainty over the future of the exams since the Covid-19 lockdown began in March.However, it has also sparked concern among students, educators and politicians over the transparency and fairness of providing students with calculated grades. “We all know the Leaving Certificate can be a stressful time. Some students have parents working on the frontline, others are anxious about families and some are grieving,” Mr McHugh said at a press conference on Friday afternoon. “I have made every effort to run the 2020 Leaving Certificate as close as possible to the way the examinations were originally intended to be held,” he said. “My desire had been to allow students to undertake the written and practical examinations in July and August but I have compelling evidence, based on medical advice and other assessments, that the Leaving Certificate examinations cannot be held in a reliable and valid manner, nor in way that would be equitable for students.”Mr McHugh said that there are “legal vulnerabilities” associated with the decision to postpone the Leaving Cert but he said the Department of Education is proceeding on the basis that it is not currently safe for students to sit the exam. “There are vulnerabilities in this in terms of the legal advice we are getting because there is a legitimate expectation for students to sit the Leaving Certificate. We as a department have come to the conclusion that it is not safe and is not in the best interests of students in terms of their physical and mental health to hold those exams.“It has been flagged that there will be an issue around legitimate expectation but one of the advices which was very clear advice is that if there is compelling health evidence saying that the Leaving Certificate can’t go ahead, yes we can set up this new model of calculated grades.“The advice we were given is that we can set up an executive authority within the Department, it got the blessing today of Cabinet.“The reality of the impact of Covid-19 has led to a decision that has never happened in our country before. I fully appreciate the magnitude of this issue for the students, for their families, for the teachers and for school principals.”Special unitMr McHugh said the decision was taken “with the best interests of the students at heart”and that he took the decision “with a heavy heart”.Under the new plans, all exam fees which have been paid will be refunded. Teachers will be asked to provide a “professional judgement of each student’s attainment” which will be “subjected to a rigorous in-school alignment process to ensure fairness”.The school principal will approve the estimated scores and the rankings of each student in each subject in the school.A special unit is being established within the Department of Education to process to the data provided by each school and to “nationalise standardisation”.The department will then finalise the grades for each student which will be issued to each student as close as possible to the traditional date.Students will retain the right to appeal. Students may also sit the exam, potentially later in the year.Mr McHugh said that he has a “responsibility to find a fair way to address the disadvantage that some students are facing and the impact a lack of time in school has had in recent weeks.”“The decision has to be taken now to remove the anxiety that many students have been experiencing over how the expansion would look later in the summer,” the Minister said.

We need to work to convince the UK that more time is needed to get a good deal for everybody, including the UK.”Sinn Féin finance spokesman Pearse Doherty said if the British position did not change they were potentially looking at a Cabinet subcommittee preparing a Plan B or other alternatives.Mr Coveney said “the easy thing is just to call for an extension, but we do not get an extension unless the UK side wants to pursue that approach”.He said there is “no hidden solution that will pop up in a few weeks’ time” and they would have to try “to find a way of getting an agreement on these very difficult timelines”.What about a trade deal?Mr Coveney warned that “if it is not possible to conclude an agreement because of the tightness of these timelines we have to have plans in place to try to protect Irish interests as best we can”.He told Green Party finance spokeswoman Neasa Hourigan and Independent TD Marian Harkin that the Unite Kingdom is refusing to deal with the issue of a level playing field and common standards but wanted facilitation on a trade deal.“If we do not have serious negotiation and engagement from the UK side on level playing field issues” then “we are running into a roadblock”, he said.People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett said that if Ireland is going to make the case to the North for a united Ireland “we must at a minimum have an all-Ireland national health service which is properly resourced, with the necessary capacity, where we treat our health workers properly and well. People in the North will not be attracted to a united Ireland if it involves a two-tier under-resourced, under-capacity health service.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: John ThysThere’s one word no one wants to hear in Brussels: Brexit. Profound weariness has set in in the European Union capital towards Britain’s project, even as talks stall to try to find an agreement to avoid a damaging lurch to default trade terms at the end of the year.There’s a sense of deja vu to the rows and speculation in the British press. Lately, the talk has returned to the idea of a “Canada-style deal”, with gossip that British negotiators could demand a copy of the bespoke arrangement tailored to the specifics of the transatlantic trade relationship that took seven years to negotiate.“I’ve heard talk about a Canadian-style deal for a long time. In fact I think it generated a lot of internal debate in the British government around 2017,” trade commissioner Phil Hogan wearily told The  when asked about the idea. “It continues to be an issue.”Part of the jadedness is because the EU is busy dealing with the biggest economic shock in its history and the worst pandemic in a century. These are challenges nobody wanted. Brexit, on the other hand, was voluntary.Britain chose disruption, and much of the angst and delay associated with this is due to the fact that the government rushed into it without working out the details of what the point of it was in advance.London’s negotiators seem to have adjusted little to the post-Covid reality. Even as talks were delayed and moved to videoconference due to the pandemic, officials refused to countenance even the idea of extending the current transition period to allow more time for talks.Blast from past“It’s exceptional. Never in the history for such important negotiations with any third country, have we been under such time pressure,” an exasperated chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier said after the last round concluded without progress in the most contentious areas.Tuesday’s headline in the Financial Times – “Northern Ireland tensions threaten to derail Brexit long-term EU-UK deal” – was greeted as a blast from the past.This new rehearsal of the old theme relates to the EU’s request to set up an office in the North to work with local officials as they implement the complex new arrangements agreed in the withdrawal deal last year to avoid a hard border on the island.London recently started briefing that such an office would be isive, and dropping dark warnings about the Belfast Agreement, despite its diplomatic service having agreed to the idea last year.Until the talk of sovereignty from Westminster, it was a non-issue in the North itself. This is a carbon copy of events that led to the ditching of the so-called backstop, which only became a topic of contention after Conservative Party politicians began talking about it as “annexation”, giving unionists little choice but to oppose it.“I’m not aware that anyone in Northern Ireland of any persuasion was getting exercised about the EU office,” SDLP Assembly member Matthew O’Toole told The . “It was not a battleground in NI before the UK government started publicly suggesting it was unacceptable.”‘Territory question’It’s common for international organisations to have global offices, whether the United Nations or the OECD. The EU has over 129 – including, until Brexit became a reality at the end of January, one in Belfast. Even Northern Ireland itself has “Invest NI” offices in Brussels, Dusseldorf, Dubai, Manchester and Dubai. The North has long had bespoke diplomatic arrangements: it has its own office in the United States, the Northern Ireland Bureau in Washington DC, which works there to promote “political, economic, educational, and cultural” links.\u0026nbsp“It’s not a territory question, because not even embassies count as territory, even though they are sometimes wrongly portrayed that way in the movies,” said Joris Larik, an expert in EU external relations at Leiden University.“Imagine it was the other way around,” Larik mused. “Imagine the UK wanted a technical office in Rotterdam or Hamburg or in an important EU member state that they do a lot of trade with, to help out with all the paperwork that is coming their way. I don’t think that would make the headlines, I just can’t imagine anybody would be interested in that. It’s an uninteresting piece of news.”For the EU, this is another example of a technical issue becoming unnecessarily politicised by Britain, and it’s increasingly a problem when it comes to something that agreement hinges on: trust.“There are increasing worries on the EU side that the British government isn’t really 100 per cent serious about implementing this . . . and then if you can’t even have an office . . .” Larik trailed off. “The Achilles’ heel of the Northern Ireland protocol is that it relies on the UK to implement it.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Control answered that they had not and signed off the reply with a ‘QRX’ code, indicating the time they will speak on the next day.   Intercepted by the British, the Bletchley Park analyst commented on the signal: “He does not seem to have much opinion of the speed of our troops as he gives each outstation a QRX for tomorrow morning”. In fact the Tommies arrived at Cuxhaven at 14.00 on May 6, an hour and a half after Control said they’d not arrived yet.As the Allies closed in the radio network rapidly collapsed as stations went off the air.Realising he was probably alone and with his calls unanswered, the last German signaller still at his post, Lieutenant Kunkel, sent the final message of the war from the network wishing any listening colleagues good luck.Intercepted by Bletchley Park codebreakers, he signed off for the very last time at 07.35 on the morning of May 7, 1945, saying:“British troops entered Cuxhaven at 14.00 on 6 May – from now on all radio traffic will cease – wishing you all the best. Lt Kunkel” This was immediately followed by: “Closing down for ever – all the best – goodbye”A day later the war was over, but Bletchley Park codebreakers carried on working monitoring German communications to confirm that they were surrendering and that there would be no final stand by the Nazis.GCHQ\u0027s Historian Tony Comer said: “These transcripts give us a small insight into the real people behind the machinery of war. “While most of the UK was preparing to celebrate the war ending, and the last of the German military communicators surrendered, Bletchley staff – like today’s GCHQ workers – carried on working to help keep the country safe.”The document, graded Top Secret at the time due to the sensitivity around the work at Bletchley Park, was signed off in Hut 6 by Professor Frederick Norman, known as ‘Bimbo’ because of his child-like enthusiasm, quickness of wit and intellectual curiosity.Described by one of the women working at Bletchley Park as “quite a character” due to his habit of wearing a trilby hat and leggings, Professor Norman specialised in providing scientific intelligence to the Air Ministry’s Chief Scientist.According to Tony Comer, Frederick Norman learned German while a prisoner in the First World War and was recruited for Bletchley Park in September 1939 from his post as Professor of Medieval German at King’s College, London. In 1940 he became one of the original Watch staff in Hut 3, where Alan Turing occasionally worked, and had become Head of the Hut 3 Research Section by May 1942.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"eu agreed chinese censorship coronavirus origins","story":"The European Union agreed to Chinese censorship of a public letter by its ambassadors that removed any mention of the fact the coronavirus pandemic originated in China, it has emerged. The EU’s foreign affairs service agreed to cut out a reference to the “outbreak of the coronavirus in China” as a reason for a cancelled EU-China summit in the letter, which was published in the state-run China Daily newspaper. The European External Action Service (EEAS) excised the reference after coming under pressure from China’s foreign ministry. Two weeks ago, the EEAS was forced to deny it had bowed to Beijing by watering down language in a report accusing China of a campaign of disinformation about the virus. It was revealed EU officials softened some of the language condemning China after repeated calls by Chinese officials.“It is of course regrettable to see that the sentence about the spread of the virus has been edited,” said Nicolas Chapuis, the EU’s ambassador to China, who co-signed the opinion piece with the 27 ambassadors to China of the bloc’s member states. The senior diplomats wrote the letter to celebrate 45 years of diplomatic relations between Beijing and the EU. Diplomats in Brussels and politicians in Europe were dismayed at the latest decision but officials insisted that the letter would not have been published unless the cut was made. Norbert Rottgen, the head of the German parliament’s foreign affairs committee, said he was shocked “not once but twice”. “First the EU ambassadors generously adopt Chinese narratives and then on top of that the EU representation accepts Chinese censorship of the joint op-ed. Speaking with one voice is important but it has to reflect our shared European values and interests,” he said. “The EU delegation made known its concerns. The EU continues to advocate a free press. On this specific case the EU delegation decided to proceed with publication with considerable reluctance because it considered it important to communicate the key messages.”China is attempting to block EU moves in the World Health Organisation to push for an investigation into the pandemic over language that states it started in China. The US also supports the UN resolution on the probe into the origin and spread of coronavirus when the World Health Assembly convenes later this month. Beijing  accused the USA of trying to shift blame over the coronavirus on Thursday, after President Donald Trump said the pandemic was a worse attack than Pearl Harbor or 911.Tension between the world\u0027s two biggest economies has reached fever pitch in recent days as they have exchanged barbed comments on each other\u0027s handling of the virus.Mr Trump has claimed the virus leaked from a lab in Wuhan, while Chinese diplomats have floated the idea it was planted there by US military. The president said the coronavirus pandemic should never have happened on WednesdayCould have been stopped at the source. Could have been stopped in China, he said.We urge the US side to stop shifting the blame to China and turn to facts, said foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying at a press briefing.They might say the pandemic is comparable to Pearl Harbor or 911, but the enemy facing the US is the novel coronavirus, she said. China said for the first time Thursday that researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology were trained in the US and France, as it faces repeated US claims that the coronavirus pandemic originated there.The lab\u0027s French ties have previously sparked concern in France. The Institut Merieux, Alain Merieux\u0027s firm, has strenuously denied taking part in the lab\u0027s design, construction and management.French President Emmanuel Macron has also denied that there was any evidence linking the Wuhan P4 lab to Covid-19.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"meet ve day life lockdown","story":"Earlier this year, in an increasingly distant pre-Covid age, plans were announced to celebrate the 75th anniversary of VE Day. There was to be a parade of veterans past Buckingham Palace organised by the Royal British Legion, packed pubs allowed to extend their opening hours long into the night, street parties under streams of fluttering bunting and Winston Churchill’s victorious speech declaring triumph in Europe broadcast in towns and cities across the country.But all that was before a new enemy entered our midst. Instead, this Friday, as with every day for the past six weeks of lockdown, those same streets which 75 years ago thronged with revellers will be deserted. Trafalgar Square and Whitehall, where the Queen and Princess Margaret sneaked out to celebrate with the joyous throng, will be left to the ghosts of a distant past as Britain once more finds itself on a war footing, with no clear end in sight. The events of May 8, 1945, provide a tantalising glimpse of the euphoria of a nation coming together in celebration against a vanquished enemy. We cannot know when and even how it will happen, but we already have a name for the eventual moment of triumph over the coronavirus: VC Day.“Silence” is how 94-year-old Bob Garner will be marking the anniversary of VE Day on Friday, self-isolating at home in Cambridge with his wife of 69 years, Miriam. What a contrast to 75 years ago when the then 19-year-old Private of the 1st Battalion, The Suffolk Regiment, was summoned by his Sergeant Major and instructed he had been selected for the victory parade. At the time Private Garner was convalescing at barracks in Bury St Edmunds having been shot in the throat during the push through Normandy the previous autumn. When he was picked up lying in the middle of the road, blood pumping from the wound and crying for his mother, it was initially presumed he was not going to make it. “We took a bashing,” Garner recalls. “Men were getting killed every minute of the day.”A Canadian doctor at a field hospital in Bayeux saved his life and he was flown home in a white Dakota with a red cross painted on the side. By VE Day he remained paralysed in the neck and required to take heavy medication. But he was told to collect his rifle, polish his boots, and board the next train for London. Garner recalls being collected by a convoy of Army trucks from King’s Cross station and taken to Regent’s Park where they camped under canvas for the night. On the morning of VE Day he was given a berth on an open top truck and joined the procession through central London. At one stage the men in his vehicle spotted the then 19-year-old Princess Elizabeth dressed in the uniform of the Auxiliary Transport Service.“We all cheered for her on the truck and she waved back,” he recalls. “That made our day.”He remembers heavy guns being towed through the crowds, music blasting out from every street corner, and revellers shouting and waving flags. “It felt like everything was finally going right for us,” he says. Eventually he returned to camp at around 11pm – still early, with people dancing though the night around Trafalgar Square. Not that Private Garner was able to join in the Lindy Hop and group huddles to the wartime favourite ‘Knees Up Mother Brown’. “There was no dancing for me,” he says. “I was only strong enough to walk a couple of steps.” Joan Hall, a 95-year-old former WRAF, was one of those in the crowds at Trafalgar Square until the early hours. “I had never seen so many happy people in my life,” she recalls. “All the pubs were full with people singing and on the streets everybody was dancing. I lost count with everyone I danced with. They all looked the same eventually. Everybody was kissing everybody else – today you wouldn’t dream of it.”London that day was the focal point of the celebrations. It was where the Royal family appeared on the balcony at Buckingham Palace to wave to the crowds and where the official peace declaration was announced by Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who stood on a balcony outside the Ministry of Health and announced “this is your victory”.Just as his successor (and biographer) Boris Johnson has sought to emulate during the coronavirus pandemic, in his speech Churchill praised the optimism and fortitude of the British public. “Did anyone want to give in… Were we down-hearted”, he shouted to a crowd, which each time screamed back “NO”. He continued: “the lights went out and the bombs came down. But every man, woman and child in the country had no thought of quitting the struggle.”Churchill’s words – as with the later 9pm radio address by King George VI – were broadcast across the land. In villages and towns, trestle tables were erected and neighbours gathered what meagre supplies they could muster after five years of rationing to throw street parties.A then seven-year-old Beryl Story was at one such party on Barnard Street in Thornaby-on-Tees. A photograph from the day (which was later turned into a documentary Victory’s Children) shows her sitting fourth from left in her Sunday school dress, in a row of children holding up ‘V’ for victory signs with their fingers. Beryl – now 82 – recalls treats such as spam paste sandwiches, jelly topped with custard, fairy cakes and crunchy cornflake tarts. “I remember thinking what a lot of cake,’’ she says.But even for a seven-year-old that day the celebrations were bittersweet. Beryl’s younger brother, Barry, had died of meningitis during the war aged just two-and-a-half-years-old. Her grandmother and aunts and uncles who lived a few streets away had also been bombed out of their home during a Luftwaffe air raid and arrived one evening terrified and streaked with dust and rubble. “We were scared because our parents were but it was exciting as well,” Beryl says. “It must be similar for children today.”Only four people in that photograph are still alive, Beryl says, while Barnard Street itself is long gone – demolished to make way for a dual carriageway. She still lives in a bungalow in Thornaby-on-Tees. Her husband, Vic, died in 1978 and her two children live elsewhere. She has spent lockdown alone, keeping sane by playing piano and listening to classical music. Every Thursday at 8pm she has joined the neighbours in her street clapping for carers and NHS workers, and says the display of community solidarity has reminded her of those wartime years.“Neighbours have been helping people out,” she says. “I really hope this leads to a kinder society.”This weekly celebration in defiance of the virus offers hope of a time when we can come together once more, link arms on the street and dance with strangers, and not give a passing thought to the ‘R’ value which determines the speed at which coronavirus can tear through a population if left unchecked. Today VC Day lies at an indeterminate point in the future. Much like the end of the Second World War, it’s likely our victory over Covid-19 will arrive with several false dawns. Even as Britain celebrated in May 1945, the war in Japan, after all, did not end until August that year. As countries begin to lift lockdown, the virus will no doubt launch a counter offensive. Already, we\u0027ve seen evidence from several countries that the reproductive rate of the disease rises as soon as some social restrictions are eased.VC Day, in all likelihood, will arrive in different guises. There will be the cautious moment of optimism which occurred in South Korea last week when no new cases were confirmed in a single day. Then there will be wider celebrations of the like seen in November 2015, when Sierra Leone celebrated 42 days without a new ebola case – the criteria set by the World Health Organisation for declaring the outbreak officially over. But for a virus that thrives on human intimacy, VC Day will mostly be about the moment we can be close to one another again without fear of spreading infection. For Beryl Story it will be when she can finally hug her son, Craig, a retired policeman who lives in nearby Middlesbrough and has been dropping shopping off at her door during the lockdown.Until then everything remains different. Well, nearly everything. At 9pm on Friday, just as her father did in 1945, the Queen will lead the tributes to those who fought for our freedom and security. And then people will emerge to sing Vera Lynn’s famous wartime song together from their doorsteps.Not for 75 years will those three words have meant so much to a nation:We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed emailed offer help turkish t shirt salesman led ppe","story":"It began with an emailed offer of help from a T-shirt salesman in Turkey who promised that he could help solve the UK\u0027s worsening personal protective equipment (PPE) crisis.Little more than three weeks later, a Royal Air Force plane was pictured waiting on the tarmac at an airport in Istanbul as ministers were accused of presiding over a farce.And finally – as The  revealed on Wednesday – the saga ended in catastrophe. On arrival in the UK, thousands of hospital gowns were discovered to be useless and now lie in a warehouse near Heathrow. Around 170,000 more remain in Turkey after officials blocked their delivery over safety fears.Around 68,000 gowns provided directly by the Turkish government have passed safety tests, it is understood.On Thursday, senior MPs demanded an inquiry into how the mission – dubbed Air Jenrick – had gone so badly wrong.Downing Street said the UK Government would now seek a full refund or replacement, while hospital chiefs accused ministers of making critical deals on a wing and a prayer.NHS procurement chiefs, meanwhile, questioned why officials had pinned their hopes on a firm founded only four months ago with experience of making T-shirts and tracksuits rather than high-quality medical gear.The Istanbul-based company, Selegna Tekstil, first came to the attention of the UK Government in mid-March when Mehmet Duzen, a former parliamentary candidate turned textile salesman, saw an appeal for supplies and sent an email to the Department of Health.Mr Duzen had an affection for the UK, having lived in London in the mid-2000s. In his message, the businessman said he had a factory capable of churning out hundreds of thousands of hospital gowns, each made to stringent safety standards and fit for the NHS front line.For around two weeks, the Department of Health did not reply. But then, as supply chains in China dried up and hospitals began running out of vital protective gear, Mr Duzen received a grateful response.Back-and-forth discussions began over an order of 400,000 gowns, to be produced at the Selegna factory and flown back to the UK. NHS officials sent over complicated documents setting out UK standards in detail, including sleeve lengths and the type of non-woven material needed to repel virus-carrying fluid.At first glance, Selegna appears to have been an unlikely saviour. Documents show the company was only founded on January 31 to supply clothing including T-shirts and tracksuits. Its slogan was More Than Expected.As coronavirus began to spread around the world, Mr Duzen and his sister Naile, the firm\u0027s owner, decided to switch production to high-quality medical gear. One factory that previously made sweets was instructed to make masks instead.Mark Roscrow, the chairman of the Health Care Supply Association, which represents NHS procurement chiefs, said Selegna\u0027s lack of a track record should have raised the alarm.We should have done proper checks on the company, Mr Roscrow said. It should have raised obvious risks because the company didn\u0027t have much experience. Clearly we had some confidence in them, but that has apparently been a mistake. It\u0027s ended up with money being poured down the drain.On Thursday April 17, the deal was approved and the order placed. The next day, Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) officials paid a deposit, with the contract stating that the full balance would be paid on delivery.By that time, hospitals were at risk of running out of gowns completely. Only hours before, Public Health England (PHE) had sent out an unprecedented alert warning health workers to reuse their disposable gowns and, where possible, to wear aprons and laboratory coats instead.Ministers were under severe pressure to explain to the public where the next consignments of vital PPE were coming from, so the fateful decision was taken to tell the nation about the Turkey delivery at the Downing Street press conference led by Robert Jenrick, the Communities Secretary, on Saturday April 19.Today I can report that a very large consignment of PPE is due to arrive in the UK tomorrow from Turkey, which amounts to 84 tonnes of PPE and will include, for example, 400,000 gowns – so a very significant additional shipment, he said.According to one report, officials from the Department of Health warned Number 10 not to publicise the Turkey deal but were overruled.Behind the scenes, there was already a problem. A draconian weekend lockdown had just been enforced in Turkey. In Istanbul, Mr Duzen and his colleagues found their usual suppliers were unavailable, with factory workers forced to stay at home.Meanwhile, the firm had not yet formally secured an export license from the Turkish government, needed to sidestep a national export ban on PPE.If it was a normal order, I would have cancelled it because there was a misunderstanding and there was no time, Mr Duzen told the Financial Times last month. How could I supply the goods in one night? We didn\u0027t sleep. During frantic conference calls, UK officials tried to break down the obstacles in time to fulfil Mr Jenrick\u0027s promise.The following day, Gavin Williamson, the Education Secretary, admitted that the consignment was not yet ready, adding that he hoped it would arrive the next day.On Monday, as the Air Jenrick mission dominated news coverage, the decision was taken to send the Airbus A400-M plane to Turkey anyway in order to apply pressure.According to one senior Whitehall source, there was considerable disquiet among RAF chiefs as Government press officers sent out regular releases promising that the delivery would shortly arrive.The MOD was not part of this. The RAF was only there to help out, the source said. There were constant updates every time the plane moved an inch, and pictures in the newspapers. It looked ridiculous, frankly.The PPE order was still not ready, however. Eventually, the Turkish government stepped in to help UK ministers save face. It was arranged that a last-minute shipment of only 32,000 gowns made by Ushas, a state-backed firm, would be packed onto the plane, which finally left for RAF Brize Norton on the Monday afternoon. Exactly what happened next is unclear. According to sources, UK officials in Turkey did check the boxes of gowns supplied by Selegna to make sure they adhered to the agreed standards.After being given the go-ahead, RAF personnel dragged an initial consignment of around 67,000 gowns on to two more planes, which left for the UK later that week. But when they arrived, inspectors from the Health and Safety Executive discovered a major problem. Tests on around 2,400 of the gowns revealed that they would not, in fact, keep NHS workers safe from coronavirus.Around 4,500 more did pass the tests, but officials placed an immediate halt on further deliveries. The useless gowns were impounded in a facility near Heathrow, where they remain.Senior sources admitted on Thursday that a further 170,000 Selegna gowns were blocked by the UK after the alarm was raised, and are still in Turkey being checked by the Turkish Standards Institute.Hospital trusts which had been promised the vital gear were then informed that their deliveries had been cancelled.Asked on Thursday what had happened, Mr Duzen claimed he had not received any complaints from the NHS. The fabric we supplied was certified, he insisted. If there was a problem, they could do research and let us know.Sources at the Department of Health, however, said officials were in negotiations with Selegna to either supply safe PPE or hand back the deposit.There was a view that it was good enough PPE – it is only when it has got here that teams have looked at it again and taken a view that it is not up to the right standard and they\u0027ve decided not to use it,” said Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland Secretary, on Thursday.It is not known exactly how much the UK has already paid, but the total order is thought to be in the region of £300,000.Tobias Ellwood, the chairman of the defence select committee, called for an investigation if errors have been committed. He said: I want this Government to succeed – but you need to demonstrate your success, not promise it and fail to deliver.Niall Dickson, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents organisations across the healthcare sector, said: This illustrates the danger of making promises on a wing and a prayer. We have warned repeatedly that setting big targets which are then not met and saying all will be well, when at the sharp end of care it is manifestly not, undermines confidence among clinical staff on the front line.A spokesman for the Department of Health said on Thursday that ministers were grateful for the assistance of the Turkish government, adding: We have received part of an order of around 400,000 gowns from a private supplier in Turkey. While a small number of these gowns have failed tests in the UK, more have passed tests making them suitable for use in the NHS.We are working night and day to source PPE internationally and domestically, and more orders are lined up and expected from suppliers in the UK and overseas. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ve day 2020 celebrations pictures","story":"Neighbours Steve Corney and his son Teddy (5) share the two minute silence across the garden fence with their neighbour, former Lt-Cdr Leslie Taylor (81) who served as a Weapons Engineer Submariner.

Patient zero has not yet been confirmed.The theory the virus was circulating earlier than expected came after a French athlete who fell ill after competing in Wuhan in October said she had been told by doctors that she had likely caught Covid-19.The claim by Elodie Clouvel, an Olympic silver-winning pentathlete, bolstered claims that the coronavirus may have been carried around the world by those who had taken part in an international competition there.Ms Clouvel, 31, says that she, along with her boyfriend Valentin Belaud, 27, who is also a pentathlete, fell ill after the Military World Games, which were held in Wuhan on October 18-27 with 9,308 athletes from 109 countries. Other French team members has since spoken to the French press, mainly on condition of anonymity, to say they too had fallen sick.“We all fell ill with the same symptoms,” Ms Clouvel, a military police officer, told RTL radio. The French army denies knowledge of anyone contracting the disease during the games.This week, French doctors informed a 43-year old man that a “mystery” disease he contracted on December 27 and that left him requiring oxygen was indeed Covid-19 after testing a frozen swab. Until then the first confirmed case in France was on January 24.The discovery of France\u0027s potential patient zero prompted the World Health Organisation to urge other countries to investigate any other early suspicious cases.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"duke duchess york sued 67m swiss ski chalet","story":"Legal proceedings have begun in Switzerland against the Duke of York and his ex-wife Sarah, it has been reported, over £6.7 million they were said to still owe on a luxury chalet.The Duke and Sarah, Duchess of York, who remain close despite their 1996 orce, bought shares in the holiday home in the Verbier ski resort in south-west Switzerland in 2014 for 22 million Swiss francs (£18.3 million).It is alleged that they have missed a payment deadline, with legal proceedings made public via a French-language newspaper.A source on Thursday night told the Daily Mail the Yorks have already made plans to sell their part of the property, with the beginning of a legal case causing some bafflement.The original owners of the chalet, who retain shares in the property, want their money, they added.The wooden chalet, which the Duchess is reported to have moved to for a short while in 2015, has seven bedrooms, an indoor swimming pool and a sauna. In the deeds of sale, seen by Le Temps, six million francs were due to be paid at the end of last year. It now equates to eight million francs with interest, it claimed.Four months on, Etude du Ritz, a law firm, has been instructed by the vendor to launch legal proceedings at the local prosecution office.There was no immediate comment from Etude de Ritz on Thursday.Le Temps quoted a spokesman for the Yorks as saying: There is a dispute between the two parties in this matter, adding that the contractual details were subject to a confidentiality agreement. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: This isn\u0027t something we would comment on.The legal proceedings will be another blow for the Duke of York, who has already stepped back from duties as a member of the Royal family following the Jeffrey Epstein scandal.In recent weeks, he has been seen in Instagram photographs with his ex-wife, with whom he is still on good terms, packing bags for the NHS in what had been seen as an effort to rebuild his reputation.In November, he announced he would step back from public duties for the foreseeable future after facing mounting public pressure following a disastrous interview with the BBC\u0027s Emily Maitlis over his friendship with convicted child sex offender Epstein.I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein, he said in a statement then. He continues to emphatically deny any wrongdoing.Earlier this year, The Daily  revealed that the Duke - who is no longer represented by Buckingham Palace press office - had been receiving PR advice from Mark Gallagher, a crisis management specialist nicknamed the backroom fixer.As the FBI and US prosecutors sought to interview him about his relationship with Epstein, the Duke also hired Clare Montgomery, Britain\u0027s most respected extradition lawyer.Andrew married Sarah in 1986, splitting amicably in 1992 after having two daughters and orcing four years later.

But there, in the heart of London, darkness was strangely absent on one city street. A stream of light illuminated almost an entire city block.Some happy soul had raised a blackout shade. And for the first time in nearly six years, it was done without fear of inviting an air raid warden’s citation or German bombs.That marvellous lighted scene, foretelling the end of Europe’s deadliest period, has stayed with me all these years. The date was May 7, 1945.I was 20 then, and a B-24 bomber radio gunner on a three-day pass from my airbase outside of Norwich, a five-hour train ride away. On an Underground train en route to Piccadilly Circus, I kind of got the picture after spotting a newspaper headline: “Unconditional Surrender Imminent” it screamed in thick, black letters.The lighted street seemed to confirm the headline. By 3 p.m. the next day, it was official.Standing on the War Ministry balcony above Whitehall at that hour, a beaming Winston Churchill flashed his familiar V-sign. This time, though, his “V” for victory was no symbolic promise. “This is your victory,” he told a huge crowd that had gathered.Cheers grew into one hell of a party. People poured into the streets, shouting, dancing, embracing. They mounted double-decker buses and utility poles, waved flags, started bonfires and danced the hokey-cokey around a statue of Queen Victoria. Sirens blared, car horns honked and church bells pealed.I found myself drawn to Buckingham Palace. A roar from the crowd and wild applause greeted the appearance of the Royal Family on the balcony. From where I stood, among a mass of humanity, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, their princess daughters Elizabeth and Margaret, and prime minister Churchill were a distant blur. The next day, newspaper pictures showed them responding to the crowd’s adulation with smiles and waves.That night, floodlights illuminated Buckingham Palace and the Houses of Parliament for the first time since the Battle of Britain began in 1939. And Big Ben’s toll, signaling the official end of the war in Europe, was greeted by exploding fireworks and screaming sirens.Bus and train service in and out of London was halted, and thousands who had flocked to the city to witness and participate in these historic moments jammed hotels and parks. US military personnel passes were extended for two days because of a mass transit breakdown.Great – except for the fact that the Red Cross servicemen’s hotel – and all other hotels – had no vacancies, and my money had run out. I wasn’t alone and joined hundreds of others, spending a damp, chilly night trying to keep warm and sleep near one of the bonfires in St James’s Park.A thin, dark-haired girl I met also was left out in the cold, unable to return to her suburban home because trains weren’t running. Doreen Jordan was her name and she told me that her mother had come to London to celebrate the end of the First World War and had met and married a Yank. She couldn’t wait for the end of rationing, she said, especially for the day when nylon stockings would be available in England. Several months later, back in the States, I answered her prayers and mailed her three pairs of nylon stockings. The anticipated thank-you note never arrived, though.My memories of those tumultuous days will be rekindled today. I’ll be there in spirit, recalling the joy and that chilly night in St James’s Park. This time, though, I’ll be with my wife of nearly 71 lucky years, and the sole survivor of my fun-loving, nine-member 8th Air Force B-24 bomber crew Today, I’ll drink a toast to the memory of my old buddies.

The coronavirus outbreak means that there will be no street parties, parades or concerts this year, but there is plenty going on to celebrate.A national two minute silence took place at 11am, which gave Britons the opportunity to pause and reflect, remembering the lives lost and sacrifices made in wartime. The RAF\u0027s Red Arrows also roared over parts of the UK, in a special flypast to mark the anniversary.The Queen will address the nation from Windsor Castle at 9pm. Her speech on the significance of VE Day will take place at the same time that her father, King George VI, gave a radio address back in 1945.

Here is the latest update from our Berlin Correspondent, Justin Huggler:German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier gave a sombre speech to mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day. May 8 was the end of National Socialist tyranny, the end of bombing nights and death marches, the end of unprecedented German crimes and the Holocaust’s breach of civilization, he said.President Steinmeier and Angela Merkel took part in a wreath-laying ceremony at Berlin\u0027s Neue Wache memorial, standing far apart to observe social distancing.Germany wanted to mark the occasion with representatives of the victorious Allies, and had invited young people from around the world, but instead faced a lonely commemoration because of the coronavirus, he said.Perhaps this being alone will take us back to May 8, 1945, because at that time the Germans were actually alone...defeated militarily, politically and economically…morally shattered. We had made ourselves the enemy of the whole world, he said.He paid tribute to previous generations who had struggled to denazify Germany and regain its place in the community of nations, and thanked the survivors, the descendants of victims, and all those in the world who gave this country the chance to start again. When victory was announced, the people of Britain ate, drank and made merry as they hadn’t since the war effort began.As people came together over a series of feasts, food historian Annie Gray has the story on how that was able to happen after years of rationing. You can read all about it here.A victory tea party was given to children at Amber Road, Finsbury Park in LondonFrom crowds in Trafalgar Square and Belfast to street parties in Essex and a knees-up on Manchester’s cobbled streets, here is how VE looked across the nation in 1945.Prime Minister Boris Johnson will speak to a number of world leaders to remember the events of VE Day 75 years ago.Mr Johnson has already spoken to Russian president Vladimir Putin to mark the partnership of British and Russian forces during the war.The PM is due to speak with German chancellor Angela Merkel and Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki later in the day.Asked whether Mr Johnson raised the issue of cyber-hacking of the NHS with Mr Putin, the PM\u0027s spokesman said: The primary purpose of it is to mark VE Day.The Prime Minister and President Putin met in January and the PM set out very clearly then what the UK\u0027s position was on the relationship we have with Russia and what needs to happen before it can be normalised.The last message sent by a German army radio network in the final hours of the war said: ‘closing down for ever – all the best – goodbye’, newly released GCHQ files show. Britain’s cyber spy agency has revealed the intercepted signal for the first time to mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day.Read the full report from our Defence and Security Correspondent, Dominic Nicholls, here. The Queen recorded an interview for the BBC Radio 4 programme The Way We Were for the 40th anniversary on May 8, 1985.As a 19-year-old princess, she joined thousands of other revellers after slipping into the crowds to dance and sing outside Buckingham Palace unnoticed with her 14-year-old sister Princess Margaret.In the archive audio on the Royal Family\u0027s social media channels, the Queen can be heard saying: We cheered the King and Queen on the balcony and then walked miles through the streets.I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall, all of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief.She reveals how they cheated to make sure their parents appeared on the balcony to their shouts of We want the King.We were successful in seeing my parents on the balcony, having cheated slightly because we sent a message into the house to say we were waiting outside, the Queen says.I think it was one of the most memorable nights of my life.As the country around him broke into celebration, John Richard Perceval spent 8th May 1945 in a state of quiet contemplation. The 36-year-old was sitting alone in his bedroom in Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, gazing out over a field of sheep. On his radio, he could hear the thousands of well-wishers who had gathered outside Buckingham Palace, about 50 miles away, to cheer the unconditional surrender of German army. But Perceval was in no mood to wave flags. For five years, he had worked alongside Alan Turing at the secret Bletchley Park code-breaking facility.Dick Perceval\u0027s diaries shed light on a remarkable period. Read the full story, from Luke Mintz, here. The UK\u0027s first skytyping display has been conducted, to mark VE Day and pay tribute to frontline workers.Messages such as We Will Meet Again and Thank You were etched in the sky above Henstridge airfield in Somerset.The display was commissioned by the Department for Transport, which recently introduced a law change to allow skytyping and skywriting to take place.Skywriting was inadvertently discovered by an RAF pilot during the First World War, when oil accidentally entered a plane\u0027s exhaust, creating dense, white smoke.Victory in Europe Day will always be a landmark in British history and it is an honour to have commissioned the first skytyping display in the UK to mark the occasion.With its strong British history, stemming from the creation of skywriting, it seems an entirely fitting way to honour all those who fought for our freedom while also thanking those keeping the country moving during this challenging time.A copy of the Daily  from Tuesday May 08, 1945A copy of the Daily  from Friday May 04, 1945A copy of the Daily  from Saturday May 05, 1945 To find out more about how we covered the end of the war, read here. The Prime Minister has spoken with a 102-year-old Second World War veteran and told him he was awesome, following the two-minute silence held at 11am to mark VE Day.He held a Zoom call with a veteran, an amazing guy by the name of Ernie Horsfall.He is 102 and one of the UK\u0027s oldest surviving servicemen.Ernie served with the Army\u0027s Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers from 1940 to 1946 as a staff sergeant.He was in Naples on VE Day, on the outskirt of the city along the Pompeii road, running workshops to repair and maintain tanks.He and the PM had a really lovely conversation, they spoke for just over half an hour.Mr Johnson told Ernie he was awesome and a credit to his generation during the call.From the Queen to Dame Vera Lynn, the coronavirus crisis has been full of wartime references - but do the comparisons really pass muster?Our feature writer, Luke Mintz, has asked those who lived through both.The threat was external - people were afraid of bombs and invasion, and there was a psychological need to draw together with family and crowds, in pubs and so on, as a kind of reassurance, says Katherine Knight, 87. This time, the idea is that we should keep apart as much as we can.”You can read the full set of interviews here. The SSAFA, the armed forces charity, says it is immensely honoured to have received a message of support from the Queen on VE Day.The Queen, who is the charity\u0027s patron, was joined by Prince Michael of Kent in sending her best wishes.She said: As patron of SSAFA, the armed forces charity, I am pleased to send my best wishes to the beneficiaries, volunteers, employees and all those concerned with the charity on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of VE Day.At this increasingly challenging time, I know that you have continued to provide support to members of the armed forces and veterans, together with their families.As you reflect on the charity\u0027s 135-year history, my thoughts and prayers remain with you all for your continued safety and the future success of your important work.SSAFA has been providing lifelong support to the nation\u0027s forces and their families since 1885.Last year their teams of volunteers and employees helped more than 85,000 people in need, from Second World War veterans to young men and women who have served in more recent conflicts, and their families.Our feature writer, Joe Shute, has conducted a series of interviews with those who remember VE Day firsthand, from war heroes to young evacuees. You can read their moving accounts below:WW2 hero Harry Billinge: ‘Like the war, this experience will bring us together\u0027. The 94-year-old veteran speaks to Joe Shute about his VE day memories, and his hopes for a post-lockdown world‘VE Day was a normal day. There were some dark moments knowing the war had finished but not for us’. Flight lieutenant Doug Temple, 94, was stationed in East India when VE Day happened, and he was still at war ‘I lost count of the people I danced with in Trafalgar Square’. Former WRAF Joan Hall, 95, was given the day off to celebrate VE Day and joined the throngs of people heading to London‘VE Day meant I would be reunited with my family - we were strangers after so long apart’. Harry Norton, 90, was a 14-year-old wartime evacuee - VE Day meant he could finally see his family again‘On VE Day I met a young Wren. We promised to meet up but we never saw each other again’. Able seaman Seymour Taylor, 95, recounts coming ashore the day that celebrations ensuedA Royal British Legion chairman and his neighbours celebrated VE Day despite the coronavirus outbreak, and vowed to make the best of a sad situation with a socially distanced street party.Former soldier Eric Howden BEM, 75, had planned a parade with comrades in Redcar, Cleveland, but restrictions meant the event was cancelled.Instead, he organised a mark of remembrance outside his bungalow, lowering his branch\u0027s Royal British Legion standard at 11am and observing a minute\u0027s silence.Afterwards, as We\u0027ll Meet Again played over the loudspeakers from Mr Howden\u0027s garden, neighbours danced along and joined in.He said: The only alternative to what we had planned was to do it outside my own home and the neighbours have come forward too, some sitting in their gardens, some hanging over their fence.We have done our duty by paying respects and now we are going to have a street party, doing what we can under the circumstances.We are going to have a good time, with cakes, biscuits and buns that people have made, while observing the two-metre rule.

This is great for quickly copying handwritten notes (if you write neatly!) and pasting it on your laptop without having to retype them all”, Google said on its blog.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever, for\u0026nbspthe copy-and-paste functionality to work properly, users must be using the latest version of the Google Chrome browser, and must be signed in to their Google account on both devices.Lens has improved its foreign language capabilities too users will now be able to select the text with Lens and tap a new Listen button to hear it out loud.Best phone to buy 2020: The latest iPhone, Android and Sony releasesFinally, Google has also added the ability to look up new definitions using Lens.

Others, such as the\u0026nbspOppo Find X2 Pro, will require the app to be downloaded before it can be found under the “More” section of its main camera app.As well as those mentioned above, Google Lens can also be used to identify plants and animals, to pull up facts about landmarks around you, scanning clothing and furniture, and reading QR codes and barcodes.Google’s Lens functionality was first introduced in 2017 as a part of Google IO.\u0026nbspThe app uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to detect what is in an image by comparing it to a dataset of countless other versions of a similar image.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Aarts, an activist, philanthropist and chef, said: “We have ramped up from 200 to 3,900 meals a day but the move to Wembley will allow us to gear up further to cook and deliver 20,000 meals a day – which is 140,000 meals a week.How to support our campaign“We already supply 15 hospitals, elderly care homes, community centres and homeless hostels. These organisations are trying to cope with unprecedented demand for food and they keep asking us for more. Our new kitchen will allow us to keep pace with rising hunger and need.”Compassion London operates seven days a week with 25 chefs and 200 volunteers who pack and deliver food to charities and families. The fresh, raw produce comes daily from The Felix Project, the biggest distributor of surplus food in London, which has quadrupled its deliveries since lockdown to 40 tonnes a day and supplies daily more than 100 charities, schools and community hubs like Compassion London.The Independent has pledged to raise £10m to help The Felix Project feed hungry people across the capital over the next three years – with £3.65m already donated since we launched our appeal on 27 March.The Wembley facility is being given to Compassion London free of charge, thanks to Wembley Stadium, its in-house caterer Delaware North and the stadium’s owner, the Football Association.Top restaurant chefs join forces to provide free meals for familiesPhoebe Waller-Bridge backs our appealOur appeal raises £3.5m as food crisis deepensHead chef Mr Lomas said: “Using an empty kitchen and bringing food together to feed vulnerable people and the NHS is fantastic.

They also had a more positive perception of their cognitive abilities, i.e. memory, learning and ability to concentrate.”The basic income also appears to have moderate effect on encouraging people to find jobs – an effect some had theorised would occur because recipients do not lose their support when they take one up.The study found that people paid the income were in employment on average six days more than people in a control group where people were not payed the income.“The employment rate for basic income recipients improved slightly more during this period than for the control group,” the study said.The latter finding is in contrast to arguments by opponents of the policy, such as former DWP secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who suggested the policy would be a “disincentive” to work because it did not include sanctions.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

New leader Keir Starmer has however moved away from backing the policy. It has long been supported by the Green party.Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, rejected the policy last month, telling MPs: “I think we need to have a very focused approach providing the resources that we need to those that need it most.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The stay at home regulations much remain in place until the next review in three weeks time. We must not lose the progress that we\u0027ve made.But he said there were some small and modest adjustment which we could make to the regulations, stating that the Welsh government wanted to make these adjustments on Monday so that we move in step with the other nations of the United Kingdom, as part of our determined preference for a four-nation approach.Boris Johnson accused of ‘mixed messages’ over lockdown easing – liveWe will adjust our regulations to allow people to go out and exercise more than once a day but we will strengthen our regulations to make it clear that that exercise must be local. It should begin and end at home and it should not involved any significant travel away from home.Our second planned change to the regulations will be to allow garden centres to reopen, provided that the two metres social distancing can be applied.

British journalism, in particular.What’s stopping you right now from falling off your perch in fits of laughter  Well, the fact that you’re currently digesting a work of journalism.This probably means that it’s an act – let’s call it that for now – which you’re used to committing on a fairly regular basis.Let’s also assume then that much of the information you gather, store and share comes from such journalistic sources.It’s likely you frequently form opinions and make decisions based on this content you consume.In fact, think really hard for a moment and try and imagine an area of your le where you haven’t been guided in some form by journalism.Buying a house, investing your savings, choosing a school, picking a holiday, deciding which box to put your cross in when you go into a polling booth .If you’re honest with yourself, you tend to make most of those decisions after you’ve digested the array of journalism available to you. And let’s also admit, disregarded too.Some of it is opinion led, some is impartial. You might not agree with all of it, and sometimes you might get ruddy cross at a paper or commentator that doesn’t chime with your world view.But together, the many erse components of British journalism create something which is profoundly valuable.The Covid- pandemic has tested our society to the limit. In the midst of a national crisis, journalists have been putting their lives at risk to keep you informed.News outlets have faithfully broadcast public health announcements – but also held our political leaders to account.The Downing Street daily conference has become a household staple, with ministerial interrogation by the press corps regularly influencing government policy.Without such probing questions and front page splashes, would you have known about the dearth of PPE or the crisis in our care homes Journalism, from local to national level, has connected communities in a way that social networks can only dream of. We have celebrated triumph in the face of adversity – and also documented tributes from the tens of thousands who have lost loved ones.But now we come to the rub.With the country under lockdown, British journalism is facing the biggest threat in its storied history.For newspapers, sales have dramatically fallen. For broadcasters and online outlets, advertising has gone through the floor even whilst audience numbers have risen.Yes, journalism joins one of many industries in financial peril right now.The work of reporters should be held up to scrutiny like any other profession. But we also need to acknowledge the sacrices its practitioners are making to keep the public informed.Everything that journalism hands to you doesn’t come for free.I’m sure that when you think about this properly, in a way you might never have done before, it really is needed more than everWe have to safeguard journalism. It is far too important to discard because it isn’t worth contemplating what the world would look likequality journalism didn’t exist.I don’t need to urge you to buy a paper or take up an online subscription, but I want you to tell everyone you meet that our sector is under a very real and present threat.I am the CEO of the Journalists’ Charity. It was founded in  by Charles Dickens and a group of parliamentary reporters – naturally in a pub.Our core mission to this day remains the same: to bring aid to journalists and their dependents who have fallen on hard times.We are stepping up to the mark, helping those in need with emergency funding and practical and emotional support.It’s why we’ve launched a #supportjournalism campaign in print and on social media.For me, a lockdown without journalists would be unthinkable.That’s why the Journalists’ Charity is standing four-square behind our industry when it needs us most. But we also need you to do your bit too.The Journalists’ Charity has been helping journalists through tough times for more than  years. The charity is currently supporting iniduals from all sectors struggling from the impact of Coronavirus.

If Boris Johnson is to get our flatlining economy going again, he and his Government must prove to the public that lockdown restrictions can be lted sensibly and safely.And that’s where homemade masks come in. Yes, we know they’re not perfect. But mounting evidence proves that insisting on their use in confined spaces can help slow the spread of the virus, and — crucially — they lend confidence.One way or another, it’s becoming crystal clear that after lockdown Britain will be very dferent from the country we remember. Gone are the days of a post-work pint in the pub to wind down:ministers permit us to socialise, it will be only for picnics, and only with those we consider our close friends.But with the economy on its knees, we must throw everything we’ve got at creating a “new normal” to tide us over until a vaccine can be found.Andmasks are part of that, then let’s get Britain sewing.OFFICIALS must stop hiding behind corona-jargon and start explaining in plain English exactly what they want from us.Guidance states thatyou’re classed as “extremely clinically vulnerable” you’re supposed to “shield”, andyou’re considered “clinically vulnerable” you should be “closely following social distancing rules”.The problem is thatyou’re over  and not in the habit of scrutinising government websites, you may understandably not know what the dference between those terms is. And so could be putting yourself through the misery of a  week self-isolation unnecessarily.Brits have given up most of their cherished liberties at the drop of a hat. Many of them have sacriced their jobs too.The very least they are owed is clear, comprehensive guidance on what the new normal is supposed to look like.THE news that McDonald’s will open  of its stores next week has cheered us up.Yes, it’s a blow that the lockdown menu is limited and some fan favourites didn’t make the cut. Butthe trial opening goes well, we have no doubt they will alsoAnd in the meantime, a world with McFlurries in it is definitely brighter.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I am , so when I joined the workforce we were in the midst of a financial crisis that plunged the economy into paralysis.I have endured years of political to-ing and fro-ing over spending, infrastructure projects and — whether you voted for it or not — Westminster’s tortuous Brexit chicanery that has slowed down economic growth.The price  Real wages, measured alongside inflation, only got back above their  levels this year.House prices shot up to unaffordable levels, with governments promising to build the houses we need but failing miserably to take on the vested interests that stand in the way.Young people could already only dream of owning a home before the world shut down.Just this week, a friend sent round a story on WhatsApp about the possibility of house prices collapsing.We all just laughed and agreed we still could not get anywhere near a deposit, and not because we have been enjoying too much avocado toast.And just as we looked forward to a British bounce once Brexit was in the rear-view mirror, now a global pandemic has made  look like nothing more than a trailer for the main event in which this young generation, yet again, gets a starring role.It is not just about getting money moving and business booming, either.The temporary schemes introduced by the Government to get people through the worst of this crisis will leave a borrowing pile that not even Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell could have dreamed up.Most likely, that means higher taxes and lower spending for decades. In short, Britain’s under-s are being condemned to years of an economy going backwards.So it is time for them to be allowed back to work and start the recovery. We should all be invested in British companies’ success.The better they do, the more jobs they create, the more they can pay, the better le is. Yes, there is a risk to getting the young back to work.But witness the orderly queues outside supermarkets and the pavement shuffle dance that we have all perfected to give each other space.The public, young and old, understand the threat of this virus.We invented all these video apps everyone is now socialising on. We are more than happy to use them for a little while longer.As for employers, they have built everything from thriving construction businesses to high-tech apps.It is not going to be beyond them to install plastic screens in the office, and nor are Lisa in marketing and Phil in accounts going to make like Professor Pantsdown in the filing cupboard.Are we prepared to trust our fellow Brits, take that risk and allow the next generation a better chance to succeed Even some of those in the highest at-risk groups will acknowledge we cannot live in economic shutdown forever.Even the boffins at Oxford know a vaccine will take months,not years.AndTikTok-ing millennials are not exactly winning much sympathy, what about the parents of young kids Anybody looking after children at home right now knows full well their productivity is close to zero.They need schools and nurseries open, too.Britain’s most dynamic cities and companies are being driven by the young, from the video game industry in Dundee to the start-up hubs of Shoreditch.They have had a decade of flatlining wages, a housing crisis and now the corona crash. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Those who could not serve overseas volunteered on farms to help feed our nations.And in unprecedented numbers, women stepped up to serve in field hospitals, factories, fire departments, and civil defence stations.Commitment, innovation, and self-sacrice are what made that first VE Day possible.And that is exactly what we are seeing again today.Medical workers, supermarket workers, and bus drivers are stepping up in service to others to defend against Covid-.People are observing social distancing in order to keep others safe.Neighbours are taking care of neighbours. We are also seeing the same tremendous innovation we saw during WWII.Scientists are racing against the clock to develop therapies and vaccines. Hospitals are being built in record time.Schools are finding new ways to continue to educate our young people remotely.We are even seeing the modernof the Victory Gardens, as families across our countries plant fresh fruit and vegetables in gardens and window boxes.And, someday soon we will all meet again, and raise a glass to the heroes of today, and the heroes of WWII.That greatest of generations will remain our guiding inspiration – not only on account of their heroism and sacrice during the war, but also their resilience and resolve after it.When countries across the world lay in ruins after the war, with industries and economies on their knees, they rolled up their sleeves and they got to work to rebuild and re-emerge stronger than before.That is exactly what we will do as soon as the lockdown is over.Just this week, our governments kicked off the formal process to start negotiating a huge US-UK trade deal.Trade is at the heart of our shared prosperity on which our shared security is built.Working side by side, as we always do, there is no limit to the opportunities and prosperity our countries will create.So on a day when we celebrate the heroes and victories of the past, we are also looking forward to the future and laying the groundwork for a new era of success in the Special Relationship.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it is dficult, its hard to explain to a five and a six, nearly seven-year-old what’s going on.With the UK in its seventh week of lockdown, Kate wants Brits to reflect the resilience, bravery and kindness they are experiencing by capturing family, friends and colleagues living under lockdown.Her new initiative, Hold Still, is being run with the National Portrait Gallery which the duchess supports as patron.Of her own photography skills, she told This Morning: Im very much an amateur photographer - I sort of learn along the way but during this time I’ve spent lots of time bringing out my camera and taking lots of photographs of the children because they are always around us and we are doing stuff together which has been great.Speaking about her new project, Kate said: Weve all been struck by some of the incredible images weve seen which have given us an insight into the experiences and stories of people across the country.Some desperately sad images showing the human tragedy of this pandemic and other uplting pictures showing people coming together to support those more vulnerable.Hold Still aims to capture a portrait of the nation, the spirit of the nation, what everyone is going through at this time. Photographs reflecting resilience, bravery, kindness - all those things that people are experiencing.Kate has been struck by some of the striking photos taken of le at the moment, including an image of two self-isolating grandparents putting their hands up to glass doors to touch the fingers of their grandchildren on the other side.Another picture to strike a chord was a nurse showing the red marks and bruising on her face after wearing personal protective equipment during a -hour sht.The project, which is free and open to all ages and abilities, includes three categories - Helpers And Heroes, Your New Normal and Acts Of Kindness.The duchess will help to curate  of the entries, chosen for the emotion or experiences they express rather then their expertise, with the photographs going on virtual display before a selection are shown across the UK later in the year.The project opens from Thursday and runs until June , with photographers asked to send their pictures via the National Portrait Gallerys website.We are backing a proposal by Lord Ashcroft to honour our health heroes with the gallantry gong given for acts of bravery that did not take place in battle.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.” SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking our readers to please sign the petition below. Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day -

which is said to be unfinished and inoperable.Kim vanished for more than  days - sparking rumours he was ill, or even dead - before he reappeared at the start of May.State media released pictures of him beaming as he toured the new industrial complex in Sunchon, complete with a ceremonial cutting of the ribbon.Reports have now emerged that this event was actually mysteriously and suddenly arranged just two days before it happened - and nobody knew Kim was going to be there, reports Daily NK.North Korea is notoriously secretive, and it is very hard to know exactly what occurs within its borders without explicit confirmation from the regime.Fresh reports of this  hour panic to stage a big event for Kims reappearence adds further mystery to his apparent disappearance.And this is despite South Korea insisting he is fine, was just riding out the coroanvirus pandemic.North Korean state media did report on two letters Kim had allegedly sent during his disappearance - but have continued to fail to offer a reason for his absence.Rumours around Kims health were sparked when he missed the key Day of the Sun celebrations on April  after last being seen on April .Satellite photos appeared to show he was in the seaside city of Wonsan as his armoured train was spotted, but the US repeatedly said they had not seen Kim.It has now emerged a sudden order was sent by one of North Koreas top government committees on April .Workers at the Sunchon factory were told to prepare for a completion ceremony - even though the plant was nowhere near done.Women and children were mobilised to plant flower beds and clean the roads within the factory grounds.Builders are said worked themselves to the bone, night and day to try and get the job done in just two days.Kim was then on hand for grand opening with his sister Kim Yo-jong, but the factory is allegedly just a facade.It is unfinished and incapable of producing fertiliser due to a lack of imported machinery and raw materials.North Korea authorities have reportedly given factory chiefs until October to get the plant working.A source said: Nobody onsite expected that the event would involve Kim Jong-un himself. Everyone knows that construction was not complete.Kims reemergence appears not to be business as usual as North Korea suggests, but a carefully crafted publicity stunt for the dictator.South Korea has insisted all is well with Kim, but questions and theories loom over his health - such as a mysterious needle mark on his arm and credible reports China sent a medical team to advise on him.Flurries of reports emerged from the US, Japan, South Korea and China - all of them saying the same thing, something is wrong with Kim.Kim healths is not believed to be good, reportedly being a prolic binge eater, heavy drinker and chain smoker with a history of heart problems in his family.He has also reportedly only made  public appearances this year, as opposed to  in .Wilder theories have speculated the Kim who appeared on May  is actually just a body double standing in for him.Meanwhile, North Korea is believed to be constructing a new missile base able to house  of his nuclear-capable Hwasong- weapons.And Kim went missing again this week when he didnt appear at a ceremony in which Russia awarded him a medal in Pyongyang as part of anniversary celebrations for the defeat of Nazi Germany.Mintaro Oba, a former US official who worked on North Korea, told ABC: The blunt truth is that we can speculate all we want about where Kim Jong-un was and why he disappeared, but we simply dont know.It could be for health reasons, it could be for tactical reasons, we just dont know with any certainty and probably wont.Professor John Blaxland, from the Australian National University, added: We cant even be sure when these were taken, there is the question ofits even him as he has a body double but I dont give much credence to that theory.Theres certainly the question of whether or not this is even a real event.The academic said Kims unexplained lack of appearance on The Day of The Sun is the big question, while Mr Oba said experts are looking very closely at the pictures.Professor Blaxland suggested his disappearance may have been a carefully arranged piece of political theatre, designed to flush out any dissenters among his inner circle.And with South Korea claiming Kim was hiding from the coronavirus, that raises more questions as North Korea continues to boast it has zero cases of the infection.Meanwhile, days after he reappeared North and South Korea exchanged fire over the heavily fortied DMZ that separates the two nations - driving home the fact the region remains on a kne edge.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But a fellow young soldier was running to catch up, so they pulled him in and he sat opposite my grandpa, who askedhe was OK.He replied “yes”, only for his stomach and guts to fall out all over the floor. He was dead within minutes.Because my grandpa was a professional soldier, he wasn’t demobilised and sent home after the war, but was billeted with the family of a German soldier of equal rank as he became part of the occupation forces in the British-run sector of what would become West Germany.Just imagine how hard that must have been: Living with someone who a few weeks earlier you were trying to kill.But my grandpa said: “They were just like us, fighting for their country.”Without wanting to disparage the generations that have followed — mine included — it’s hard to imagine a member of Generation X or a millennial turning such trauma into a positive way of living.But,  years on, there’s very good reason why our leaders today have regularly invoked the unsurpassed generation who came of age during World War Two throughout the current coronavirus crisis.It’s no coincidence this group of fine folk includes the Queen, Sir David Attenborough and Captain Tom Moore, who have all provided the nation with so much inspiration at a time when celebrities, experts and politicians have often looked so deeply inadequate.That gives me some hope that out of our current trauma will come a new great generation of young leaders to shepherd us through the next  years.Maybe I’m naive, but I think the current pain and uncertainty surrounding lockdown could strengthen the character of young people, who have been mollycoddled by teachers and parents for so long.This is the only time since the last world war where the entire globe is engaged in a conflict that has upended le as we know it.We are again surrounded by tragedy, uncertainty and genuine fear.Adults can no longer provide easy assurances or answers to children about when they will be able toto normal le, be it visiting grandparents, going on holiday, shopping for clothes or attending school.While this is a situation no one would ever have wished for, I have a growing optimism that we are never going to take any of those seemingly everyday pursuits for granted again.What’s so striking about the generation who lived through World War Two is their total rejection of unnecessary consumerism. The Queen is a great example of this.She has all the money and privilege in the world, but feels no need to replace her rotary-dial telephone from  at Windsor Castle or wallpaper that dates back to Queen Victoria at Balmoral.I guess anyone who worried about surviving the London Blitz or lived in terror over whether relatives and friends wouldfrom the front line understands that hyper- consumerism is largely unimportant.Grandpa Bill’s future we, Catherine Taylor, my beloved grandma, was  years old and living in South Shields, Tyne and Wear, when World War Two broke out.My great-grandfather, a World War One veteran and coal miner, had resolved to send her to Canada on the SS Athenia.Thank God he changed his mind at the last minute it was the first British ship lost after war was declared.She was instead evacuated to Cockermouth in the Lake District to live with another family, but ed home just as German bombers started targeting the Tyneside shipyards and suburbs of Newcastle.My proud Geordie grandma Rua, as I called her, spent night after night in a not-at-all-sturdy brick shelter in their back garden, listening to the bombs drop nearby, on one occasion on her actual street.It was no le for a teenager. She carried her gas mask everywhere, knitted for airmen, joined bucket lines to put out fires and grieved for the  people of Newcastle lost in the bombings.Then there was the daily fear of the “telegram boy” arriving with messages of relatives killed in combat.But determined to help the war effort further, she dropped out of school and in  joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service — the women’s branch of the British Army during the war.This week I listened back to an oral history I recorded with my late grandma in the Nineties where she recounted her experiences of the time in her typically stoic and understated manner.I noticed that any time I tried to guide her towards talking about the emotional cost of her teenage years being overtaken by tragedy, she batted it away.“We didn’t talk much about nasty things,” she said softly. “I hated the bombing and I was terried. Looking back, I think we got through it with lots of prayers.“The war taught you about tragedy in people’s lives but you just battled on regardless.”In fact, grandma said the positives included being “united as a nation” and “people caring for one another”.Was she ever depressed “Le was entirely dferent then. We did sort of lose our teenage years in a way because they weren’t happy go lucky.“Teenagers in England now have the chance to go on the Continent and travel around at a very small cost.We couldn’t do anything like that. You just carried on. You had to.”There is very little comparison to what we are going through at the moment with the six years of death and destruction in World War Two.But it’s impossible to deny that the travel, socialising and happy-go- lucky approach to le we had become accustomed to has been stolen from us, for now at least.Youngsters previously so obsessed with how many people watched their latest dance video on TikTok are starting to think twice about what really matters.They’re volunteering. They’re cooking for family members. They’re talking on Zoom to isolated elderly relatives.Millennials who had become turned off and disillusioned with public le during the partisan Brexit wars are starting to re-engage with politics, aware of the real-le impact of decisions made by our leaders.Ridiculous snowflake battles around identity politics and social issues now feel meaningless.I hope and pray that when we look back in many decades’ time, we will be talking about how the historic coronavirus pandemic of  helped create a new greatest generation in the same way the end of World War Two did  years earlier.But tomorrow my thoughts will be entirely with all four of my grandparents — Bill, Cath, RAF airman John George Wheeler and London Blitz survivor Sylvia Jean Cook — who put their coming of age aside for the good of the country.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The scheme was designed to find work for jobless Brits.Mr Darling told Radio : The one thing we should learn about this is that the Government is not only the lender of last resort, it is also the insurer of last resort, it has got a duty to ensure that as far as we possibly can, people who lose their jobs are helped to get back into dferent employmentthat is necessary.He added: But for those people who are not going to be able to get back to work or will see signicant income reductions then only at the end of the day the Government can step in - that is what it is for.Airport and ground handling companies have called for a tapered end to the Governments job retention schemein a bid to avoid job losses.Organisations including Airlines UK, the Airport Operators Association, Swissport and Menzies Aviation have written to the Prime Minister to stress the absolute necessity of a flexible end to the scheme amid expectations of an easing to the economic lockdown.Between the airports, airlines and ground handling businesses, tens of thousands of staff are furloughed under the scheme.The industry is warning it will not be in a position tothem all to work at the current end date next month and is likely to make a signicant number of the redundancies the JRS was designed to avoid.Without a flexible or tapered end to the scheme, the industry will not be able to support the economic recovery, the letter warns.FSB boss Mike Cherry said: “Today’s figures are a stark reminder that millions of jobs are stake in the weeks ahead. As we look to recovery, small firms must be allowed to get back on their feet one step at a time –  million jobs depend on it.“Our members are telling us in no uncertain terms that part-time furloughing is the way forward - allowing staff toto work for a few days a week while remaining furloughed for days when they’re not required.“The economy is not suddenly going to start firing on all cylinders overnight. Adjustments to the job retention scheme need to reflect that fact.“Government must avoid applying sector straightjackets that don’t work for small firms. There are far too many businesses that don’t fit neatly into one box, like small companies that mainly supply to hotels, but aren’t classed as hospitality firms.“We need to see these changes made from the beginning of June as small businesses begin to restart. Orders are going unfulfilled because a few hours work doesn’t justy bringing somebody off furlough.Businesses can’t even quote for jobs to be completed once restrictions are eased. Time is of the essence.”Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies said Sunak should look at offering dferent furlough rates to workers in sectors of the economy which can begin reopening as part of the coronavirus recovery plan.He said there was an incredibly dficult and fine judgment to be made as some sectors of the economy were unlikely to ever fully recover.The respected think tank boss said: One of the big questions for Government in moving away from furlough policy is the extent to which it is able to do that dferentially by sector.You might think that the current system of really quite generous payments is appropriate for those sectors that have to remain locked down - so supposing you work in a bar or a restaurant you might think thats reasonable.The IFS also presented new research that revealed Britains lowest paid workers are in jobs that are least able to do remotely - exposing how the coronavirus lockdown has hit the poorest the hardest.The think tanks Rob Joyce said it is easier to work at home in higher paid occupations such as corporate managers, business managers, scientists, engineers, business associates and customer services.But lower paid jobs such as hospitality jobs, farming, sales, leisure and travel jobs are much harder to do from home, making “a lockdown especially problematic for lower earners on average”.Meanwhile new figures from the Office for National Statistics gave a rare positive boost, showing more than three quarers of firms in the UK were still trading despite the lockdown.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The EU continues to advocate a free press.On this specic case the EU delegation decided to proceed with publication with considerable reluctance because it considered it important to communicate the key messages.”Just two weeks ago the EEAS was forced to deny it had caved to pressure from China to water down a report into how Beijing is pumping out fake news about the killer virus.Eurocrats were accused of self-censoring to appease the Chinese Communist Party after a damning dossier was rewritten at the last minute.The EEAS accused Beijing of running a global disinformation campaign and specically targeting the French government.But references to both were removed and other language softened in the final published version of the report.Its release was delayed so it could be rewritten to tone down the criticism of China, according to emails seen by the New York Times.President Trump previously claimed the outbreak was the result of a horrible mistake after saying  he’d seen evidence the virus originated in a Chinese lab.The US president added the Chinese communist regime then tried to cover up their Covid- blunder.He said: Personally, I think they made a horrible mistake, and they didn’t want to admit it.We wanted to go in, but they didn’t want us there. They made a mistake, they tried to cover it, like a fire… They couldn’t put out the fire.Trump’s comments came after he told reporters he had seen proof that would suggest the virus originated in a lab in Wuhan but said he could not go into details.Others have linked the outbreak to a food market in the city - where the first virus victims were detected.Fox News reported this month that US officials are investigating the Wuhan Institute of Virology and trying to form a timeline of what the Chinese government knew and when.The news outlet had previously reported the virus started in the lab as part of China’s effort to show the country has the same capabilities of identying and combating viruses as the US.China then bizarrely hit back saying the US military planted it there.Beijing has been accused of not reacting quickly enough to contain the killer bug, which has killed more than , people globally.British politicians have also been highly critical of China, which led their ambassador to the UK to hit out.Liu Xiaoming said: Such talks are a political virus. If they go unchecked theyll poison UK-China relations and even international solidarity.In direct reference to Mr Trumps accusations, he added: They want to pass the buck over their lack of response, lack of efforts to contain the virus, to China.Theres a game of blaming, scapegoating.

This is where the ID virus can be used to screen patients during the pandemic.BioConcept developed the strip and the kit is similar to a lateral flow test, which most people will be familiar with in pregnancy tests.The Respi Strip uses antigen test samples from a swab and looks like a cotton bud that goes through the nostril and down the nasal passage.The test works by looking for proteins on the surface of the virus and the testing of the strips was partially based on the SARS outbreak. At present the strip cannot determine the dference between Covid- and SARS.BioConcept estimated that the test could reduce the amount of lab tests by  per cent and said current testing capabilities are limited due to the fact that trained medics need to carry them out.They said the strips should not be used as a definite answer but as part of a broader testing strategy.A major usefulness of the COVID- Ag Respi-Strip test would be in the low- and middle income countries, where molecular assays are available in very few laboratories, mainly only in capital cities. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But a Boris Johnson ally has warned that just baby steps will be announced by the Prime Minister and the public should expect some measures to continue for months. The Covid- lockdown was formally extended on Thursday for another three weeks following a review, and parts of it could be lted every two weeks. When the Prime Minister addresses the nation on Sunday night, he is expected to announce his roadmap for easing restrictions while still trying to prevent infections. But the lockdown is set to remain in place until at least June as outbreaks in care homes and hospitals have made large-scale changes before then too dangerous.to get the Mirror’s daily coronavirus briefing email at mirror email -after the press conference every evening. The lockdown is facing a major test from a long weekend of warm weather and concerns of mixed messaging ahead of Mr Johnsonaposs announcement, as Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales weigh whether and when to make changes of their own. The Prime Minister has been urged to reveal a timeline and identy specic dates when certain measures will be lted amid fears for the economy and businesses, although ministers have warned that only modest or limited moves are likely. The UK is past its peak and the number of confirmed cases and deaths trending down. However, it has the highest death toll in Europe - more than , - and the second highest in the world behind only the US. There are fears a second wave could eruptthe restrictions are eased too soon and Britons donapost follow social distancing rules. The Mirror reported this week that the Government has a five-stage exit strategy staggered over the next six months, and a -page blueprint has been drawn up to get the country back to normal. Here are the changes that are expected from Monday. Monday Mr Johnson is expected to set out a rough timetable for lting key restrictions such as reopening schools and shops, but will stress that tough milestones must be reached before that can happen. He is likely to announce that people will be allowed unlimited exercise from Monday, ending the once-a-day restriction that has been in place since the unprecedented lockdown came into effect on March . The blueprint called for employees to be encouraged toto workplaces that have stayed open during the lockdownsafe.  Guidance for adapting workplaces to make them safer could be introduced. The Government could also allow places of worship, including churches and mosques, to open for private prayer but not for gatherings of groups. It is possible that garden centres will be given the OK to partially reopen, at least, although this is said to be one of the most contentious issues within cabinet. There may be further guidance on the use of outdoor spaces including open-air markets, high streets and cemeteries. Walesapos First Minister Mark Drakeford said lockdown restrictions in the country would continue for a further three weeks, with three modest adjustments from Monday.  People will be allowed to exercise more than once a day but they must not travel to do so, with the exercise beginning and ending at home. The second change is to allow garden centres to reopenthey can observe social distancing rules. Local authorities will also be able to begin planning how to open libraries and municipal recycling centres. Mr Drakeford said on Friday: These very cautious changes will apply to everyone other than the , people in the shielding group. We continue to urge people who are over , or who have an underlying health condition, or who are pregnant, to continue to take extra care.  Confirming that the lockdown would be extended in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that the Scottish Government is looking into expanding the current guidance over exercise. Advice for Scots currently states that exercise should be limited to one hour per day. Ms Sturgeon said: The only change that weaposre considering in the immediate term is the guidance on outdoor exercise, as I mentioned yesterday and I will give you a further update on that over the weekend. The First Minister also said, on a call with the Prime Minister and leaders of the devolved administrations on Thursday, there was a helpful recognition that the four nations may move at dferent speeds, should the available data allow it. May   Rail services are set to increase to about % of the normal timetable later this month as part of the gradual easing of the lockdown, it is reported.\u2028 Sources told PA there will be a gradual increase from May . Rail unions have been involved in talks about the safety of workers and passengers when more trains run.\u2028 Some areas might see aof similar services to a Saturday. Rail bosses and Government sources told the BBC that services will be increased to about % of the normal timetable - from about % - to ensure the railways are able to cope with a rise in passengers as peopleto work. End of May start of June  The blueprint outlines a phasedof primary schools in England from the start of June, starting with Year . Families, shared homes and people living alone could be allowed to expand their household bubble and mix with others. End of June According to the five-stage plan, a phasedof secondary schools in England would begin before the summer holidays. Small team sports such as five-a-side football could be allowed, along with outdoor gatherings of fewer than  people. Cafes with outdoor seating could reopen while outdoor sports such as golf, tennis and fishing might resume. Premier League football matches could be played behind closed doors. End of August start of September Pubs, bars and restaurants could gradually reopen near the end of summer, although customers would be expected to follow strict social distancing rules. Greene King chief executive Nick Mackenzie has said beer gardens will most likely be the first areas to reopen in pubs due to social distancing rules. October This is when fans could be allowed to attend football matches again. Gyms could be allowed to reopen. But any further lting of restrictions to get back to normal le would be in doubt amid fears of a second wave of coronavirus or an outbreak of seasonal flu. New measures could be introduced It is possible that the Government could tighten existing restrictions, introduce new ones or reimpose certain measures to drive down infection rates.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said the stay-at-home order for . million of the most vulnerable people may have to be extended beyond  weeks. Tougher border controls could be introduced at some point during the lockdown. Quarantining foreign visitors on their arrival in the UK was a measure being looked at now that the domestic infection rate is decreasing, Downing Street has suggested. Mr Johnsonaposs spokesman said: This has been put to ministers in the past and they have said it is an issue we are looking at. Iaposve not got anything for you today and I wouldnapost want to pre-empt what we have to say in the future. I think ministers have said the issue of looking to ensure, as we really drive down transmission in the UK, that we are enable to ensure the virus is not being brought into the country from overseas is one they are actively considering. aposItaposs a bit of a shamblesapos The plans are due to be finalised over the weekend before Mr Johnson makes his televised address at pm on Sunday. Earlier this week, a Government source told the Mirror: “It’s a bit of a shambles. “Nobody can quite agree what to do and when to do it. Somebody comes up with a bright idea, but the practicalities get in the way. We’re not South Korea.”  Mr Johnson will keep Britain in lockdown until at least June after he was warned that it is too dangerous to make any signicant changes due to outbreaks in care homes and hospitals. He told his cabinet that he would proceed with “maximum caution” and modest changes before the end of May. A Government source told the Times: “It is baby steps taken slowly and only when it’s clear they can be taken. Plans to allow households to mix in a social bubble have slipped down the order of priorities because more work is needed, a source said, adding: “How do you enforce it  It could easily lead to a spike in transmissionit goes wrong. Restrictions could be eased every fortnight The Prime Minister could lt parts of the lockdown every two weeks under plans being discussed by ministers, thereported.  It said he is expected to give Britons a rough timetable for reopening schools and shops, but will describe tough milestones must be reached first. He is not currently planning to allow garden centres to fully reopen from Monday despite pressure from the industry, and bars, restaurants and indoor events are expected to be among the last things on the list. After each step, Mr Johnson will assess the impacts before risking further easing, as experts say it will take two weeks to produce reliable data. A Government source told the : “It means we could lt restrictions once a fortnight rather than reviewing the lockdown every three weeks, as is currently the case.

Shay was initially taken to Basildon Hospital on Saturday following the incident at around .pm. Caryn got a call from officers telling her what had happened and that she should go to Basildon Hospital where her son was.

Caryn had barely enough time to kiss her son on the head and tell him she loved him. Shay was then moved to Queen’s Hospital, Romford, on Sunday - and Caryn said she received an update to say he was stable.

The Sunday Mirror has launched a petition calling for health staff to be given a cash bonus to reward their efforts on the coronavirus frontline. Marisa Bappoo went from having a mild cough to gasping for breath in front of her shocked parents. She was rushed to hospital and ventilated, with Roshan, , and Anita, , spending the next  days not knowingtheir youngest child would survive. Marisa is just one of a few dozen children to have fallen seriously ill to the virus.  Roshan, a graphic designer, said: “We had all been suffering from the virus and were recovering but Marisa didn’t. She became very poorly. It was shocking to see her struggling to breathe which is when we called an ambulance. “They were going to start to bring her round when she woke up by herself on her th birthday. “We were just elated that our daughter came round to mark her birthday. It was the best birthday present to have in the circumstances.“With coronavirus there are guarantees of a happy ending. When you hear that half of people don’t make it out of ICU it sends a chill down your spine. You worryyour loved one will be one of the unlucky ones.”Southampton Children’s Hospital arranged a Facetime call so Roshan and Anita and older sister Reyana, , could speak to doctors and see Marisa. They were also able to email pictures of the family so staff could print them out and display them around her room in intensive care. Reward our healthcare heroes now for risking their lives to fight Covid-.

The two young princesses, Elizabeth and Margaret Rose, had known for some time that this moment was coming and that victory in Europe was assured. But, as they joined the King and Queen on the balcony of Buckingham Palace on VE Day in , the sheltered young royals were unprepared for the electric atmosphere and sense of release bubbling from the crowds. They were desperate to be part of it. A few hours later, Lilibet, , and her -year-old sister sneaked out of the palace with the blessing of their parents, who agreed “the poor darlings” deserved a little fun at last. Then, going almost unrecognised, they found themselves dancing with strangers, joining a rowdy conga and cheering up at their waving parents as they appeared again on the balcony. “I think it was one of the most memorable moments of my le,” the Queen would recall in a rare and candid TV interview in . “I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall, all of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief.” The Queen will share her memories in a VE Day th anniversary address at pm today – the same time her father spoke to the nation in .  Earlier in the day, Prince Charles will read extracts from his grandfather George VI’s diary. King George VI and Queen Elizabeth had steadfastly refused to leave London during the war, despite an extremely near miss when the Luftwaffe pulverised the Buckingham Palace Chapel in September . The princesses remained at Windsor Castle and their parents joined them a few days before, knowing victory was imminent. The King had been working on his victory address with voice coach Lionel Logue, who had helped him overcome his stammerOn Monday, May , the royals ed to Buckingham Palace as it was announced that Tuesday and Wednesday would be VE Day public holidays.  Huge crowds began descending on London overnight, awaiting Prime Minister Winston Churchill’s announcement the following afternoon. The King wrote in his diary: “The day we have been longing for has arrived at last and we can look back with thankfulness to God that our tribulation is over.” Loudspeakers and floodlights were being erected in The Mall and the palace balcony – newly strengthened after the bombings – was decorated with crimson and gold drapes. Princess Elizabeth, a mechanic and driver in the Auxiliary Territorial Service, dressed in her unorm while Princess Margaret wore a light-coloured jacket and skirt. Then, after a morning of tense anticipation, the royals listened to Mr Churchill’s pm speech from Downing Street.  They could hear the crowds going wild outside as Churchill ended with the words: “Advance Britannia! Long live the cause of freedom! God Save the King!” And then they made the first of many balcony appearances that day, including one with Churchill himself. Lionel Logue and his we, Myrtle, arrived at the palace to dine with the royals before Logue gave the King’s speech a final run-through. By now the princesses were pleading with their parents to be allowed to join the party. Finally, they agreed to let them leave in a group of , including some guards officers, the Queen’s cousin, the Hon Margaret Rhodes, and lady-in-waiting Jean Woodroffe. They were also joined by Lord “Porchy” Porchester, who later become the Queen’s racing manager, and Peter Townsend, the king’s equerry who sparked a national crisis a decade later when, though a orced man, he won Princess Margaret’s heart.  Speaking in , Margaret Rhodes revealed: “We crossed the forecourt at Buckingham Palace and got to the railings and there were these masses and masses of people. There was a general thing of, ‘We want the King and Queen!’ which we all frantically joined in with. “We were amazed when, five or  minutes later, the windows opened and they came out on to the balcony. “It was like a wonderful escape for the girls. I don’t think they’d ever been out among millions of people.” In  the Queen herself revealed: “We were terried of being recognised, so I pulled my unorm cap well down over my eyes. “But a Grenadier officer among our party... said he refused to be seen in the company of another officer improperly dressed – so I had to put my cap on normally.” The Queen was recognised by at least one eagle-eyed member of the crowd though – a teenage lad who stole a dance.  Ronald Thomas’s story only emerged in  when the partially fictionalised movie A Royal Night Out featured a similar incident Ronald, then , from Harrow, had travelled to London with a pal. In Trafalgar Square, he recognised Elizabeth. His grandson Thomas, , explained: “They danced together for a few minutes – just a merry dance. “She denied her identity at first but he was so sure, he said, ‘I’d recognise your face anywhere!’ “Eventually she admitted it but told him to keep it quiet. “He felt a strong sense of civic duty to the future monarch, which is why he didn’t expose her then, and why he has been very bashful about it since. “There were several big blokes with her, chaperoning, and after a few minutes they all moved on.

The country took to the streets to celebrate the end of years of fighting, bombings and death. Those who were there share their special memories of VE Day. Marion Parry, , of Aberdare, Wales Marion lived with her parents, Ethel and Ernest. Her dad joined up as a gunnery soldier with a Royal Artillery anti-aircraft regiment defending naval bases in Scotland, near the Orkney Islands. This family photo was taken when he ed to Wales, in June , to meet baby Marion. Marion, far right, honours May ,  in verse... A bonfire stands upon the hill for everyone to see, The daily news reads, “Peace at last! We’ve won the victory.” Flags are flying, people singing, children start to shout. But I am only four years old, I don’t know what it’s all about. Soldiers in their khaki suits, relief spread on their faces. Shake hands, join arms with “ GI Joes” of many dferent races. “We’re going home at last!” shouts Bill. “New York, here I come!” “Oh! What will we do now ” moans Dai. “Who’ll give us chewing gum ” My Mickey Mouse gas mask will finally be put away, In the hope that it may never again see the light of day. The air raid shelters will soon come down, As peace s to our small town. The village band plays a Glenn Miller tune to set feet tapping with a swing. And pit hooters sound throughout the hills, while church bells start to ring. A radio plays Vera Lynn, as she begins to croon, “There’ll be bluebirds over the white clfs of Dover,” That ever-popular tune. It’s time at last, the torch is lit and the bonfire starts to burn. Crackling wood and soaring flames light up each face in turn. A new tomorrow will soon dawn and war will fade away, But we must never forget the price that we all had to pay For freedom and the right to live in peace at last. However many years go by, we remember the past. Now,  years on, we’ll remember, and celebrate with tea. There’ll be plenty to eat and plenty to drink, more than enough for you and me. But we will still stop and wonder how we survived each day, Of rationing and coupon books and queues along the way. Yes, the time has long since passed but it seems no time ago, That I still remember VE Day, When I was only four.” Gillian Holding, , Sheffield I was nine and living on Firth Park Road on VE Day and we couldn’t have a street party as the road was too busy with trams, buses and tanks. The houses all had Union Flags outside. My family had a very tatty flag which had been used for the  celebration.  Opposite our house was a Chinese laundry and I remember the anticipation of seeing which flag they would hang out – it was the Union Jack! As there was no street party, my aunt gave us some money and coupons to help arrange a party on a green, open space nearby. We had sandwiches and cake but I was very upset that the younger children had jelly too – it would have been such a treat.My father went on the train to London and had an amazing time with everyone smiling, laughing anddancing.Pamela Broadhurst, , Dorset This is a photo taken on VE Day. I was five and my brother was eight but I still remember the day. In the evening there was a party in a marquee for the adults – but us kids stayed up anyway. All our friends and neighbours from Eric Avenue in Padgate, Warrington, were there. It was such a happy time, though growing up during the war meant I really didn’t know any other way of le. You’d hear the air raids and knew it was time to run home. It was just what we did. But the first time we could have sweets, it was amazing – the queues used to go round the block. There were few men there. My father had been in the Army from the beginning and was still away. I now live in Dorset with my husband Colin, , and we will soon celebrate our th wedding anniversary. Sheila Doughton, , Wolverhampton  I was aged six when the war started. On VE Day we had a big street party. One of the neighbours, Mr Emery, brought his piano out into the street and his we played it. All the surrounding streets had lorries driving round with the children on the back who were all dressed up. Each truck had a theme, ours was The Victory Queen. Claire, being the eldest of us, was the Victory Queen... we were all dressed in red, white and blue. The lorries were driven round the surrounding streets and through the hospital grounds. We children were so excited and we all really enjoyed the day.  We had a small shelter in our back garden at home and some nights we used it and other nights we stayed in the pantry under the stairs. Our ARP Warden, Mr Courtney, used to come down our entry during the air raids and shout at Mum through the pantry window: “Are you all all right, Mrs Bate ” In my mind I can still hear the German planes flying over us – the hum, hum, hum sound that they made. You could tell they were loaded. We used to hear the whistle bombs being dropped and us children would go out the next day to pick up the bits of shrapnel that had fallen. Thomas Spittle, , Gamesley, Derbyshire  Thomas was the first baby born in Manchester on VE Day – and his middle names, Victor and Edward, are a reminder of his special birthday. Here, he reveals what sharing such a famous date means to him... I am extremely proud of being born on VE Day. My mum, Margaret, told me she went into labour the day before, when everyone was preparing for a party outside the house. I was born one or two minutes after midnight on the day itself, I just made it! I weighed lb oz. I was so big the nurse said Hitler must have known I was coming! Mum held me in her arms as she watched the bonfires and the dancing in the streets with my older sisters.  We lived on Wendover Road, in Urmston, Greater Manchester. My parents had a five-bedroom house with a big cellar where they used to go when the sirens went.I remember bunk beds there when I was growing up. My dad Jack worked as an ambulance driver in Kent during the war but he made it back up for my birth.My mum and sisters said he’d bring up boxes of fruit for them. They used to share them around kids on our street. I now have six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren and I’ve talked to them about the meaning of my name. It’s important not to forget. VE Day meant a lot to a lot of people. The war should never have happened, it caused a lot of hardship all over the world but at least we won. Five years ago we had bunting and flags out, and all the family here to celebrate the th anniversary of VE Day as well as my birthday.This year I’ll be  but the celebrations will be more muted as we are facing a dferent battle today. Val Nuttall, , Stockport, Cheshire  My mother, Hannah Kathleen Davies, was in the Auxiliary Territorial Service as a PT instructor when war broke out. My father, Thomas George Beaumont, was a Lieutenant in an artillery regiment. They met when they were stationed together at a camp near Derby before he was posted abroad. I was born on VE Day. At the time, my mother was living with his family at the corner shop they owned. When Mum went into labour, Dad’s sister was sent to the phone box to ring for a taxi to take her to the nursing home where she was to give birth. My aunt had been looking forward to going to celebrate victory but spent the day and night running between the shop and phone box, checking the progress of the labour, relating it to Grandma. Luckily, she didn’t hold it against me that she missed out on the fun and became my godmother. The s and s brought challenges of growing up but I was lucky to be born when resilience and optimism were a huge part of the national character. This is a photo of myself and my parents, in about June . Dad’s still in unorm, my mother looks gorgeous... and I was too young to spoil it! Joy Lennick, , who now lives in Alicante, Spain  Joy wrote a memoir called My Gentle War about being an evacuee. The eldest of three kids, her dad was in the RAF. She recalls: “When peace was finally declared, Dad was still serving, Mum was working as a welder and we children were evacuated to our third place. I had another brother, named Royce, as Dad was stationed nearer to home. “We were overjoyed to be reunited as a whole family, while mourning the loss of Dad’s youngest brother Bernard.  “I can recall the feeling of euphoria which swept the country when the war ended. “Our parents took us on the train to London. There were bonfires, like beacons of hope, blazing in back gardens and flags waving everywhere.We watched, entranced, a huge firework display from Westminster Bridge, and giggled as sailors climbed lampposts and kissed as many girls as they could catch! “Goodness knows what time we arrived home, tired but so happy.” Joyce Hughes, , Hale, Liverpool  During the war I lived in a terraced house in Vale Road, Woolton, with my parents Teresa and Jack Langley, and six brothers and sisters. Dad and Mum worked in a components factory. I remember sirens and air raids. We used to go to a family with a shelter or to one in Gladstone Street. We were only children, so it seemed like a big adventure. We were still going to school but had to carry little gas masks with us. Once, in  when I was , we came out and a bomb had dropped on the next street. It only demolished one house but when we went back to ours, Dad went to put the key in the front door and it just fell backwards into the house.The windows had gone. There was soot everywhere but our little dog lived through it. On the day the war ended there was a big bonfire at the bottom of the road, someone had pushed a piano out and everyone was singing and dancing. A few days later we had a street party in the afternoon. I have no idea where the food came from but there was plenty to go around. Rex Wellard, , Chigwell, Essex  Rex was evacuated to three dferent places in six years and has written a book called Don’t Forget Your Gasmask about his experiences. He says: “I had been home with my family for about five weeks when at daybreak one Monday, we were woken up by a cacophony of noise coming from the river.The boats moored on the Thames were sounding their steam horns and many gave hoots emulating the Vin Morse code. ‘That’s it!’ my dad said. ‘The war’s over.’ “My friend and I caught a train to London and squeezed down The Mall to join thousands in front of Buckingham Palace.The crowd were chanting for the Royal Family, who came on to the balcony with Churchill. The loud cheering and flag-waving was years of tension being released. “In Shaftesbury Avenue, an American Forces club had its windows open wide and a gramophone blared out music. Soldiers leaned out calling to girls as a long conga line snaked about. “They threw fire-crackers down, too. A middle-aged couple got a shock when one went down the man’s sweater and exploded, blowing a hole in it. He was unharmed but his we was most annoyed.” Bill Bennett, , of Kidderminster  He joined the Merchant Navy at  but was seconded to the Royal Navy. He worked on Plutoto allow petrol to be pumped from the UK to France and was mentioned in Dispatches for his bravery for helping a wounded colleague. There were a lot of shells and e-bombers and I wasn’t allowed to carry a gun as I was from the Merchant Navy. But I was too busy getting on with the job to be scared. I just remember tremendous noise, as well as hundreds of planes, and the smell of cordite. We sailed back to Folkestone on May  but got back into the harbour late so stayed aboard the ship. Next morning as I went on deck, there was a buzz of excitement. A group of men on the quay were talking and looking at a paper. I shouted “What’s happening ” They said the war was over in Europe and the Germans had surrendered. Looking around you could see people shouting and talking to one another and the excitement and buzz was unbelievable. After five years of tension, there was such relief for all. The next two days were spent celebrating on land. We felt a great lt. But our war was far from over.Bill, a Royal British Legion member, was involved in the Japanese campaigns and was finally demobbed in November .Don Sheppard, , Royal Engineers and stDivision  My ision was involved in the last big battle on May , , in Bremervorde, north-west Germany – known as the final surrender.As the attack was progressing, many of the enemy surrendered to our troops, which was the beginningof the final capitulation of all of Germany’s armed forces on VE Day. My thoughts at the time, after surviving five years of war, was relief that nobody was shooting at us any more. I’m sure the German soldiers felt the same.  Then, of course, I celebrated the event with a tipple or two. But I found myself thinking, what a futile way of le, killing one another.There was a sadness of all those comrades who would never be going home, like I was longing to do. The casualty figures from my ision alone from D-Day to VE Day was , killed, wounded and missing. Let us remember with thanksgiving and honour all those who gave their lives in the pursuit of freedom. Sergeant Fred Foster, who died in  aged , by his son Steve Foster, , author of The Soldier Who Came Back  Dad joined the Army in May  and saw action in Norway in .Over five days of fighting in deep snow in the village of Tretten, the British were subjected to continuous mortar and machine-gun fire which they had no answer to. Armed only with rles, they were eventually overrun as tanks passed through them.Hand-to-hand fighting took place in order to hold the village but it was finally taken when most of the brigade were killed, wounded or captured. Fred was imprisoned in Stalag XXA, Thorn, Poland, where in , he and a friend undertook an escape to the Swiss border. At the border they were recaptured, harshly interrogated and eventually ed to the camp. From there, Fred was moved to Stalag  in Hohenfels, Baia, where he was finally liberated by American forces on May , . However, there were , allied PoWs released in Germany in May  and most would not get home by VE Day. The pure logistics of feeding, clothing and transporting them was a huge challenge. Documents show that Fred was given a day pass from his camp on May , so he was effectively still a prisoner but held by British authorities and he did not get home until May . He and his friends, who had spent more than five years as prisoners, were still in PoW camps in Germany on VE day and not out on the streets in their home towns celebrating. This is perhaps a little-known fact. Walter Taylor, , of Waterlooville, Hants, served as a private with the Tank Corps from . A D-Day veteran, he was awarded the Legion d’Honneur in   He says: “I volunteered at  because I hated my job in a Lancashire shoe factory. On D-Day we landed on Gold Beach and I saw some terrible sights. That night one of our drivers was sleeping under his tank when the Luftwaffe hit it. “He was the first of our casualties but not the last. I lost some great colleagues as we made our way through Europe, including Geordie, who looked after me like a second father. “We pushed on to the Rhine and I started to get the feeling we might be getting to the end – youthful optimism, perhaps. “Then, in May , we were in a wood near Luneburg Heath in Germany. There were lots of vehicles moving around – and I now know that was because the Germans were surrendering. At about midday on the th, our Sergeant Major came out and said: ‘That’s it, it’s all over.’  “We were told it was VE Day and were very pleased, obviously. But we didn’t have any booze to celebrate with so I just had a cup of tea. One of my mates was fed up and made a sign saying ‘VE Day and NO BEER’ and hung it on a tank. “So I’ve promised myself I am going to have a bottle of beer on Friday to mark this th anniversary. I’m going to toast all the lads who never came home.“ Walter was demobbed in , ing to join the police force. He married Vera and the couple had three children. He adds: “Before the coronavirus lockdown I was meant to be coming to London to lay a wreath on the Cenotaph. “But I’m hoping I’ll be able to do that on Remembrance Sunday in November instead.” Barbara Hurman, , from Aylesbury, Bucks, joined the Army at  and became a teleprinter operator in the Royal Corps of Signals  Following D-Day I volunteered to go abroad and joined the Central Mediterranean Forces. I was in southern Italy when news of the end of the war came but I never had a chance to celebrate. My unit was in transit, waiting to be posted to our next billet, so we weren’t allowed out. It was only afterwards I realised I had spent VE Day confined to barracks! As a member of the Royal British Legion, I was looking forward to taking part in the VE Day events in London this year. But now I will be celebrating at home as I didn’t get the opportunity to all those years ago. You don’t tend to hear so much about the work that women did to help win the Second World War. Women played a valuable role – at home and abroad – and that should be acknowledged more. Bernard Morgan, , from Crewe, Cheshire, was a codebreaker who found out about the German surrender via a telex two days earlier than most. He still has the original message  I landed on Gold Beach at .pm on D-Day – the youngest RAF sergeant to land in Normandy.I can still vividly remember seeing dead bodies scattered all over the beach as I came ashore, and that is a sight that will stay with me for ever. By May, , I was stationed in Schneverdingen in Germany – where I got advance warning that VE Day was coming. I got a telex to let me know that the war was ending and that the German surrender was imminent. I still feel very privileged.  I remember VE Day very well, the drinks just appeared from nowhere and we lit a bonfire, and had a massive party. It’s so important that we make the most of these opportunities to remember what happened – not just to celebrate the achievement but also to ensure that such horrors never happen again. Secret agent Odette Hallowes, by her granddaughters Sophie Parker and Nicole Miller-Hard Our French-born grandmother Odette was recruited by the British Government to join the Special Operations Executive and work undercover in occupied countries. After training, she joined SOE agent Peter Churchill in France but, in April , they were both betrayed, captured, and imprisoned. Odette was brutally tortured for information about her fellow agents but refused to say anything, saving their lives and enabling them to carry on their vital work.During her confinement in the notorious Ravensbruck bunker she did all she could to try to keep her mind and body active and retain her dignity. In the spring of , as the Allies were closing in, Odette, emaciated and extremely ill, was taken from Ravensbruck by the prison commandant, who had been instrumental in the extermination of , women.They went in his own car and she was told, ominously, that it would not be necessary to bring her things. She was sure her end had come and he would drag her into the woods and shoot her.  But it was not to be. On May , just days from the German surrender, the prison commandant handed her over to the American military base and her relief must have been immeasurable. We are sure that arriving home in England after two years of incarceration and knowing she was at last going to be reunited with her daughters must have been monumental for Odette. The sight of London’s streets hung with the glorious flags of military victory, and the joyous sounds of the VE celebrations would have affirmed that her hopes and dreams had finally become a reality. Odette was awarded the George Cross, an MBE and the Legion D’Honneur. Alec Borrie, , Slade Green, Kent  I was the youngest member of the st SAS and was with them for two years during the war. On VE Day I was in a transit camp in Chesterfield and the news came at about midday. I can sum up VE Day in two words: Getting drunk.  We went to a pub and I spent quite some time trying to strike up a conversation with another man from st SAS, until I realised I was actually looking at myself in a large mirror. Eileen Storey, , Norfolk  Every time I hear the lovely Vera Lynn sing The White Clfs of Dover, I am transported back to the day when I joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service at the age of . I became a very proud gunner.  We were positioned on the white clfs of Dover at the time when the V and V rockets, doodlebugs, were beginning to attack. Most of the crews were young girls. I still have lovely memories of friendships formed during the war. John Stuart Chapman, by daughter Jan Stewart, , London  My father was an Able Seaman in the Royal Navy and turned  on VE Day. His ship sailed into Plymouth harbour as the church bells were ringing out for the end of the war. But to him, it felt like everyone could have been celebrating his st. Dad, who had done some bell ringing, found a nearby church and rang a peal of bells himself. Dad, who was only  when he was called up, operated depth charges on destroyers. He didn’t really talk about the horrors he must have seen but he told us two stories. He thought he had been blinded when a depth charge exploded near him – but found he could see when his eyelashes, which had been stuck together, were trimmed. And one night in the Atlantic, a huge wave washed him overboard, but the next wave washed him back on, which he said was a miracle. Dad, who worked for BT after the war, died at  in . Lillian Cox and Doris Hobday , of Tipton, West Mids, are the oldest identical twins in the UK  The end of the war was announced on the radio, which our parents rented because we had hardly any money. At first we were so relieved but everyone was worried in case it started again or another war broke out. We lived in the Black Country, and worked in a factory. Even during the war we went to work each day, carrying our gas masks and ID cards. Everything was rationed.We had coupons for food, clothes, furniture. Times were hard but we got through it. When we came home from work we would hear the sirens and had to go straight to the shelter in our garden.  We used to sit there frightened while we heard the loud planes overhead. Our father was a firefighter looking after the streets to make sure everyone was safe. Doris had recently got married and her husband, Ray, was called up – he was a private in the Army and away for two years and eight months. When he went away he had a full head of hair. He came back bald and it never grew back. Towards the end of the war, a bomb went off just behind where we lived. It shook all the houses. Our mam was shouting: “Arrrrh, my bloody mantle is broken!” But we later learned that bomb killed three children and a doctor. When we heard the war had finally ended we were able to relax a little and start living our lives. Joyce Masters, by her daughter Marion Trathen, , from Cornwall  My mother wrote her story down before she died in , aged . She joined the land army in , aged , and was sent from London to Cornwall.On VE Day, she was cutting cabbages to be sent on the train at midday, when the housekeeper called: “The war is over!”Needless to say, the cabbages were thrown into the air and they had a cabbage fight. They danced and sang “the cabbages never saw the railway truck”. Marie Scott, , New Malden, Surrey I was in Fort Southwick on D-Day and transmitted messages to and from the beaches. I went to London for VE Day with my friend Betty, aiming to walk down the Mall to Buckingham Palace. But most of London was determined to do the same thing. We met a human tide and were hugged and kissed by soldiers, sailors and airmen! People were delirious with joy. Marie is supported by The Taxi Charity for Military Veterans, taxicharity.orgEdith Pleasance, , from Wymondham, Norfolk, was on a delayed honeymoon For most of the war I worked in a factory making aircraft parts. One day a voice announced “Mrs Pleasance, please report to the main gate”. A friend was waiting for me with a telegram. My husband Jim had been captured by the Germans  months earlier at Anzio and incarcerated in a Stalag in Eastern Germany, so I was pretty certain he would have been on the much-publicised Death March.  I tore open the envelope and didn’t know whether to laugh or cry as I read: “ARRIVED SAFELY. SEE YOU SOON. JIM.” Jim and I had married on his first leave in  but we had no honeymoon. So after he arrived home – at am on April ,  – we decided to go to Plymouth. We were there on VE Day when we heard Churchill on the tannoy. Then it was announced that celebrations for all would be organised on Plymouth Hoe. The party was like six New Year’s Eves rolled into one. Si Liberman was a -year-old US airman stationed at Attlebridge airfield, near Norwich  The explosion of joy had not yet erupted. But there, in the heart of London, darkness was strangely absent on one city street.A stream of light illuminated almost an entire city block. Some happy soul had raised a blackout shade.And for the first time in nearly six years, it was done without fear of inviting an air raid warden’s citation or German bombs. That marvellous lighted scene, foretelling the end of Europe’s deadliest period, has stayed with me all these years. The date was May , . I was  then and a B- bomber radio gunner on a three-day pass from my air base outside Norwich, a five-hour train ride away.On an Underground train en route to Piccadilly Circus, I kind of got the picture after spotting a newspaper headline. “Unconditional Surrender Imminent,” it screamed. By pm the next day, it was official.  Standing on the War Ministry balcony above Whitehall at that hour, a beaming Winston Churchill flashed his usual V sign. This time, though, his V for victory was no symbolic promise. Hostilities with Nazi Germany were over. “This is your victory,” he told a huge crowd that had gathered. Cheers grew into one helluva party. People poured into the streets, shouting, dancing, embracing. They mounted double-decker buses and utility poles, waved flags, started bonfires and danced the hokey pokey around a statue of Queen Victoria. Sirens blared, car horns honked and church bells pealed. I found myself drawn to Buckingham Palace. A roar from the crowd and wild applause greeted the appearance of people on the balcony.  From where I stood among a mass of humanity, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, their princess daughters, Elizabeth and Margaret, and Prime Minister Churchill were a distant blur. That night floodlights illuminated Buckingham Palace and the Houses of Parliament for the first time since the Battle of Britain began in . And Big Ben’s toll, signalling the official end of the war in Europe, was greeted by exploding fireworks and screaming sirens. The celebration went on for two days.

The monarch recorded an interview for the BBC Radio  programme The Way We Were for the th anniversary on May , . As a -year-old princess, she joined thousands of other revellers after slipping into the crowds to dance and sing outside Buckingham Palace unnoticed with her -year-old sister Princess Margaret. In the archive audio on the royal familyaposs social media channels, the Queen can be heard recounting how, as a -year-old, she joined thousands of other revellers after slipping into the crowds outside Buckingham Palace unnoticed with her -year-old sister Princess Margaret. I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall, all of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief. We cheered the king and queen on the balcony and then walked miles through the streets, the Queen said. I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall, all of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief. It was an unprecedented and spontaneous breach of royal protocol when the princesses hurried out of the palace after dinner to join the crowds, accompanied by a group of Guards officers, who were friends of the princesses. My sister and I realised we couldnapost see what the crowds were enjoying. My mother had put her tiara on for the occasion, so we asked my parentswe could go out and see for ourselves. I remember we were terried of being recognised, the monarch said. She revealed how they cheated to make sure their parents appeared on the balcony to their shouts of We want the King. We were successful in seeing my parents on the balcony, having cheated slightly because we sent a message into the house to say we were waiting outside, the Queen said. I think it was one of the most memorable nights of my le.  Under the cover of darkness, the royal teenagers went unrecognised in the throng. They sang in jubilation, did the hokey cokey and the Lambeth Walk, and also danced the conga through the Ritz hotel in nearby Piccadilly. An -year-old Princess Elizabeth had joined the Auxiliary Territorial Serviceand registered as No.  Second Subaltern Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor and took a driving and vehicle maintenance course at Aldershot, qualying as a driver. She was in unorm on the day and told how she pulled her cap well down over my eyes to stop herself being recognised. But she added she was reprimanded by a fellow officer. A Grenadier officer amongst our party of about  people said he refused to be seen in the company of another officer improperly dressed, so I had to put my cap on normally, she said. The Queen poignantly told how one of her party - a cousin - believed to be John Elphinstone - had just ed from years as a prisoner of war. I remember the amazement of my cousin just back from four-and-a-half years in a prisoner of war camp, walking freely with his family in the friendly throng, she said.

Lauren McLean, , was flying back from a Tenere to Birmingham when an hour into the flight she felt like she needed to push. An announcement asking for help was answered by a complete stranger - midwe Angela Chamberlain who was also ing home from her holiday. She became Laurenaposs saviour, helping her avoid giving birth until the flight was erted to Faro in Portugal and she would have access to a hospital, reports Birmingham Live.As Lauren lay on the floor of the plane, Angela took her weight as the craft landed to avoid adding to her discomfort. Little Oscar Jacob Wall was born only a few minutes later, weighing lb oz. But Lauren wants to warn other mums-to-be of the need for full insurance and the dangers of flying - even when, as in her case, they were medically cleared to do so.to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at www.mirror email Lauren, from Marston Green in the Midlands, said Angela, a midwe at Walsall Manor Hospital, was her saviour. It was like a Hollywood movie, Angela said.I had to pin Lauren to the floor while trying to straddle her. An air hostess was looking out of the window so she could tell me the the exact moment we would land so we would brace ourselves and I could take the weight on my hands on the floor. You can watch Lauren talking about her experience on the above video and Angela is in a video further below. Both Angela and Lauren are big fans of BBCaposs Le and Birth series, which was recorded in Birmingham. The fourth episode at pm on Tuesday May  will feature posthumous footage of Birmingham Womenaposs Hospital and Childrenaposs Hospital neonatologist Dr Vishna Rasiah whose death from coronavirus was announced on April .  How the drama unfolded Trying hard not to give birth at , feet was the last thing administrator Lauren expected when she boarded aflight from Tenere to head back to Birmingham. Within five minutes of the jet landing in Portugal, she was in an emergency ambulance. And ten minutes later Oscar was born. The boy had only been in the country for  minutes but now qualies for a Portuguese passport. Proud dad Jake is hoping itaposs a sign Oscar could be the next Ronaldo. But because Oscar had to spend the first six weeks of his le in Faro Hospital on the Algarve, Lauren said she had a more serious agenda.  The holiday plan Laurenaposs end-of-winter holiday had been booked as a Christmas present when nobody had heard of Covid-. The dates were from February  to March . Having had medical clearance first - and knowing a friend had once flown back from Australia  weeks into her pregnancy - sheaposd never considered herself to be at risk from four-hour flights to and from the Canaries. But, having taken mother Adie on holiday to Tenere with sister Jordan and their respective partners, Lauren later began to feel unwell. A doctor in Tenere thought she had a urine infection and prescribed antibiotics. With ten weeks left before her due date, Lauren was looking forward to flying home and being back in her own bed. Angela was on the same flight home with husband Russ - having booked a late winter break for the two of them at short notice. She had never met Lauren before.  The need for tests As the end of her own holiday drew near, Lauren began to realise something wasnapost quite right. Iaposd had no contractions and no waters breaking, she recalled. I just had bad pains in my lower back, hips and thighs on Wednesday. We saw a doctor before our flight who confirmed a water infection and said we would be safe to fly on Thursday. I just wanted to get home and check it out there. The flight back Once on board, Lauren said she needed to start going to the loo regularly. An hour after take off I turned to my mum and said: aposI need to push!apos You just donapost realise how much pressure there is inside a plane. Ryanair staff put out a call for anyone with medical training and Laurenaposs sister Jordan overheard some passengers thinking there was a Covid- patient on board. There was a midwe on the flight and Lauren was adamant she saved her sonaposs le. I owe everything to Angela, she said. She was our saviour. Angela could feel the babyaposs head and said I was fully dilated. Angela told me I would not be having this child on the plane I needed to wait until the hospital, with him being ten weeks early. I was having no pain relief but Angela taught me how to breathe through the contractions.  Trying not to give birth Angela - who knows some of the midwives featuring in the hit BBC series Le and Birth filmed last summer at three city hospitals - didnapost respond to the medical call at first as she thought she might not be qualied. But when it became apparent there was no doctor on board, Angela told cabin crew she was a midwe and met Lauren in the toilet at the front of the plane. With all of the other passengers looking in their direction, Angela moved Lauren to the back of the plane and two doors were opened from the rear loos to provide a degree of screening privacy. She encouraged Lauren to lie down to try to tilt her pelvis backwards so gravity might help to keep the baby in. Lauren was then able to put one leg up on a chair normally used by cabin crew while mother Adie held her other leg up. Meanwhile, the plane was being erted to Faro. I was so trying not to give birth, said Lauren. The next half-hour was a blur of me breathing my le away and screaming that I needed to push, while breaking Jake and mumaposs hands. The midweaposs view Angela had to think counter-intuitively to try to stop Lauren from giving birth. I knew thatthe baby was born in the air at  weeks that would dangerous for the baby and possibly Lauren, too, she said. With no oxygen and not being able guarantee keeping him warm, he might not have been able to breathe on his own for long. I encouraged Lauren not to push. A mother-of-three, including two stepsons and a -year-old boy of her own, Angela has been a qualied midwe since  after previously managing a care home. Because she had booked a short-notice flight with Russ for an end-of-winter break alone in Tenere, the couple werenapost even sitting next to each other when Laurenaposs drama began. Russ didnapost even know what was happening, said Angela.  Lauren was experiencing a lot of pain and pressure and where she was sitting there was a danger the baby could have been born down the toilet. I had to spend a few minutes to get my working head on and decided to take her to the back of the plane where I asked her to lie down so I could examine her with all of the passengers facing away from us. The labour was well-established and I could see babyaposs head. But the only mask available would have been bigger than the babyaposs head and, had Lauren given birth, the only thing I might have been able to do would have been mouth-to-mouth. The stewardesses were outstanding and had two fleeces ready in case he was born. At this stage there were still three-and-a-half-hours of the flight left so they contacted the captain who found somewhere to make an emergency landing. I did the best I could do at the time and, on reflection, I donapost think I would have done anything dferently. But I do thinkLauren had had a full medical examination before leaving for the airport she would probably have been told not to fly.  The bumpy landing Having been holding Laurenaposs hands, Jake - a bricklayer - and mum Adie were told to sit down and put seat belts on. The plane made a safe, emergency landing at Faro - but at great risk to Lauren, baby and Angela since they could not be strapped in. Angela says: The plane wasnapost full because of the coronavirus, and everybody  was moved forwards so there were not as many people at the back. A stewardess told us when we were going to land. It wasnapost the best landing - I was kind of straddling Lauren and I put my hands on the floor to take the impact. Looking back, Lauren said: Within five minutes I was in an ambulance and ten minutes after that Oscar Jacob Wall arrived into our world at .pm. As soon as I got in the hospital they said I could push - and Oscar arrived after just three pushes! The journey home Being born in a foreign hospital on March  wasnapost the end of Oscaraposs debut drama. Given that he only weighed lb oz, medics wanted mum to recover and to see him grow before allowing them to fly home to Birmingham. But within days of his birth, the whole of Europe was going into Covid- lockdown. Spain and Portugal went into lockdown on March  and  respectively - before Britain followed suit on March . Even after six weeks of consistently putting on weight, doctors didnapost want Oscar to fly home with members of the public because of the Covid- risk. During Oscaraposs stay in neo-natal care in Faro Hospital, only one parent a day was allowed to visit him between am and pm due to Covid-. That was the hardest of times for us, but the nurses were incredible, said Lauren. Thankfully, Lauren was fully covered for her holiday. An air ambulance was then arranged through her travel insurance for Lauren, Jake and Oscar to fly back to Birmingham with a nurse, doctor and two pilots - leaving Adie to make her own way home via flights to Lisbon and then Stansted. Once back at Birmingham Airport on Wednesday, April , Lauren and Oscar had a five-minute ambulance ride tohome to Marston Green.

Parts of the country are set to hit C this afternoon, hotter than top tourist destinations including Monaco and Corfu. And Saturday could just shade it by reaching C and matching the highs felt on April  in Cornwall - the hottest day of , Met Office forecaster Greg Dewhurst told the .  However, stormy showers across East Anglia, southern England, south Midlands and Wales over both days could hamper the mood slightly.Regardless of the heat, many beaches and open spaces are likely to be largely empty as people stay at home due to the coronavirus lockdown.The south-east will be the warmest area today and could see C in London while Scotland will reach highs of C.  Northern Ireland will see the mercury rising to C, and northern England and Wales could each see peaks of C. Met Office forecaster Oli Claydo said: It will be a bright and warm day for most on Friday. “There will be some early morning fog in the Midlands and west of England, and scattered showers in Scotland, but that should clear by mid-morning. By the afternoon it is likely to be clear and pleasant for all, and could be pretty hot for most. “But this will start to change on Saturday as a cold front will move from Scotland, bringing scattered showers in parts. The temperature could drop as much as C by Sunday as Arctic air sweeps in from the north of the UK to bring rain and colder temperatures, with possible wintry showers in northern Scotland. Mr Claydon added: There is expected to be a drastic drop in temperature on Sunday, falling as low as C in London, and there could even be a chance of snow in hilly areas of Scotland, but it is unlikely to set.

The war ended in two phases the European conflict concluding in May , before the Japanese surrender three months later ended hostilities entirely. Thousands of people famously gathered outside Buckingham Palace, as Brits up and down the country celebrated the news of the Nazi’s collapse and unconditional surrender. Next weekaposs celebrations to commemorate  years since the end of war in Europe will be understandably muted, because of the lockdown in response to the coronavirus pandemic. However, a planned change to the May Day bank holiday remains, so there will be a three-day weekend on the th anniversary of the end of World War Two in Europe. When is VE Day Since  the end of World War Two in Europe has been marked by Victory in Europe Day, better known as VE Day. It falls on May  every year, and  marks  years since the Allied victory of the Nazis. Adolf Hitler committed suicide in Berlin on April , leaving his replacements to see out the end of the war. The unconditional surrender was signed in the early hours of May  , with hostilities in Europe officially ending at one minute after midnight on May . However, celebrations across the UK took place throughout May . This year May  is on a Friday, and the traditional May Day bank holiday - normally the first Monday of the month - has been moved to VE Day . What will happen on VE Day  The bank holiday change was announced last year when a full weekend of celebrations were being put together. Originally flypasts, a procession down the Mall and a plan to turn St James’ Park into Victory Park - giving an idea of what le was like during World War Two - were being arranged.

Of course, people were going to get killed but the aim was to keep the numbers to the barest minimum with a strategy known as “steel not flesh”. Britain aimed to use its vast global reach, technology, science, and ­mechanisation in an effort to limit the number of men at the coal face of war. This meant creating huge air fleets, incredible material support for ­frontline troops and developing new means of communication. Never was there to be a greater period of scientic and technological invention. Even after the fall of France and the realisation that Britain now needed to create a much bigger army, it was agreed it should be  isions in size and no more – compared with the hundreds of the Germans and Soviet Union, for example. Unlike Germany, considerable manpower was to be kept in the ­factories rather than stripping them out for the front – so much so that until the autumn of , the priority for manpower in Britain was not any of the armed services, but rather, the Ministry of Aircraft Production. Only the US would produce more aircraft in the war. Britain went on to build a staggering , by . Having seen off the invasion threat in , Britain’s prime focus was to hurriedly rebuild the Army and to secure the Atlantic. The battle across this huge ocean was rightly identied as the most important theatre of the entire conflict because, for an island nation like Britain, almost everything reached its shores through these waters, whether from the US or from India or Australia. Fortunately, the Germans had pointlessly focussed on building a surface fleet before the war, even though it could never hope to rival those of the leading maritime powers, rather than building a sizeable U-boat force. By January , only six U-boats were operating in the Atlantic and the high tonnage of ships being sunk had fallen. During the invasion scare the previous summer and autumn, convoys had been crossing the Atlantic largely without protection but now convoys of merchant ships were once again being increasingly heavily escorted by destroyers and other anti-submarine warships. The Royal Canadian navy was also rapidly growing – and manned entirely by volunteers as were all its armed services. It was a contribution that rarely gets the credit it deserves. Prioritising scientic research and development also helped win this battle. One of the key inventions was the cavity magnetron, developed in , which allowed for greater detection of smaller objects by much smaller radar antennae. Instead of having huge ft high masts, radar could now be placed on to an aircraft or ship. It was a game-changing invention and one neither the Germans nor the Japanese ever knew we had developed. At the same time, further developments were being made in improving high frequency-direction finding – known as ‘huff-duff’ – as well as developments in the global tracking of shipping and anti-submarine weaponry. In March , two of Germany’s most successful U-boat commanders, Günther Prien and Joachim Schepke, were killed and, a third, Otto Kretschmer, was captured. Because the U-boat Arm was so small, these were big losses. Then, in May, an Enigma signal coding machine was captured with its codebooks and one of Germany’s two largest battleships, the Bismarck, was sunk, forcing the Kriegsmarine’s surface fleet to skulk back to port where it largely stayed for the rest of the war. Britain still had a long way to go before the U-boat threat was destroyed but by May , it had reached a point where it was no longer going to lose the Battle of the Atlantic. That was no small achievement and by early , with aircraft now ­operating with the cavity magnetron aboard from Iceland, northern Canada and Northern Ireland, the U-boats had been pushed further into the middle of the Atlantic, which took them longer to reach and made them less effective. It was true some convoys were still being hammered, but more than % were getting through unscathed. Meanwhile, Britain’s growing army was, with the help of Commonwealth forces from Australia, India, New Zealand, South Africa and Rhodesia, fighting German and Italian forces in the Mediterranean and Middle East. Italy had declared war on June , , and its forces invaded Egypt in September that year. In December, the small ,-strong Western Desert Force had counter-attacked and smashed two Italian armies – some , Italians had been captured by February . The British had also attacked Italian-held Abyssinia in East Africa and had pretty much won the day there by May . Germany had struck up an alliance with Italy so that the latter would expand and protect the southern flank of the Reich, but Mussolini’s forces were insufficiently trained and equipped for modern warfare. Smashed by the British, they were also given a bloody nose by the Greeks when they invaded there in October . Hitler felt he had no choice but to intervene. General Erwin Rommel was sent to North Africa with two and then a third ision while German forces also swept into the Balkans and then Greece. Honouring an earlier offer to the Greeks, Britain erted troops from North Africa across the Mediterranean but had neither the air support nor heavy equipment needed to see off the Germans. Most were evacuated from Greece in late April. It was a defeat for both Greece and Britain – as was Crete that followed – but it wasn’t all bad news and these losses need to be seen in their wider context. Crete cost the Germans terribly in terms of half their highly trained paratroopers and most of their transport aircraft – resources they would desperately need in the mammoth clash of arms in the Soviet Union, to be launched a month on in June , . A month later, Britain secured Syria, and rebellions in Iraq and Iran were put down. Later in the year, Rommel’s German-Italian forces in Libya were pushed back again. The Middle East, though important, was not a major oil-producer at the time and its supplies fuelled the British war effort there and in North Africa and no more.  Rather, the leading oil producers in the world – by a country mile – were the US and Venezuela, out of reach for the enemy and the right side of the world for Britain. Fuel was rationed at home but we still used four times as much domestically per year as Germany did in entirety. The biggest setback for Britain was Japan’s entry into the war and the losses of Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaya and Burma. Britain was simply under-prepared in the Far East – its hands were rather full in the west. On the other hand, Japan was unable to reach the jewel in the crown, India, while during the retreat Britain set alight the Burmese oil wells and denied their use to the Japanese.

A few months earlier, in June , the British had been smashed near Tobruk and sent packing. It was the lowest point of British generalship in the entire war: a needless defeat caused by bad command decisions and faulty tactics. That the Eighth Army avoided annihilation was largely due to the Desert Air Force, who had developed exciting new tactics for close air support – tactics that would be further honed by the end of the war. General Harold Alexander, Britain’s most experienced commander, and Montgomery were brought in, steadied the ship, then struck back, and this time decisively, sending Rommel’s forces speeding back across Egypt, Libya and into Tunisia. Meanwhile, a joint Anglo-US force landed in pro-Axis French Algeria and Morocco and moved in a pincer movement from the west. By this time, Britain had worked out its way of war, which was to use immense firepower, brought about by a marriage of air, land and sea power. It had realised that German troops always counter-attacked. The moment they did, the Allies would emerge from their foxholes and camouflaged positions and the full weight of their firepower would then rain down upon the Germans – immense artillery, low-level bombers and fighter aircraft, and,close enough, off-shore naval guns too. It meant using a stick to goad them in the first place, which was why being a British infantryman or part of a tank crew was so incredibly dangerous, but it did mean these troops were comparatively few in number. Only around % of the Army were infantry and % were in tanks. Some %, on the other hand, were service troops, maintaining and supplying those at the coal face with food, ammunition, new tanks, trucks, spare parts and medical supplies and so on. Tunisia fell in May , the same month U-boats were largely withdrawn from the Atlantic, which meant the British and Americans could plan operations more effectively as they knew pretty much exactly what supplies were likely to reach them whether in the Mediterranean or in Britain, where preparations had begun for the cross-Channel invasion of France in . In the meantime, British and American troops launched the largest-ever amphibious operation – in terms of numbers of men landed – against Sicily on July , . This was a phenomenally dficult operation logistically, but in a sign of growing confidence, air, land and naval forces worked together to conquer the island in  days, hastening the overthrow of Mussolini. The Allies then invaded southern Italy whilst also building up for Operation Overlord, the invasion of Normandy, which took place on June , , two days after Rome fell. Despite the Americanisation of D-Day, largely thanks to Hollywood, D-Day itself was a predominantly British show. All three service chiefs were British,  of the , warships were British, , of the , landing craft were British, two thirds of the aircraft were British and two thirds of the troops landed were British and Canadian. It is true that American industrial muscle was truly exceptional and yes, the United States did, in many ways, become the Arsenal of Democracy. It was, however, British cash that kick-started this process in  and  and lend-lease ­actually cut both ways: some % of all US supplies in the European Theatre of Operations were provided by us. The Liberty ship, the prefabricated ,-ton merchant vessels churned out by US shipyards, was designed by a Brit, Cyril Thompson, and the initial shipyards on the east and west coasts of the States built with British money. D-Day was, of course, a success, and British forces continued to play a key part in the war in Italy and north-west Europe until the end of the war. Air power remained key to British strategy, and while initially, bombing was inaccurate and underwhelming, by March , when Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris launched his all-out bombing offensive, Britain had pioneered new navigational aids such as Gee, Oboe, and the first ground-mapping radar, HS, and bombing accuracy improved enormously. The levels of destruction by the RAF’s night bombers were incredible, but regardless of the debates about the morality, it unquestionably had a profoundly detrimental effect on Germany’s ability to wage war. It also saved British lives. The Lancaster bomber and Mosquito were also two incredible designs that played big roles in the air war. What’s more, by the middle of , RAF Bomber Command was able to strike – with unequalled accuracy – not least  Squadron, who earlier on May  and  carried out the successful raid against the German dams. Britain’s approach to war never stood still. In the Far East, the demands were even greater. There were few places in the world more challenging in which to fight. Disease was re, infrastructure almost nonexistent, and the first attempts to re-invade Burma in late  and early  met with failure. Then came monsoon season and a pause for a reappraisal of approach. Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten became Supreme Allied Commander of South East Asia and appointed General Bill Slim as his Army commander. Slim reorganised his supply chains, created new forward units for treating malaria – a disease that struck  men for every one battle casualty – gave every single man jungle combat training, and insisted the RAF win air superiority, which they swtly did with the arrival of superior Spitfires in the autumn of . He dramatically improved morale and his men first withstood a Japanese attack at the Admin Box in the Arakan in north-west Burma in February , then fought a fighting retreat to Imphal in north-east India, before counter-attacking at Kohima and destroying the Japanese Fteenth Army. Part of Slim’s success was his continued harnessing of air power. By commanding the skies, the RAF was able to transport two isions to Imphal as well as make numerous supply drops. Slim pushed the Japanese back into Burma and in spring , he brilliantly caught them out at Meiktila. Mandalay and Rangoon fell soon after and Burma was once again back in British hands. Britain had formed the Pacic Fleet in August  and helped the Americans in the Pacic, not least at Okinawa, in April and May . British scientists also played a vital role in the development of the atom bomb. At home, meanwhile, another agricultural revolution had been going on. In , Britain had produced only % of its own food, but by , that figure was %. This enabled shipping that before the war had been used for food to carry arms and war material instead. Rationing was nothing like as bad as where on the continent. The main purpose was to ensure everyone got a fair and balanced diet. This in turn meant they were fitter and healthier and productivity increased as a result. Britain deserves to feel very proud of the contribution it made in the Second World War and its “steel not flesh” policy. Some , people were killed in the war, and although that is a huge number, it was roughly half that of the First World War – and over nearly six years of a truly global conflict, not four.

It celebrates the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany to the Allied forces and the end of World War Two in Europe.Millions of Brits celebrated the news on May  . Prime Minister Winston Churchill led the way with a radio broadcast, a speech to crowds gathered in London and an appearance on the Buckingham Palace balcony alongside the Royal Family. To mark the th anniversary, the traditional May Day bank holiday on the first Monday of the month has been moved to Friday May  for - what was supposed to be three days of celebrations. The end of WW in Europe By April  the Nazi regime was crumbling, with Allied and Soviet forces overrunning Germany from the west and east respectively. Nazi leader Adolf Hitler knew the end was close, and had heard what had happened to Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. Mussolini had been captured by Italian partisans on April . Three days later he was shot and his body hung upside down. The Fuhrer was eager to avoid a similar fate, and on April  killed his dog, his new we Eva Braun and himself in his Berlin bunker. German soldiers started to surrender first in Berlin, then in other parts of Germany and Europe. At .am on May , Nazi high command sent to Reims in France signed the unconditional surrender of German forces.  At first General Alfred Jodl, representing Nazi high command, wanted to surrender to Allied forces on the Western Front. However the Supreme Allied Commander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, refused and insisted that the Nazis on the Eastern Front must surrender to the Soviet Union, otherwise heaposd end negotiations. The Nazis agreed, and the total surrender was to come into effect the following day, May . VE Day celebrations Celebrations erupted once news reached Britain. It’s estimated that more than a million people celebrated on streets across the UK. Some of the largest crowds gathered in London, with people filling the roads from Trafalgar Square and Whitehall, up The Mall and to Buckingham Palace. In a rousing speech, Churchill told the amassed crowd: “God bless you all. This is your victory! It is the victory of the cause of freedom in every land. In all our long history we have never seen a greater day than this. Everyone, man or woman, has done their best. Everyone has tried. “My dear friends, this is your hour. This is not victory of a party or of any class. Itaposs a victory of the great British nation as a whole. The Prime Minister also appeared on the Buckingham Palace balcony alongside King George VI and Queen Elizabethas well as Princesses Elizabethand Margaret. The young princesses were also allowed to slip out of the palace and join the cheering crowds.  US President Harry Truman celebrated his st birthday on VE Day, and dedicated the victory to his predecessor, Franklin D. Roosevelt. He had died of a cerebral hemorrhage less than a month before VE Day on April . Russia celebrates the end of World War Two in Europe on May . Despite the euphoria, both Churchill and Truman were keen to stress that the war was still going.

The flat in Sydney even offers two weeks rent free as an extra incentive, leaving you with a bit of spare cash to make it your own. So far, so good.One striking feature, which has escaped the attention of absolutely no one, is that the shower and toilet are located in the kitchen, leading to an open plan living area and bedroom. Although there has been an attempt at creating bathroom walls, the designer opted to go with glass to really open up the space. So not only will you be able to keep an eye on the cooking as you do your business, your guests will also be able to keep an eye on you, too.Itaposs listed with Exclusive Real Estate’s Emma Mattiuzzo, who told Realestate.au : There are a lot of properties on the market at the moment, so this all about creating a point of dference in a crowded field. There are lot of people who have come through and loved it because it is dferent to what you usually see. The studio suits a single person and because there is not much space, you’re not going to be hosting dinner parties, so it won’t be a problem for many.”Photos of the flat were shared on Twitter by Joan Westenberg, who said: Sydney real-estate is a literal toilet in your literal kitchen going for  a week.When one replied to ask: What happensyou have someone over , Joan replied to say: You immediately break the ice.  Another commented: How is that even legal  I could have sworn we have building codes that protect against this   A third played out the hypothetical situation of inviting guests round, writing: aposBefore you come over I’d advise that you use the toiletapos. aposWhy, what’s wrong with yours apos aposYou’ll see.apos” "},{"url":null,"title":"simple diy boozy ice lolly","story":"NewsSimple DIY boozy ice lolly recipes - from a GT to a Tequila SunriseEasy to follow alcoholic ice lolly recipes which are perfect for any sunny dayShareCommentsByPaige HollandShowbiz Audience Writer:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsAll of the recipes come from Jassy Davis With alcohol anything is popsicle book \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The compound called liquiritin was found to have prevented the rapid replication of the virus strain in monkey cells, according to reports. In China, liquiritin is commonly used in traditional medicine and found in herbal liquorice tablets, although many scientists remain unconvinced of its benefits, local media reports. Liquorice extract is usually used for gastrointestinal and respiratory problems as well as a sweetener in food or drink.to get the Mirror’s daily coronavirus briefing email at mirror email -after the press conference every evening. The extract from liquorice, a flowering plant native to Asia, has proved effective in trials, according to a local media report. The Beijing research team has been using articial intelligenceto carry out its tests and speed up the process. The study has not yet been peer-reviewed. The research is being carried out by medical experts from Peking University and the Academy of Military Science. The team said in a statement: “We recommend liquiritin as a competitive candidate for treating Covid-.” Since the pandemic started, many patients have been treated with known antiviral drugs, but none have proved sufficiently effective against the new strain of coronavirus, which emerged in the city of Wuhan late last year.The new study said that it can also work as an antioxidant as well as having antidepressant, anti-inflammatory and therapeutic effects on heart disease patients. AI technology found that liquiritin signicantly inhibited the replication of the new virus strain in a cell line derived from a monkey, according to reports. The compound was also tested on mice for one week and the combined results “did not show toxicity or side effects in two independent experiments”.

Hopefully, when the time#s right and everybody is safe, we need to make sure we are ready to go.”Dundee have been heavily linked with afor striker Simon Murray, who is a free agent after leaving South African side Bidvest Wits last month, while a permanent move for St Johnstone midfielder Ross Callachan could also be on the cards.His loan spell at Dens was ended prematurely with a broken leg but impressed in his short time there and is out of contract in the summer.McPake has also never hidden his desire to see Hearts forward Craig Wighton back with the Dark Blues.The current concern for teams like Dundee in the lower isions, however, is how next campaign might look.The SPFL have begun a league reconstruction task force led by Hearts chair Ann Budge and Hamilton chief Les Gray to revamp the setup for the new campaign.Dens Park managing director John Nelms is part of the -strong reconstruction group but McPake admits he’ll be happy with whatever future is decided, as long as it benefits the game as a whole.He added: “My preferred option is that we just find a way to get something that works.“Look, we need to make sure everything is safe first.“Do I have a preferred option  I would love to be in the Premiership but we had a chance to do that ourselves this season and we failed.“If we had won the league, it would have been a given.“Butreconstruction happens, whatever way, I just hope they do it so that it suits the game going forward.“Would our input as managers help  But do we then ask players as well “It is a tough one. Do I want to be involved  No, I am happy to leave it to the powers-that-be and just concentrate on my job getting our squad ready so that when we do get the green light to go ahead we can do that.“I just want football back, I think society wants football back andreconstruction comes in then great.“But there are people out there risking their lives to save lives so they are the real important ones.” months free access to our web and ePaper pack including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53674242-242x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53674242-499x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53674242-757x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53674242-242x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"subscriber special this commemorative tele supplement marks 75 years since ve day articleisfree","story":"Today, May , sees the country commemorate the th anniversary of VE Day and The Tele is bringing you special coverage to mark this historic event.We have produced a special -page supplement looking back  years to when Germany surrendered after five years of bloody war.The supplement, available to Tele subscribers only, includes:And that’s not all – on Saturday we will also publish a special replica edition from the Tele on VE Day itself, available to our subscribers only.This special edition is a must-read as it captures the historic moment as it happened with reporting direct from the scene as the country took in the news of the victory that would bring the conflict to an end. months free access to our web and ePaper pack including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-woman-discovered-first-human-coronavirus","story":" June Almeida, who discovered the first human coronavirus, was the daughter of a bus driver from Glasgow.

ldquodferent speeds when releasing the lockdown as long as ldquothere is evidence that supports the decision.Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden looked to temper public expectations for the PMrsquos pm announcement on Sunday, stating ldquolimited moves will be made to ease the restrictions currently in place to stem the transmission of coronavirus.PA understands that scientists believe the Government will not be able to lt lockdown measures yet as doing so could risk a second deadly wave of the disease, should people try toto living their lives as before the restrictions were

change being considered ldquoin the immediate term is on allowing longer than one hour of outdoor exercise a day.Similarly Arlene Foster, her counterpart in Northern Ireland, told BBC Breakfast there

transport services can be increased as measures are eased.The Prime Ministerrsquos official spokesman also suggested quarantining foreign visitors on their arrival in the UK is a measure being ldquolooked at now the domestic infection rate was decreasing.The No  spokesman added: ldquoI think ministers have said the issue of looking to ensure, as we really drive down transmission in the UK,

to the Hoops in .Although members of the Red Army who weren#t even born by  will have likely seen Theo Snelders# shoot-out save from Anton Rogan before Brian Irvine fired himself and the   squad # bossed by Alex Smith and Jocky Scott # into the history books, there will be some who don#t know the full story of the Dons# run in the competition that year.The League Cup-winning Dons started their Scottish Cup quest away to eventual First Division mid-tablers Partick in what would turn out to be goal bonanza.There was no Willie Miller, Theo Snelders, Hans Gillhaus or David Robertson due to injury, while midfield maestro Jim Bett was suspended, meaning the likes of Michael Watt, Ian Robertson and Willem van der Ark all started.Callum Campbell scored for the Jags after two minutes, after the ball squirmed under Watt, before big Dutchman Van der Ark levelled from Alex McLeish#s low cross.In what was an underwhelming start to a thrilling cup campaign, centre-back Irvine # Miller#s heir apparent # then chopped down Campbell to give away a penalty, and Chic Charnley put the home side back in front.However, an angled finish from Brian Grant before the break made it - and seemed to extinguish any Thistle fire.In the second half, Van der Ark lashed home another, Jim Kerr headed Paul Mason#s cross into his own net, before Skol Cup hero Mason made it - # despite being brought down in the build-up to his lofted finish # and Van der Ark completed his hat-trick with a perfectly-placed low effort from the edge of the area.Smith and Scott#s charges got off to a shocking start at rain-soaked Pittodrie in this one, gting the First Division strugglersan opener from a free-kick hoofed from half-way which Tommy Turner turned past Bobby Mimms.Both sides hit the woodwork chasing the second goal of the game, with Charlie Nicholas also seeing a one-on-one effort saved.The Dons must have been given a rollicking in the Pittodrie dressing room at half-time, though. Hans Gillhaus headed the equaliser from Mason#s cross soon after the break, and # after a few close calls # Nicholas eventually smashed home from close range after the ball was poked through to him by Bobby Connor. Phew.Long-time skipper Willie Miller was again missing for this last-eight clash, during what was a frustrating season for the great one, and didn#t play again in Aberdeen#s Scottish Cup run. He had suffered a knee injury on Scotland duty against Norway in November , which would ultimately end his career.Still, the Dons # in what would become a procession to the final # made light work of the Jambos.Midfield dynamo Jim Bett scored the opener, cutting in off the left and sending an early shot past Henry Smith. The Reds were in charge, but John Colquhoun would later equalise after a stramash at a corner.After the break Aberdeen ran away with it, Stewart McKimmie, Nicholas and Gillhaus combining for their second, before final hero Irvine lashed home to make it -.The fourth saw Gillhaus nutmeg Walter Kidd out wide, before repaying the favour with a cutback for Nicholas to finish.Smith and Scott surprised everyone by including full-back David Robertson in their line-up for the last-four meeting at Tynecastle. He#d been out for months with a serious foot injury.Keeper Snelders also ed from a knee complaint. These s and sense of things coming together were perhaps, in hindsight, a sign Aberdeen#s glory day at Hampden was meant to be.In what turned out to be a rout, final hero Irvine opened the scoring when he turned home Nicholas# cross from close range after Alan Main had saved his first effort.Just before half-time, future Don Mixu Paatelainen headed a high ball into the Tangerines# area past his own goalkeeper to make it -.The Reds# third was another nightmare for United, when Freddy van der Hoorn # under  a little bit of pressure from Mason # comically hoofed the ball over Main from the edge of the area.There was no fortune about the goal to make it -, however, Dutch wizard Gillhaus taking down a long ball on the left of the box and thumping it low beyond the United goalie. Aberdeen were in the final at a canter.The part of story even the Dons fans who weren#t around to see it know.After a goalless  minutes, there was no other way to settle the Hampden showpiece other than penalty kicks. Dariusz Wdowczyk missed the Hoops# opener, before Grant failed to score with penalty number four for the Dons.Aberdeen#s Nicholas # set to join Celtic after the summer # was notably successful with his effort to level things at - and send the shoot-out to sudden death.On the unbearable tension of the moment from that point onwards, captain and penalty-taker number six McLeish told the Evening Express in January: “God, aye.the penalty, the penalty I had to take.“It wasn’t the winning penalty, but it was a pretty important one. It was number six.“Celtic had taken five, we had taken five and one player from each team had missed.“I rememberJocky Scott saying ‘who’s taking the next one ’ and I said ‘I’ll take it’.“He asked ‘are you confident you’re going to score ’ and I said ‘not really, but I don’t see anyone  volunteering’.“So I took the long walk up, decided to stick to my favourite position, hitting to the goalkeeper’s left as hard and accurate as I could. If I did that I knew he wouldn’t save it.“I scored. But I didn’t jump up and celebrate. I walked back thinking ‘thank … goodness’.”Eventually, Rogan#s penalty was saved by Snelders, before Irvine blasted the winner to secure the trophy.McLeish added: “By the time we got to - and Brian won it, the goalies were ing the wrong way and people were mis-kicking it and it was going in.“We thought it was never going to end.“Then Theo Snelders, as he said at his hall of fame induction, said he knew it was coming close to him taking one, so knew he had to save one – that was Anton Rogan.“It was a great, great save. Theo timed it really well.” months free access to our web and ePaper pack including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe join our communities in applauding the people at the sharp end of the coronavirus outbreak.In this time of crisis, we have nothing but admiration for frontline health, care and other local authority staff # and even management # who are having to deal with the virus close-up.Let#s not forget everyone  working on for the benefit of our society, from shop workers to lorry drivers and the emergency services # and many more besides.

A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A few weeks ago I launched an appeal on social media aimed at supporting nurses and medics at the Mid Argyll Hospital during this terrible COVID- pandemic.I was initially trying to find outthere was anyone locally who might be interested in dusting down their sewing machine to make a few sets of protective ‘scrubs’ to donate to the hospital. Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

But I have lost my job and can’t afford to feed my kids right now.’ You could tell that he was absolutely mortied and so humble. So many people have lost their jobs.“We have told pensioners not to answer their door when we deliver, but one old lady insisted. We told her she shouldn’t be doing that, but she replied: I just want to say thank you’.“The older generation are so apologetic when asking for help, they all say: I’m sorry to bother you’.”Christian charity Via Wings is offering food deliveries and befriending to anyone who is self-isolating, elderly, vulnerable, an NHS employee, key workers, or those financially impacted by Covid-.Volunteers observe social distancing guidelines and food is carefully wiped down before being packed. Food and toiletry donations can be made at Eurospar, Supervalu and Vivo in Dromore and Tescosand Lidl in Banbridge.Via Wings works with local schools and churches, social workers, care workers and other agencies.“Working in unity is what our grandparents used to do, and that is what we need to get back to doing, caring for each other,” Gail added.“There is no ownership, we are just working together.”CASE STUDYNEIL MUSGROVEPicture# NEIL MUSGROVE SUBMITTED BY LEEDS CARESAN ULTRA-MARATHON runner is putting his best foot forward after several running events planned for this year had to be cancelled or postponed.Last year Neil Musgrove ran seven ultra-marathons and with none looking likely for this year he is running one in his back garden.He is doing a mile a day in his back garden according to his running watch and is hoping to reach his goal of the  mile starting distance for an ultra marathon by the end of April.For every mile completed, Neil is donating £ to Leeds Cares and hopes that friends and family will join in with the challenge at their own homes and donate after every mile completed.He said: “With no ultra-marathons to run I thought I’ll run one of my own. Any experience I’ve had with Leeds Hospitals in the past has been positive, I want to support all of our amazing NHS staff who are currently under huge pressure and working in extremely tough circumstances.“It is quite a few laps. All being well this takes me to a  mile ultra marathon distance. Yes it might get a little tedious but I am thinking of it as an ultra with a checkpoint, food and drink at every mile.“My young niece and nephew have already got involved and I’m hoping to get my own kids involved too. I’m sharing the challenge with my colleagues and running club team-mates so hopefully lots of us will get involved. Make it as interesting as you like. I am thinking about obstacles, singing, dancing, whatever. I would love itpeople joined in. The only rules are it has to be a minimum of one mile. It has to be fully within your own property boundary. If you don’t have a garden, special dispensation is given to use your street but remember the two metre rule.”All funds raised through Neil’s challenge will go towards Leeds Cares’ Support Your NHS Hospitals Appeal and provide vital support to frontline staff at Leeds Teaching Hospitals.This includes, paying for care packages, assistance with travel and accommodation where needed, as well as helping to fund other health and wellbeing initiatives to boost morale across the wards.

Since then, the number of volunteers has hit  although extra help remains welcome.Government guidelines mean the volunteers can leave their homes to help a vulnerable person and, with almost every volunteer already assigned to an inidual, more support is likely to be needed in the weeks ahead.The idea has been well received by those who live in the Stenhousemuir and Larbert areas and beyond, so much so organisers opted to branch out and ease the strain on mums and dads by collecting and distributing school lunches purchased by Larbert High School to youngsters stuck at home.Pupils from Larbert High and its cluster primaries are benefitting from the move.On just one day last month, volunteers delivered more than  meals to schoolchildren.Stenny chairman Iain McMenemy, who helped to organise the initiative, said: “We put out a few requests for further volunteers and the response to each has been really encouraging.“We’re doing one-to-one tasks for people like dog walking and shopping and we’re putting in calls to make sure they’re okay.“The advice was clear:you’re going out for your own shopping,you have to go to work,you’re going out for one bit of exercise oryou’re helping a vulnerable person you’re able to go out, particularly because some people have got nobody .“We have even had members of family from farther afield saying they have a relative in the area and they want to give you a call.“We’re still looking for volunteers as we’re only in week three and the smart money is probably on this being extended for three months. We’ve also expanded out to do school meal deliveries for a number of the schools. Carron Bathrooms got in touch and offered two vans so we now have three. On top of that, we’re doing deliveries for Falkirk Foodbank.”Though Stenny officials admitted concerns over the impact COVID- would have on the club itself, their focus has always been on the “health and well-being” of the community.When the community help initiative was first announced, Mr McMenemy wrote in a statement: “With the continuing spread of the coronavirus, Scottish football faces an uncertain future.“It is quite clear that there will be a signicant impact on football operations and finances and Stenhousemuir Football Club will no doubt be affected by this.“However, there are other, more important matters to think about. The coronavirus is a very serious disease that will affect thousands within our communities.“The health and well-being of friends, neighbours and members of our community should be our top priority.”CASE STUDYHARRY RAGLESSSTAR MAN: Steve in his dramatic outfit.A BOY with spina bida and his father are both doing their bit for the community # but in completely dferent ways.Harry Ragless usually spends  per cent of his time in a wheelchair due to his condition, which means his spine did not form properly in the womb and he has neurological damage to his legs and back and cannot feel his feet.But inspired by the efforts of -year-old war veteran Captain Tom Moore, which have seen him raise around £million for the NHS, Harry decided to raise money by walking with his frame and leg supports.The determined six-year-old from Oaksheath Gardens in Durrington, near Worthing, has raised £, and rising within days of his parents launching a fundraising page for his efforts # smashing his £ target.He said: “I feel really good. I was shocked.”His proud mother Selina Ragless said: “He has shocked us all. Because of his condition he tires easily but the other day he walked from our house to Vancouver Road, which is really far for him. We couldn’t believe it.”As word of his exploits spread, Selina said people were coming out of their homes to applaud Harry, who attends West Park School in Marlborough Road, Goring, when he went out for a walk.She said: “I feel overwhelmed to be honest. We owe the NHS so much they have been there for him since he was born and will be there for him for the rest of his le. If we can give something back, that is all we want.”In fact, Harry’s exploits grabbed the attention of Captain Tom himself # and his picture was featured on the Second World War veteran’s Instagram page.Harry is not the only person in his family who is raising a smile in the community.By day, his dad Steve is a warehouse manager # but during his daily walk, he dons his Stars Wars outfit to bring a bit of fun to the neighbourhood. The -year-old said: “I love it. From my own experience, I remember the first Comic-Con I went to in Birmingham and I saw all these stormtroopers standing outside, and I went into full fanboy mode.”The opportunity for him to get his own suit arose when a friend was selling theirs.He said: “When I finally put it on, I just felt amazing in it. I love seeing the looks and smiles, and people tooting their car horns and waving. It brings a few smiles in these very strange times.”Selina came up with the idea for him to wear it after they were put in lockdown, and during their walks around the estate Steve has posed for ‘socially-distant’ photos with some of the children who have come out to see him.In his spare time, Steve has donned the costume to a iety of events, including birthday parties, weddings and charity events.When the Connaught Cinema has done showings of Star Wars films, Steve has turned up in his gear to raise money for Sussex Association for Spina Bida and Hydrocephalus, a charity which has helped Harry.When askedthere was anything he wanted to say to the people who have donated so far to his campaign, Harry said: “Thank you.”To donate, visit justgiving. com fundraising selina-ragless.Nominate a community heroDo YOU know a volunteer who deserves to be recognised for making a change in their community The Prime Minister recognises one person a day with a Point of Light award.Read more or nominate someone at www.pointsoflight.gov.uk "},{"url":null,"title":"sad ending for ardfern","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsPuffer enthusiast and reader David Wright, who grew up in Bellanoch and now lives in Largs, sent in this photograph of the #Ardfern# puffer taken in the early s.Ardfern sank entering the canal locks at Crinan.

outbreak.It is estimated that the public is collectively owed about pound billion from travel firms.Forced instead to turn to their banks for help, many customers have now been told they are not eligible for a refund.Heres what you need to know.Why arenrsquot travel firms giving refunds Consumer watchdog Which  recently revealed that  of the UKrsquos largest airlines and travel firms are illegally withholding refunds which should be paid to customers within  days.Instead, most customers have been offered vouchers or credit notes, with many complaining that they have been unable to claim a refund online, or get through to customer services on the phone to ask for their money back.Should I ask my bank for a refund Customers who have been refused a refund by travel firms and paid for their trip using a credit card can claim the money back from their provider under Section  of the Consumer Rights Act.Credit card providers are jointly liable with the retailer or trader for any breach of contract for misrepresentation, providing the value is more than pound and less than pound,.However, Which  has warned that some credit card customers have been told by their provider that theyre not eligible for a refund through the scheme.Others have been informed that their claim wonrsquot be processed until they have tried to claim the cash from the travel firm first, even though this is not a legal requirement.Customers are also able to claim through a process known as chargeback, which allows a transaction to be reversedyou are unable to resolve a dispute, including services not delivered.This covers all card payments and is a process agreed between financial institutions and the relevant card scheme, such as Mastercard and Visa.What are Mastercard and Visarsquos chargeback rights Mastercard said there is a chargeback right where firms have cancelled goods or services, even where this is due to government restrictions, insolvency or other exceptional circumstances.It is also validthe cardholder doesnrsquot wish to accept the firmrsquos offer to rebook or claim a voucher, but the issue should first be attempted to be resolved with the firm.Visarsquos guidance also states that firms should process a refund promptlycustomers decline a credit note or voucher, and cardholders do have a right to complain when goods or services are not provided.However, Visa does make an exception where firms have failed to provide a service due to a government-imposed travel ban, stating that this ldquosupersedes Visa rules on dispute rights.For this reason, Mastercard customers are likely to be more successful when making chargeback claims for coronavirus-related cancellations.If flights are cancelled due to closed borders, customers will still have a dispute right under both Mastercard and Visa, as EU-wide rules around refunds override the government travel ban, according to Which .Which banks will refund under Section  and chargeback Banks have said that they will assess each case inidually when it comes to refunds from firms only offering credit notes or rebooking a cancelled trip.This is what the major banks told Which  about issuing refunds:Where a provider has not met their legal obligations to the customer, Barclays will consider both chargeback and Section  claims, provided the relevant criteria are met.HSBC, including First Directand MS Bank, will allow a chargeback or Section  claim to be made for goods or services not received, but customers are encouraged to contact their airline first.Lloyds Group, including Halaxand Bank of Scotlandsay thata refund is not offered by the travel firm and a customer has proof of this, the bank can pursue a disputed transaction claim under scheme rules.Bankrsquos position is that every chargeback and dispute is dferent, and each claim will need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis with the customer to work out the best solution.Nationwidealso says each case will be looked at on a case-by-case basis because it depends on the type of good services being purchased and what the terms of the agreement are with the merchant.Similarly, RBS, including Natwestand Ulster Bank, said cases would be considered on an inidual basis.If a claim made with the merchant in the first instance is not satisfactory, customers can contact Santanderto raise a claim.,params: .pushWhere the merchant has offered the chance to rebook for free and or provide vouchers and the customer is not satisfied with this then Starling Banksays it would initiate a chargeback.If a merchant is not offering a refund, or are asking customers to contact their card issuers to process a refund, Tesco Bankcustomers can raise a dispute.The Co-operative Banksays thatcustomers tried to resolve the issue with the merchant first but there was no refund or resolution, the bank would look at each case inidually to verya dispute chargeback right existed. If a chargeback right existed but the cardholder accepted a credit voucher, this would not affect the cardholderrsquos original dispute rights. The bank would also not reject a Section  claim outright in these circumstances.If customers are offered a voucher or a chance to rebook, TSBwould typically accept the claims and each case will be considered inidually.If the customer is unhappy with the solution offered by the merchant, Virgin Moneywould consider the terms and conditions. If the alternative arrangements are not covered, a chargeback would normally be successful.

Scotland, only alterations to exercise guidance are expected, while those in Northern Ireland have been told there will be only ldquonuanced changes to the clampdown on movement.Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford expects only modest changes across the UK The announcements come around  hours before Boris Johnson is due to declare the result of the UK Governmentrsquos review into what rule changes should be brought in for England.The Prime Minister has promised to exercise ldquomaximum caution when tinkering with the restrictions but paved the way this week for the devolved nations to move at ldquodferent speeds when releasing the lockdown as long as ldquothere is evidence that supports the decision.Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden looked to temper public expectations for the PMrsquos pm

being advised to shield themselves from public interactions, including those aged over , should continue to do so, he added.Mr Drakeford, giving a briefing in Cardf, said: ldquoI donrsquot believe

The residential units are shown to be laid out in such a way that adheres to the normally accepted privacy and amenity criteria on overlooking and overshadowing, whilst affording the future occupants of the residential units an appropriate level of privacy and residential amenity.Access to the new development would come from Fall Avenue and James Kirk Way.A design and access statement included within the planning application notes meetings had taken place with ious local authority departments in a bid to address ious design requirements.It concludes: ldquoOverall, it is considered that the final design creates a well-considered, proportionate design that responds to the site constraints and the nearby area to create a positive design solution.ldquoThe result is a development that will make a positive contribution socially, economically and aesthetically to the area and enhance the amenity of existing and future residents within this area.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council stressed they ldquowelcomed comments from community councils.She said: ldquoIn this case, we consulted the community council back in December, and they submitted a response detailing a number of concerns.ldquoThese included concerns over house type and layout, increased vehicle movement and parking space provision.ldquoWhilst we understand that consultees may be frustrated when planning authorities do not always agree with their comments, we must balance these comments against the other material considerations of each case.ldquoIn the case of the Hallhill application, our conclusion was that, subject to the imposition of conditions, the proposed development was acceptable.Thank you for reading this story.

A report is expected by mid-May.Pub chain Wetherspoonrsquos has said it plans to reopen its bars and hotels in June and said that due to it having larger than average pubs social distancing measures could be applied.RetailMinisters are thought to be considering allowing some non-essential businesses to open, such as garden centres and car showrooms, provided social-distancing could be maintained.Lobby group the British Retail Consortium has produced guidelines on how stores could prepare for the easing of restrictions.The guidance draws on lessons learned from supermarkets in recent weeks to ensure the re-opening of non-essential firms can be done safely.Advice coverslimiting entry and exit points, using floor markings to outline social distancing and keeping changing rooms closed.The guidance also suggests installing cleaning stations with hand sanitiser and disinfectant wipes at the front of stores.SportIt is understood Culture Secretary Olive Dowden has been working on a plan for major sports to be played behind closed doors when some social-distancing rules are eased.Weekly meetings are to be held between the Government, Public Health England and medical officials from sports bodies, with the issue due to be on the table when ministers review current measures next month.Key questions that need to be tackled include testing requirements, burdens on emergency services and the possible impact on fan behaviour ndash such as impromptu gatherings outside grounds.Sporting bodies are understood to be keen to resume full training safely as soon as possible.TravelLast week, low-cost European carrier Wizz Air announced plans to resume some flights from Luton Airport on May .Cabin crew will be required to wear masks and gloves on all flights and will distribute sanitising wipes for passengers, while new distancing measures will also be introduced during boarding.Mr Raab has indicated that officials are looking at possible checks at air and sea ports, with passengers arriving in the UK required to quarantine for  days.Meanwhile, the Rail, Maritime and Transportunion warned there was ldquozero chance of ramping up transport services soon, amid speculation of an increase on May  or May  when a new rail timetable is due.Last week, industry sources said no dates have yet been agreed or announced."},{"url":null,"title":"community-resilience-can-turn-help","story":"From collecting shopping and vital prescriptions to dog walking and simply being there for people, the volunteers are there for residents throughout the coronavirus crisis.Here, we look at five of the groups who are giving up their own time to help out.Cockenzie and Port SetonTHE resilience effort in Cockenzie and Port Seton has been helping launch a Fair Share hub at the Port Seton Centre this past week.The charity Fair Share delivers surplus food from supermarkets to the centre every Friday.The hub will cover the whole of East Lothian and support the centrersquos existing work to provide hot meals and food packs to families in need and children who would usually receive free school meals.Bryan Hickman, chairman of the local community council, which is leading the resilience effort, said: ldquoWe are still delivering food to those who need it but the Fair Share hub has been set up.ldquoWe receive food like coffee, cereal, milk and biscuits but this could change every week.ldquoItrsquos really good news that we have set this up as it will help us give other types of food.

this week for the devolved nations to move at ldquodferent speeds when releasing the lockdown as long as ldquothere is evidence that supports the decision.Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden looked to temper public expectations for the PMrsquos pm announcement on Sunday, stating ldquolimited moves will be made to ease the restrictions currently in place to stem the transmission of coronavirus.PA

before the restrictions were introduced.Official data suggests more than , people have died with coronavirus in the UK since the pandemic broke.On Friday, NHS England said a six-week-old baby with

talks have commenced to see how transport services can be increased as measures are eased.The Prime Ministerrsquos official spokesman also suggested quarantining foreign visitors on their arrival in

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music. Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site. It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio. It plays a leading role in the promotion of the Gaelic arts and culture and also offers an international exchange programme with universities in Canada and Ireland.The collegersquos graduates include Seumas Greumach , Chief Executive of An Comunn Gaidhealach, which runs the Royal National Mod, who studied the Cugraversa Comais in  and then ed for another year to study Cagravenan is Cultar na Gagraveidhlig. He went to Sabhal Mograver to improve his language skills and says he would not hold his present job had he not become a fluent speaker.ldquoI was fully immersed in the language at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, which is essential to become fluent in any language. he says. ldquoYou could hear Gaelic being spoken every day, in every situation and that helped me no end in improving my own Gaelic. I gained a great deal of confidence in terms of Gaelic grammar, spelling and writing, all of which has been invaluable in my working le.BBC weather presenter, Joy Dunlop, is another graduate of the college who says the fluency in Gaelic she developed at the college has given her many opportunities that she otherwise would not have had.She studied Gaelic as a second language when she was a pupil at Oban High School then decided to do her sixth year at the college. She initially planned to stay for just one year to do the Cugraversa Comais but loved it so much she stayed for four, graduating with a BAin Cagravenan agus Cultar na Gagraveidhlig .ldquoAttending Sabhal Mograver was a revelation for me, she says. ldquoThe education I received was unparalleled.ldquoThe personal support and guidance I received from all the staff was of the highest level and I always felt that our teachers were genuinely invested in both the language itself and our progress.ldquoBeing immersed in the language is definitely the best way to learn, dficult as it could be at times, and having the opportunity to speak Gaelic in both the classes and the community was a real help to me.ldquoSimply,you genuinely want to learn Gaelic, there is no better place to do so than Sabhal Mograver Ostaig.

Suddenly, people have realised why there are borders and what governments are there for: it is to look after their own. It is all about safety. When it comes down to it, other countries cannot make le and death decisions for you.It was the principle applied by Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand when she decided that, actually, globalisation sucks and its better to look after your own people, eventhis means closing the borders to foreigners. Yesterday she said the borders would not be reopened ldquofor a long time.It applies especially to small countries because they are generally forgotten when the chips are down. However, in Scotland, there has been a widespread belief that the reverse has been the case and that the pandemic has ldquotorpedoed Scottish nationalism as a Scotsman headline put it recently.Commentators insist that the United Kingdom has been reunited, as in wartime. ldquoThe British family has come together to look after each other, opined a romantic unionist in the New Statesman. Im not sure theres much evidence for this.The pandemic could equally be said to have demonstrated the opposite: that it is irresponsible in a crisis to remain tied to the United Kingdom, and to the politics of British Conservatism which this country has consistently rejected. Scots are certainly not enthused by Boris Johnsons record so far. Yet three quarters believe Nicola Sturgeon has done a good job, according to the latest opinion poll.Personally, I am extremely uncomfortable with all the talk of borders, but I cant ignore the argument that, had it been in control of them, a Scottish government could have attempted the elimination strategy so effectively deployed in New Zealand. Instead, the UK government kept the borders open and some , travellers a day continued to enter Scotland with scarcely any checks.Opinion: Teddy Jamieson: Government needs to deliver more than gesturesThe influential Devi Sridhar, professor of Global Health at Edinburgh University, believes thatScotland had implemented border controls early a policy of intensive testing might well have worked here. The Scottish death rate has been around half the UK figure, and Prof Sridhar thinks it could have been halted altogether. Yet, in line with the UK, the Scottish Government abandoned community testing and contact tracing in mid-March.Now, I dont subscribe to the view that Boris Johnson has allowed thousands to die in order to save his billionaire Brexit chums. The UK government behaved reasonably, according to its lights, muddling through as always. But many mistakes were made and there is certainly an argument that Scotland could have handled the crisis better on its own.There still seems to be an assumption in the UK media that big countries are better at handling crises like coronavirus than smaller ones. Precisely the reverse appears to be the case ndash the biggest countries like America, UK, Italy, have had a dismal record in managing the pandemic so far.It is not only remote antipodean nations like New Zealand that seem to have fared better. The country with the lowest number of deaths per million in the EU is Slovakia, which has a population similar to Scotlands. The wearing of masks was made compulsory there early in the infection.Slovenia, which borders on Italy, has also emerged largely unscathed. Most small states like Norway and Denmark seem to have managed the disease effectively. The outlier is Belgium which has had the worst headline death rate so far, partly because of its population density, and perhaps because the country which houses the European Commission has been the most open and ldquoborder-free.The true death rate league table, as the risk guru Sir David Spiegelhalter has pointed out, cannot be known until the pandemic is over. But there is pretty strong evidence that smaller countries do well. They seem able to move and adapt more quickly. They also tend to be more united and able to reach a rapid consensus.Of course, unionists have always insisted that, Covid aside, an independent Scotland would be too poor and dependent on UK subsidies to survive. It would certainly start le with a budget deficit. Butthe pandemic has shown anything it is that large deficits can be managed. Theyll have to be, because every country is now in the same boat.There was never any sound economic reason why Scotland should be any less able to manage its affairs than countries like Denmark or Norway. Nationalism is about security not economics.Anyway, in the bounce-back, assuming that it happens, Scotland will again find itself tied to policies that it doesnt choose, which may include another wave of Conservative austerity. The Westminster government will naturally look to London and the North of England, where its votes lie. They will be first in the queue for investment.This isnt out of malice, but simply because Scotland is another country. It seems blindingly obvious that we are entering an age in which voters and their governments are more nation-conscious than ever. Not in a spirit of xenophobic exceptionalism but out of practical necessity. They are nearer to the people and to their pain.Of course, independence is not coming tomorrow or the next day. There wont be a referendum in the near future, for obvious reasons. But after Covid, Scotland will continue to demand greater control over its own affairs. It will increasingly behave as an independent country, even though it is bound economically to the UK. If and when the next phase of Covid arrives, Scotland will not be following a policy dictated by Westminster.I think the voters are actually ahead of the politicians on this, and ahead perhaps of Nicola Sturgeon, who has been reluctant to appear to exploit this crisis for political ends. That is to be commended. There would always have to be cooperation between Scotland and England. But far from reviving the United Kingdom as a going concern, this pandemic could be the final nail in its coffin.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

No community deserves this tag and for a day or so these streets piqued the curiosity of the media caravan before it moved on to feed on the misfortunes of some other benighted place.Our new friend is in trouble and perhaps sees in the councillor something solid and reliable.

He seems more relaxed now and says that we are a pair of ldquogood c**ts. As the taxi arrives he asks uswersquore behaving ourselves and, with a twinkle in his eye, entreats us to look after ourselves. He has started our encounter four goals down but he wonrsquot be defeated.This is Greenock Central, which was ranked top of the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivationearlier this year. This table measures income, health, employment, education, housing, crime and access to services. It took the title from Ferguslie Park in Paisley which was named third most deprived this time. The statistics are well-intentioned and designed to inform all the concerned agencies about spending decisions and service priorities across , small postcode areas called \"data zones\". Yet, every four years when the latest winners and losers are revealed the names at the top and bottom remain largely the same.Mere statistics, though, can never form a complete picture of a neighbourhoodrsquos worth and needs. We all form pictures of what a community rated Scotlandrsquos most deprived ought to look like and this part of Greenock doesnrsquot really fit. Councillor McEleny says: ldquoWersquove got a high population of pensioners here, and many of them have been living in poor health for maybe the last  years or so of their lives.He points to a homeless centre standing between the town and the water. ldquoThis place lies at the heart of the data zone and contributes to the statistics. You donrsquot see places like this in Stockbridge or Bearsden. Yoursquove got people in there whose needs are numbered in multiple strands of deprivation. They get into patterns of behaviour at a very early age when they leave school and find there are no jobs. That place is a monument to the failure of society. You canrsquot just keep throwing pound after pound at fire-fighting. You have to have early intervention and prevention. In many of these cases though, the time for early intervention has probably come and gone.Councillor McEleny is a well-kent figure on these streets and our walk is punctuated by local people stopping to chat and say hello. Soon, we reach the glass-roofed shopping centre that sits at the heart of the town and the councillor becomes animated in his disdain for it. ldquoThis whole area was a handsome and open place with green spaces. As a child I walked through here on my way to the other side of town or down to the waterfront.ldquoSadly, the stock solution favoured by planners in places struggling with de-industrialisation and de-population was to get more retail spaces under one big roof. Itrsquos a  economy. Many of the units were quickly occupied by chain-stores and coffee-shop franchises which replaced local shops, unable to compete with their prices. Thus, money was sucked away from the town and into the pockets of distant shareholders.ldquoThis is why Irsquom passionate about politics: this is where support comes from. We have a budget of poundm in Inverclyde but people want their good roads and their leisure facilities. When they see you spending money on things that only seem to benefit a minority they get disgruntled. This is the test of a decent society: how much are we willing to help those on the bottom rung Alan Coyle is the principal teacher in Pastoral Support at St Matthewrsquos Academy in Greenock and observes the challenges encountered by his pupils and their little victories each day of his working le. He says. ldquoItrsquos easy to be negative and hark back to the old days of busy shipyards and full employment. I think itrsquos remarkable that the area of the town which has emerged as the most deprived is pretty much its commercial centre. This is testament, I think, to the way this area has been decimated due to poor governance.ldquoBut local people are very protective of it and proud of its heritage, but they are also very aware of the challenges it faces. However, you canrsquot discuss Greenock without placing it in the context of Inverclyde as a whole. When I taught Modern Studies we used to talk about the paradox of Drumchapel and Bearsden separated by only a few hundred metres. Here, we have an equally striking dichotomy between Kilmacolm and the east end of Greenock. The gap between the most and least affluent in Inverclyde is the same as it is in any number of towns across central Scotland.:Giovanna Eusebi shares memories of cooking with her grandmother in lockdown recipe seriesldquoOnce, we had the great industrial actions of the s and s and the Lee Jeans work-in. And we fans of Greenock Morton FC take enormous pride in the fact that when it came to the crunch, we fought to keep our club back in . The local community support came to the fore then. But I dont think that feeling is there anymore.A DISTANCE of  miles separates Greenock from the stately arrondissement of Stockbridge, north of Edinburgh city centre, but it may as well be a dferent planet. This opulent little village was rated the least deprived corner of Scotland in the SIMD table, although it seems bizarre to include a word like lsquodeprivedrsquo anywhere near this neighbourhood.Those who donrsquot know Edinburgh are inclined to describe it as a posh city, but itrsquos not really. Refined: maybe reserved: perhaps, but Edinburgh too has its edgy places. Stockbridge though, is a Brigadoon version of Edinburgh that you happen upon after a long walk down from Princes Street, not noticing it until yoursquore actually in it. Here, the pace of le seems to slow and yoursquore invited to leave your baggage at the side of the Water of Leith. Itrsquos an enchanting place that beckons you to linger a little and chill for a while. Running alongside it is an aptly-named district called Comely Bank.In public buildings and dwelling places are the obvious dferences between affluence and penury but you sense these too in the way that people carry themselves. In poor streets there is a sense of people needing to be somewhere soon ever-alert for some invisible threat. In places like Stockbridge they move with the languor thatrsquos the preserve of those who measure their plans in years not days.Today, I encounter Stockbridge in the middle of coronavirus lockdown but you canrsquot help wonderingmuch has changed with the social restrictions. The usual middle class caprices of cobbled streets and the neighbourhood watch are here. Not for the first time I wonder why such genteel vigilantism is only seen in those communities that least require it.Where there are betting shops in Greenock here there are little shrines to interior design selling bespoke kitchens and luxury lights. Next door to a bakerycalled Pattiserie Florentin there is a shop which sells something called a ldquoSublime Replenishing Night Masque, which in Greenock might equate to a facial. Across the road stands an ample shop-front calls itself a lsquoFloatariumrsquo which I initially took to mean a shop specialising in inflatable paddling pools. On closer inspection though, there was a dizzying and esoteric assortment of treatments some of which, like manicures and pedicures Irsquod heard of and others such as a Lash Bar and the eponymous Floatarium that toyed with my imagination. You could go your holidays here.Judging by the number of charity shops here Stockbridge seems to have a big heart too. These though wouldnrsquot be called charity shops anywhere  but luxury goods emporiums. The estate agents advertise properties in the poundk to poundk price range in Greenock Central there are decent two-bedroom flats available for poundk. Just over there is a gallery called lsquoDoubtfirersquo. Only in a place such as this would such a name not be considered comically ironic. In the Water of Leith underneath the old bridge stands one of Anthony Gormleyrsquos sculptures. In the streets around it I counted eight interiors shops and five art-shops. They donrsquot just have delicatessens here they have epicures, which are not to be confused with the products on offer at the Floatarium.A lady with a Jane Austen accent calls to me across the road. ldquoItrsquos all very weird, she shouts, smiling. ldquoBut the wine-shop is open and Irsquove managed to get a chocolate brownie. These are essential items in a Stockbridge residentrsquos shopping basket.Maggie Lennon, director of the Bridges Programme charity and now resident of Glasgow, recalls her years living in Stockbridge fondly. ldquoThere was always something thrilling yet comforting walking down those steep hills from the new town to Stockbridge, she says. Itrsquos where, she says, the regimented streets and thoroughfares of the New Town succumbed to the anarchy of the twisted and meandering lanes of the village. ldquoI always considered Stockbridge to be hip.ldquoAnd I loved the restaurants, bistros, wholefoods and wine bars. Maison Hector was famous for the wall of running water cascading down the wall in the gentsrsquo loo. This was a design feature. We even had a cricket ground to which the Lord Taverners turned up once a year for a charity match and a ball. If you got tickets for this you knew you had made something of yourself.BACK IN GREENOCK they choose not to be resentful at such apparent inequality in the space of an hourrsquos drive in an affluent country. Councillor McEleny points to the townrsquos own handsome places. Just a few hundred metres separate the benighted town centre from the redeveloped waterfront seafront and the splendid Beacon Arts Centre. A tennis club, a private school and a fancy hotel sit just a few streets away from the corner that houses five betting shops. ldquoFrom a planning perspective, says Councillor McEleny, ldquoyou have to ask how we allowed a system that allowed the town centre to be hollowed out and then filled with franchises and chains and the practice of permitting the bookies to take up all the empty shop spaces.:Coronavirus in Scotland: Giovanna Eusebis lockdown family feast recipes for you to tryYet, he refuses to dwell on the glories of Greenockrsquos shipbuilding past and the well-paid jobs that made this place thrum with productivity and economic health. Instead he points to missed opportunities at a local level and a chronic lack of imagination and aversion to risk at a national level.ldquoWhen the shipyards began to close and the jobs began to disappear there was little thought given to what should happen next, he said. ldquoUnfortunately, Greenock encountered a perfect storm of circumstances all converging at the same time. Councils and governments were desperate for jobs and, in their panic, they invited the multinational supermarkets in with open arms.ldquoThe local producers all disappeared to be replaced by low-paid jobs contributing [less] to the long-term health of the local economy. Choices made nationally have also had an effect. Therersquos no thinking outside the box.ldquoCities have the tools to meet economic challenges. They will always attract finance and have a lucrative retail and night-time economy. The power of the public sector should have been better used in areas like this. Scotlandrsquos new Social Security hubs in Glasgow and Dundee are providing  jobs. Most of these are relatively high-paying, skilled jobs and would have made much more of a dference in Greenock than in Glasgow city centre. He salutes the Greenock , the much-loved local newspaper which has been chronicling and supporting the town for  years. ldquoLike many other local papers, they could have moved to the outskirts, but theyrsquore still here in the heart of the town centre. Itrsquos a very powerful symbol of solidarity and much appreciated around here.ldquoNeither Santander or Scottish Power are going to build large facilities here but our public sector has the ability to do this. Cities must accept thatwe want thriving towns which feed the cities then wersquove got to start doing things dferently or these communities and ones like Bute and the Western Isles are just going to keep depopulating.For those of us who live in and around cities itrsquos easy to forget that smaller and more far-flung places all need the same level of services: the bins still need to be picked up education and policing still has to be provided. But with fewer people yoursquove got less taxation to pay for it. The economic model is broken but it could be fixed with a little imagination.ldquoAny time a developer wants to build new houses therersquos supposed to be a mix to promote social cohesion.

Inverclyde now has the highest death rate in the country due to the disease according to the latest National Records of Scotland statistics.

In neighbouring East Renfrewshire itrsquos  per , and in East Dunbartonshire itrsquos currently .This pandemic, like all the others before it, preys on the poor.

This works out at around % of the total Scottish workforce losing their jobs.Their survey of more than  employers,  of them Scottish, also found the majority back calls to extend the programme and make it more flexible to allow short-term working. More than half of those asked wanted an extension until September.It comes after the Chancellor said the scheme would be scaled back from July, prompting concern from employers and opposition politicians that it could lead to the economy ldquofalling off a clf-edge.Lee Ann Panglea, Head of CIPD Scotland and Northern Ireland, said: ldquoThis survey very clearly shows the importance of the Governmentrsquos intervention, with over , redundancies prevented as a direct result of the Job Retention Scheme.ldquoThat being said, to prevent permanent redundancies the UK, the Government needs to look ahead and consider changes to the support it is providing to businesses. Our survey shows Scottish employers back both an extension to the Job Retention Scheme and increased flexibility to allow some short-time working, enabling organisations to bring back workers from furlough gradually while rebuilding their business.ldquoThis will become increasingly important as we look towards the next phase of this crisis, and will help avoid the current scheme simply becoming a waiting room for unemployment.Peter Cheese, head of the CIPD wrote to Mr Sunak three weeks ago warning thathe did not adapt the scheme, it could act as a ldquowaiting room for unemployment.Kate Forbes, Scottish Finance Secretary and Fiona Hyslop, Economy Secretary, wrote a joint letter to Mr Sunak today calling for assurances that Scottish firms would not be disadvantaged when the scheme ends.They said that while they welcome his assurances ldquo there will not be a clf edge to this support ending....we share the concerns raised about the uncertainty this brings.ldquoThe JRS is an essential leline for employers and employees, alongside the other schemes that have been put in place by both the UK Government and the Scottish Government. We understand that the support will need to be scaled back over time, but it is imperative that is done in a carefully considered way, and reflects the economic priorities of each of the four nations and the dferent sectors of our economies. The ability to stagger the closure of the scheme may be beneficial in considering how we safely exit the restrictions currently in place.Meanwhile the Scottish Conservatives said the survey was evidence that the Chancellorrsquos plan was a success.Jackson Carlaw, leader of the party, said: ldquoWe needed a major UK-wide response to this crisis to save our economy and protect jobs.ldquoThis survey shows the Chancellor delivered exactly that.ldquoWe all appreciate that this is a public health crisis, which has cost thousands of people their lives and left many more bereft.ldquoBut itrsquos also an economic emergency...Thankfully, the UK Government stepped in when workers needed it the most."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-sparks-calls-car-use-public-transport","story":"Busy roads in places such as Glasgow, Greenock and Fort William have all seen nitrogen dioxide levels more than halved.It comes amid calls for radical rethink of public transport and car use after the restrictions are lted.Plans to introduce low-emission zonesin four of Scotlandrsquos cities have been put on hold because of the outbreak.The new data was published by Edinburgh Universityrsquos Professor Paul Palmer and Dr Douglas Finch in a blog post for the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.They said: ldquoThis period of enforced traffic reduction has given us an opportunity to see what our cities would be like with reduced emissions. How air quality changes over Scotland and the rest of the world as the lockdown continues will be extremely interesting and no doubt the subject of many research projects.Combustion engines emit nitrogen dioxide , volatile organic compoundsand particulate matteramong other pollutants.All of these are known to have adverse effect on the respiratory system, including reduced immunity to lung infections, which the academics said ldquois particularly relevant to the Covid- virus.To track changes, they used air pollution measurements from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairsrsquo Automatic Urban and Rural Network .They said there are  sites operating in Scotland, scattered among urban and rural locations.The academics said: ldquoIf we look at a typical week of nitrogen dioxide concentrations in Glasgow, we can see the lockdown has led to a stark decrease in emissions.ldquoDuring a normal, pre-lockdown week, iations in nitrogen dioxide concentrations reflect traffic patterns, with a daily cycle peaking at morning rush hour and a smaller peak for the evening rush hour.ldquoThere are lower concentrations at the weekend due to less traffic on the roads.ldquoDuring the lockdown, there is still a morning rush hour but nitrogen dioxide levels are substantially lower for every day of the week, lower than values we normally expect on a Sunday.They said a similar pattern could be seen across cities in Scotland, as well as the rest of the UK.However, analysis of other pollutants paints a more complicated picture.The level of PM. , for example, has not shown ldquoa clear directional change ndash and even increased early in the lockdown.The academics said: ldquoOne potential explanation for this is the influence wind has on particulate matter. A new weather system arrived over the UK at the same time as the lockdown came into force and caused a change in wind direction over much of the country.ldquoThis meant air was being brought from the eastthat may have been more polluted than air blown in from the west.They said another explanation could be ldquoan increase in barbecues and garden bonfires occurring due to the warmer weather and people staying at home, although this is dficult to confirm.The experts said the analysis showed ldquotraffic is not the only consideration when cleaning up our air.They added: ldquoVariations in PM. concentrations have highlighted that changes in local emissions do not exclusively control local pollution levels.ldquoAs emissions from newer vehicle fleets get progressively cleaner we will likely need to sht our focus on to other pollutants. For instance particulate matter smaller than one millionth of a metre that can penetrate further into the human body.ldquoBy adopting cleaner travel options, such as more electrically powered transport and more cycling and walking infrastructure, then we would see lower levels of nitrogen dioxide.LEZs were due to have been brought in later this year in Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee, while the first scheme in Glasgow was expected to be fully implemented, but Transport Secretary Michael Matheson has now said this is ldquono longer practicable.He stressed the Scottish Government is fully committed to tackling the problem of air pollution, but he confirmed the implementation of LEZs has been paused.It followed a decision by members of the Low Emission Zone Leadership Group, which includes Mr Matheson and Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham, as well as representatives of the four councils involved, Public Health Scotland and environmental watchdogs at the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.Ministers hope delaying the implementation of LEZs will give those involved the chance to consider what transport systems could look like after Covid-.Mr Matheson said: ldquoThe Scottish Government is fully committed to tackling air pollution in the quickest time possible.But he added the ldquounprecedented impact of the Covid- outbreak has resulted in necessary changes to priorities across government and across our local authority partners.The Transport Secretary continued: ldquoSimilar to other initiatives across public sector, we have come to the view that introducing low-emission zones across our four biggest cities by the end of  is no longer practicable.He said ministers and councils ldquoremain dedicated to introducing low-emission zones across Scotlandrsquos four biggest cities to improve air quality and protect public health.Environmental group Friends of the Earth Scotland said the Covid- crisis has ldquohighlighted our urgent need to reduce pollution.The grouprsquos air pollution campaigner Gavin Thomson said: ldquoTherersquos a strong evidence base on the links between air pollution and vulnerability to Covid-. Pollution from traffic causes and exacerbates many of the heart and lung conditions that put people at heightened risk from the virus.Joseph Carter, head of Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation Scotland, said he was ldquoshocked and disappointed, adding: ldquoRecent research has demonstrated a link between the levels of urban air pollution and the effects of Covid-, so it is vital now more than ever that we push ahead with LEZs to help protect our nationrsquos lung health."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11347005.jpg?type=article-full","title":"ve-day-75-memories-unite-lockdown-scotland","story":"Also at pm, thousands of people will stand up and raise a toast: ldquoTo those who gave so much, we thank you.It wasnrsquot supposed to be this way though.Camleys Cartoon: VE Day .There were supposed to be church services and public parades and street parties.

He kept a diary in which he recorded his experiences of VE Day and the joy he felt.ldquoI heard Prime Minister Churchill speaking on the wireless at pm, he wrote.ldquoHe announced the war with Germany was over. It was a day of great rejoicing. In Stoneyburn, bonfires were lit in every street and crowds gathered round them and sang into the wee sma hours.There were similar scenes all over Scotland. In Perth, the bells of the churches began to peel immediately after Churchillrsquos broadcast.In Falkirk, a pipe band paraded through the town. And in Greenock, there was singing and dancing in the streets.But the biggest party was in Glasgow. Crowds flowed in and out of George Square from pm until well after midnight. Many danced in front of the City Chambers.Fireworks were let off. Children and soldiers climbed on the statues. The pubs had to close early because there was no more beer left, but the party went on anyway.Reporting on the celebrations, The Glasgow Herald called it a robust and joyful night.ldquoNoise, the sort of gay, grappling, carefree merry making, the sound of which has not been heard of in Glasgow in the s, came back to town, said the report.ldquoYou could hear it half a mile away. It was solid and heartwarming.ldquoA party of able seamen took the notion to ride bareback on one of the equestrian statues in George Square. They contented themselves with hanging on to the stirrups when it was pointed out to them that their combined weight might topple horse and rider from the pedestal. Later they achieved their ambition and got astride the bronze horse.The Herald also reported how a Dutch sailor climbed on top of the statue that would later become famous as a resting place for traffic cones ndash the Duke of Wellington statue in Royal Exchange Square ndash and did an impersonation of Hitler.ldquoAn admiring crowd applauded his buffoonery, said The Herald.ldquoIt was equally responsive when he made a short speech in broken English and thanked ldquothe Scots for the brave part they had played in the liberation of his country.In London, the celebrations were on an even bigger scale. Some , people gathered at Buckingham Palace to see the first of several balcony appearances by the King and Queen and princesses Elizabeth and Margaret. Famously, the princesses later slipped out and mingled anonymously with the people.At pm, pretty much everything stopped for Churchillrsquos speech to the nation and it was a warning just as much as it was a celebration.ldquoWe may allow ourselves a brief period of rejoicing, he said, ldquobut let us not forget for a moment the toil and efforts that lie ahead. We must now devote all our strength and resources to the completion of our task, both at home and abroad.Historian Derek Patrick, who lectures in history at St Andrews University, says it is important to remember Churchillrsquos words and that in many ways VE Day represented a continuation rather than a change.ldquoRealistically, there was no sea change ndash nothing changed overnight, said Mr Patrick.ldquoYou would start to see POWs ing to the country but it took a long long time to get things back on an even keel and towards normality.ldquoThere was also a level of hostility and resentment ndash a feeling that people were promised a land fit for heroes but it was a  dawn. After years of war, there was perhaps a determination to see this project through and you can attribute a lot of the changes we saw after VE Day, like the NHS, to the war. This is a moment to rejoice ndash Europe has been pulled back from the precipice ndash but this is only one step on the road to victory.Catherine Drummond certainly remembers how tough it was after VE Day. She was a war widow with an eight-month-old daughter and had to work two jobs, in a shop and waiting tables, to make ends meet. She was also still mourning her husband.ldquoIt took me a long time to get over it, she said. ldquoI didnrsquot really give up hope until the POWs came home. I was hoping, you know.Like everyone , Mrs Drummond is now in lockdown, but Poppy Scotland is encouraging people to mark VE Day at home or use the subject as a resource for home schooling.You can also download bunting from Poppy Scotlandrsquos website for a Zoom party, or use their recipes to make some of the food, like potato shortbread, that would have been eaten at street parties  years ago.There are other events today you can take part in even in lockdown. At am there will be a two-minute silence, which will be broadcast on the BBC.At pm people will be encouraged to take part in the Nationrsquos Toast. Then, at pm, the Queen,  years after making her way incognito through the crowds in London, will address the nation.Mr Patrick said it was important to mark VE Day in this way, not just through any sense of celebrating the victory ndash although that is important ndash but also to remember what the country went through.The war had gone on for six years. Scotland had been subjected to  German air raids. Homes and families were destroyed. And widows and widowers were made. The country was exhausted and the political, social and economic repercussions would be felt for many years to come.But perhaps, says Mr Patrick, it is even more important to mark this anniversary than the ones that have gone before ndash for a simple and poignant reason. ldquoThe opportunities to speak to the people who were there, he says, ldquoare slipping away."},{"url":null,"title":"lord-armstrong-archetypal-insider-inspired-yes-minister-character","story":"Born. March , Died. April , Lord Armstrong, who has died aged , was the confidante and adviser to three prime ministers: all with very dferent characters but serving them all with respect and diligence.His tact, diplomacy and patience were, however, often required. He was much involved in many major public events ndash notably, the famous lsquoeconomical with the truthrsquo ndash in a court room in Australia in .A former embittered MI officer, Peter Wright, published his memoirs, Spycatcher, which the UK government alleged leaked confidential secrets.Wrightrsquos cunning defence lawyer, Malcolm Turnbullquizzed Armstrong ruthlessly and when asked the dference between a lie and a misleading impression Armstrong replied, ldquoperhaps being economical with the truth.He immediately pointed out that the phrase was not his ndash but that of the th century philosopher Edmund Burke. The off-hand remark was to haunt Armstrong all his le.In fact, he was known outside Whitehall as the original for the fast talking and manipulative Sir Humphrey Applebey in the BBC drama Yes Minister.Turnbull directly compared Armstrong to Appleby and chose to refer to Armstrong in his summing up, ldquoIf he is an honest man, then he appears rather like a well-educated mushroom. Later Armstrong described the experience as ldquothe most disagreeable time.Robert Temple Armstrong was the only son of Sir Thomas Armstrong a former principal of the Royal Academy of Music. He attended Eton where he was a Kingrsquos Scholar and then read Classics at Christ Church, Oxford. In  he was appointed private secretary to Reginald Maudling, the future chancellor of the exchequer and then served both RA Butler and Roy Jenkins when they were chancellors.Armstrongrsquos quick mind and eye for detail marked him out as a high-flyer in Whitehall. So, it was no surprise when he was appointed principal private secretary to the new prime minister, Edward Heath, in  . His distinguished career saw him at the centre of government serving Harold Wilson from  to  and, as cabinet secretary, to Margaret Thatcher from  and .It is thought he did not remain under Wilson as his secretary, Marcia Williams, wanted more control of the administration in Number . In  Armstrong worked for the reforming Home Secretary Roy Jenkins until . That year he became cabinet secretary and in  head of the civil service under Thatcher.Armstrong was the ultimate behind-the-scene-fixer. He played an important role in Thatcherrsquos bid for peace in Ireland. She entrusted Armstrong with the secret negotiations in which took place in the heated atmosphere of the time and after the hunger strikes. In Charles Moorersquos extensive biography of Thatcher, he calls those Anglo-Irish talks, ldquoArmstrongrsquos greatest legacy ndash that led eventually to the Good Friday Agreement in .Armstrong was involved in many of the high-profile events of the era: he was with Heath throughout the negotiations to enter the EEC in  he was taking the minutes when Michael Heseltine walked out of the Cabinet in high-dudgeon over the Westland affair. The Prime Minister then appointed Armstrong to conduct an inquiry into the sorry affair. Armstrong concluded that the Trade Minister Leon Brittan had leaked a letter damaging to Heseltine, without saying that Thatcher knew about the strategy.Signicantly, Armstrong was adamant that Thatcher should not give a knighthood to Jimmy Savile. His opinion prevailed until after he had retired.Throughout his years as head of the civil service Armstrong passionately believed in the need for total secrecy within Whitehall. Leaking was a complete anathema to him and he took a robust line against anyone who talked to the media. He issued firm guidelines instructing civil servants that they were, ldquoservants of the Crown. For all practical purposes the Crown in this context means, and is represented by, the government of the day.Armstrong was the archetypal Mandarin. Incisive, intelligent and able to weigh up important events and present them with succinct clarity. Under his management meetings were controlled and worked like clockwork. A minister who worked with him has written, ldquoRobert really was a remarkable public servant, one of the best I have dealt with. Firm, honest, tough, but much warmer than most of the others. Armstrong was always very proper in dealing with his prime Ministers. Despite seeing Thatcher two or three times a day he always addressed her as ldquoprime minister and she in turn called him ldquoRobert.Armstrong remained passionate about music all his le. He was secretary of the board of the Royal Opera House and then served on its board. He was a very knowledgeable opera fan and regularly attended performances. His friendship with Edward Heath was firmly founded on their mutual love of the piano: the two often played piano duets at Chequers of an evening with little or no conversation.On retiring Armstrong served in ious capacities and was knighted in  and made a le peer  years later.In  Armstrong married Patricia Carlow, and she survives him along with his two daughters, Jane and Teresa, from his first marriage, to Serena which was dissolved.Alasdair Steven"},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-elon-musk-case-much-milk","story":"YESTERDAY we ran a story proving that the messages academics scrawl on walls can be just as smart as anything they write on a blackboard.

a now-shattered economy.The losses reflect what has become a severe recession caused by sudden business shutdowns in nearly every industry.Nearly all the job growth achieved during the -year recovery

employers had added jobs for a record  months, while in March, the unemployment rate was just .%The governmentrsquos report on Friday noted that many people who lost jobs in April but did not look for another one were not even counted in the unemployment rate.The impact of those losses was reflected in the drop in the proportion of working-age Americans who have jobs ndash just .%, the lowest on record.In addition to the millions of newly unemployed, . million others had their hours reduced in April.That trend also means less income and less spending, perpetuating the economic downturn.A measure of what is called underemployment ndash which counts the unemployed plus full-time workers who were reduced to part-time work ndash reached .%, a record high.Though some businesses are beginning to reopen in certain states, factories, hotels, restaurants, resorts, sporting venues, cinemas and many small businesses are still largely shuttered.In the five weeks covered by the US jobs report for April, . million people applied for unemployment benefits.The job losses reported on Friday were a smaller figure because the two are measured dferently: the government calculates job losses by surveying businesses and households.It is a net figure that also counts the hiring that some companies, such as Amazon and many grocery stores, have done.By contrast, total jobless claims are a measure of just the layoff side of the equation.For the United States, a key question is where the job market goes from here.Applications for unemployment aid, while high, have declined for five straight weeks, a sign that the worst of the layoffs has passed.Still, few economists expect a rapid turnaround.The Congressional Budget Office has forecast that the unemployment rate will still be .% by the end of next year.A paper by economists at the San Francisco Federal Reserve estimates that under an optimistic scenario that assumes shutdowns are lted quickly, the unemployment rate could fall

Could we get the website sorted so that people get the information that they need, rather than thinking that in order to get a test they have to first get a plane or a ferry ”Responding, the Secretary of State for Health, Matt Hancock MP, said: “It’s a very important question and I’ll look into the specics of it to make sure that our island communities get the appropriate response in the website. He’ll appreciate that we put the testing website together at a remarkable pace and so in the first iteration weren’t able to make this sort of important nuance for Orkney and island communities, but I’ll take that away and look at it.“He mentioned the answer to this in substance and the answer is to get the home testing kits working for Orkney [and Shetland] and I’m sure there’s a way through.”Reacting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said:“I am glad that action will be taken to get this issue sorted. If key workers in the isles are not getting the testing that they need because they are getting inaccurate advice from official websites, that puts more people at risk and harms public confidence.“Island communities could benefit greatly from more access to home testing kits for key workers.

While guidance to local councils suggested the former, a recent response from the Tourism Secretary, Fergus Ewing to Shetland MSP Beatrice Wishart suggested the latter.Mr McArthur wrote to finance secretary, Kate Forbes, seeking clarity and has been told that  days of bookings are required in order to be able to access support. But Orkney’s MSP has pointed to claims by the Association of Scotland’s Self-Caterersthat requiring  days of bookings unfairly excludes most self-caterers who operate in areas where the tourism season is typically shorter, such as rural and island communities.Mr McArthur said: “Getting the eligibility criteria right for these funding schemes was never going to be easy. The Finance Secretary deserves credit, however, for being willing to make changes based on feedback from myself and MSP colleagues, as well as businesses directly.“However, almost two months into the lockdown, and it is clear that many self-catering businesses in Orkney are still falling through the gaps, despite being able to evidence self-catering as a primary source of income.  This not only threatens the future of these inidual businesses but also potentially Orkney’s wider tourism sector.“The situation has not been helped by contradictions in the advice offered by dferent Ministers. The Finance Secretary has now addressed this confusion over eligibility criteria, but at the same time confirmed the sense that the bar has been set very high for applicants in many rural and island areas.“As the ASSC point out, expecting self-caterers in the islands to be able to evidence almost five months of bookings for their property is often unrealistic given that the tourism season is typically shorter here than in other parts of the country.“I have urged the Finance Secretary to look again at the criteria to ensure that they are properly ‘island proofed’ under the terms of the Islands Act.  While there is a need to avoid making scheme rules overly-complex or confusing, it is also important that they achieve fairness for businesses wherever they happen to be based.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However I have no idea how I can add my contribution. Ryan can you help me out here and publish the link in the Shetland Times mailto:NTIMailbox@ofgem.gov.ukIt is not unreliablestored. This technology exists. If we simply used the electricity to generate hydrogen, and store it just like the old city gas, we can run all our power needs through hydrogen fuel cells. Simple, cheap and clean. Or we could let global heating destroy our children#s future because nobody wants to see a big windmill near their property. I#m old enough not to care.To give a hand to each.#To leave the oyster-bed.#The sun#s shining here and like the old oyster, I can#t be bothered, either, John. Have a nice evening, do.Love it, thanks JT 🙂No real need for fuel cells. Hydrogen was % of coal gas, can be stored in gasometers and burnt in gas fires and used to power piston engines, gas turbines and most conventional heating systems. A hell of a lot cleaner than burning wood chip. Now forget the windfarms, obsolete technology, use tidal generation and mini modular nuclear.That way we will have a living planet worth saving, not a mass of concrete, steel and fibreglass.I#m not sure windfarms are quite obsolete yet# with the technology that is available at scale onshore wind is the cheapest source of new electricity. Perhaps not on peat bogs though. That#s not to say we can#t do better with other renewables.PS circa Dads Army, I am not that old!!!At  dollars a barrel so called renewables will need to reduce costs by a huge margin to compete with oil. At the current oil price of less that  dollars a barrel wind, tidal and solar no hope.Renewable energy is not produced in barrels. Where did you hear that We continue to burn oil and gas because the infrastructure is there and the investment has been made. But when it comes to investing in new electricity generation, onshore wind is the cheapest. Also # I am not sure how such a low price is beneficial to the oil industry what with their high fixed costs As a patriotic Brit I am all for us standing on our own two feet and generating cheap and reliable energy. Shetland aside, as a nation we are net importers of oil and gas. Why rely on the likes of Russia or our Middle Eastern friends when we can spend that money at home and have jobs for Brits producing clean and plentul energy  Let#s stop living in the s. Let#s have clean, reliable British energy instead.I tend to lean in the direction indicated by John Thomas.For reasons of cheapness , safety and reliability I can’t see why wind and tidal forces should not be the primary options for energy generation. Winds are unlikely to stop blowing and sea tides are unlikely to dry up , so how can they not be major considerations Nuclear power is also in the running provided that the associated risks can be accepted. No matter what the no doubt wellintended may suggest, there ARE risks which do not raise their ugly heads with wind and water. Reliable , sustainable , and non polluting. What more could one ask for in this struggling , changed 🌎 world we occupy for a short time. Now Thorium nuclear is clean, no long half-le isotopes produced and no danger of meltdown.They are also neither cheap or reliable. Back up will also be requiredfor when the sun doesn#t shine or the wind isn#t suitable at more expense. More renewables will inevitably contribute to increased fuel poverty.Michael Moore # Planet of the Humans # a documentaryon the renewable energy scam that the left want banned # who would have thought !The more you look into the problem of energy supply against saving the environment, the more contradictory conclusion one gains. Wind and Solar maybe cleaner, but how much land and natural habitat being destroyedwould be required to power a city of several million##.and this is just  city     What energy source would be required alsothere are days of no sun or no wind. What backup technology would be in place, and would this also be clean energy  It seems ironically disturbing that cleaner energy through wind and solar, would also have a negative impact on the environmentyou take into consideration the polluting processes involved in the manufacturing of such devices.as well as the huge amount of land required , which would also be expanding as the population grows. I would assess cleaner energy via wind and solar would have a larger impact on the natural eco-systems and the environment and would still be reliant on fossil fuels. As far as I can see, disturbing as it may be, the only source for future energy demand is to go nuclear.And no , I am not a pessimistI’m a wary realist.Better than a blinkered optimist.Nuclear Energy does have its dangerous pitfalls, but we are already using this technology to generate electricity. I believe % of our electricity is produced by nuclear power  In France I believe this to be much higher  Although it may be dficult to assess the impact of solar or wind generators on the environment on a large scale, it would have to be balanced between the use of such technology to this of the environmental and eco-systems which maybe affected.I do not know how much land would be required to provide electricity to a city of several million, but I would hazard a guess it would be quite considerable  This use would also have to compete with farming and agriculture not to mention living space for housing etc etc.  from the shore would these wind turbines be  I suspect it would be quite close  Will our seashores be lined up with thousands of wind turbines I would also suspect the cost of such a scenario would be very high in adoption and maintenance.lol Hayden. Disturbing as it may be, I do not think we will have much option but to go nuclear. If it were a case of saving the environment and eco-systems, one may not have any choice We are already using this technology to produce electricity, andit is the case of minimizing our impact on the environment and eco-systems, then nuclear maybe the only way Cleaner energy may be, morally, more suited, but one must also take into consideration the impact on the environment and eco-systems and how this may change towards a negative once we realize the full influence of this compared to the potential benefits I cannot give any answers to what a large scale wind or solar scheme would be to power several millions homes, but I would suspect it would be considerably large in land area  One could use the same land for agriculture and farming and possibly housing  Shetland is suited for wind generating power schemes, but what would be the benefits to this of tourism, bird populations and property values, not to mention the visual impact of those people living near to such schemes and the consistent vibrating noise.Agriculture, farming and housing would not be adversely affected. Bird populations would be safe and tourists would be able to concentrate on spending their money which, after all, is the main reason for encouraging them to visit Shetland!! By the way,I have stood close to wind fed generators of the type we are discussing and never felt vibrations —- just the pleasant swishing sound of the rotating blades. Not too dferent from the soothing sounds of the sea.Haydn, You live in Crickhowell, Wales, nowhere near any large windfarms.The Black Mountains and the Brecon Beacons on your doorstep. Just how close is your home to the #the pleasant swishing sound of the rotating blades  .# I really doubtyou can even see a -meter turbine from your home. On Shetland people would be living under them, they would be about  meters high on high hills  meters or so plus above our heads!!! The plan is for over.Another smaller series of wind turbines is even closer to me and they are sited near Ebbw Vale on The Tops as we in the lower valley area call them. From close first hand experience I still maintain that the swishing sound of the blades is pleasant and certainly not as fierce and noisyas anyof the many gale force winds on Shetland.Or does that apply just to those who are incomers from other places like England for example Where do you hale from Ian  Just wondering !Llanfoist is just a walk from Crickhowell, I walk that distance most days!!! !! As you asked, for what it is worth, I have lived in Shetland  years now, longer than anywhere . Just the relevance of that is a bit beyond me but it seems you wish to know!!Ian, since I don’t live in Crug Hywel , a walk from where I do liveand back would be  miles. In my marathon running days that would have been a decent evening run but those days have gone. A short walk of  miles would be easier now.Ian, you did a Trump special and answered a query I did not make. I did not ask you how long you’ve lived on Shetland. My question was where do you hail from Haydn, I wrote rotor noise, not Chinook engine noise. Do not put words in my mouth. Now close up in a gale the continuous noise compares to engine noise fo a jet engine, I believe Chinooks are turbojet-powered. Now your  Ferndale turbines are tiny compared to the Shetland proposed -meter monsters.

The peat hills of Shetland are as rare special as the Amazon rain forest. Hectare for hectare the peat stores more carbon than a rainforest, tens of thousands of tons of concrete a hundred miles or so of new roads all over the high hill!

The breeding ground of the very rarest of birds, animals and SSSIs desecrated all to make a very few people richer. Seven hundred and fty-odd million Pounds on copper and plastic cable alone.

This really is a case of a common approach and a common message saving lives.“Those who promote a dferentiated approach ignore the practical implications of that.#We must avoid mixing messages and any ergence in practice across the UK must be based on clear need, and not on doing things dferently for the sake of it.” raquoHow about getting our councillors back to work so that they can start getting to grips with developing an economic recovery plan to try and mitigate the effects of the impact of a government mandated shutdown.The four pillars of our economy are crumbling..

However, in May  Loch Alsh became a centre of activity for processing German U-boats that had surrendered at the end of the war in Europe.With the objective of ensuring total German naval disarmament, the Royal Navy intended that, at the cessation of hostilities, any German U-boats that surrendered in and around Europe would be moved to the UK prior to their destruction.To this end Admiral Sir Max Horton, Commander-in-Chief Western Approaches, advised the Admiralty that he intended to use Lisahally in Northern Ireland and Loch Ryan in south-west Scotland for laying-up the surrendered U-boats pending joint Allied agreement about their future.’, and on  March  decisions were concentrating on three main strands of action.The first related to the surrender orders to be issued to the U-boats at sea at the time of the expected German capitulation.The second concerned the reception arrangements for the U-boats surrendering from sea, and the third concerned the arrangements for the reception of the U-boats that had surrendered in German and German-controlledports and which were then to be transferred to the UK.Loch Eriboll near Cape Wrath in the far north-west corner of Scotland was designated as a ‘Port for Preliminary Examination’, Loch Alsh on the north-west coast of Scotland, was designated as a ‘Port for Final Examination’ and Lisahally and Loch Ryan were designated as ‘Ports for Laying-Up’.Loch Alsh was selected for the final examinations because it was sheltered, because it could accommodate  U-boats on buoys at any one time, and because it possessed both a resident naval organisation and a railhead.As Loch Ryan did not become operational until after  June, all the U-boats handled in Loch Alsh in May  were destined to be transferred to Lisahally.Loch Alsh’s principal role was to remove the U-boats’ torpedoes, as well as to take the majority of the German crews into captivity, and this was influenced by the fact that it was already a formal, but small naval anchorage.However, although it had a resident Naval Officer-in-Charge, Captain Brian Gourley, who was to be responsible for the overall organisation, it did not have sufficient staff or facilities to process the number of U-boats that were expected to pass through in transit from Loch Eriboll to Lisahally., which was commanded by Commander Bertram W Taylor, was ordered to Loch Alsh to organise this intermediate part of the surrender process,arriving there on  May.In the meantime the general German capitulation came into effect, and this led to the issue of the Admiralty order that all U-boats were to surrender with effect from  hours on  May, and that those still at sea were to head for a number of designated reception ports, the prime one of which was Loch Eriboll.The first U-boat to arrive in Loch Eriboll was U- on the morning of  May and, by  May seventeen more U-boats had arrived in the Loch.None of the U-boats which had surrendered from sea spent long at Loch Eriboll.Instead, after the preliminary examinations, they were moved quickly, and under escort, to Loch Alsh. Escort Groupwhich was based in Loch Eriboll:, which were being moved to Trondheim from Narvik where they had surrendered on  May.Escort Group , but instead of being allowed to continue to Trondheim, the Admiralty directed that the U-boats should be escorted to Loch Eriboll.The  U-boats were therefore escorted across the North Sea to Loch Eriboll by the th EG, and they all arrived off Loch Eriboll at  in the evening of  May where they were met by ships of  EG before moving into the anchorage for initial processing.After that, the ex-Narvik U-boats were quickly transferred to Loch Alsh, sailing in three separate batches of five:, and they were escorted from Loch Eriboll by four ships from  EG on  May. left Loch Eriboll on  May escorted by two ships from  EG and one from the th EG. escorted by three ships from  EG also left Loch Eriboll on  May.It had originally been intended to berth the U-boats singly alongside Loch Alsh’s railway pier where, with the aid of its steam crane, their torpedoes would be disembarked.However, it soon became clear that the rate of arrival of the U-boats from Loch Eriboll, the lack of on-shore accommodation at Loch Alsh and the general shortage of personnel, would result in a very slow turnoverthis plan continued.moored in Loch Alsh awaiting disposal by the Royal Navy.However, these two ships were well suited to the U-boat handling task in every way, particularly as each possessed an electric crane whose lting capabilities were ideal for the task of disembarking torpedoes from the U-boats...The four remaining ships in  EG were employed in providing guards for the U-boats on arrival and for escorting them to Lisahally after they had been processed. arrived from Loch Eriboll, and the final examination process began.This started with the removal of all the German officers and men from each U-boat, except for a steaming party.A Royal Navy submarine inspection party which had been delivered to Loch Alsh on  May then began the formal inspection of each U-boat and, as soon as the torpedo compartments were pronounced clear, the removal of the torpedoes started.Within the first  hours, eight U-boats had been cleared,  torpedoes had been removed, and  German officers and  ratings had been searched and landed as Prisoners-of-War.would be available to be transferred to Lisahally on  May.The prospect of up to eight U-boats being transferred to Lisahally so quickly after the German capitulation provided an ideal opportunity for Admiral Sir Max Horton to stage a public multi-national surrender ceremony to celebrate the successful end of the anti-U-boat war in the North Atlantic.’ which took place on  May.Despite the considerable pressures created by the need for speed, Commander Taylor’s arrangements for the processing of the U-boats at Loch Alsh turned out to be exactlyright in the circumstances, and after clearing the first eight U-boats, the process settled down to run smoothly.Prisoners were cleared every other day, so that there were never more than  men in either depot ship at one time.The later U-boats had few torpedoes, many none at all, so the rate of handling went up to six per day at times. had arrived at Loch Alsh from Loch Eriboll on  May, and aroused considerable interest because of its cargo of strategic materials from the Far East, and it was then sailed for Liverpool on  May.The U-boat arrived in Liverpool on  May for its cargo to be unloaded in the Gladstone Dock. was moved to Barrow-in-Furness on  May for completion of the unloading process.In the meantime, while in Liverpool, the U-boat was inspected by Admiral Horton amid considerable publicity, giving rise to the oft-repeated, but incorrect, story that it had surrendered there.The movement of the remaining U-boats from Loch Alsh to Lisahally went equally smoothly, with the U-boats and their escorts departing regularly:.As warheads were also stored in the lighter, steps had to be taken to keep the fire localised and prevent the heat reaching the explosives.A drter remained alongside all night, prepared to tow the lighter clearnecessary, but the fire was contained and the drama ceased.The fire had occurred in the battery compartment and propelling motor of the torpedo, and was the result of chemical action after acid from the batteries was spilt whist the torpedo was being handled. bound for Lisahally. Thus, as stated in HMS Aylmer’s Report of Proceedings:once the last Loch Eriboll U-boats had been processed, and in his fortnightly diary of events dated  May , the Flag Officer-in-Charge, Greenock, Rear Admiral Sir Richard Hill, reported to the C-in-C WA that:In summary, for two weeks in May , Loch Alsh was a centre of U-boat-related activity. It had been designated as the ‘Port for Final Examination’ of the surrendered German U-boats that had arrived earlier at Loch Eriboll, both directly from sea and from Narvik, and thus was involved in the processing of  of the U-boats that were to be held in the UK awaiting decisions about their final demise.Loch Alsh was an established, albeit small, naval base, and it had the advantage of a railhead. However, even after the arrival of  EG, its berthing and mooring facilities were inadequate for handling the ex-Loch Eriboll U-boats at the required speed. moored in Loch Alsh awaiting disposal, both of which were well suited to the U-boat handling task in every way, particularly as each could accommodate the disembarking German crews and each possessed an electric crane whose lting capabilities were ideal for the task of disembarking torpedoes from the U-boats.They were therefore pressed into service, and between  May and  May facilitated  EG’s processing of the U-boats.In that short time  of the U-boats were escorted to Lisahally and one to Liverpool,  torpedoes were removed and disposed of,  German crew members were searched, and , of them were landed for transfer to POW Camps.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3102034.jpg--.jpg?1588582662000\n","title":"parcels delivered by ballee community association","story":"Ballee Community Association have played their part in helping the commuity during the COVID crisis.The Association were awarded pound funding from Mid and East Antrim Borough Council and then match funded pound from their own reserve funds to make  emergency parcels for older residents in Ballee.

And while the Executive at Stormont holds firm about no changes to the current lockdown, you soon get a sense that a gradual release has left the starting blocks a little earlier than the authorities might have liked.It is a bright, sunny early afternoon, and even before you reach the town there are signs that lockdown may be wearing thin. Some people are unpacking a picnic at a table in a lay-by.Hidden away behind Lough Neagh, you will find the people who inhabit rural Mid Ulster often feel they are forgotten about away from the bright lights of Belfast.And examining the statistics around Covid-, you will find the rates of the virus are a lot lower than where.Social distancing is being well observed.Outside the several chemists along the main street queues have formed. People stand two metres apart. Several are wearing masks. Entrance is on a one-in, one-out basis.One thing you do notice is that most of those around the town are older.There are no young families, few teenagers. Most shops remain closed. There is no reason for them to be there, so they are not.Yet Cookstown is billed as the retail capital of Mid Ulster.In a small area you will find Tesco, Asda and an MS Foodhall. Homebase and Halfords are open.Throw into the mix BM Bargains and Poundland and that magnet draws them all to one central location.As more shops have come out of their enforced hibernation, so too have the people.At the snf of a nibble to feed their starved retail need, many are biting.In one convenience store there is an admittance that the number of people out and about is on the rise.There#s definitely been an increasing number of people coming in, I am told.And what we#re seeing is more and more older people, possibly coming back two or three times a day.There are very few younger people and teenagers.Cookstown is a hub for a wide area of townlands dotted around the Sperrins and along the shores of Lough Neagh where people do not have access to chemists and supermarkets.They all gravitate to the main town.And while the younger generation content themselves by staying in touch through social media, that is not the way the older generation do things.The scope for loneliness is much wider in the rural community, but perhaps that environment gives a sense that the population is shielded by the wide open spaces around them.And this is a town without a bypass.Everyone travelling through Mid Ulster has to go along the . miles of the main street. There is no alternative in a quirk of geography and infrastructure.While that might explain the amount of traffic, the sense remains that the community is making a slow and gradual choice to ease back to le as they knew it.On the other side of town, two miles along the road to Omagh, a police car is stationed at the gates of Drum Manor Forest Park - a reminder to everyone that the current advice on non-essential travel still stands.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

While it is true that many unionists - including those in the Assembly - have reservations about how Boris Johnson has handled the crisis, they remain cautious about pursuing any strategy which would see Northern Ireland signicantly out-of-kilter with the rest of the United Kingdom.And Sinn Fein - very keen to play the England#s problem is Ireland#s opportunity card at the moment - doesn#t want Executive strategy to be signicantly out-of-kilter with the rest of Ireland.Issuing joint statements about working together in the Executive is one thing but actually working together, particularlyit#s in a way that seems to favour one national government approach over the other, is another thing entirely.In a letter on April , following Leo Varadkar#s announcement that the Irish Government would begin a unilateral process to ease lockdown restrictions, Mary Lou McDonald wrote: You announced last night that the caretaker government is preparing a plan to lt the public health emergency restrictions, with steps to progress this plan taken every two to three weeks ... A safe exit strategy must be, by definition, all-Ireland. This will require close collaboration and co-ordination with the Executive in Belfast.This all-Ireland mantra has been at the heart of Sinn Fein#s approach to Covid- since the beginning, with many of their key players linking it to the much bigger constitutional project of Irish unity.Understandably, that approach has angered most of unionism, including many inidual unionists who aren#t, in fact, supportive of the UK Government#s sluggish approach to the crisis, or the reality that there have been more Covid- deaths in the UK than in any other European country.There was also anger when Sinn Fein junior minister Declan Kearney wrote in his blog a few weeks ago: Disturbingly, the extension of lockdown in the short term masks an argument which is being encouraged by some right-wing elements in the British Cabinet and also by some unionists in the north of Ireland that the lockdown measures should be relaxed and that economic activity and productivity should be resumed. It is the typical capitalist reflex which puts the market economy first.The problem for Sinn Fein is that Leo Varadkar has now pushed ahead with his own proposals to relax lockdown and encourage the resumption of economic activity and productivity, and has done so without consulting either Sinn Fein or the Northern Ireland Executive Yet, Regina Doherty, the Irish Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, seemed to defend not formally telling the Executive first: At the end of the day, I think the most important thing that we needed to do was to tell the people that we serve the Irish people. And that is what the Taoiseach did at the first opportunity after the cabinet meeting was over.Yet, even though Sinn Fein has expressed anger at Varadkar#s not consulting the Executive and Doherty#s defence of him, the party still feels obliged to support him, rather than any UK-led alternative.There had been hope in some quarters that the nature of the crisis would improve the relationship between the DUP and Sinn Fein. But evidence suggests that the constitutional gulf between them remains as wide and as isive as ever.And while it is true that the number of deaths here is lower than originally predicted , there has been no corresponding indication of cross-party agreement on what needs to be done next. Ironically, the success in keeping the numbers down seems to have exacerbated the policy strategy disagreements between them.Sinn Fein has been pushing for the Executive to publish a plan for easing restrictions, but that seems to be more to do with keeping Northern Ireland in step with the Irish government rather than waiting to hear what Boris Johnson will say on Sunday.Michelle O#Neill wanted the plan published yesterday, but with the UK Government favouring a UK-wide strategy built on conversations with the devolved administrations, I#d be very surprisedthe Executive agreed to jump the gun and publish its own proposals.From the unionist perspective, it#s also a matter of not creating new gulfs with the UK Government, particularly at a time when the Executive and Northern Ireland will need massive economic support from that government for the next few years.That#s not to say that the Executive couldn#t, or won#t, produce a recommendations document which might feed into Johnson#s thinking before Sunday#s speech.The Scottish Governmenthas already made a case for some bespoke arrangements while the nature of the relationship between Northern Ireland and the Republic also favours a bespoke approach in some, very specic, areas.But since the Irish Government has clearly embarked on its own approach to easing lockdown and kick-starting the economy, it would now seem oddthe Northern Ireland Executive decided not to wait for a lead from the UK Government. Indeed, Johnson may already be considering the Varadkar proposals as a potential template.It#s also worth bearing in mind that nobody really knows how the easing of restrictions in some countrieswill work.An awful lot seems to depend on people exercising common sense, avoiding complacency and adhering to social distancing rules and continuing lockdown regulations. There is no guarantee that will happen.And nor is there a guarantee that there won#t be a second wave of Covid-, which could actually be much more devastating than the first wave. For all of us, this is - and will remain - uncharted waters.Northern Ireland is in a very odd position: torn politically constitutionally between London and Dublin and with both the DUP and Sinn Feinseemingly electorally obliged to support competing strategies from Johnson and Varadkar, even when they have dficulties with those strategies.But, as I have noted many, many times down the years, and in relation to a whole host of issues, the dreary steeples outlook will always trump a genuinely collective approach.And even though the Covid- crisis is a unique challenge we have, as ever, ended up in our default position.Am I surprised  Not really.

It doesn#t look like anything can beat her, she said.We were all worried when we got the news last month that she had tested positive in the nursing home, but she#s been through a lot these past couple of years and it seems this virus wasn#t going to beat her either.Ethel, born Margaret Ethel McFadden with two sisters and two brothers, has always stuck by what she knows best - Belfast le.She#s now living at Bradley Manor off the Crumlin Road.

After marrying and having two children, my father Samuel and his sister Lorraine, she lost her husband Jim to cancer  years ago, but she kept on going, Ashleigh told this newspaper.She suffered a bad fall when she was . She spent several months in hospital with a broken hip and wrist and contracted MRSA while when was in there, but we#re all delighted to still have her with us as she reaches  years.Contracting coronavirus was a big concern for us, but thankfully, though she tested positive, her symptoms turned out to be quite mild. Throughout it she was determined to stay in her home. She wasn#t for going to hospital and wanted to be where she felt safe and secure. The care the staff at Bradley Manor gave her helped her stay where she wanted to be. We just can#t thank them enough for all that they have done these past few weeks. Coronavirus still knocked her back a good bit and, given her age, the recovery is slow, but we all take it in turns to FaceTime her every day. She might not be up to date with technology, but the staff in Bradley Manor have been fantastic in helping her. She loves nothing more than seeing her great-grandchildren. All the family have been there for her in whatever way we can.None of us have actually seen her since the home closed to visitors in the middle of March. While we did have plans to celebrate her birthday at Belfast Castle and let her look down over the city she loves so much, we#ve obviously had to put any big family gatherings on hold until the situation changes.But we have been in touch with Bradley Manor and we#re all hoping to be there in the car park next week to see her on her birthday.Though she#s in bed most of the time recovering, the staff are hoping to get her down to reception and wheel her to the door so she can see all of us.Birthday cards can be sent to Ethel, addressed Bradley Manor,  Crumlin Road, BT GEBelfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

At the weekend, the Irish government outlined its roadmap for reopening society and business. The British government is set to publish its plans this Sunday. Speaking at today’s COVID- press conference First Minister Arlene Foster said the NI Executive is working ‘actively’ on its plan and continues to make progress. She said people would be ‘anxious’ to know of NI’s plan but cautioned that social distancing measures are ‘likely to be with us for some time’. The First Minister explained: “In fashioning a plan ministers are being guided by the latest medical and scientic evidence. googletag.cmd.push “We are looking closely at the current rate of infection, the estimated level of transmission, and estimates of future trajectory in this pandemic once relaxation takes place. “Another signicant factor in our planning is assessing the impact on our health and social care system to deal with COVID- cases. “And also of course the resumption of other health services. The Executive is also assessing the wider health, societal and economic implications of the current restrictions to determine which areas will pose the least risk and greatest benefitwe were to relax them. “None of these decisions are easy, as we’ve said before all governments are grappling with the implications of a public health crisis that we never thought would come to pass. googletag.cmd.push “And COVID- has dramatically altered society and will have implications for the way we live for many years to come.” She added that there is a danger of the public becoming distracted and going back to what they did before. The First Minister said the country needs to be on guard and respect social distancing guidelines. She went on to say that people ‘cannot afford to be lax’ and act like coronavirus has been beaten as it still ‘poses a threat to you and those you love’. Restrictions won’t be kept in place any longer than is necessary, she concluded. Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said any approach must be ‘cautious and gradual’ as COVID- is still spreading and taking lives. She asked the public not to take matters into their own hands. The plan will be published as soon as possible, ‘hopefully later this week’. Any plan is ‘not a green light’ for people to do as they choose as the Executive is looking at the safest possible approach, the Deputy First Minister added. She also took the opportunity to welcome Finance Minister Conor Murphys announcement of over pound million of new funding for infrastructure, regeneration, and tourism projects across the north. That includes match funding of poundm forDerry City and Strabanes City Deal Inclusive Future Fund.

Cllr Kathleen McGurk started the GoFundMe campaign to help those struggling to afford day-to-day essentials, with over pound raised to date. The Causeway Coast and Glens councillor said the generosity from the community had been ‘overwhelming’. “Many in our community will have lost their income, seen businesses collapse and are facing increased living costs from being at home all day,” she said. “Families and others in our community will be struggling to put food on the table and pay their bills. I have been overwhelmed by the generosity from our community to help those in need. googletag.cmd.push “Despite the extensive measures put in place by Communities Minister, Deirdre Hargey, these are unprecedented times and there will still be many people who require help.” The funds will help people to purchase essentials such as groceries, sanitary items, electricity top ups and coal. Referrals to the scheme can be made to any of the Community Co-ordinators who are involved in the Community Coronavirus Response. The scheme provides support to those who are isolating at home and has tapped into strong community spirit in the area. Cllr McGurk also reiterated the call from the Executive for local residents to stay in their homes and adhere to the guidelines. googletag.cmd.push She said: “It is imperative that everyone continues to observe the social distancing and lockdown guidance issued by the Executive. “Monday saw the highest COVID- death toll here in the North since the beginning of the Pandemic, and we cannot become complacent. “I understand that it is an extraordinary ask of people to stay at home, particularlyyou are struggling financially and this is why I believe all elected representatives should work as hard as possible to alleviate the stress and strain of the lockdown. “I hope that the money I have helped to raise will be able to help some of my constituents with this.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Chloe Tinneyhas now set her sights on the real thing with plans to climb an ‘actual mountain’ in future. She managed the epic feat in  days to raise funds for her ‘heroes’ at Foyle Search  Rescue. Mount Everest is earths highest mountain above sea level. With the help of a few calculations Chloe worked out that she had to climb , stairs, , flights of her stairs, at a rate of  flights a day for  days. googletag.cmd.push The -year-old devoted herself to the task by iding her time wisely between her full-time job and conquering the stairs. Her ascent got underway on April  and it has been gruelling climb ever since. She has been hampered by a niggling repetitive strain injury to her knee along the way which was attributed to the left turn in the stairs. This meant she had to use a crutch for the vast majority of the challenge and cut out the turn to avoid aggravating the injury further. An astounding pound, raised so far for Foyle Search  Rescue more than six times her original target. googletag.cmd.push Speaking after reaching the summit yesterday, she said: “My leg injury has been feeling slightly better so I have been able to do the last  days without use of my crutch which is making it so much easier. “I also think my body has adapted to having to walk up stairs for  -  hours a day, every day because I am finding it easier every day. “That being said, I cant say it is something I will keep up,” she joked. “I cant wait to be done and have a little rest, maybe eat a pizza and have a glass of wine to celebrate being done with stairs. “Maybe Ill climb an actual mountain when this is all over  “I am genuinely so taken back and actually quite emotional about the generosity of everyone towards me during this time. From donating money to the amazing FSR, sharing posts, offering encouraging words, and so much more. Thank you just isnt enough. “I know the donation to FSR will mean so much to so many people and will definitely be put to amazing use to help all the folks at FSR continue to be heroes in our city.” Donations will remain open for another three days,you would support her cause visit:https:www.crowdfunder chloe-climbs-mount-everest-from-her-home  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It was recently announced that the Department for Communitiesfood box scheme was capped with an overall delivery capacity of , boxes per week across Northern Ireland and will be time bound. In terms of delivery to the Derry City  Strabane District Councilarea, full capacity has been reached and there can be no increase beyond the , of food boxes received. Currently, it is estimated that there is an existing demand of , Food Boxes which is  in excess of the current allocation and consequently a reserve list has been formed. googletag.cmd.push People Before Profit Cllr Shaun Harkin commented: I and many others arealarmed to be notied that the Department for Communities has capped the weekly free food parcel scheme for those shielding and in financial hardship across the North. We are calling for this decision to be reversed immediately. In Derry and Strabane , people have been accepted to receive a food parcel but the number has been articially capped here at ,.  people havebeen placedona reserve list with no guarantee they will receive food help. Its also been announced no further referrals will be accepted even though many people are not aware the scheme exists. This is discrimination and a breakdown in the departments duty of care for those in need. googletag.cmd.push Since the Executives decision to implement Tory welfare reforms our already high levels of deprivation have rocketed across the North. The clearest example of this was the rising dependence by many iniduals, familiesand workers on food banks. The Covid- crisis isputting many more people into financial hardship. Now is not the time to cut off access to the food program - funding should be increased based on need not on an articial figure thatunderestimates food poverty. The Covid- crisis has already forced many more people to apply for meagre welfare benefits. And many more people will be forced to applytheir jobs dont . With more people unemployed and dependent on benefits food poverty will increase further across the North. The Stormont Executive has the responsibility to make sure this is addressed. Political establishment parties are already talking about the need for austerity and hard choices - working people and the vulnerable should not be forced to bear the financial burden of this crisis. On April  the Department for Communities Covid  said its FoodParcelService has been hugely successful in getting immediatefoodand essential supplies to those most in need, with , boxes having been delivered to the  Council distribution centres in the three weeks since the service started. This service is part of the emergency response for those who are in critical need offoodand have no other means of accessing it, either through deliveries, or help from family and friends. A Department for Communities spokesperson said: “The delivery offoodparcelsto those in need was developed as one of the key strands of the Departments emergency response to the current crisis situation. The service has been a major success with a large number of boxes being delivered to those in need via partnership working between Councils and our grass roots Community Organisations. When theschemeopened it was envisaged that approximately ,foodparcelswould be needed, but due to the current situation the Department has delivered thousands more.” “Our current suppliers have now informed us that it not possible at present to go beyond a supply capacity ceiling of ,foodboxes per week. This is due to the sourcing offood, the capacity of suppliers to pack, prepare and distribute at volume – and additional limitations such as the need for social distancing requirements. We will continue to deliver to the thousands already receiving theparcelsand the Minister will be holding urgent meetings with officials to explore all available options.  “This service is one element of our overallfoodsupport programme, aimed at those who are in most critical need. People can also use the helpline to be connected to other means of support, including volunteers who can collect shopping, or community groups andfoodbanks who can provide support. For those people who still require access to such help contact the COVID Community Helpline on    in the first instance.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Michael McMullan tells the story of the Park mans soccer career... *** The weekends were always about football for Gerry McElhinney. Right from the beginning. And as much as he could possibly squeeze in. Gaelic football or soccer, it didnt matter. In January , in his mid-teens, he set off from the family home under the slopes of Sawel mountain. He walked a mile down the Barnes Road. Boots and gear at the ready, hed rest against the wall of the bridge in Park. googletag.cmd.push It was the start of a regular occurrence, waiting on the recently-formed Dungiven Celtic to collect him for the first game of a soccer career that would take him to Celtic, a career in England and the cusp of the  European Championships. “I used to walk down from Dreen, because you would never have found it, it was a little farm,” McElhinney begins. His GAA career would earn him an all-star at the age of  in his first season with Derry seniors in . In  of a family, six boys and five girls, football was always the game of choice in the fields around home, with the neighbours joining in to bolster the numbers. googletag.cmd.push From the rural Moneyhaughan Primary School, he moved on to St Patricks and St Brigids in the nearby village of Claudy. Hughie Doherty was on the teaching staff and passed on his fascination with sport. The schools gym was a haven for youngsters after school. Basketball, Gaelic football or soccer. It didnt matter. Indeed, it was often after six oclock before McElhinney ed home. “Hughie was the guy who got me to Dungiven Celtic. I was  at the time and I played in goals for them,” said McElhinney. Derry City had withdrawn from the Irish league and before they became affiliated with the League of Ireland in the s, they operated in the realms of junior football. It wasnt long before McElhinney joined them. He recalls how hard it was to get around at the time during The Troubles, but he always found time for sport. “I wouldve played football seven days a week,” he said. After an outing for Derry City in the morning, Saturday afternoon would revolve around Dungiven Celtic and before he had played for Banagher on Sunday, McElhinney wouldve fitted in a game with Dungivens Sunday morning league team. He was the oldest in the house and it wasnt he until was  that the family home had electricity. The first game he saw televised was the  FA Cup replay. David Webbs injury time winner for Cha over Leeds and a Cha kit received as a present swayed him towards supporting the blues. Performances at the heart of Derry Citys defence brought him to the attention of the other club he supported – Glasgow Celtic. *** Jock Steins right-hand man in the Celtic dug-out was Sligo man Sean Fallon, who scouted players such as Kenny Dalglish and goalkeeper Packie Bonner, Steins last signing as Parkhead boss. “When I played with Derry City, there were some Celtic scouts watching. They were a brilliant club...Sean was assistant manager, but he knew all about Donegal, he had scouts all around there,” McElhinney recalls. They liked what they saw and their  year-old target was invited for trial and was snapped up on a semi-professional arrangement. McElhinney would fit it in around work and was given time off to spend the summer in Glasgow. He played on and off for a season with the clubs reserves. While he was trying keep trim for the boxing back home under Jim Noonans eye in Draperstown, Stein insisted their new signing needed to put on weight. McElhinney was stuck in the middle. “I stayed in a hotel, near Hampden Park, and I used to travel into training every morning. My diet, every other night, was four pints of Guinness in the hotel,” McElhinney joked, having put on a stone and a half. “By the time I came back from Celtic to play for Derry I had went welterweight to middleweight. Arthurhad something to answer, it was very good protein.” Gerry didnt force himself into the first-team at Parkhead, but rubbed shoulders with many future Hoops legends in the reserves side- names like Bobby Lennox, Peter Latchford and George McCluskey. During nearly two hours on the phone, his level of detail is staggering. He never forgets a name. From the Derry players he played with, the soccer battles he had and right down to those he worked for during his summers in America. “A lot of the time, especially in the bad weather, the Celtic first-teamers would playto keep themselves fit,” he continued. At the time, Billy McNeill had left the club. Roddy McDonald was on the books and they brought in Roy Aitken, who would go on to captain the club and win the league and cup double in . McElhinney was surplus to requirements, but his career was far from finished. It was time to head back home, but his career was only beginning. *** Gerry hit the brakes, but nothing happened. The car skidded on the black ice, careered across the road and over the hedge. “Therell be no Castle the night Jim,” Gerry offered, when the car eventually came to a stop. He was referring to the infamous Dungiven night spot and the Jim was Jim McGroarty. McElhinney was dropping him off in Lettershandoney on their way back from a Finn Harps game. “I had to go and get towed out,” McElhinney remembers. “My da was going mad because it was his car and I was in the bad books for a while.” He was on loan from Parkhead to the Harps. He had one game under his belt in centre midfield against Shamrock Rovers, before regular goalkeeper Gerry Murray got injured. In their hour of need, they turned to McElhinney. “I had played in goals for Dungiven and Patsy McGowankicked a few balls at me under lights in a car park in Ballybofey and reckoned I would be a good goalkeeper.” He was never going to stay in goals. Goalkeeper Packie Bonner used the rough and tumble of the Donegal club GAA scene to toughened him. Coming for crosses was a breeze. McElhinney was dferent. Heplayed a dozen games between the posts for the Harps, but wasnt for him. Boredom set in. He missed the banter of being stuck in the middle of a game. “We did alright, we beat Bohemians on a night when I got man of the match and we had some good times,” he said of this time at the club. This spell came during Gerrys GAA career with Derry and during the summer hed jet off to America for work and play a bit of ball. During his time in Philadelphia, he played with FC Berne and he had trials with Chicago Sting. But as  came to a conclusion, so too did his time in the US. *** When Annie McElhinney answered the phone and a thick Scottish accent filtered down the line, the first thought was that Celtic were back in the hunt for her sons signature. It wasnt, but it was an opportunity to kick-start a soccer career that had been parked. It was the voice of Distillery manager Gibby McKenzie. On hisfrom America, Gerry had written to a few clubs askinghe could get a trial. Distillery were the only club to take notice. “Right big man,you want to come and play for us, you can come and play for us,” McKenzie bellowed down the phone. At the time, they had no ground and shared with Brantwood in Antrim. McElhinney got Kenny Shiels and Eugene Young involved in the club. “At that stage, Distillery pretty much finished bottom of the league every season,” Gerry recalls. “Martin ONeill had gone by the time I got there. I played there for a season and done really well.” McKenzie was replaced as boss by Bertie Neill as manager. He arranged for McElhinney to have a trial with English top-flight club Bristol City, who had Joe Royle on their team. “I played against Vancouver Whitecaps, it was a friendly. We drew - and I thought I did fairly well,” Gerry adds. Manager Alan Dicks was impressed by what he saw, but with the clubs financial situation and so many of the squad on long-term contracts. His hands were tied. “I was that down in the dumps, so I decided to go back to America. I came back again at Christmas and went back to Distillery,” he continues. With a good pre-season under his belt, he was playing well and impressed a Bolton Wanderers scout during a friendly away to Drogheda in July . Within a week, McElhinney and Neill were on a plane over to Bolton.  Gerry in his Bolton kit “I played a friendly against Bury FC. It was - and I done quite well and they more or less signed me straight after the game. “Bolton bought me for a fee that rose to around pound, after I had played a certain amount of games and lined out with Northern Ireland. Distillery moved to their new stadium in Lisburn, got the greyhound track and built that big wall. They reckon my transfer paid for that wall. They were really good to me.” *** Anytime Northern Ireland Billy Bingham came to see Billy Hamilton play for Burnley against Bolton his heart mustve been in his mouth. Gerry McElhinney didnt stand on ceremony. He gave as good as he got. During his first two seasons at Bolton, the international call never came despite being on the standby list for the squad in the build-up to the  World Cup in Spain. “I broke my toe. It had came through my boot and I was injured and wouldve never been fit,” McElhinney admits. Later in his Bolton career, after ing from a -game spell at Rochdale, he forced himself into the first-team and his form earned him an international call-up, with the  European Championships around the corner. Seven games came and went, with McElhinney yet to make an appearance. Their last game was against West Germany, who they had beaten - in Belfast thanks to Ian Stewarts goal earlier in the campaign. With Hamburgs Volksparkstadion filling to an attendance of over ,, Billy Bingham decided to reshuffle his deck and took his Derry contingent to three. Martin ONeill was joined by Paul Ramsay for his second appearance and dropped Chris Nicholl at the expense of Gerry McElhinney for his debut at the age of . Gerry remembers Bingham giving him the news: “Youre playing big man, get yourself sorted out,” he was told. “I didnt think that much about it at the time, it was just a game. You have to understand that I wouldve travelled anywhere for a game of football,” McElhinney said. Just to spice it up, he was up against captain Karl-Heinz Rummenigge who had six goals to his name during the campaign, but the Park mans early tackle laid down a marker. After  minutes, Northern Ireland grew in confidence much to the frustration of the home fans. Early in the second half, Harald Schumacher failed to hold an Ian Stewart effort and when Ramsays shot was blocked, Norman Whiteside fired them into a - lead. McElhinney was part of the back four that thwarted the Germans and on the one occasion they threatened to beat goalkeeper Pat Jennings, Jimmy Nicholl cleared the ball off the line from Lothar Matthaus shot. For four days, Northern Ireland led West Germany by three points in the one qualying spot. “They had a game in hand against Albania to qualy and a win would put them through on score dference,” McElhinney can remember. Their chances were not out of their own hands. The Albanians took an early lead, only for Rummenigge to immediately level the game and with  minutes to go, Gerhard Stracks goal ended their qualication dreams. “After that, I played for Northern Ireland in the Home Championships and we were the last winners of it in ,” McElhinney adds. In the first game, they were - winners over a Scotland side that included Roy Aitken. McElhinney nearly score a third and after the game the Scots manager Jock Stein admitted to McElhinney that he shouldve kept him on at Celtic. *** By Christmas of , Bolton were in the third tier of the league and their bank accounts didnt make for pleasant reading. Aside from a squad of kids, McElhinney and Jeff Chander were the only senior players they could sell to help their plight. “He went to Derby County and I went Plymouth. Bolton got a combined total of pound, and it kept them afloat. Even though they had been relegated from the first ision, they were still getting really good crowds. “They lost a lot of players, with them not being given contracts. Nothing has changed with Bolton, they still have got no money.” During his four years at Plymouth, McElhinney was captain for two seasons as they gained promotion to the old second ision. In his first season,  , he helped tighten up their defence, helping them begin their climb – beginning with a - win over Bolton early in his spell. The following year, Argyle were promoted in second place. ”We beat Bristol City in a mid-week game to seal promotion. Reading won it, we were second and Derby County came third,” McElhinney remembers. His Gaelic career was beginning to take prominence back home and after steering Gortin to the final of the Tyrone senior championship – a game be missed due to Boltons pre-season – he transferred back to Craigbane. “A lot of the guys who sign for Plymouth never leave that area. It is a lovely and Cornwall is on your doorstep,” explains McElhinney, who had the opportunity of following his promotion winning manager to picturesque Torquay. “I was coming home, every now and then, playing Gaelic football on the sly. To come home and play, I had to drive from Plymouth to London to get a flight home. I thought Id move a bit closer, so I moved to Peterborough.” When Peterborough gained promotion in the  season, Gerry was the youth team coach before moving to non-league Corby Town for two seasons at the end of his career. Gerry now lives in Draycott, near Derby where he currently works in construction. He is still fanatical about sport. He is also a guest at Bolton on match-days days and takes part in an open mic question and answer session. “Plymouth get me down too, I am part of the Plymouth Argyle legends and I got my free tie,” he laughs.

Michael McMullan tells the story of the Park mans soccer career... *** The weekends were always about football for Gerry McElhinney. Right from the beginning. And as much as he could possibly squeeze in. Gaelic football or soccer, it didnt matter. In January , in his mid-teens, he set off from the family home under the slopes of Sawel mountain. He walked a mile down the Barnes Road. Boots and gear at the ready, hed rest against the wall of the bridge in Park. googletag.cmd.push It was the start of a regular occurrence, waiting on the recently-formed Dungiven Celtic to collect him for the first game of a soccer career that would take him to Celtic, a career in England and the cusp of the  European Championships. “I used to walk down from Dreen, because you would never have found it, it was a little farm,” McElhinney begins. His GAA career would earn him an all-star at the age of  in his first season with Derry seniors in . In  of a family, six boys and five girls, football was always the game of choice in the fields around home, with the neighbours joining in to bolster the numbers. googletag.cmd.push From the rural Moneyhaughan Primary School, he moved on to St Patricks and St Brigids in the nearby village of Claudy. Hughie Doherty was on the teaching staff and passed on his fascination with sport. The schools gym was a haven for youngsters after school. Basketball, Gaelic football or soccer. It didnt matter. Indeed, it was often after six oclock before McElhinney ed home. “Hughie was the guy who got me to Dungiven Celtic. I was  at the time and I played in goals for them,” said McElhinney. Derry City had withdrawn from the Irish league and before they became affiliated with the League of Ireland in the s, they operated in the realms of junior football. It wasnt long before McElhinney joined them. He recalls how hard it was to get around at the time during The Troubles, but he always found time for sport. “I wouldve played football seven days a week,” he said. After an outing for Derry City in the morning, Saturday afternoon would revolve around Dungiven Celtic and before he had played for Banagher on Sunday, McElhinney wouldve fitted in a game with Dungivens Sunday morning league team. He was the oldest in the house and it wasnt he until was  that the family home had electricity. The first game he saw televised was the  FA Cup replay. David Webbs injury time winner for Cha over Leeds and a Cha kit received as a present swayed him towards supporting the blues. Performances at the heart of Derry Citys defence brought him to the attention of the other club he supported – Glasgow Celtic. *** Jock Steins right-hand man in the Celtic dug-out was Sligo man Sean Fallon, who scouted players such as Kenny Dalglish and goalkeeper Packie Bonner, Steins last signing as Parkhead boss. “When I played with Derry City, there were some Celtic scouts watching. They were a brilliant club...Sean was assistant manager, but he knew all about Donegal, he had scouts all around there,” McElhinney recalls. They liked what they saw and their  year-old target was invited for trial and was snapped up on a semi-professional arrangement. McElhinney would fit it in around work and was given time off to spend the summer in Glasgow. He played on and off for a season with the clubs reserves. While he was trying keep trim for the boxing back home under Jim Noonans eye in Draperstown, Stein insisted their new signing needed to put on weight. McElhinney was stuck in the middle. “I stayed in a hotel, near Hampden Park, and I used to travel into training every morning. My diet, every other night, was four pints of Guinness in the hotel,” McElhinney joked, having put on a stone and a half. “By the time I came back from Celtic to play for Derry I had went welterweight to middleweight. Arthurhad something to answer, it was very good protein.” Gerry didnt force himself into the first-team at Parkhead, but rubbed shoulders with many future Hoops legends in the reserves side- names like Bobby Lennox, Peter Latchford and George McCluskey. During nearly two hours on the phone, his level of detail is staggering. He never forgets a name. From the Derry players he played with, the soccer battles he had and right down to those he worked for during his summers in America. “A lot of the time, especially in the bad weather, the Celtic first-teamers would playto keep themselves fit,” he continued. At the time, Billy McNeill had left the club. Roddy McDonald was on the books and they brought in Roy Aitken, who would go on to captain the club and win the league and cup double in . McElhinney was surplus to requirements, but his career was far from finished. It was time to head back home, but his career was only beginning. *** Gerry hit the brakes, but nothing happened. The car skidded on the black ice, careered across the road and over the hedge. “Therell be no Castle the night Jim,” Gerry offered, when the car eventually came to a stop. He was referring to the infamous Dungiven night spot and the Jim was Jim McGroarty. McElhinney was dropping him off in Lettershandoney on their way back from a Finn Harps game. “I had to go and get towed out,” McElhinney remembers. “My da was going mad because it was his car and I was in the bad books for a while.” He was on loan from Parkhead to the Harps. He had one game under his belt in centre midfield against Shamrock Rovers, before regular goalkeeper Gerry Murray got injured. In their hour of need, they turned to McElhinney. “I had played in goals for Dungiven and Patsy McGowankicked a few balls at me under lights in a car park in Ballybofey and reckoned I would be a good goalkeeper.” He was never going to stay in goals. Goalkeeper Packie Bonner used the rough and tumble of the Donegal club GAA scene to toughened him. Coming for crosses was a breeze. McElhinney was dferent. Heplayed a dozen games between the posts for the Harps, but wasnt for him. Boredom set in. He missed the banter of being stuck in the middle of a game. “We did alright, we beat Bohemians on a night when I got man of the match and we had some good times,” he said of this time at the club. This spell came during Gerrys GAA career with Derry and during the summer hed jet off to America for work and play a bit of ball. During his time in Philadelphia, he played with FC Berne and he had trials with Chicago Sting. But as  came to a conclusion, so too did his time in the US. *** When Annie McElhinney answered the phone and a thick Scottish accent filtered down the line, the first thought was that Celtic were back in the hunt for her sons signature. It wasnt, but it was an opportunity to kick-start a soccer career that had been parked. It was the voice of Distillery manager Gibby McKenzie. On hisfrom America, Gerry had written to a few clubs askinghe could get a trial. Distillery were the only club to take notice. “Right big man,you want to come and play for us, you can come and play for us,” McKenzie bellowed down the phone. At the time, they had no ground and shared with Brantwood in Antrim. McElhinney got Kenny Shiels and Eugene Young involved in the club. “At that stage, Distillery pretty much finished bottom of the league every season,” Gerry recalls. “Martin ONeill had gone by the time I got there. I played there for a season and done really well.” McKenzie was replaced as boss by Bertie Neill as manager. He arranged for McElhinney to have a trial with English top-flight club Bristol City, who had Joe Royle on their team. “I played against Vancouver Whitecaps, it was a friendly. We drew - and I thought I did fairly well,” Gerry adds. Manager Alan Dicks was impressed by what he saw, but with the clubs financial situation and so many of the squad on long-term contracts. His hands were tied. “I was that down in the dumps, so I decided to go back to America. I came back again at Christmas and went back to Distillery,” he continues. With a good pre-season under his belt, he was playing well and impressed a Bolton Wanderers scout during a friendly away to Drogheda in July . Within a week, McElhinney and Neill were on a plane over to Bolton.  Gerry in his Bolton kit “I played a friendly against Bury FC. It was - and I done quite well and they more or less signed me straight after the game. “Bolton bought me for a fee that rose to around pound, after I had played a certain amount of games and lined out with Northern Ireland. Distillery moved to their new stadium in Lisburn, got the greyhound track and built that big wall. They reckon my transfer paid for that wall.

Their feathers are just too bright. And when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice. Still, the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that theyre gone.”  - Morgan Freeman as Red in the Shawshank Redemption Netflix delivered a gem to the sporting fraternity recently in the form of The Last Dance, a behind the scenes documentary following the Chicago Bulls during their six NBA titles in eight seasons during the s. It was casual watching and not needing much concentration, but interesting on a range of dferent levels. googletag.cmd.push The footage of Michael Jordan was just enthralling. His demand for the highest of standards turned around the fortunes of the underperforming Bulls. His brilliance gave him locker room clout beyond his newcomer status. His power to jump and score was sizzling. When he leapt off the court, he was a genius. The Bulls went from winning just over a third of their games to pushing for glory and he was named as Rookie of the Year in his first season. As the series began to pan out, it was centred around three main players and their personalities – Jordan, Scottie Pippen and later Dennis Rodman. googletag.cmd.push Tangled in the storyline was Scottie being grossly underpaid for what he was offering the team. It led to a fallout with the franchise General Manager Jerry Krause. One glance at Dennis Rodman made me think more about team dynamics. He is the ultimate maverick. He came from a broken home but somehow escaped the drug culture that passed by in front of his eyes. The day he lted a basketball saved him. A family friend saw enough to tip off a local school basketball coach and it was his passport to college and eventually the Detroit Pistons. The Pistons were labelled the bad-boys of the NBA. They got into teams faces and under their skins and they developed nasty rivalry with the Bulls. Rodman morphed into one of their most influential players and built up a terric relationship with coach Chuck Daly. So much so, than when Daly – a father figure almost – resigned, Dennis went off the rails. He was a troubled inidual and demanded a transfer. He also dated music star Madonna who convinced him that he needed to express himself and be who he wanted to be and not how others wanted him to fit. HUNCH After a spell with the San Antonio Spurs, Rodman moved on to the Bulls. It was a gamble. The club hierarchy went on a hunch that Dennis would be safe due to the presence of Jordan and Pippen and how they would steer and inspire him. The other factor was the most important – coach Phil Jackson. They knew he could handle him. A glance at Rodman and he is not your everyday player. Tattoos, jewellery all over his face and a hairstyle that changes day on day. Even on one occasion, he had bleached all through his hair, to mark his teammatesto the court from injury. Rodman made me think of that line from the Shawshank Redemption. The one Red mutters when the innocent Andy is on the the brink of escape – some birds are too beautul to cage. And Rodman knew his worth. “Youve got the great Michael Jordan, the great Scottie Pippen and the greatPhil Jackson...you take me away from this team...do they still win the championship  I dont think so,” was one of his comments during the documentary. Everybody  knew it too. In  when the Bulls were chasing their sixth title, Rodman requested some leave time in mid-season and was granted  hours. As Jordan expected, Dennis went AWOL in Las Vegas and they had to go to get him back. Onto training, Jackson put the Bulls through their paces to blow the black smoke out of Rodmans system from his time off the rails. The old fashioned back to the front runs. During laps the player at the back had to sprint to the front, all the way around the court. The GAA pre-season drill from hell. The Bulls players plotted to take it easy on Rodman -and themselves – by keeping the pace low. But when it was his turn, their colourful colleague blew them away and they spent the the rest of the session chasing him. They didnt need to worry. His natural fitness levels could absorb time away from training. The support structures around him were strong. He was motivated by winning and coach Taylor understood the concept of not everyone being the same. Some birds are too colourful to cage. Welcome the concept of the maverick. For the manager in team sports, it can be easy to pigeon hole everyone into the same category. That way, you have a simple set of rules andsomeone steps out of line, the pre written rules leave the decision to omit someone easy. “At the start of the year, everyone knew the story,” would be the narrative. But not everyone is the same. Why should they be  The challenge is how to manage on a dferent scale. Some need a kick up the ass, some need an arm around the shoulder. But in a team scenario, not everybody fits. If someone is too disruptive, has nothing to offer the team and wont meet the coaches rules somewhere in the middle – then cutting them loose is the only option. I remember chatting to former Dungiven manager Jim McGroarty a few weeks ago. He uttered a statement along the lines of...anyone can throw down a load of cones and copy drills off their phone and call themselves a coach, but management is about so much more. He is so right. Having not covered a game of sport since St Pius won their MacLarnon semi-final, watching sport on television has been filling the gap. It has also led to a period of reflection. If we are lucky enough to get through all this, sport should resume in a better place –team managers have also used their time to reflect and not just find a better way of playing  or  men behind the ball. Gerry McElhinney waltzing through the heart of the Dublin midfield, Maradona tearing strips of the England defence in  and Michael Jordan dunking shots with his back to the basket - these are the people who build a legacy. They are players who will inspire and –managed properly - are the dference between a team being average and great. Without them, sport is dull. These are the players teams need to revolve around. Development should not be about seeing now many athletes you can find that can handpass with perfection and follow out orders. Anyone could do that. Dennis Rodman and the mavericks out there need to meet the team ethos halfway down the path. If they dont, then you can say you tried and agree to go your separate ways. If they understand the word compromise, then so too should the manager. If they cant dferentiate between their ego with the ego of others, they shouldnt be managing.

This follows commitments made by ministers over the weekend that the government will meet with the two representativebodies for publicans over course of the coming week.As part of their discussions with the government, the two organisations will be pressing for pubs to reopen at the same time and on the same basis as cafes and restaurants. Recognising the challenge of maintaining social distancing in a hospitality environment, the organisations will also be putting forward radical changes to the normal operations of barsin order to protect public health.These measures include: googletag.cmd.push • Bars will become dispense bars only with no sitting, standing, ordering, payment or drinking at the bar allowed. • Table service will be a requirement with pubs only serving customers seated at tables. • The numbers on the premises would be confined to no more than  per every  square metres. • A maximum of  people would be permitted at any one table. • Customers will be required to use hand sanitiser upon entry. • All customers must remain seated. • Staff will be fully trained in the new procedures. They will also be asked to maintain a safe distance from customers when taking orders and to wash their hands thoroughlyevery  minutes. googletag.cmd.push • The utilisation of outdoor spaces to enhance social distancing. • Procedures implemented to ensure safe use of toilet facilities, which may include limits on the numbers using toilets at any one time. • No live music or DJs. Speaking about the proposed measures, Donall O’Keeffe, Chief Executive of the LVA said, “We fully respect the need to continue to protect the public health. We have repeatedlyproven this commitment, not least in the fact that our sector was the first to close across the country. We also believe thatother venues who serve food and alcohol are allowed toreopen in Phase , then pubs should be granted the same opportunity to trade. We don’t believe it is in any way appropriate that the Government should apply one rule for somehospitality businesses and another rule for others.“We are making a series of radical proposals to how bars should operate for the reopening scenario. Trading will be extremely dficult under these circumstances. There is no doubtthat the pub experience as we know it will have to change dramatically. Many pubs may choose not to reopen as it simply won’t be financially viable under these conditions.However, for those who want to trade, these measures will have the essential impact of protecting the health and wellbeing of staff and customers alike,” Mr. O’Keeffe said.

Plans have been put forward to construct the new footbridge as part of a proposal to extend Derrys popular quayside walk and cycle path. Derry City and Strabane District Council has applied for planning permission to build the footbridge across an inlet close to the Fort George site. This would allow the quayside walkway to be extended into the Bay Road area. There are also plans to create a new three-metre wide cycle walking path along Bay Road to link in to the Bay Road Park. Derrys quay has been revitalised in recent years and the latest proposal looks set to continue the regeneration of the riverside area. googletag.cmd.push The plans for the new footbridge and walkway are now being considered by the local councils planning department. Meanwhile, a new cycling champion role has been created to encourage more people to get on their bikes in Derry. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon this week announced a new walking and cycling champion with a focus on transforming communities and developing creative solutions to support a new way of living during and post COVID-. “Our champion will ensure that we deliver our commitment to increase the percentage of journeys made by walking and cycling. Inspiring our communities, restructuring our spaces, changing forever the way we live – and changing it for the better,” said the Minister. googletag.cmd.push “I want to increase the space available for people who want to walk and cycle by extending pavements, pedestrianising streetsand introducing pop up cycle lanes. I have already identied someparts ofBelfast City Centre and Derry city that can betransformed in this wayand I intend to work with councils to identy more areas across the North as a matter of urgency. Changing how we use our spaces will transform communities right across Northern Ireland – creatively change lives – enable social distancing and encourage health and mental wellbeing. “Thisenvironmental and public healthwork will be done on a collaborative basis, with an action group, formed from both within and outside government. I also want to work in collaboration with communities, including identying and creating ‘Quiet Streets’ where pedestrians, cyclists and play have priority and motor vehicles are guests,” added Ms Mallon. “As the Executive looks this week to review thelockdown – we all need to be looking ahead – out of the darkness of this pandemic and into a better world that we need to build for ourselves. Greener, cleaner, healthier and happier people and places must be our aim as we learn to live with this new normal during and after Covid-.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The full nature of the financial crisis facing the local council was made public for the first time today. In a report by senior council officers brought before a special meeting of the council, it was stated that the council is currently incurring losses of around pound, per month as a result of the closure of facilities and services. The local authority is also having to cope with additional waste management costs and exceptional emergency expenditure as a result of the coronavirus crisis. googletag.cmd.push The council report stated: This will likely be worsened following the first quarter as the impact of the pandemic hits Council’s rate-base and the current rates relief scheme for business comes to an end. Whilst a regional bid is currently being considered by Central Government, this has not yet been confirmed and may only part fund some of the financial loss being incurred. At this point, it is therefore clear that reserves will not be adequate to fund Council services for the year ahead and Council will be in a position of insolvency by September .  googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Like all of us, hersquos patiently waiting for when thingsto normal and travel is possible again.ldquoI definitely havenrsquot spent more than at couple of weeks at home since  when my father George died, explains Tim. ldquoItrsquos a real shame that I canlsquot really enjoy everything that Co Down has to offer, but at least home is a good spot. Myself and my mother enjoy going out for a walk along the Quoile river every now and then.The third of four children, Tim has an older sister, Heather, and two brothers, Michael and Pat. Their late father was a highly respected lawyer, who became a county court judge.Ash, the band Tim founded in  at the age of  with fellow Down High School students Mark Hamilton, also from Downpatrick, and Rick McMurray, from Killyleagh, exploded on to the Britpop scene in the mid-s. Known as one of the softer alternative rockpop bands, Ash put Downpatrick well and truly on the music map. Along with the success of the Papenfus brothers, Kenneth and Carl, with their band Relish, and local rockers, The Answer, it was a golden age for music for the town and district.Tim and the band have been recording and touring ever since, having recently embarked on a European tour to support their new specially compiled album, Best of Teenage Wildle ndash  years of Ash. Coming in a combination of vinyl, a special  CD with an  rare track CD, Teenage Wildle has charted well so far, coming top in both the UK and Irish Independent Albums chart and th in the UK Album chart.When President Donald Trump closed the US airports in March, it could not have come at a worst time for the band in promotional terms.Tim explained: ldquoWe were in the middle of European tour in February and everything was just gradually grinding to a standstill. At that time, I did thinkI didnrsquot leave for New York soon there was a chance that I wouldnrsquot get back for two to three months.ldquoBut our UK dates were the following week and they still hadnlsquot been cancelled. I felt that I didnrsquot have a choice so we stayed and we spent three days driving to Hamburg to a gig which got cancelled on the day. We travelled back to the UK and then the tour dates got cancelled the day before the first show was meant to have been held. It was too late for me at that point to get back to the US so I came back to Northern Ireland and stayed at my sisterrsquos place for a week before I went to Downpatrick.While he is enjoying his downtime in Downpatrick, rehoning lyrics to songs he first started several years ago, Tim is naturally concerned about when andhe will get back to New York.ldquoIrsquom technically a temporary resident so Irsquom worried about getting back to the US as Irsquom not a citizen or permanent resident. I was planning to move to London in July as we have a recording studio there with a lease ending soon and we need to move equipment out over the next few months. Thatrsquos all a big question mark now. Irsquove been in New York for  years and would like a chance to say goodbye to everyone.Although the change of pace is dferent at home compared to New York, both are close to Timrsquos heart.ldquoThe number one thing about New York that I love are the people. Itrsquos such an amazing mixof cultures. It has so much energy to the place. The pace is really fast, itrsquos endlessly interesting, he said.ldquoBut Irsquove always been comfortable about coming back to Northern Ireland. We are surrounded by woodland and the Quoile river. When the sun shines, therersquos nowhere better in the world. I like going between the two extremes, itrsquos a really good place to be writing, reading and walking around.Tim recently connected with the world of music globally when he broadcast a live performance from his Downpatrick home to raise money for struggling musicians and artists impacted by the coronavirus lockdown. Organised by the Performing Rights Society , which pays royalties to members when their work is performed in whatever , Tim was one of  big names who took part.He started off with a rendition of his hit, Girl From Mars, performed with an acoustic guitar, and played Shining Light, which he won an Ivor Novello award in  for Best Contemporary Pop Song, finishing off with Teenage Kicks by Derry band The Undertones.ldquoThat felt really good and I felt really connected it was good seeing all the comments coming up, said Tim. ldquoBut to be honest, it was nerve-wrecking doing a broadcast from home as the internet is not too good here. Normally on stage you would have fears of your equipment failing but I was just thinking I hope that this internet does not cut out. If the phone rings the home, the internet cuts out. I was praying that no one would ring my mum in the middle of it.ldquoIt just dawned on me while I was singing Shining Light that I had written it in the same room where I was broadcasting from. Irsquove written a lot of good songs in that room.He joked at how long it normally takes him to release new music and how he is still working on songs he wrote several years ago.ldquoThe guys and I have been chatting a lot still and Irsquove been sending them song ideas and discussing things but I really wish we could get into a rehearsal room and jam through the stuff. Maybe we will get to do that in a few weeksrsquo time.ldquoItrsquos going to be interesting to see what new music comes out from artists after the lockdown but Irsquom always on a bit of a lag with new stuff as by the time Irsquove written a new song and wersquore recorded it, itrsquos three years later. The good thing about this time is that itrsquos given me an opportunity to finish a lot of lyrics where I just didnrsquot have time before. Irsquom wrapping up a lot of songs that I started in , so expect our coronavirus album in .Hersquos disappointed, as are local fans, that the bandrsquos planned Belfast gig has had to be postponed until at least the autumn.Best of Teenage Wildle is available now for streaming on ious s and to purchase from Ashrsquos official website store https:store.ash-official .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Ballycran.jpg","title":"Ballycran members sewing scrubs for frontline workers  ","story":"SCRUBS made by a group of women from St Josephrsquos GAA Club in Ballycran are now being worn in the Belfast Nightingale Hospital and several local nursing homes and medical centres.The colourful easy wash garments are brightening up NHS nurses and care workers as they look after patients and residents during the coronavirus lockdown.Some lucky frontline staff are wearing Manchester United scrubs or Paws Patrol made from themed duvets.Mrs Marguerite Fowler, sister of club chairperson Shane Gilmore, is co-ordinating the cross-community effort.The core group of sewers are Pamela McGourty, Brenda Coyle, Madeline Bell, Ann Moan, Anne OrsquoBrien, Madeline Branf, Caitlin Savage, Fiona Gilmore and Geraldine McGrattan. However, more sewers are coming on to help out as word spreads about the initiative.The club put out a call for people to help with the sewing and donations of material and were overwhelmed with the response.Mrs Fowler explained that the group came about after she was approached privately by some peopleshe knew anyone who could provide scrubs.ldquoWe started at the beginning of the month and so far we have made scrubs for four nursing homes, including Barrhall Residential Home in Portaferry, and supplied scrubs to Loughview Medical Centre in Kircubbin and Ballywalter Health Centre.ldquoWe have also supplied scrubs to nurses at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast and the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald as well to nurses in the Nightingale Hospital in Belfast City Tower Block through my sister-in-lawrsquos niece who is a nurse. We are now filling orders from Positive Futures, a group who visit people with learning disabilities who vulnerable, in their own homes and had absolutely no protective gear. They find scrubs are so much easier to wash and dry than their own clothes.She said that while the GAA club put the initial call out for help and donations of material, it was very much a community effort.GAA clubs in Portaferry and Ballygalget have also donated duvets sheets and other items, already washed and ready to sew.ldquoWe are also very excited about a delivery of brand new fabric, funded by a grant negotiated by Iain Bell from Kircubbin and District Community Association and we thank him for his generous help.Scrubs provided are free of charge, but the group do like to see photographs of staff wearing them afterwards.Mrs Fowler said the group are able to take requests for specic sizes which might otherwise be dficult to get and they can be contacted via the Ballycran Facebook page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Community.jpg","title":"Community allotment group looking for new volunteers  ","story":"TUCKED away in a corner of the New Model Farm housing estate in Downpatrick is an oasis of calm amidst the turmoil of the coronavirus pandemic.Downpatrick Community Allotments has gone from strength to strength since its launch a number of years ago and there is also a healthy and particularly thriving apiary.With so many people confined to home as part of the the governmentrsquos lockdown directive, the group behind the allotments is keen to recruit new volunteers to help with their upkeep.Those responsible for the allotments are hoping that people will come forward to get involved in and enjoy the many benefits of working on the plots, especially at a time when the focus is very much on looking after your mental health.That the allotments can continue to operate is due to the fact the strict regulations in relation to social distancing are rigorously enforced, with the focus not just on the health of the plants and vegetables being grown, but also of all those tilling the land.Indeed, the community allotments initiative is a success story which continues to blossom and has transformed what was once an area of wasteland into a thriving hub which is also making a positive contribution to the environment and the lives of those who use it.Developed by the Downpatrick Community Collective mdash an umbrella group for a number of community groups across the town mdash the allotments have become a blooming success in more ways than one thanks to the horticulture skills of the volunteers who have learnt new skills and gained confidence as a result.A vibrant and growing community initiative has firmly embedded itself in this part of Downpatrick and continues to flourish, thanks to the hard work and dedication of the volunteers. Only last month, all the hanging baskets produced at the New Model Farm site sold out.Locate at the site are two poly tunnels, flower beds and vegetable patches cocooned into a corner of the housing estate, with the apiary also a big hit with beekeepers who have honed their skills with the help of the Killinchy Beekeepers.Allotment holders and groups using the site regularly produce an array of fresh vegetables, flowers and bedding plants, while the beekeepers are producing their own delicious honey which is in its natural state with no additives.Sean Clarke, who is the chairman of Downpatrick Community Allotments, says there is nothing like working in the great outdoors, filling your lungs with fresh air and clearing your mind.ldquoAll our plots are currently taken but we are looking for new volunteers, he explained.ldquoWhen one of our plots does become available, it is snapped up immediately. Some of the townrsquos residentsrsquo groups have taken plots and we are delighted to have a mix of all abilities working at the site.ldquoThere is great camaraderie and we have our very own gardening guru mdash Stephen Harris.ldquoHe is brilliant to have around the place and has an encyclopaedic knowledge of gardening which is being passed on to the volunteers. Stephen once had his own landscaping business and is more than happy to share is extensive knowledge with us.Downpatrick Community Allotments now has its own Facebook page packed with photos and information about what is happening at the New Model Farm site with the social media page helping generate wide interest in what is going on there.ldquoMany people have come along to learn gardening skills including seed planting, propagation and how to fill hanging baskets and it is clear to see their enthusiasm. It is great to be outdoors and enjoying the benefits of physical exercise and fresh air, Sean continued, revealing that within three days of all the hanging baskets produced going on sale they sold out.Given the focus on greater public health awareness as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, all the equipment at the allotments is sanitised before and after use and social distancing regulations are enforced across the site, both at the allotments, in the poly tunnels and apiary.ldquoEveryone is always two metres apart and due to the size of the allotments, three people can work comfortably at the same time, while adhering to the social distancing guidelines.Sean is a great believer in how working at the Model Farm site is good for mental health and said there are many studies which back up his assertion.ldquoPeople really get a lot out of seeing the flowers and vegetables they plant growing and there is always a great buzz about the place. The allotments can certainly help people destress, especially in the current climate.It was planned to bring along a chef to the allotments so the volunteers can learn ious ways they can cook their fresh vegetables and while this has had to be put on hold, it is something Sean is keen to see happening when the pandemic is brought under control and the current lockdown regulations are relaxed.He added: ldquoWe are hoping that we may be able get a chef in around September, but that will depend on the current restrictions being eased.For further information on Downpatrick Community Allotments pay a visit to the grouprsquos Facebook page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Council.jpg","title":"Council has no plans to lay off current staff  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has this week insisted that it has no current plans to lay off staff.The confirmation comes after Antrim and Newtownabbey Council confirmed last week that it was planning to make a number of employees redundant, with  jobs affected.However, officials subsequently deferred a decision on  positions, but  agency staff are to be let go due to funding pressures during the coronavirus pandemic.Defending its decision to cut jobs, the council said it had faced an ldquounprecedented financial challenge due to signicantly reduced revenues following the closure of public facilities.It also confirmed there has been ldquono confirmation of any additional funding being provided to councils from government and the UK-wide furlough scheme is not expected to be used by local authorities.While the planned job losses are subject to negotiations with trade unions, Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey made it clear that she will not support actions of councilsthey do not respect and protect workersrsquo rights.The minister said that each of Northern Irelandrsquos  councils mdash including Newry, Mourne and Down.ldquoI call on councils and other employers to do all in their power to safeguard jobs so that when the current restrictions are lted, those very workers can contribute to the economic recovery that we will so badly need, she remarked.The Northern Ireland Local Government Associationmdash the umbrella body for the provincersquos  councils mdash said councils were facing ldquoshort and long-term financial pressures like never before.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that no decision has been taken in relation to reducing staff number ldquoat this time.Former NILGA president and Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos announcement.ldquoThese are unprecedented times and the local authority has lost a signicant amount of income given the closure of leisure and community facilities across the district, he said.ldquoVarious staff have been redeployed across the organisation and at these terribly dficult times, they are working to maintain services with others playing key roles in helping to deliver food packages to residents across the district.Cllr Curran said he would not want to see anyone losing their job and hopes the local council will continue to work hard to make sure this does happen anywhere within the organisation.ldquoNo one could have predicted the situation we now find ourselves in, he continued. ldquoItrsquos important that the public plays its part, stays at homeit all possible and when out, exercise social distancing to help protect the HNS and save lives.ldquoMany people have lost their jobs through no fault of their own and I hope that in the not too distant future, lockdown measures will start to be eased to help rebuild the local economy and people can get back to work.He added: ldquoThis will not happen overnight, but the more we obey public health advice now, the sooner the lockdown can be eased..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Evan.jpg","title":"Evan and mum raising dough for charity during virus lockdown  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE woman and her little son have been busy baking tasty treats on social media to help raise money for a local mental health charity since the lockdown began.When Pauline Smyth was forced to close the doors of the Blue Bay Cafe in Dundrum due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus, she and two year-old Evan took to baking some of their favourite recipes.For almost four weeks, the pair have stirred, sted and simmered their way through a mountain of ingredients, making everything from pizza pin wheels to Portuguese custard tarts and posting snap shots of their combined efforts on the Blue Bay Cafe  Bakery Facebook page, along with the recipes.Pauline says Evan loves to help out, especially when it comes to making doughnuts.

the town.Superintendent Brendan McGuigan has appealed to local people not to react to rumour or innuendo and to ensure common-sense prevails at all times.The police chiefrsquos comments come after a second week of serious assaults which left one local man requiring hospital treatment for sustained severe head injuries, inflicted during a vicious attack at the Bishopsbrae area.Mr McGuigan has also highlighted an incident when a family were forced to flee their Leaside Gardens home in the Flying Horse estate after a malicious blaze.In addition, two other young men were bundled into a car and taken to the Steamboat Quay area at the Quoile River where they were assaulted.Two weeks ago, an ongoing feud between two Downpatrick families was blamed for a shooting incident at the Vianstown Park area in the town and an assault on a woman in Church Street.Mr McGuigan says he is concerned at the number of recent events, which include a local family having to be rehoused in emergency accommodation, and claims they paint a very wrong picture of the county town.The police chief said the sequence of recent events does nothing to enhance Downpatrickrsquos reputation and said people who live in a civilised community must accept the rule oflaw.DUNDRUM ndash A Dundrum man confronted a skinhead burglar in his home during the early hours of Monday morning and forced him to flee the Church Avenue house.The owner was asleep at am when he was disturbed by the intruder whom he chased out of his home.But the burglar, who is described as five foot  inches tall and believed to have been wearing a grey sweatshirt and jeans at the time, made off with the keys of the manrsquos Peugeot car which he stole.The car has still not been traced and detectives investigating the incident have issued an appeal for information.In particular they want to hear from anyone who was in the Church Avenue area during the early hours of Monday morning and witnessed any suspicious activity.Police also want to hear from anyone who knows the whereabouts of the missing Peugeot car.SEAFORDE ndash A Seaforde woman has been appointed to chair Northern Irelandrsquos conservation

that as chairwoman she wants to make the council more open and has invited the public to contact the council through its secretariat.ldquoIf people want to contact us with their ideas they can do so by writing to Syril Francey, CCNC secretariat at Hill Street in Belfast.The CCNC is an advisory body which advises the Department on matters affecting the natural beauty of Northern Ireland.Mrs Browne, who has an OBE for her work in the commercial environment sector, said: ldquoThe statutory duty of the council is to look after nature reserves, such as the Quoile Pondage and other areas of natural interest.BALLYHORNAN ndash A recent lucky escape for two stranded jet skiers off Ballyhornan coast has once again drawn attention to the need for safety precautions on local beaches.The pair,

Proceeds of this yearrsquos event will be donated to the Northern Ireland Hospice and Marie Curie Cancer Care.Jenny Adams, the showrsquos joint secretary, says the commemorative booklet is a good account of how the show has evolved over the years.ldquoIt is certainly interesting to see the role it originally played in improving the standard of farming in the Killyleagh, Killinchy, Kilmood and Tullynahill areas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Collins.jpg","title":"Goalkeeper Collins selects his all time greatest Down team  ","story":"THE early s saw ato the glory days for Down. The county was a footballing powerhouse once more, landing two All-Ireland titles in the space of three years and the players secured their place in GAA folklore.An immovable force was their goalkeeper Neil Collins. He thwarted Meath in the  and in  memorably saved a penalty from Dublin danger man Charlie Coleman.Now a youthful , Neil began his football career with Ballymartin and then with Drumaness. But he is best known for his association with Carryduff. He broke into the Down senior  in  and remained in the squad for ten years.He remained a dedicated servant of Down long after his playing career ended. He managed the county U- team for three years, was goalkeeping coach of the senior team for six years and also a selector for three years when the team was managed by his All-Ireland-winning colleague, the late and much missed Eamonn Burns.Neil hasnrsquot included himself in his  greatest Down players, but for the others donrsquot look much further than his team-mates from the early Nineties.ldquoThese were the players I grew up with, so I have to stick with them. Irsquom too young to remember the Sixties, he says.ldquoI had a great time with Down. Obviously the highlights were winning the two All-Irelandrsquos, but I have wonderful memories of the people I played with and all the friendships.ldquoThanks to WhatsApp I am in contact with them every day. We had the th reunion of the  team in Dublin last year and we also got together to remember the th anniversary of the Loughinisland tragedy.ldquoThey are a great bunch of lads, but you canrsquot put a foot wrong, otherwise you would be pulled up very quickly. Pat DonnanPat was goalkeeper for the Down minors which won the All-Ireland title in  and was goalkeeper for the senior team for many years. He was a great keeper and became a mentor to me. He took me under his wing and made me a better player. He was also generous with time and advice. A great goalkeeper and an even greater man. Miceal MagillThis is the most dficult pick. It was between Miceal and Brendan McKernan, but I have gone for Miceal, largely because of his performance in the  final which won him the Ulster Bank Man of the Match award. He had a fantastic game and never let Charlie Redmond get away from him. He was always comfortable with the ball and could read a game well. Conor DeeganConor was a tremendous athlete and he could take on the oppositionrsquos biggest players. He always seemed to get on top of his opponents and I never once saw him roasted. He had terric hands and he could read a game as well as anyone. He always encouraged those around him. He was a true team player. Paul HigginsPaul was as hard as nails and he was also the quickest player in the squad, even faster than Mickey Linden. He dominated and bullied his opponents and he had great strength of character. John KellyMy Carryduff clubmate and a ruthless, nasty player in the best possible way. He was the sort of player nobody wanted to mark, whether in a match or in training. He would put his head where others feared to put their feet. Barry BreenAnother double All-Ireland winner. I first played with him at the Red High. Barry always seemed to have time on the ball. He played at a dferent level to everyone . What set him apart though was that he could play with his head up and see what was going on. He was always looking for someone off the ball. DJ KaneOur captain in  and an inspirational leader. DJ was one of the most competitive players I have seen in my le. He would not lie down and did not know what it meant to be beaten. It was win at all costs and he was someone you needed when things got bad. Gregory McCartanA massive character both on and off the pitch. Gregory kept the craic going in the changing room and in the bar afterwards. But he was also a tremendous footballer. He could take a free with either foot. He put money on himself to get the first score in the  final, which he did. Eamonn BurnsAn absolute gentleman, but a warrior on the pitch. He was quiet and unassuming, but had everything you wanted in a player. He scored two sublime points in the , which we won by two points, so he played a huge part in getting us over the line. His death came as a great shock. He is a much missed colleague. Ross CarrA Rolls Royce footballer. He had a wonderful left foot and was one of our two main free takers. Ross had a massive amount of inward drive and challenged us all to perform to the same high standards which he set for himself. Greg Blaney . Quite simply the best player I ever played with. He had it all. He was a brilliant ball player who made the forward line tick. He was always looking to play in James McCartan or Mickey Linden and wasnrsquot worried about scoring himself. An absolute team player. Gary MasonA superb free taker, particularly when under pressure. He never failed us. In June  he played for Down against Monaghan. It was the day after the Loughinisland tragedy. He must have been under enormous mental pressure and anguish, but he put on a massive exhibition and was man of the match. Mickey LindenWhat can you say about Mickey  He was an absolute flying machine and totally dedicated to Down football. He was still playing county football at the age of . A player of exceptional ability and one of the nicest men you could meet off the pitch. Peter WithnellA big, strong one-man wrecking ball. He would hit opponents very hard and early on. Peter brought something dferent to the team and his game fitted in well with the players Down manager Peter McGrath put around him. Many of their scores came about because of him. James McCartanConfident and aggressive with the ability to find space where he had no right to. Every time James got the ball, there was a buzz in the crowd. He was man of the match in the  All-Ireland final. He went on to manage Down and took them to the  final.Substitutes: Brendan McKernan , Aidan Farrell , Liam Austin , Ambrose Rogers Sr , Ciaran McCabe ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Heather.jpg","title":"Heather coaching the kids  ","story":"A COMBER soccer coach is keeping local children on the ball mdash despite the coronavirus shutdown.Heather Kerr normally coaches primary school children, but now she is passing on her skills online and on social media.Heather, a player and coach with Comber Ladies and an Irish FA staff member, admits it can be a challenge keeping children active and entertained in the current lockdown, but she believes she has the answers.Heather is also a key member of the IFArsquos Electric Ireland Shooting Stars programme aimed at young girls and she says keeping it fun is the key to keeping kids engaged with their extra-curricular activities.ldquoItrsquos all about making sure that they are having fun while learning something new, she says.ldquoEven though your little ones arenrsquot getting out on the pitch they can still be trying out new skills at home.Heather has been involved in football since an early age and was inspired by her dad, who was a coach.ldquoI started volunteering with the youth section of my local club, Comber Rec when I was , and Irsquove been involved in some sort of coaching ever since, she explained.ldquoI completed a weekrsquos work experience with the Irish FA around this time too and I really got a taste of all the dferent aspects of what is involved in football development.ldquoOver the years I worked through my coaching badges and recently completed my A Licence.ldquoI have been coaching in primary schools for the Irish FA since .

I havenrsquot been running for a few years now but I was persuaded to get up off my rear end and try to mark the th anniversary of the postponed London marathon due to be held on the very appropriate th April by running or walking or generally moving over a distance of  or . miles or kilometres.And having sorted out a route around my garden, estimated to be  metres long, I worked out that  laps per mile would be achievable over the five days specied mdash i.e. I could walk  laps to count as . miles. And I also asked my friends for some sponsorship towards the Cure Parkinsonrsquos Trust . I am hugely indebted to everyone who contributed towards this charity, and raised pound. plus pound. Gt Aid. Which reminds me I must go and finish the last eight laps.At the top end of the sport, international marathon runner and Rio Olympian Paul Pollock, while naturally disappointed that the Olympics have been postponed until , feels that it could well prove to be a blessing in disguise in his case at least.He reasons that it will give him an opportunity to concentrate on clocking up stress-free miles in training, enabling him to recover from old injuries and come to the competition, for the first time ever, in the best shape of his le.Portaferry star Ciara Mageean, Irelandrsquos greatest hope of an Olympic track medal since the halcyon days of Sonia OrsquoSullivan, is also disappointed, having been, as she says, in the form of her le, but, like Paul, will continue with her planned training regime and sees it as an opportunity to build up her strength and thus make up the ground on her nearest rivals.Eoghanrsquos viewNewcastlersquos Eoghan Totten, who aspires to taking part in a future Olympic Games as a marathon runner, in a recent interview published in the Athletics NI webpages said: ldquoWhen I recorded a : personal best over the half marathon in Barcelona in mid-February, the virus was relatively undocumented in Europe.ldquoBy mid-March, I understood that I would not be racing for a long time. My biggestfear was that there would be a blanket ban on exercise. Nonetheless, the sanctions under which we are all living have forced me to reconsider the spirit in which I run. I decided that I would follow lockdown protocol as strictly as possible to do my part.Double runshave always been a staple part of my training, allowing me to hit the high mileage required to prepare for the marathon. Completing the same mileage across the week off one daily training session was initially challenging. However, I eventually adapted after two weeks of attrition. In the process, I learned that I benefit from the extra recovery time between runs. This pleasant surprise helped me come to terms with what seems like a more or less empty race calendar in .I can understand that many of you will be disappointed not to be running the Belfast Marathon this weekend, but your chance to do so will come around again in the future. Anyone who is brave enough to step on the start line of a marathon is a special type of person, irrespective of fitness. More so those who run to raise money for a cause. It takes courage to do this. Bank that courage and build on it over the coming months.Athletes are creatures of habit. We are conditioned to race on a monthly or two-monthly basis. Having the options restricted has enabled me to focus on the process of training without looking too far ahead. It has reminded me that, despite thriving off pushing to my limits in races, I love the journey, equally as much.ldquoYes, it is all about achieving in races, but also, to get there a long time is spent training . So we have to love the training too.Right now, I have to wait. We all have to wait. Runners are resilient. Focus on whatever training you can do right now and enjoy the journey.ldquoTo those friends and family in the health service, who have been tackling the virus over the past six weeks, I am amazed beyond words. Thank you for what you are doing.Club updateThese words echo the sentiment of all of us and we commend all key workers who have been put in the front line in the course of their work. We have many EDAC members who are in that position and we send them our best wishes.So what of the last six weeks  The clubrooms were closed with immediate effect and the committee advised all members of the governmental advice to stay home and stay safe. The only good news was that there was no ban on exercising so long as training was done solo or in household groups.It may seem crass to be concerned about the ability to train when there are much bigger issues at stake, but it is well known that sticking to some routine is beneficial in keeping mental health in good order and anything which allows us to be positive will help us to cope with the situation that has evolved.Most have been taking daily exercise as prescribed by the government as it is already a part of our daily routine. However, because of the restrictions on movements and associations and the change of routine for many, whether through being laid off work, working from home, working for NHS at the coal face so to speak, or any of above combined with the added dficulties of home schooling kids of whatever age, it means that many runners are no longer free to go for a run whenever they chose or indeed will have to make signicant changes to their daily routine to fit it in.Some have turned their daily run into a practical outing where they canessential items to those who are shielding. Others have managed to combine their exercise with fund raising for charities involved in the frontline or for organisations who will see their funding hit by the economic fallout of the pandemic.Our juniors could be forgiven for thinking this is an unexpected long summer break, but they report back from time to time to log that fact that they are knuckling down to home schooling while using exercise to take a break.Jarlath and Anna Kearney have committed to a daily .k run, Mackenzie and Ky Murray have been out with their dad, Dee, making sure he doesnrsquot slack. Mackenzie even recorded an unofficial K PB this week.Ollie and Alex Robinson have the good fortune to be able to train as a family and they push each other as well as mum Marguerite. It is no surprise that dedicated athlete Lauren Madine is training away in between exercising the horses. Others such as Emily Burns have opted to cross train.If baking was an Olympic event, there would be a few EDAC records set there too by the sound of things. Tik Tok also seems to be a favourite occupation with some slick dance routines doing the rounds. The one thing that is clear is that our juniors miss their club mates but that physical exercise in any form is a big help. We are proud of our juniors for this mature approach and urge them to continue their efforts.Virtual challengesSome of the races that have been cancelled have then gone ahead in a virtual form, the Titanic K being one. Runners were invited to run a solo K on any course near their home and record the time.Three EDAC runners claimed the reward mdash a T-shirt and medal in the post. Gareth Reilly was the quickest of the trio, posting a -minute time. Hallie Jennings stole a march on Donal Smith by a couple of minutes mdash  minutes to his  mdash but with all runners doing dferent courses it was mainly for fun.Also for fun and the motivation to keep going was the Galbally Runners April Challenge. A simple concept where each runner chose a target of ,, or  miles etc and then had a month to complete. Evidence was submitted by Strava or fitness watch records.Kelly Smith and Donal Smith blew their goals out of the water with totals over  miles each. Marguerite Robinson, Hallie Jennings and Suzy Smith broke  miles in their inidual sessions and Alison Carroll completed a conservative  miles to start a new regime. They all agreed that it was a good way to keep base fitness. Buffs are apparently in the post and thanks are due to Galbally Runners for sorting this.Some runners were racking up the miles and others were thinking of improving speed. Jimmy Sloan has been following a programme which is hard without club members to egg him on, but he has been very successful nonetheless with a new K PB of .. All times are, of course, unofficial as they are not on measured courses but they are a good indicator of form.Jimmy was taking part in the NHS Run , Donate , Nominate . Many of our members will have taken part and the fun can be in nominating friends who would hate to run five km, let alone five miles mdash they canrsquot really refuse when it is for such a good cause!Every club has its mile munchers and in normal times Phillip Vint would see a weekend without a marathon as a waste of a free day. Like others, he has had to get used to a new normal, but when the weekend of the postponed London Marathon came round, he couldnrsquot resist setting off on a . mile course close to home to mark the day.No crowds to cheer him on and no sights of London to entertain him en route, but he was glad that he had the health to complete it. Predictably with the Belfast Marathon also called off, he repeated his endeavours seven days later and clocked another marathon with ease.The best bit is that the finish line is his own back door so no painful walk back to get the car or the train. He was straight to the sofa in seconds and recovery could begin.Donal Smith was to have completed his inaugural marathon at Belfast , as was his daughter, Kelly. Again their hard training seemed lost without a cause, but they had followed the programme to the letter and felt that they needed to test the waters.They set off to give it a rattle and coped well with the dry run of the full marathon distance. They were delighted to get the odd toot and cheer as a substitute for race day atmosphere and they received hearty congratulations when they posted their achievement on social media.While it would have been nice to have friends and family there to greet them at the finish line, it just means that they will have the incentive to do it all again when an official Belfast Marathon can eventually take place. At least they know that they can cope with the mileage and surely with the crowd support it can only be easier Last, but not least, EDAC ultra man himself Keith Reilly has been thinking up ways to raise money and satisfy his need for a challenge at the same time. He decided that his lockdown event would be a treadmill ultra and that he would appeal for funds for NHS Charities Together.He managed . miles running in hourly shts which is no mean feat on a treadmill and logged his th ultra marathon. He was delighted to announce a total of pound, for the frontline workers dealing with Covid- patients. A good dayrsquos work all round.So there you have it from both ends of the scale mdash what the top runners think and do and what the rest of us do. Not a lot of dference really is there  Letrsquos all continue to play by the rules and hope for better times.

on the latest phase of a mains gas pipe-laying scheme.The Recorder revealed last week that Phoenix Natural Gas has seized the opportunity to make the most of the coronavirus lockdown by bringing forward work on the scheme in the resort as part of its poundm investment programme across East Down.Work started last week at the Dundrum Road and Railway Street junctions with Main Street, with contractors switching attention to a stretch of road between the Railway Street junction and Castle Bridge, adjacent to Newcastle library, from this week.Next Monday, it is planned to lay a section of mains pipe between Castle Bridge and the Bryansford Road junction, while seven days later, contractors will be laying pipework along the Bryansford Road, between the Central Promenade and Shimna road junctions.This particular part of the scheme concludes with a pipe being laid between the Bryansford Road and Bryansford Avenue junctions at Shimna Road.Work in the town centre was scheduled to start towards the end of the year, but Phoenix officials have been working with the Department for Infrastructure to identy areas where pipe-laying could be brought forward in order to avoid further disruption to traders, visitors and residents.Phoenix says it understands that Covid- has had a signicant impact socially and economically across the region and hopes that by expediting its works in Newcastle, it can utilise the lockdown period to not only avoid further disruption later in the year, but enable more people to have access to fuel choice before the winter period.The works will involve one lane closure mdash rather than a full road closure mdash with traffic management plans also in place and Phoenix aiming to utilise underground drilling equipment where possible.In addition, the company insists that its work will not impact on Newcastlersquos granite paving which was part of the resortrsquos multi-million pound public realm scheme completed a number of years

implementation of additional operational procedures, in line with government guidance.ldquoWe will continue to review the appropriateness of this activity on a daily basis to ensure that it remains the best solution for the local area.Confirmation that Phoenix Gas is carrying out the work in the heart of the resort when it is anticipated that there will be less traffic, has been welcomed by two local politicians, South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Mournes councillor Laura Devlin.Mr McGrath said he appreciates that for many, the ongoing roadworks across East Down ldquohas been a complicated time, but is pleased that the company is now able to carry out additional works in the Newcastle area, much earlier than planned.Cllr Devlin said that while many aspects of le are currently dficult

in her stride mdash almost.The  year-old Portaferry runner, who is currently holed up in Manchester, says the current restrictions arenrsquot that far removed from her normal training regime.Even so, she says there are days when she does not want to run and she also misses her family and friends back at home.ldquoWersquore all struggling mdash therersquos days I donrsquot even want to go out and run now, and that the thing I have to do and the thingI always look forward to, she said.ldquoTherersquos days Irsquove cried and been like, lsquoWhat the hell is this rsquo Irsquove chatted to my

Balance, Ciara lives in Manchester in the same house with fellow athletes Jip Vastenburg and Adam Craig. Right now shersquos spending a lot more time inside the house than outside.ldquoThankfully my training hasnrsquot changed hugely, but wersquore in the house an awful lot more. The whole season has disappeared, which is very strange because wersquore training without any real focus.ldquoWersquore all watching the news and seeing whatrsquos happening the world over, and wersquore all far away from our families.ldquoLast week Jip lost her grandmother and she couldnrsquot get home for the funeral mdash she had to watch it over Skype.Ciara is worried about members of her own family. Her elder sister, Myra, is a registrar at a hospital in Belfast, her younger sister, Nuala, is a nursing student, younger brother Brendan has volunteered to work in the Nightingale hospital in London and her mother, Catherine, also works in the NHS, while an aunt is a pharmacist. She also misses her boyfriend, who she hasnrsquot seen in a month.Ciara, who won the m bronze medal at the  European Championships and bronze again at the European Indoor Championships last year, happens to be in the form of her le.She improved on her own Irish indoor m record in January and smashed her personal indoor best at m a month later.Training and events were geared towards the Tokyo Games this summer but the Olympics have been pushed back to  because of the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoIrsquom feeling in fantastic shape so itrsquos a little frustrating - we had the whole season planned out, she said.ldquoEven down to the training camps you were going to go on, down to the very day that I was going tointo the Olympic village and then the day that I would possibly leave the Olympic village.ldquoIt is quite tough because all of those plans are all scuppered, itrsquos all up in the air and we donrsquot know when wersquore going to be able to start racing.ldquoThe circuit doesnrsquot have a clue when theyrsquore going to be able to race - it depends on when countries allow more movement and, ultimately, does anybody know ldquoIrsquom not going to feel too sorry for myself because I know therersquos an awful lot of people out there that are in a much harder place than me.In a recent interview with RTE Ciara revealed something about how she is coping with the coronavirus restrictionsQ Whatrsquos the first thing you do in the morning A At the minute when I wake up Irsquove been giving my boyfriend a wee call to say good morning. Irsquom not quite sure when Irsquoll get to see him next as Irsquom in Manchester and he is in Dublin so itrsquos a nice way to start my day and always puts a smile on my face.Q Whatrsquos your favourite exercise A Oh I feel like I should say running, as I am an athlete, butI was to think of my favourite it would probably be a few things. I do miss playing a team sport so probably camogie, I absolutely loved dodge ball in school sothat was an option Irsquod pick that, and I do enjoy my gym workouts getting to lt weights.Q Is there one particular skill you practice every day A Running, every day! Running is a gross motor sport so fine skills arenrsquot really a part of my daily training, but I do work on dferent areas of my fitness every day. I have to work on things such as flexibility and fine muscle control every day to keep myself injury free. In the athlete house though we have been honing dferent skills while on lockdown, trying out dferent Tik Tok dances, press ups, and trying to get our eye in with the sling shot in the back garden!Q Netflix and chill or a nice evening jog A Both, usually we have an evening run, easy four miles... then we chill and watch a movie after dinner. We have had to mix training up a bit with the changes but in an ideal world we get both in.Q Name one book you want to read.A Irsquom making my way through a few Malcolm Gladwell books. I love coming away with new information and enjoy a book that challenges my thought process. Then when I need to flake out Irsquod pick something like A Man Called Ove. Soanyone could recommend books like this to me theyrsquod be on my ldquowant to read list.Q On a scale of  to , how good are your DIY skills A Ohhhh, Irsquom going to give myself an . -  here. My daddy is a joiner so I spent my le watching him make and fix things, and soon learned the names of tools and how to use them. I do know my limits though so I stay away from the plumbing... luckily in Portaferry my dad has a lot of friends who are alsotradesmen so they all help each other out.Q Have you a favourite pre-training meal to help you through a tough session A We usually train in the morning so I tend to eat an OTE DuoBar, the vanilla flavour in my favourite, and a cup of tea. When it come to racing in the evening, something easy to digest is usually what I go for... rice is always a winner.Q Name one movie you want to watch.A , I was planning on watching it in the cinema before the lockdown.Q Whatrsquos the best way to stave off boredom A Oh as a full-time athlete I feel Irsquove been preparing for lockdown for years. My le is basically train, eat, sleep. For me therersquos a few things I enjoy. I love chatting with my family, Irsquom usually on WhatsApp most of the day chatting or messaging and keeping in touch. I also love arts and crafts, Irsquoll be making postcards to post to my boyfriend and siblings to make them laugh, and currently my little cousin is teaching me the guitar via WhatsApp. She is a tough taskmaster, I have a lesson every Thursday and Monday and homework in between so that keeps me busy Q Have you any tips for training at home A Set yourself some goals that you can realistically achieve from home. We are allowed out for our daily exercise so you can get some cardio in outside, find a route that works for you and follow the guidelines. When it comes to working out inside, have fun. Find new alternatives, there are so many exercises we can do with body weight, or with stuff we have about the house so be creative and have a bit of craic. If you need any ideas check out social media, so many people are sharing home workouts. Give yourself a plan or schedule and try to stick to it. Being home means we can fall into the habit of sitting about and it can be hard to feel motivated. At the beginning of each week set out your plan for the week, what day, what time, and what exercise. Write it down and stick it somewhere you can see. Creating a routineduring these strange times means we can take back a little control.Q Name one documentary you want to see.A Anything with David Attenborough, I absolutely love animals and nature, and could listen to his voice all day.Q Have you discovered any new music or podcasts A My music taste is so ied but my wee sis and cousin Tara introduced me to Beoga and I absolutely love it. A lad from my hometown, Ryan McMullan also features in some of their songs, always a nice surprise hearing a weePortaferry accent as Irsquom listening.Q Is there one piece of housework you can no longer avoid A My own room! I actually enjoy housework, everywhere but my own bedroom. Irsquoll clean all day but canrsquot be bothered with my own mess!Q Favourite room of the house to spend time in A We are lucky that the Team NB Manchester athlete house is lovely and has lots of space so my favourite room ies depending in the time of day. In the morning my bedroom gets lovely light, it makes me smile sitting there chilling. Then when I want a bit of company the front room or kitchen is where we chill as a team and have the craic... andthe sun shines, which it does on the odd occasion over here, we have a lovely garden.Both Jip and Adam are enjoying learning how to puck about with my hurl..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Recycling.jpg","title":"Recycling facilities to reopen  ","story":"THE districtrsquos household recycling centres could reopen next week.Located in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch, the centres closed at the end of March in line with the government directive to help reduce the spread of coronavirus.The Recorder understands that the sites will reopen, provided Newry, Mourne and Down Council can satisfy itself that the move can be managed safely and there is no risk to the public or frontline staff.Mid and East Antrim Council has already opened its recycling centres and Stormont environment minister Edwin Poots recently published guidelines aimed at paving the way for waste centres across the province to reopen.The reopening is expected to be discussed at todayrsquos virtual meeting between senior council officials and the leaders of the main political parties.Members of the local authorityrsquos senior management team are currently evaluating theenvironment ministerrsquos guidelines and developing a staff plan to allow the reopening to proceed in a safe way.In addition, officers are liaising with their recycling contractors, a number of whom have furloughed staff. The contractors are responsible for removing waste from all  council amenity sites, with early suggestions that it could take at least one week to ready themselves for reopening.With strict guidelines in relation to social distancing remaining in place, council officers are looking at the potential risks of reopening the sites and the required measures to mitigate them, with suggestions that ratepayers may have to book a slot to visit.Police and other statutory bodies, including the Department for Infrastructure, along with neighbouring councils, are also being consulted about reopening the sites.Council officers have suggested the recycling sites will open in a ldquophased manner and that certain restrictions will apply. Discussions with trade union officials are also planned.This Friday, the Northern Ireland Executive will review the current coronavirus regulations which could pave the way for the reopening of recycling centres not just in the local council area, but across Northern Ireland.Local councillors Willie Clarke and Billy Walker say Newry, Mourne and Down Council is right to carefully assess the guidelines published by Mr Poots and proceed with caution.They say the key importance is the safety of staff and residents, with the councillors suggesting that a visit to a civic amenity site would need to be classed as an ldquoessential journey under the current coronavirus legislation.Cllr Clarke says it is vital that the council approaches the reopening issue with caution, given that ldquocoronavirus is still rampant and people are dying.He continued: ldquoAny decision needs to be based on medical advice and direction from the Assembly.ldquoRecycling centres have not been classed as an essential service and people on their way to such a facility could end up getting stopped by police and issued with an enforcement ticket and sent home.ldquoThe council must ensure that all the Trsquos are crossed and the Irsquos dotted before the centres reopen. I understand there is a need across the community for this to happen, but my appeal to people is be patient for just a little longer.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoA phased approach to reopening the centres has been discussed by the party leaders. There is no point opening the centresthe contractors who remove the waste are not able to do so. A decision also has to be taken on what waste will be accepted at the sites in the short term.ldquoThe last thing we want is everyone landing at the sites, people getting out of their cars talking to one another and maybe not social distancing. People are still dying s a result of the virus and we must keep that in mind.Cllr Walker said that while many people have been cleaning their homes, garages and outhouses during the lockdown, the council needed to ensure that its civic amenity sites can reopen in what he described as a ldquosafe and proper manner.He added: ldquoWe need to manage the reopening process carefully and ensure there are not long queues of people waiting to use the centres, particularly in Downpatrick, Ballynahinch and Castlewellan, with tailbacks of cars spilling on to busy main roads.ldquoThe council does not want to put ratepayers at any risk and, in my view, is rightly proceeding with caution. It is not a simple case of opening the entrance gates and letting everyone in.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the decision to close the recycling centres is continually being reviewed in-line with government essential travel restrictions.ldquoThe council is currently reviewing this guidance and the implications it will present when it reopens the centres within the district, the spokesman continued.ldquoIf a decision is made to reopen the centres, residents will be informed via updates on the council website, social media channels and through local media outlets..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Ryan.jpg","title":"Ryan bakes tasty treats for heroic postmen  ","story":"SOME superheroes really donrsquot wear capes ndash they deliver the post.To honour the work of the often unseen heroes of the local postal service Ryan Bogues has delivered a hamper of his famous baked treats to the Royal Mailrsquos Downpatrick sorting office.The  year-old, who has Downrsquos Syndrome and lives in Teconnaught, has has to suspend his popular Ryanrsquos Cookie Box initiative, which he started over four years ago, because of the coronavirus lockdown.Ryan was praised by Prime Minister Boris Johnston last year for fundraising for several charities through his Cookie Box scheme where people donate money for his baked goods.Hersquos helped by his mother, Hazel, who explained a line in a recent speech from Taoiseach Leo Varadkar inspired them to think of local postal workers.ldquoMr Varadkar used the line lsquonot all superheroes wear capesrsquo and that struck a chord with us, she said.ldquoWe have had to close the Cookie box, but Ryan wanted to still help.
