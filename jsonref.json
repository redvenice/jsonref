I love the stark nature of the Icelandic landscape and its contrasts. Deltas form from glacial meltwater running down towards the shoreline, picking up silt and different materials along the way to create these ribbon patterns. There’s all sorts of wildlife too – birds, beautiful wild horses, seals.So a few years ago after a lot of research, cross-referencing Google Earth with books and photography by others, I took a red eye from New York to Reykjavik. It was kind of funny to take a jumbo jet, have three hours upon landing to rent a car, check into my hotel and nap for 20 minutes and then turn around to meet a pilot and spend the day up in the air again in his homemade plane.You can do all the research you want for these projects, but nothing compares to actually seeing things in person. Being in an airplane above that landscape was really magical. Emotional, even.At first, when you’re flying around in a tiny plane, opening the door and hanging out to take pictures, it’s a little nerve-wracking. You see your life flash before your eyes. But I’ve become quite comfortable doing it and am able to be extremely focused.We were looking for the birds – they are Arctic tern, or sea swallows. They are small and quite difficult to spot. But we found this flock circling very fast. We were flying above them at a safe distance. I’ve come to realise animals are actually not that intimidated by planes. There have been countless times we have been flying over flamingos or buck, seals, turtles, 100 feet above them – which is really quite low – and they just could not have cared less. .I knew exactly which terrain I wanted to capture the tern flying over: that patterning of white pebbles against the black sand. We circled several times until finally they lined up as perfectly as I could have asked for and I was able to get several shots.I started working in this way in 2009. I had just finished a two-week commercial job in Botswana and had a couple of extra days to kick around the area. Somebody knew a bush pilot who had his own plane and said: “This guy wants something to do.” On a whim, I said, “Sure, that’d be fun.” I had seen the world from 30,000 feet up, but this was completely different – we were in this ultra light aircraft, flying low over a vast mud flat. When it rained, the water would pick up dirt and silt. And when it dried it created really interesting patterns, things I wouldn’t have been able to see if we’d been flying even just a couple of thousand feet higher. It was an incredible experience and set me off on this path.What attracts me to aerial photography is that point, at a certain elevation, where the line between abstraction and reality blurs. I never show the horizon because it’s an obvious giveaway, a point of reference. I want to create an image that works on multiple levels and at multiple distances. Some aerial photography looks like it could be a landscape, or something that you’re seeing under a microscope. I want you to know this was taken from the air.Animals are a good focal point. They’re recognisable, although I’m often showing them from a point of view people aren’t familiar with. Here, it’s a bit like a layer cake, you have the flat earth, the birds flying above it, and you’re above it all. I like playing with the way the lens flattens this multi-level, three-dimensional space – the sense of scale, the textures, the distance.The fact that I’m moving through the same space as the birds is one part of the story that the image doesn’t tell,. But it is important for me. Everything is at play, the movement of the ocean, the implied movement of the birds. There’s a connectedness between the living and the moving, to make a beautiful, harmonious image.Training: Photojournalism at the SI Newhouse School of Public Communications, Syracuse University.Influences: Jackson Pollock and Joan Miró.High point: “The shoot I did in South Africa in 2016: we covered about 2000 miles of ground, 45 hours of flying, in a week, never knowing where we would eat that day or sleep that night, landing on remote airstrips, following wildlife from tips from people we would meet along the way. It was a real adventure.”Low point: “Any time I’m not working.”Top tip: “Work your ass off. To be successful you have to put in a tremendous amount of hard work and not give up.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/912a1c98812e84cff30ac1138e3d726a0eff48dc/0_0_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eda5ec2239c3871076850d04d303499d","title":"search for british author of 50 year old message in a bottle washed up in australia","story":"South Australian man and his son found the bottle, which was dropped from an ocean liner by 13-year-old boy Paul Gilmore in 1969A South Australian man is trying to find the British author of a message in a bottle he found off the SA coast, 50 years after it was dropped into the ocean.Paul Elliot and his son Jyah told ABC radio they found the bottle on the Eyre Peninsula’s west coast recently while fishing.Elliot said he was looking for the author, Paul Gilmore, who described himself in the note as a 13-year-old English boy travelling on a ship along the southern Australian coast from Fremantle to Melbourne.The note is handwritten on paper with Sitmar Line’s company name at the top and is dated 17 November 1969.In it the teenager says he is travelling on board the Fairstar, a ship that brought many British migrants to Australia during the 1960s under the assisted passage scheme.The boy urges whoever finds the note to reply to him and gives an address in Melbourne.Oceanographer David Griffin said the bottle could not have remained afloat for 50 years off the south coast because “the ocean never stays still”.Griffin suspected that the bottle had been buried on a beach for years, then refloated by a storm.“If it had been dropped in anywhere in the ocean somewhere south of Australia, then there’s no way it’s going to stay actually at sea moving around for more than a year or two,” he told the ABC.The author gave his position as “1,000 miles east of Fremantle”.However, it is not clear whether the author actually meant 1,600 kilometres out of Fremantle, which would have included a journey south along the west coast before turning east.Last year, a West Australian woman found what is thought to be the world’s oldest message in a bottle.Tonya Illman found the 132-year-old gin bottle in the dunes near Wedge Island. Inside, she found a roll of paper printed in German and dated to 12 June 1886, which was authenticated by the Western Australian Museum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10d5a689c068f81909b559163b3baeca124aaa63/0_27_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c50caca1da9ddc51f64439a3376a63f","title":"boeing 737 max congressional hearing testimony","story":"Paul Njoroge warned at congressional hearing there will be more deaths unless action is takenA father whose five family members, including three children, died when a Boeing 737 Max jet crashed in Ethiopia in March, accused the company of “utter prejudice and disrespect” and warned there would be more deaths unless action is taken.Paul Njoroge’s wife, mother-in-law and three young children died when Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 crashed on 10 March, shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa. All 157 passengers and crew members aboard were killed.The congressional hearing in Washington at which Njoroge spoke comes in the wake of two fatal crashes involving Boeing 737 Maxes that killed 346 people and which have triggered investigations and lawsuits around the world.In blistering testimony, Njoroge said Boeing’s focus on share price and profits “at the expense of the safety of human life” and its cosy relationship with its US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), had led to the two crashes and cost him his family.In prepared notes, Njoroge wrote: “I miss their laughter, their playfulness, their touch. I am empty. I feel that I should have been on that plane with them. My life has no meaning. It is difficult for me to think of anything else but the horror they must have felt. I cannot get it out of my mind.”Unless Boeing’s conduct is addressed “another plane will e to the ground killing me, you”, Njoroge told Congress.Njoroge said Boeing had moved to blame “foreign pilots” after a Lion Air 737 Max crashed into the Java Sea in October 2018. He said Boeing’s insinuation of pilot error allowed it to keep flying the plane – and that led directly to the death of his family.As investigations have continued, it now appears that a software system called MCASs, which is designed to automatically prevent stalling, was central to both crashes.Njoroge said: “I speak for all of the families who lost loved ones whom they will never see again and who were tragically torn from their lives because of reckless conduct on the part of so many. Particularly Boeing, a company who became steadfast in its single-minded quest to place blame on so-called ‘foreign pilots’.”He went on: “In Canada, Independence Day was celebrated on 1 July. I stayed buried in my little house, in my grief, hearing the sounds of celebration and fireworks in the sky. But all I could think about was the 737 Max struggling to gain height and eventually ing to the ground, killing my whole family and 152 others.”Boeing’s fleet of 737 Maxes remain grounded. Last month, US regulators said they had found more problems with the airplanes after a simulator test, leading United and Southwest airlines to extend their bans on flying the 737 Max.The company appears to be planning to rebrand the plane before it is given the all-clear. This month, a 737 Max due to be delivered to Ryanair was photographed with 737-8200, instead of 737 Max, painted on its nose."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/082c4e59fefa11cbf22cc80c8d2e35e7933e088d/0_115_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2fa09152c4bcb5a229fca286d2472864","title":"city watchdog admits investment rules too complex for staff","story":"Angry investors at public meeting demand answers from FCA over financial scandals that have lost their moneyThe City watchdog has admitted that its rules are so complex that even its staff may not understand which investment products come under its jurisdiction.The chairman of the Financial Conduct Authority made the concession during a tempestuous annual public meeting in London on Wednesday, where consumers criticised the regulator for failing to protect them from a growing list of scandals.Attendees demanded answers over the collapse of London Capital \u0026amp Finance, which is now at the centre of a mounting £236m financial scandal in which more than 11,000 investors lost money. The FCA’s enforcement team was warned three years ago about the company, but failed to act.One victim claimed FCA staff assured her that dealings with LC\u0026ampF were protected by the regulator. But complex regulation meant that while LC\u0026ampF was authorised by the regulator, the mini-bond products it sold were not. It left investors unable to recover their cash through the Financial Services Compensation Scheme once the firm went under.One attendee challenged the FCA to be more proactive in training staff and explaining which products and services are protected – referred to as the “regulatory perimeter”.But the FCA’s chairman, Charles Randell, said that rules governing the regulatory perimeter are hard to understand, given how much they have changed over time. “It’s actually almost impossible to explain. There’s tremendous risk of confusion, either on the part of consumers, or … on the part of our staff. So it’s not a good situation and I’ll be the first to acknowledge that,” he added.“For many people in this country … unregulated investment, particularly high-risk investments, have absolutely no place in their savings and retirement planning. They’re not suitable products for people, and they should go in to those products with their eyes much wider open than the perimeter enables them to be at the moment.”Some of the nearly 350 people present turned angry when the FCA failed to extend the meeting, which lasted two hours, inciting a shout of “you’re running away” from one.Last month the FCA confirmed it would not punish either RBS or any current or former RBS managers, despite finding evidence of “systemic and widespread” mistreatment of small and medium-sized business customers between 2008 and 2013. The regulator said its powers were limited as business lending is not regulated in the UK.When asked what would constitute “criminal behaviour” in the GRG case, Bailey said the FCA introduced the senior managers’ regime in 2016, which aims to hold iniduals at the bank responsible when things go wrong. He stopped short of confirming whether any crimes would have been committed under the new rules, and stressed that the regulation could not applied retroactively."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f8625c0399879afa1a174b7eeb5542ce39d4eed/0_102_4928_2955/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba70d33d598a632a48030e51c02260f4","title":"klm airline tells breastfeeding women expect cover up","story":"Airline provokes outcry with response after woman says she was asked to cover herself with a blanketThe Dutch airline KLM is facing a storm of protest after warning that women who breastfeed their babies on its flights may be asked to cover up to avoid offending other passengers.The company’s policy emerged after a woman claimed on Facebook she had been asked to shield herself from view while feeding her one-year-old on a flight between San Francisco and Amsterdam last month.Shelby Angel, from Sacramento in California, said a flight attendant had approached her with a blanket, which she refused, saying she felt “uncomfortable and disrespected”.Angel said she always sought to be discreet but that her daughter did not like to be covered. After complaining to KLM she was told it was the airline’s official policy and that passengers needed to be “respectful of people of other cultures”.A KLM Twitter account later tweeted in response to the criticism prompted by the woman’s Facebook post, confirming that “to ensure that all our passengers of all backgrounds feel comfortable on board, we may request a mother to cover herself while breastfeeding, should other passengers be offended by this”.It added: “As an international airline company, we transport passengers with a variety of backgrounds. Not all passengers feel comfortable with breastfeeding in their vicinity and sometimes these passengers complain to the cabin staff.”The response has led to other airlines being asked on social media to explain their stance. British Airways said it did not have an official policy but that passengers who required privacy should “please speak with one of the crew when you are board”.KLM, which recently sought to burnish its credentials as an environmentally conscious airline by encouraging passengers to take fewer flights, has been accused of stigmatising mothers.Niki Kandirikirira, from the Equality Now lobby group, said: “Negative attitudes about breastfeeding in public stem from the over-sexualisation of women’s bodies. Breastfeeding is a totally natural process and women should have the freedom to do it wherever and whenever they want, rather than being forced to hide as if they are doing something inappropriate.”Physicians and health campaigners have expressed their frustration on social media at the “antiquated” policy of the airline.One doctor tweeted: “I find it uncomfortable and offensive when people chew with their mouths open, infinitely more so than breastfeeding. Can you cover up the heads of passengers who do so with a blanket? Thanks!”The World Health Organization recommends that babies be breastfed exclusively for their first six months, then have a diet of breast milk and other food until they are two years old.The NHS advises new mothers that breastfeeding reduces a baby’s risk of infection, diarrhoea and vomiting, sudden infant death syndrome, childhood leukaemia, obesity and cardiovascular disease in adulthood.Ayala Ochert, from the campaign group Better Breastfeeding, said: “In their effort to avoid offence in the tiny minority of people disturbed by the sight of a child feeding, KLM has instead chosen to offend a mother trying to feed and nurture her child.”The airline said in a statement: “We would like to emphasise that breastfeeding is permitted on KLM flights. However, we strive to ensure that all of our passengers of all backgrounds feel comfortable onboard.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1995e1ced8da89c5adc3f8658bbeee65dc423800/0_439_6588_3953/master/6588.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e1a626b9dad067291a13f36c02ecaa8","title":"northern rail could lose franchise after year of passenger misery","story":"Chris Grayling says company must improve after months of delays and cancellationsThe government could terminate the Northern rail franchise if performance does not improve, the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, said, after more than a year of misery for passengers.Northern has faced intense scrutiny over the past year as travellers have been plagued by delays and cancellations.Asked by MPs on the transport select committee whether Northern should be stripped of the franchise, Grayling said: “If Northern can’t deliver then of course we would look at all options.”He added: “I will not resile from taking away a franchise if it is the right thing to do and if I’ve got the contractual basis for doing so. We are watching and we will continue to watch very carefully Northern’s performance in all respects, and I expect them to deliver on what they have committed to deliver. It hasn’t been good enough up to now.”The government has faced repeated calls to strip the franchise from Northern, which is part of Arriva Group. Arriva’s ultimate owner, German state-owned rail operator Deutsche Bahn, has put the rail and bus business up for sale, with a reported price tag as high as €3.5bn.In May, the mayors of Greater Manchester and the Liverpool city region called for the franchise to be terminated, saying they had received assurances that services would have improved by then.Grayling, who was appointed as transport secretary by Theresa May after the EU referendum three years ago, acknowledged: “Fundamentally the infrastructure in the north is not up to handling the needs of a modern commuter railway, and that’s what it needs to be.”It is unclear whether Grayling will still be serving as transport secretary by the end of the month under a new prime minister. Grayling, who backed the leave campaign, was an early supporter of Boris Johnson, the bookmakers’ favourite to win the vote of Conservative party members.Grayling has faced repeated calls for his resignation during his tenure, including after a controversy over a £33m out-of-court settlement paid to Eurotunnel. The Department for Transport was sued by Eurotunnel for allegedly breaching public procurement rules over a contract with the ferry leasing company Seaborne Freight and two other ferry firms to provide freight capacity for emergency medical supplies in the event of no Brexit deal.Grayling, who favours leaving the EU without a deal if there is no trade agreement, said he had been in favour of fighting the action, but that he was overruled by a cabinet subcommittee who worried that the NHS would run out of vital medicines.“Although we would have liked to fight that case in court, we collectively decided that we could not jeopardise the supply of goods to the NHS, which is why we settled,” he said.A spokesman for Northern said it was investing £500m in new trains, as well as starting another 2,000 new services a week.“The north deserves the best possible rail service and we are working hard to improve performance and reliability for customers,” the spokesman said.“Since last year, we have made a large number of improvements for customers – including better punctuality and further investment in refurbished trains.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f7cc9be51fa95bba8b51e8107a92ac3db1817b6/0_333_3222_1933/master/3222.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc159d3ad794e086230a9fee22b9ef2a","title":"pesticide industry health planet mps ffcc report farmers","story":"A government report shows how the pesticide industry prioritises profit over our health and the planetIt provides a clear diagnosis of the causes of the current environmental and health crisis linked to how we produce and consume food. It describes how, over the last 70 years, agriculture has been about specialisation, consolidation and control over nature, with many farmers simply raw material suppliers to a processing industry. This model of agriculture has driven deforestation, wildlife loss, soil degradation and diet-related ill health.We urgently need to farm in harmony with nature and put public and planetary health at the heart of food policy instead – and there’s one particular barrier that we need to do more to overcome: the malign influence of the pesticide industry. It’s no surprise that agrochemical companies are seeking to undermine the transition to environmentally friendly farming – just as the fossil fuel sector has sought to delay and derail the transition to renewable energy. Despite the Green Brexit rhetoric, recent signs are worrying.In May, researchers from the University of Sussex uncovered a significant weakening of the pesticide approval process as part of the changes under the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2019, and a risk that the role of scientific evidence in pesticide regulation could be watered down.A few weeks earlier, leading environmental NGOs resigned from the two main government bodies tasked with reducing environmental harms from pesticide. Citing the alarming decline of wildlife, butterflies and bees and an increase in land treated with pesticides, the Pesticide Action Network explained: “We simply cannot remain members of groups continuing to push the “business as usual” approach as pesticides drive us towards the sixth mass extinction.”The pesticide industry reach extends beyond Whitehall. Around half of all agronomists – farm advisers – are employed by agrochemical companies . That’s why the recommendation in the FFCC report for every farmer to have access to advisers with “independent and credible knowledge to make substantial changes to their systems or business models” is critical too.If we liberate our food and farming system from the profit interests of agrochemical companies, what would that look like?The FFCC report invites us to “imagine instead a future which is about valuing ersity, working with nature, with farmers able to secure their own prosperity and that of future generations.”It proposes a 10-year transition plan for sustainable, agroecological farming by 2030 – applying the principles of the regenerative economy to agriculture to create a sustainable and fair food system.Don’t expect the pesticide industry to agree without a fight. There are profits at stake with a shift away from business as usual – although there is space for a just transition too.Joined-up thinking is key yet, for instance, the Department of Health is dismissive of its need to be involved in proposals for “less but better” livestock and measures such as a tax on processed meat, when public health should surely be a key part of future food policy decisions.There are also important question over what would this shift would mean for the cost of food. The UK already has the third-cheapest food among developed countries, yet it also has the highest food insecurity in Europe, too, because political decisions have led to poverty wages and grotesque wealth inequality.Nothing short of a radical transformation of food and farming will suffice. At a time when society faces many isions, agroecology offers practical hope for averting climate breakdown, restoring nature and securing human health, wellbeing and livelihoods. That’s an approach that many different voices and interests could unite behind. When MPs eventually get the chance to amend the agriculture bill, let’s put agroecology at its very heart.• Caroline Lucas is the Green MP for Brighton Pavilion"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94038b0495efa3321ac9bdd2e80d70116232d004/0_253_5230_3139/master/5230.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f79b746671562017662b34a323817de","title":"real fans cricket world cup final freeloaders adrian chiles","story":"Long-suffering cricket fanatics would have given their right stumps for a ticket – but instead Lord’s was full of corporate clients on a jollyOn Sunday I received texts from various friends who were at Lord’s for the Cricket World Cup final. One thing they had in common was that, in all the years I’ve known them, never have they betrayed the remotest interest in the sport. In fact, I’m not sure I’ve ever heard any of them so much as utter the word “cricket”. Yet they were there and I wasn’t. I couldn’t get a ticket. I’m not bitter on my account, but I am gutted on behalf of so many long-suffering, hard-travelling cricket fans who would have given their right stumps to have been there.Even if I had been offered a ticket I would have had to refuse it, or at least not accept it until I’d called at least three people I know who would have been more deserving cases. I’ve watched plenty of county cricket, and fought for Test match tickets tooth and nail. It was even my privilege once to travel to Cape Town to watch England lose a test match at Newlands in less than three days. I’ve done my time. And yet, relative to my cricket-fanatic friends, I wouldn’t have felt worthy of a ticket for Sunday’s final. The guilt of being there while they weren’t would have been too much.I get the need for the organisers to generate revenue by courting the corporate shilling. And yes, I’ve been on the receiving end of lavish corporate hospitality myself more than once. But a balance has to be struck. If the passion of too many genuine fans is being discharged yelling at televisions instead of at the field of play, the game will be the poorer for it.Football is no better. I took my girls to see One Direction at Manchester City’s Etihad Stadium. Full disclosure: we were there as guests of Liam Payne’s parents (who I happen to know). Accordingly, we were in some corporate entertainment area with the family and friends of the band. A testimonial on the wall caught my eye, from someone described as a chartered financial adviser. “The experience in the platinum boxes is pretty much unforgettable. Even when our guests have no great interest in football, you can guarantee they’ll be blown away.” Eh? If you have “no great interest in football”, what on earth are you doing there? As good a spread as they put on at the Etihad, you’ll get better in a restaurant somewhere and won’t have to trouble yourself watching all that running about chasing a ball.Anyway, back to the cricket. One of my friends there was a lawyer. I asked them how they got their ticket. “Corporate box – invited by a generous client – amazing view and champagne all day.” I know not what the answer is here, but if I was in charge, as well as frisking punters on the way in I’d quiz them on their cricket knowledge. Nothing too difficult: “Who is England captain?” or even just “Who are England playing?” would have probably weeded out a couple of thousand, at least. Their confiscated tickets could then be passed to accredited cricket stalwarts queueing at the Grace Gates. That should sort it.Well done England, by the way. Brilliant.

Is this the summer’s most hair-raising trend?Outside of the the black community, wig-wearing in popular culture has traditionally fallen into two camps: fancy dress or hair-loss solution. Occasionally, celebrities have flirted with wigs to define their look – Tina Turner or Cher – but whispers of “it’s a wig” are not often positive. That, however, is beginning to change.Last month, Paris Hilton revealed she has a collection of more than 800 wigs, albeit some of which she uses for going “undercover”. During this month’s Wireless festival, Cardi B removed her wig and threw it into the crowd, before requesting its return on Instagram. Katy Perry took to Instagram to remove a bouncy blond wig, revealing longer, blonder hair beneath (also thought to be a wig). Kylie Jenner, who, like the rest of the Kardashian clan, is best known for sporting long, dark locks, opted for a short, blond wig with a fringe on a highly publicised night out. And it’s not long, of course, since Jenner wore a lengthy, purple, mermaid-esque wig that matched her dress to this year’s Met Gala (three years after she claimed to have started the wig trend, to much derision). The first trailer for the forthcoming Charlie’s Angels film was so wig-filled that, in less than 24 hours, New York magazine’s style pages ran  a wigtastic roundup.On the catwalk, too, hairpieces are stepping out of the shadows: Martine Rose’s springsummer 2020 menswear show placed almost every model in a wig, many with their natural hair poking out from beneath. The designer cited the London club night Kinky Gerlinky as an inspiration for the show’s hair and makeup, as well as the event’s exploration of gender politics.Paria Farzaneh sent models out in identical brunette bobbed wigs for a show titled Virtue Signalling. When asked why she had opted to turn models into an army of clones, Farzaneh said: “It’s about who’s underneath.” According to the SS19 shows, wigs will be big this summer: Andreas Kronthaler for Vivienne Westwood put models in towering two-tone creations, while Asai’s show for Fashion East featured more naturalistic wigs in two colours, worn by all models.At Urban Outfitters’ online store, wigs in pink, purple and blue have all sold out. At Selfridges, the HotHair concession stocks a range of human and synthetic hair wigs, priced from £115 to £995.“The effect of celebrities such as the Kardashians openly wearing wigs has meant we have seen an upturn in wearers who want to wear them for fun, to change their look for an event or just for a night out,” says the HotHair marketing manager Louise Cayzer. “We also specialise in wigs for hair loss, especially for people affected by alopecia or chemotherapy treatment. I think one of the nicest things about the recent interest in wigs is that it normalises wearing them, which means we can offer a better selection of fun, fashion styles.”The global wigs and hair extensions market is predicted to reach a value of $10bn (£7.9bn) by 2023. “Wearing wigs has grown in popularity because people have the desire to change their hairstyles as a way to reflect their own iniduality, – whenever, wherever,” says the hairstylist Akki Shirakawa, who has worked with fashion houses including Saint Laurent and Versace, as well as Lady Gaga. “Instagram has become this amazing platform to source inspiration.”It’s true that images of wigs – from the fantastical to the more natural – abound online, with an Instagram search of #wig prompting more than five million results.“There’s a huge wig community on Instagram,” says Emily James, a 23-year-old social media manager, who often posts images of herself wearing wigs online and has since started modelling for Lush Wigs. “I tend to go for styles I’d never dare experiment with on my own hair I absolutely love being able to get pastel shades without bleaching, and then deciding the next day that I want to go straight to dark brunette. It’s impossible to have a bad-hair day with wigs. From what I’ve seen, they’re definitely becoming more mainstream, particularly with so many influencers wearing wigs now.”Such influencers are often criticised for feeding into the culture of throwaway fashion and promoting the idea that an outfit should only be worn – and more importantly, photographed – once. Wigs, then, are another way for iniduals to change their look and keep followers interested – although no doubt some wigs will also fall victim to the “wear it once” approach.However, Akki does credit Instagram with breaking down “so many of the stigmas that may have previously existed in fashion and beauty, especially for wigs”. Wig wearing is no longer secret or subtle, but lauded as a means of being fashion-forward. The wig maker César DeLeön Ramirêz, who has worked on wigs for Jenner and Ciara, says that negative associations – such as the taboo of female baldness – are long gone: “I wanted to diminish the stigmas that surrounded wig wearing. People are now open to wearing wigs because it has become another accessory, a statement piece and the alternative to a permanent change.”The fashion psychologist and avid wig-wearer Dawnn Karen agrees that wigs have “become more acceptable and less taboo. There are tons of tutorials online – how to secure your wig, how to care for your wig, how to create a wig. Black women already wear wigs, it’s commonplace within our culture. Also, the LGBTQIA community – particularly transgender women – have made wigs more acceptable.”“For most trans men, a wig is not necessary, but for most trans women – especially those above a certain age – a wig is essential,” says Dr Jane Hamlin, president of the Beaumont Society, a national self-help body run by and for the transgender community. “Several wig suppliers advertise in our members’ magazine and some attend events that are organised for the trans community, so that people can try them in an environment where they feel safe. When I started, I relied on mail order and bought wigs that were probably not the best choices for me.”Ramirêz recognises that the growing popularity of wigs comes at a time when the natural hair movement has encouraged many women with afro locks to embrace their curls. Yet he is also keen to stress that the two trends can sit side by side.“Wigs were originally a form of protective hairstyling that allows natural hair to grow while avoiding heat or chemical damage,” he says. “It’s a temporary shield for someone in the natural hair movement.”Drag acts, too, have had a role to play. Although drag errs towards the “costume” end of the wig-wearing spectrum, it has also placed wigs and their aesthetic potential firmly in the spotlight. On the TV show RuPaul’s Drag Race, the “wig reveal” – where a drag queen deliberately removes her wig as part of the performance – has become a recurring feature. It’s a motif that has also cropped up elsewhere in pop culture, from series two of Killing Eve to films including The Perfection and In Fabric despite the mainstream acceptance, wig removal is still a popular trope within the horror and thriller genres.The rise in popularity may also be down the fact that wigs have much improved in recent years.Wigs and Warpaint offers a wig-fitting service and gets between five and 10 requests every week, with those who are tapping into the trend (rather than wearing a wig due to hair loss) most likely to opt for more affordable, monofibre options, rather than real hair.The danger is that makers of wigs comprising real human hair may exploit those who provide it by either forcing them to cut their hair or not providing fair payment in return. Synthetic alternatives avoid this problem and are usually less costly, but cannot be heat-styled. They also have environmental implications – they tend to be made from plastic fibres such as polyester, acrylic or polyvinyl, which are not recyclable and are usually nonbiodegradable.Despite these concerns, the fashion psychologist Shakaila Forbes-Bell believes the versatility afforded by wigs is one of the main reasons why they have become increasingly mainstream.“Studies have shown that novel things, like a new hair colour or length, for example, activate the brain’s pleasure centres, resulting in a flood of dopamine – the same chemical that is released when we eat good food and have great sex,” she says.Wigs, then, offer a certain escapism a chance to achieve the aesthetically unlikely or impossible. While awareness has increased around conditions such as alopecia, so too have the opportunities afforded by wigs as a fashion accessory. Karen cites wigs as a means of “mood-enhancement dressing” – where clothes (or in this case, hairpieces) optimise the mood of the wearer. Now that wearing a wig is no longer imbued with the same sense of shame at the possibility of being “found out”, it can be an exhilarating experience, the chance to try different styles, and maybe even take on a more daring – albeit temporary – persona.“There’s a reason why many of us take a trip to the salon after a devastating breakup,” says Forbes-Bell. “A wig is even more appealing, as it allows you to experience that euphoric novelty, without having to plop yourself in a stylist’s chair for two hours.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d9ddcaf001a80de44ad7969b3c498d8d91482bf/0_205_5130_3078/master/5130.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9eaebf30a871424a64d77c5045aab8d6","title":"zara collections to be made from 100 sustainable fabrics","story":"Owner says its brands including Massimo Dutti and Pull\u0026ampBear will all follow suitInditex – which was named the world’s third largest apparel company this year by Forbes – said its other brands, including Zara Home, Massimo Dutti and Pull\u0026ampBear, will also follow suit.Pablo Isla, the chief executive of Inditex, said: “We need to be a force for change, not only in the company but in the whole sector.“We are the ones establishing these targets: the strength and impulse for change is coming from the commercial team, the people who are working with our suppliers, the people working with fabrics. It is something that’s happening inside our company.”The group was named the most sustainable retailer by the Dow Jones sustainability index from 2016 to 2018, and is owned by Spain’s richest man, Amancio Ortega.Isla insisted this week that despite Inditex’s presence on nearly every main high street around the world “the opposite of a fast-fashion company”, adding: “We operate with a different model. We make our own patterns, work with our own factories, keep low levels of inventory, have local sourcing and manufacturing and don’t have promotions in stores.” Inditex is already in the middle of a serious sustainability drive. Since 2015 it has collected more than 34,000 tonnes of used stock, after it installed clothes banks in more than 800 stores in 24 regions. A service picking up used clothes from customers’ homes has proved effective in Spain, Beijing and Shanghai and will be extended to London, Paris and New York. The company has partnered with charities, such as the Red Cross, on redistributing the used stock and is working with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to find feasible ways of fibre recycling. It has committed to disposing of unused items responsibly and has promised that its factories will no longer discharge hazardous chemicals at any stage of the supply chain by 2020.The promises come as fashion companies are under increased scrutiny from consumers, who are demanding ethical production practices and responsible retailing, particularly concerning excess levels of stock and the disposal of unwanted garments.The recent news that the UK government rejected parliamentary environmental audit committee proposals, including a tax of 1p per garment to help curb the throwaway culture and mandatory environmental targets for brands turning over more than £36m a year, caused outrage. The government’s report Fixing Fashion also proposed a nationwide ban on incinerating or sending to landfill clothes that can be reused or recycled.The government said it would consider the proposals by 2025, saying: “We believe that positive approaches are required to find outlets for waste textiles rather than simply imposing a landfill ban.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f689ecc65935d24fc65e3d1a136bbfbd1a3e541/0_0_720_880/master/720.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75feccf96b359a1e68bb386cd4a855b8 880w","title":"chimps bond quicker watching films together research","story":"New research shows chimpanzees bond quicker after watching films together. Time for Hollywood moguls to fetch the popcorn and head for the zoo – for everyone’s sakeFour years ago, while excavating the rainforest floor of Ivory Coast, archaeologists from Leipzig’s Max Planck Institute of Evolutionary Anthropology made a startling discovery. From a metre deep in the earth, the archaeologists began to uncover a series crude tools that chimpanzees had passed down from generation to generation in order to enhance their food-gathering abilities. In short, they discovered that we are living through the chimpanzee stone age.At the time, this was huge news. But new research has just blown this discovery out of the water. Because now we know that chimpanzees would probably quite enjoy Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.Researchers from Duke University in North Carolina have discovered that chimpanzees become more sociable after watching films. The chimps were placed in pairs and subjected to a short video, before the researchers measured how long it took them to approach their partners, and how much time they spent together. The chimps who had watched the video together approached their partner faster and spent longer in proximity to them.This ultimately means that humans are not the only species able to gain greater social bonding from shared experience. It also means that when you paid £15 a ticket to sit through Men in Black: International with your friends, you were probably demonstrating evolutionary behaviour millions of years in the making. Lastly, it means that your average chimpanzee is more evolutionarily advanced than former England striker Michael Owen.But what to do with this information? It’s reassuring to know that other animals can take the same pleasure from shared experiences as we do. Yet this may mean chimpanzees are catching up with us, and it will only be a matter of time before they out-evolve us and begin to wreak a terrible revenge on mankind.The only answer is more research. Watching films together can bond chimps, but is the bonding affected by the type of film they’re shown? For example, how would they react if shown Avengers: Endgame? Would the procession of context-free story beats and interdimensional time travel baffle them, or would they find themselves instinctively rooting against Thanos? Would their attention begin to dwindle during its three-hour runtime, or would they be as invested as the biggest Marvel fanboys? Once it had finished, how keenly would they anticipate Spider-Man: Far From Home?More importantly, can the chimps hate-watch? If you gather a number of chimpanzees together and make them watch, say, Transformers 2, would they become more bonded by how terrible it is, or less? Do chimps have the capacity for film snobbery? Will some of them even exaggerate their own fondness for difficult foreign-language arthouse fare as a dismal attempt to cover for their screaming lack of personality? How do chimps feel about all-female remakes of beloved classics? Is there some way to measure their likelihood of downvoting YouTube trailers for the 2016 Ghostbusters movie or Ocean’s 8? Because that seems quite important.We cannot afford to rest until we know exactly how into film these chimpanzees are. The repercussions of this research could be enormous. At the very least, we’d know to include a scene of them all watching Freddy Got Fingered the next time anyone decides to remake Planet of the Apes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4acedb4d29cf3606d537577a8fdf4fd0db04a69e/863_65_1468_881/master/1468.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f3967a8f0ae35c2c574a0378deca8e9","title":"crazy credits how the lion king nostalgia consultant is simply following a trend","story":"From roach wrangler to orgy adviser, here are six surreal jobs you didn’t know the movies requiredChance the Rapper was brought on board The Lion King by Donald Glover as a “nostalgia consultant” – mostly, it seems, because he has been obsessed with the original cartoon since he was a kid.

Here are a few more.Ray Mendez provided 5,000 cockroaches for the 1996 comedy Joe’s Apartment and 20,000 of the insects for the Death by Roaches scene in the 1982 horror film Creepshow. (He also did moths for The Silence of the Lambs.) But the guru of insect wrangling is probably Steven Kutcher, normally credited as entomology consultant, who has worked on everything from Jurassic Park and Spider-Man to James and the Giant Peach. His habit of taking his insect chums with him on TV talk shows led to an appearance on The Larry Sanders Show when his tarantulas “escaped”.Oh, those Zuckers, David and Jerry (and Jim Abrahams). As students of film credits know, the best boy is the assistant to the head electrician (gaffer) or head rigger (key grip). Well, those funny guys had themselves a time with the credits on Airplane!, their 1979 debut: there’s no best boy credit but there is one for “worst boy” … Adolf Hitler. The Coen brothers also get creative with their credits, and producer Drew Houpt, who was head of operations at the Coens’ production company for several years, gets some interesting job descriptions. On True Grit he was credited as “the new duke” on Burn After Reading as “the walrus” and on No Country for Old Men “the one right tool”. His credit on A Serious Man is best: The last of the just. This is the title of a novel by André Schwarz-Bart about victimisation of Jews across the centuries.No such credit exists on the 1959 biblical epic Solomon and Sheba (“Behold! The love story of the ages!”), but a scene with Gina Lollobrigida leading a pagan love fest did get everyone hot under the collar. An orgy sequence adviser was named in Michael and Harry Medved’s 1980 book The Golden Turkey Awards as one Granville Heathway – who, strangely, has not been heard of before or since.Although not an especially rare credit, one in particular has gone down in infamy. The 1929 version of The Taming of the Shrew, starring Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks, was reportedly adorned with the ludicrous: “By William Shakespeare, with additional dialogue by Sam Taylor.” But, like orgy sequence adviser, this may only be an industry urban myth as popularised (again) by The Golden Turkey Awards: existing copies of the film credit Taylor for “adaptation and direction”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00df6328b1d8177f5aebfe35b9147a856237a538/0_3172_6861_4115/master/6861.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e0e07fff122afccc08f4022e24e2ff8","title":"felicity cloake masterclass salade nicoise recipe","story":"Outside the French Riviera, inauthentic versions of salade niçoise abound, much to the chagrin of purists. Here’s the classic French salad as it is meant to be madeIf salade niçoise were sentient, rather than a salad, it would sue for defamation of character, such are the abuses heaped upon it in the name of culinary innovation. Indeed, one of Nice’s most notorious sons, former mayor Jacques Médecin, wrote of the trauma of seeing ‘the remains of other people’s meals being served under the name salade niçoise’. I think he’d approve of this one, though.2 eggs500g broad bean pods, or 50g french beans4 ripe tomatoes¼ cucumber2 spring onions½ red pepper50g small black olives1 tbsp capers4 anchoviesA few basil leavesFor the dressing1 small garlic clove1 pinch coarse salt2 anchovy fillets, drained and finely chopped1 small handful basil leaves, torn4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil½ tbsp red-wine vinegarGround black pepperPut the eggs into a pan just large enough to hold them comfortably and cover with cold water. Bring slowly to a boil over a medium heat, then turn down the heat slightly and simmer gently for seven and a half minutes. Drain the water from the eggs and put them in cold water to stop them cooking further.Pop the broad beans from their pods, then peel off their papery skins (unless they’re very young, in which case you can leave them on). If you’d prefer to use French beans instead, bring a pan of salted water to a boil, simmer them for a couple of minutes until just tender, then decant into a sink of cold water to stop them cooking. Dry before use.Put the tomatoes in a pan of boiling water for 30 seconds, then scoop out and, once cool enough to handle, gently peel off their skins – if they haven’t split in the heat, use your fingernail or the tip of a small, sharp knife to help tease off enough to get started. Cut in half, scoop out and discard the seeds, then cut the flesh into thick slices.Peel the cucumber (I like to do this in stripes, but then I like stripes on everything), cut it in half lengthways, then scoop out and discard the seeds. Cut the cucumber into chunky half-moons. Finely chop the spring onions. Deseed the pepper and cut it into fairly thin strips.Put the peeled garlic clove into a mortar with a pinch of coarse salt, then mash to a paste. Add the anchovies – if they’ve been packed in salt, rather than oil, you’ll need to give them a quick rinse first – and mash them, followed by the basil. Finally, incorporate the vinegar and then the olive oil until well emulsified. Season to taste.Toss the beans, sliced tomatoes, cucumber, spring onion and red pepper in a large bowl with two-thirds of the dressing, until everything is thoroughly coated. Using your hands, lift out the dressed salad and arrange on a serving plate.Gently knock the blunt end of each egg against a hard surface until it cracks, then peel. Cut the eggs into quarters and season lightly. Arrange these on top of the salad. Pit the olives, if you like, and rinse the salt off the capers and anchovies, if need be. Cut the anchovies into slivers. Scatter the olives, capers and anchovies all over the salad.Spoon the rest of the dressing on top of the salad, then strew the basil leaves on top just before serving. Eat with some good baguette to mop up all of those delicious juices. Note: the salad itself can be made a few hours in advance, and left to let the ingredients mingle, but don’t add the basil until the last minute.If you’d like to add tuna, as is often used in Provence, leave out the anchovies from the salad itself, if not the dressing (though you can eschew them altogether, if you prefer) – a small tin, drained and flaked over the top, is quite sufficient. Boiled waxy potatoes, a popular addition in the UK, are not authentic, nor required, but if you must, I won’t tell."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cdaafc01595b7d4810b993a4a635ad2599d4f0a/0_307_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fee88b4192d35af9202e8cab46bb6fd0","title":"the rules of holday eating","story":"Dining out while away can lead to meltdowns.

You have enough cash to blow on a plate of pasta puttanesca that tastes the same as the one you make at home, but is slightly superior because you are eating it while wearing perfume in an artfully dilapidated alleyway. That’s not something to sniff at.Ultimately, however, while there may be a small number of eerily well-adjusted weirdos who disagree, for the rest of us dining out while away spells meltdown: skipping sightseeing to obsess over TripAdvisor reviews arguing with holiday companions over whose dietary preferences should take priority wasting hours trying to locate a joint that suits both your pescatarian girlfriend and your raging carnivore of a dad.Difficulties are compounded by the modern world. Thanks to the internet, we have never had so much access to information about restaurants ahead of booking. As a fussy vegetarian with an Instagram dependency and a perfectionist streak, the perils of eating out on holiday are my speciality. So here’s how to navigate them so you don’t wreck your summer or anyone else’s.It is understandable. You want your break to be perfect you have been grafting for it all year. And no one wants to end up in a tourist trap. But there comes a point when researching cool restaurants so you don’t ruin your holiday tips into, well … ruining your holiday by researching cool restaurants.Are you several posts deep in the Instagram profile of a schoolfriend you haven’t seen for 20 years, frowning at a geotagged shot of a San Sebastian pintxos bar? This is not the holiday spirit. Nor is forcing your partner on a city-wide march to locate an “off-the-radar” gelateria that may or may not have closed in 2017.Such behaviour is familiar to clinical psychologist Linda Blair. “We work so hard nowadays, and we tend to get a skewed impression of how things are meant to be because of social media only showing the good stuff,” she says. “The combination is lethal.” To combat fretting over insignificant choices, she recommends doing a real-life recce. And being spontaneous. “If you just walk in, there’ll be a more accurate match between what you expect and what you get.”There is spontaneity. And then there is refusing to even contemplate dinner until 9pm, at which point – suddenly and intensely mad with hunger – you leap off your sunbed, force your mates to sprint into town and collapse in the first place that appears to have an oven. Someone in your party has been saving up for a special dinner. Put a smidgeon of thought into it.Burger lukewarm? Moussaka underseasoned? Celebrate it, says Blair. “Success and perfection is a little bit tedious. It’s the ones that go wrong that make the great stories.”You have decided on a seafood joint in Bordeaux. But, hang on: TripAdvisor relays the unhappy tidings that Jane from Newton Abbott deemed the mussels overpriced. Back to square one. Food critic Jimi Famurewa advises taking a step back from the site if you are prone to such dithering. “It’s a weird Rorschach test where people see what they want to see.” He recommends alternative guides such as Eater and The Infatuation. “They champion smaller, humbler places that are beyond the overhyped ones with queues.”Congratulations! You have finally found a restaurant. Do not spoil this evening by bullying companions into planning how you will spend the next.You are on the hunt for a lunchtime picnic spot. A-ha, that doorway up ahead with a spotless front step looks charming. Unfortunately, it is also the vestibule of a bakery – and, crucially, not the one where you bought your food. This means you cannot, under any circumstances, camp out there with your flaky akopita. Find somewhere else. In Florence last year tourists clogging up the area around panini favourite All’Antico Vinaio became such a problem, the city’s council outlawed eating nearby.Snacking in the street is appealingly cost-savvy, but Georgette Jupe, who blogs as Girl in Florence, points out that a bit of Googling will throw up “cheap eats with seats”. Researching parks with picnic tables and squares with benches also doesn’t hurt, she says. “It might not be as easy as just standing outside the place you bought your sandwich, but having respect for the destination goes a long way with residents.”Three times! That’s the number of occasions already you have awkwardly bumped into your holiday doppelgangers. (She has your skirt your boyfriends sport similar glasses they too are fiercely gripping their Lonely Planet guides). First: on the 7.10am flight from Gatwick. Second: in Bologna’s most zeitgeisty restaurant (seriously, what were the chances?). And now they are enjoying an identical aperitivo order to yours (2 x Aperol Spritz and some crisps – niche, right?) at the adjacent table. It is tempting to shun them. Not only do they out you as unoriginal. (Without them, no one would have clocked a thing!) They also remind you of home and work and Boris Johnson. But smile. Make small talk. At the very least, you can coordinate itineraries so you never run into each other again.It is fine to take a few snaps of the dishes as they arrive, or of loved ones tipsily enjoying the meal. But rearranging tables, fretting over lighting and separating someone from their Riesling so it can be used to “add balance” to the shot are all unacceptable.“It truly is the best way,” says food writer Martha de Lacey. “Not only do you get to spend as long as you like shifting plates about, but you also get to order whatever you like. Win, win.”It is an injustice of the highest level to order a selection of goodies to the value of about five times what the person next to you can afford, ruin their meal with your expansive photoshoot of the spread, and then piss off without taking more than a few bites. They will be consumed by food envy – and then shame as they weigh up the etiquette of scarfing the leftovers. To the duo who did this to me in Sicily last year: the cannoli weren’t as nice as they looked.Unless you have a serious allergy or intolerance, do not expect small local restaurants to cater for your dietary preferences, says De Lacey. So, if butter freaks you out, or anchovies conjure harrowing childhood memories … hard luck. “Sure, ask what a dish contains,” she says. “But remember that many Spanish restaurants don’t consider ‘jamon’ to be meat, and many places in Japan use fish products in absolutely everything.” Solidarity, fellow vegetarians.On group holidays, the person with the lowest budget gets final veto. Only a sociopath would object. Obviously, don’t stage whisper “Is that all right with you?” to your hard-up friend every time your posse drifts towards a potential spot. Just don’t explode when it emerges that not everyone fancies spending 18 euros on a single prawn.Without appropriate planning, summer cheer can abruptly curdle into hunger-induced fury. Sure, join that massive queue for a trendy new opening. But – and I cannot stress this enough – take provisions. A sack of Haribo, say. Or a crate of cereal bars. After all, eating on holiday may be a joy, but it is also an endurance test."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a90d1ccdc0448e990418cc1f8b89e467d225f037/128_296_5287_3172/master/5287.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80d7252587a649312af416bb5818d154","title":"bolton players stress not paid","story":"Bolton’s friendly at Chester on Friday has been called off after the players issued a statement claiming they have been put under “severe mental and emotional stress”.Members of the squad say they and the coaching staff have not been paid for 20 weeks.

It is understood no agreement has been reached over a financial settlement for the 58-year-old, who resigned from the Championship club on Monday.A statement from Sheffield Wednesday said: “The club is disappointed to learn via public statement issued by Newcastle United that it has appointed former Sheffield Wednesday staff Steve Bruce, Steve Agnew and Stephen Clemence. Regardless of the fact that the staff resigned from their positions, there remains outstanding legal issues to be resolved between the club and the staff and Newcastle United. The club is currently considering its position and taking the appropriate legal advice.”Bruce, who replaces Rafael Benítez, has been told he can buy players, yet the level of finance Mike Ashley affords may be modest given the owner’s track record. There have been no additions in the current transfer window, during which Joselu’s £2.5m move to Alavés this week has left Dwight Gayle and Yoshinori Muto as the club’s only frontline strikers. This month Ayoze Pérez was also sold to Leicester for £30m and Mohamed Diamé left on a free. Salomón Rondón is no longer at the club after his loan from West Brom expired.Bruce also faces resistance from fans underwhelmed at him succeeding Benítez and taking his first Premier League post since since he took Hull City down to the Championship and then back up again four years ago.Bruce said: “I’m delighted and incredibly proud to be appointed as head coach of Newcastle United. This is my boyhood club and it was my dad’s club, so this is a very special moment for me and my family. We’ll roll our sleeves up and we’ll be giving it everything from the off to ensure supporters have a successful team that they can be proud of.”Lee Charnley, Newcastle’s managing director, said: “Steve has a deep affection for Newcastle United and we are very pleased that a coach with his vast experience and connections to the club and city has joined us. Steve knows what this club means to supporters and to the region and he will put his heart and soul into leading our talented group of players with the full support of our staff.”Steve Bruce completed an unlikely treble when he accepted Newcastle\u0027s offer of employment.\u0026nbspThe 58-year-old has now managed three sets of derby rivals – Sheffield United and Sheffield Wednesday, Birmingham and Aston Villa and Sunderland and the Magpies.Sheffield: As his playing career drew to a close, Bruce was appointed player-manager at United in July 1998 and won 22 of the 55 matches for which he was in charge. He did not manage the club against City rivals Wednesday, by whom he was recruited in February this year. He presided over one Steel City derby as Owls boss, a 0-0 Championship draw at Hillsborough on 4 March.Birmingham: Bruce took charge at City in December 2001 and was at the helm for almost six years, taking the club up to the Premier League, but ultimately back down into the Championship. He won four and drew two of his first six derbies, but lost the last three and a 2-1 home defeat by Villa on 11 November 2007 proved to be his last game. He took over at Villa Park in October 2016, but was sacked two years later after a run of nine league games which brought just one victory and left the club well off the Championship promotion pace. He did, however, boast a derby record of two wins and two draws.\u0026nbspNorth-east: Sunderland called on Bruce in June 2009 and he did not disappoint. He guided the club to a 13th-placed Premier League finish at the end of his first campaign and 10th 12 months later, the club\u0027s best return since the Peter Reid era. His only visit to St James\u0027 Park famously ended in a 5-1 victory for Newcastle, while the Magpies followed up a 1-1 draw at the Stadium of Light later that season with a 1-0 win. Press AssociationYet some fans cited Bruce’s arrival as the latest misstep by Ashley, with whom their relationship is fractured.A joint statement from nine Newcastle supporters’ groups said: “Steve Bruce is an unambitious appointment by an unambitious owner. To go from a world-class manager in Rafa Benítez, who brought stability and unity to the club, to Steve Bruce in the space of six weeks is beyond disappointing.The disaffection is underlined by thousands of season tickets remaining unsold and a plan to boycott the opening Premier League fixture of the season, at home to Arsenal on 11 August.Joe Halliday from the Empty for Ashley Group told the : “We genuinely believe that the amount of people planning to boycott the Arsenal game – if not St James’ Park entirely this season – could be in the thousands.”A protest is also planned at Ashley’s Sports Direct store in Ashington, Northumberland, on Wednesday evening. Bruce, Agnew and Clemence are due to travel to China, where the club lost 4-0 to Wolves on Wednesday and play a second game on Saturday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c85a8a35069d191aee4474d7995b9e09b2d7a940/0_99_4169_2501/master/4169.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba21ef5373b533627fb3d262ca871218","title":"the fiver newcastle steve bruce","story":"Sign up now! Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now!During his second stint in management as boss of Huddersfield Town, Steve Bruce somehow found time to author three crime thrillers entitled Striker! Sweeper! and Defender! Read by few at the time but now increasingly expensive and difficult to find as collectors’ items, they have become the The Gutenberg Bibles of noir football fiction. “I looked around the stadium and sighed,” whispers crime-fighting Leddersfield Town manager Steve Barnes, looking around the stadium and sighing, in one of them. “Football is a business, and a tough one at that, but the green playing area, well, that really is the field of dreams.” Well, if Barnes thought solving the murder of his club’s groundsman was tricky and full of pitfalls, his author ego has now been tasked with the much more difficult job of dealing with what is increasingly viewed as a field of nightmares by those who sit on all four sides of it.Picked by Mike Ashley to stumble around in the size 19s recently vacated by Rafa Benítez, it was announced early on Wednesday that Bruce is the new manager of Newcastle United. An appointment that has been greeted with no great surprise but a huge amount of disappointment, it was certainly not the exciting new dawn fans were hoping for a couple of months ago, when excitable chatter on Tyneside centred on an Arab takeover that turned out to be even less plausible than the preposterous plots of Bruce’s trilogy of books. “I’m delighted and incredibly proud to be appointed,” trousered Bruce, fresh from lending his name to yet another ream of paper in the form of a three-year contract. “This is my boyhood club and it was my dad’s club, so this is a very special moment for me and my family. There is a huge challenge ahead of us, but it’s one that my staff and I are ready for. We’ll roll our sleeves up and we’ll be giving it everything from the off to ensure supporters have a successful team that they can be proud of.”Describing their new manager as Ashley’s “latest stooge”, Newcastle fan website True Faith was predictably enthused by his arrival from Sheffield Wednesday for compensation believed to be in the region of £4m, not that the Owls are best pleased. “Bruce’s imminent appointment will not set the pulses racing, instil any confidence or more importantly get the punters through the turnstiles,” it groaned. “A line appears to have been crossed now.” If so, it is the latest in a long line of them to have been traversed during what passes for Ashley’s stewardship. The multi-billionaire continues to step over them with impunity because those who want him gone evidently don’t desire his departure badly enough to do anything that might actually hasten it.“Steve knows what this club means to supporters and to the region and he will put his heart and soul into leading our talented group of players with the full support of our staff,” cheered senior suit Lee Charnley, with a commendably straight face. “The hard work for Steve and his team starts immediately and we will be fully prepared for the challenge of a new Premier League season.” Another line, this time drawn, albeit a very blurred one between half-truth and fiction.“This is the respect that people have for women’s football in Brazil.

So what drives a generation of young men to the all-consuming, often dangerous pursuit of perfection?It is difficult for Miles to pinpoint the moment his muscle dysmorphia started. It was just always there, a background hum. “As far back as I can remember, I wanted a better-looking body,” says the 35-year-old US soldier, now stationed in Mons, Belgium. When he was 13, Miles spent a summer cutting grass to save up for a secondhand Soloflex exercise machine. The machine cost $1,000 (£800), but as Miles was too young to join a gym, it was worth the expense. With the help of the Soloflex, Miles started weight training and never looked back.When he returned from a posting to Afghanistan at 24, things spiralled. He began obsessively working out and regimenting his meals. “I went all in ... it was full, hardcore dedication to the lifestyle.” Miles set his watch to beep every three hours, to remind him to eat. If it beeped when he was driving, he would pull over. Slowly, he whittled his body into shape. His muscles became striated, every fibre visible. Not big enough. At 95kg (210lbs) and 1.8 metres (6ft 2in), Miles wanted to be more muscular leaner. He lost 22kg and started competing in amateur bodybuilding competitions. There was virtually no fat on him. “You pinch your skin and it just stays pinched.” His girlfriend left him. “She began to realise that my body dysmorphia was like dating another person.” The pursuit of muscularity took over his life. “I just thought, I am so lean, and shredded, and veiny, and masculine – I don’t ever want to go back to how I was before.”Yet by 33, single again – the dysmorphia had claimed yet another relationship – it had all become too much and he was in a dark place. “I did not enjoy life in any way, shape or form.” All day long, he would starve himself, struggle through punishing workouts, go home and binge-eat before throwing it all up. One evening, waiting in line at the burger chain In-N-Out for more food to purge, Miles finally decided enough was enough. “I woke up so happy the next day, knowing it was over.”What drives a generation of young men to slavishly pursue this physical ideal? “Over the past decades, the idealised male body image has got bigger and bulkier,” says Nagata.This body type even pressed its way into our children’s bedrooms: studies show that action figures have become brawnier over the past 25 years.This wasn’t always the case. “In the 70s, we saw very slim, almost androgynous men, like Mick Jagger and David Bowie ... to be muscular was to be defined as to be militaristic, at a time when, in the US, there were protests against the Vietnam war,” says Dr Roberto Olivardia of Harvard Medical School, an expert in male body image. “So that build was really frowned on and rejected by youth culture.“But then the 80s came about, with figures like Ronald Reagan, who was pro-military, and men like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone.” This ideal male – hyper-masculine, militaristic, strong above all else – was exported globally through films such as First Blood (1982), Predator (1987) and The Terminator (1984). WWE wrestling was founded in 1980, and the likes of Hulk Hogan became celebrities. In the late 90s, a leaner but still very muscular aesthetic – popularised by Brad Pitt in the movie Fight Club – became fashionable.Today’s muscle men stare down at us from the billboards of superhero films featuring stars such as Chris Hemsworth or Jason Momoa, the latter only last week body-shamed online after photographs emerged of him enjoying himself on holiday in fractionally less-than-superhero condition. On the small screen, the current crop of Love Island contestants mug for the cameras in tiny swimming trunks, all the better to display their perfect six-packs.However, just as fashion magazines don’t cause anorexia, but contribute to a toxic environment in which extreme thinness is celebrated, Hulk Hogan, Dwayne ‘the Rock’ Johnson and Chris Hemsworth are not to be blamed for the disordered behaviours sweeping our gyms. According to the NHS, we do not yet know what causes body dysmorphia disorders but genetics, a chemical imbalance in the brain or a traumatic experience in your past may play a part. You are also more likely to develop it if you were bullied or abused as a child, something student Nathaniel Shaw knows well. The 28-year-old was bullied at secondary school – they called him a Borrower, on account of his slender frame.“I was always the small kid in the corner that no one wanted to speak to.” Social acceptance came one squat press at a time. “From where I’m from in Nottingham, because it’s a very rough place, you’re training to protect yourself. The bigger guys are the serious people that no one wants to mess with. That was the main thing at the start – get big and be taken seriously.”When Shaw went to college at age 17, he had a plan: work out all winter and reveal his buff body come summer. But when he took off his T-shirt playing football one afternoon, a girl said that Shaw “had no chest”. He instantly put his top back on. “I still wasn’t good enough.” The unkind comment laid waste to Shaw’s fragile self-esteem he walked away from the wreckage determined to become even more shredded.Shaw’s life became: the gym, home to eat enormous portions of tuna, pasta and cheese, move as little as possible to conserve energy and repeat. Shaw detached from the contours of normal life. He stayed in bed longer, later and missed exams. He was depressed. “The pursuit of this muscular ideal takes over people’s lives,” explains Nagata. “They become obsessed with it. They can’t function in their daily life outside of pursuing this ideal and it can lead to depression, missing school or work, and losing their ability to do basic living tasks.”To an observer, Shaw – who weighed 80kg at 1.7 metres – was tank-like. But that wasn’t how he saw himself. “I would be in the gym and say: ‘I look like shit.’ Everyone would be like: ‘No you don’t, you’re huge, I wish I could look like that.’” Muscle dysmorphia is a disease of perception. Although its sufferers live in the material world – a place of grunting exertion and weighted bags and scoopable protein powders – they spend most of their time in an imagined reality, where they are incalculably huge. Their biceps are swollen watermelons each muscle as finely striated as the delicate contours of a seashell.But even if they eventually achieve that physique, it is not enough. As soon as one muscular ideal is achieved, a new goal appears. “There’s a saying: ‘Once you step into a gym, you’re forever small,’” says 27-year-old Rich Selby, an amateur bodybuilder from Cardiff. Miles agrees. “Every muscle could be bigger. I could be leaner. You look at yourself and feel like everything is small and weak. I have no chest muscles I have no arm muscles ... you’re judging yourself against an impossible standard.”Social media reflects this standard back at you. “You’re being sold a false reality,” says Miles. “I can get into really good shape, right before I’m doing a bodybuilding competition, and use lighting and angles and filters to make my physique look even crazier than it already is, and save a bunch of pictures and upload them to make it seem that I always look like that, all year round.”Some turn to illegal substances to attain this ideal. Tony, 23, works for a pharmaceutical distributor in Dallas. He started taking illegal performance-enhancing drugs, including testosterone, equipoise and nandrolone, two years ago. The drugs created a dangerous feedback loop: the more he injected, the more his body changed and the more he took. “People are like: ‘Wow, that guy’s a tank.’ They have more respect for you ... I thought, heck yeah, I’m going to take more so I can get even bigger.”It is a common experience: muscle dysmorphia can be fuelled by the positive reinforcement men receive from other men in the gym. “When you’re large, you get a lot of respect,” Selby confirms. Men come up to him and ask how much he can bench. Sometimes they try to start fights. “That’s why people become addicted. They’re insecure, so they need confirmation from other people.” Selby self-identifies as having muscle dysmorphia, but believes that he has it under control, because he has good self-esteem.Up close, you can see the havoc muscle dysmorphia wreaks. “Your interpersonal relationships fall apart – but you are so caught up in the endorphin rush of affirmation from your gym buddies, you barely notice,” says Miles. “You’re kind of an asshole. You don’t realise it ... you just become this all-around grouch. It consumes not only all of your time and focus, but also the human part of you.” It’s also a lonely existence. All your time is spent preparing protein-rich food, but because you are over-exercising, you are often “hungry, and cranky, and don’t sleep well”.Tony was one young man who used drugs to bulk up. He knew what he was doing was dangerous: he would even donate blood to get his blood pressure down. “I just genuinely didn’t care.” As he cycled on and off drugs, he experienced dramatic mood swings. He got fired from his job at a hardware store for screaming at a coworker in the break room. Eventually, his mental health deteriorated so much that he came off all the drugs in May last year.What makes someone play Russian roulette with a steroid-filled syringe? Selby thinks people are driven to desperate measures because they cannot disassociate who they are from how they look.It’s an obsession that can prove fatal. Freddie Dibben, 28, died in March 2017 after his heart became enlarged by the stimulant Clenbuterol. His father Clifford, 69, found him. “The hardest part was going back through to the kitchen and telling his mum what I found. It’ll never go away.” Like Tony, Freddie experienced mood swings. “He would snap at you,” Clifford says, recalling an incident where Freddie was “stroppy” with him as they tinkered with his car. He put the moodiness down to work stress – Freddie had been pulling a lot of night shifts at Wilton carpet factory, where colleagues referred to him as a “forklift”, on account of how much he could carry.But Clifford felt blessed to have a health-conscious son he didn’t see anything to be alarmed about. A keen gym-goer, Freddie even gave up smoking at his parents’ request. “He used to cook all his own food! He’d cook a meal before he went to work ... he had two sets of scales, and he weighed all his vegetables, everything. He even kept notes of what he was eating and what he was doing.” Clifford laughs, bitterly. “Except for the bloody drugs.”And that is one of the issues of muscle dysmorphia – you can hide in plain sight. A pair of weighing scales in the kitchen tupperware boxes of chicken and broccoli in your backpack. Most people view these as harmless, if idiosyncratic, behaviours. And when you look like you are hewn out of marble, it is hard to consider anything is amiss. It is only when you step past the facade that you realise these statue-like men are slowly destroying themselves.•Some of the names in the piece have been changedComments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

Employees experiencing impostor syndrome suffer from emotional exhaustion, which leads to a conflict between work and family life and dissatisfaction with the latter. While the idea that an issue at work can affect you at home may sound unsurprising, researchers hope that the results will finally add “legitimacy to discussing impostor phenomenon as an important talent-development issue”. And I hope it will add legitimacy to the conversation about impostor syndrome more generally.Impostor syndrome is increasingly framed as something that must be remedied by the women who experience it. We are told to pull ourselves up by our bra straps and that we simply have to realise the power that has been within us all along, as though we are the protagonists of a Disney film. Impostor syndrome is taken even less seriously when it is discussed in reference to women of colour, whom it affects more. The feelings of inadequacy that women of colour may harbour are twice as hard to escape because it is so often implied their achievements are down to “positive discrimination” – although, compared with other women, they often have to overcome more and greater hurdles in their careers.For women in general, life is a never-ending juggling act of sky-high societal expectations, impossibly high expectations set by oneself and the unshakeable feeling you are falling behind in both. The best many of us manage is a convincing-looking but faked balance, performed with precision until exactly 5.30pm. But the frustration of this simply follows you home. We are held to these standards in all areas of life, so it is unsurprising that impostor syndrome bleeds into the home, where we are often undervalued, too. Just last week, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex was chastised for holding her baby in a way some people deemed incorrect – with criticism such as this, it is no wonder women constantly feel like they are underperforming.It is crucial to remember that women are not born feeling less-than. But if you are continually treated as though you are, you eventually internalise it. And this is not merely a synonym for low confidence – impostor syndrome is the logical outcome of a world that was never designed for women to be successful. It is time we stopped seeing the problem as being women’s refusal to believe in themselves and rather a world that actively refuses to believe in women."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b8f430070fb3334847c3f3bad2798fe4132ed02/0_0_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c64911b2031fa7ad78e329b8a5018db","title":"give free tv licences to d day veterans bbc told","story":"Labour MP says BBC should create opt-out for anyone who took part in Normandy invasionBBC bosses have been told they should give free TV licences to all veterans of the D-Day landings, as the row over the withdrawal of the benefit for most over-75s continues.Labour MP Ian Lucas said the corporation should create a special opt-out for anyone who took part in the Normandy invasion to ensure they do not have to pay the £154.50 a year fee to watch television.“There are two Normandy veterans in Wrexham and they will not be eligible to retain the TV licence,” said Lucas, who represents the town, at a House of Commons select committee hearing. “I think you should give a concession to Normandy veterans. We’re talking about a small amount of money.”Last month the BBC announced it would scrap the free TV licences for most over-75s from next summer in order to fix a £750m-a-year hole in its finances, with only iniduals who are eligible for the government’s pension credit continuing to receive television for free.The benefit used to be subsidised by the government out of the welfare budget. But in 2015, the then chancellor, George Osborne, pushed the cost onto the BBC as part of his austerity measures, ensuring the broadcaster became the focus of public ire after it made the decision to cut the benefit.Lucas highlighted the case of iniduals in his constituency who will have to pay for television: “I’ve got a constituent whose name is Ted Edwards, who’s 93 years of age, who’s a Normandy veteran. He’s spoken to me about this issue of Normandy veterans having this benefit removed. Ted is a wonderful community activist, he is someone who contributes hugely to his community ... It doesn’t sit right with me that we’re withdrawing benefits from such people.”The BBC director general, Tony Hall, said he had the “deepest respect” for the D-Day veteran who has “been through things I hope I never have to go through”.However, he said it was about intergenerational fairness and that channels would close if the BBC picked up the cost: “The board have come to the decision to balance two fairnesses – the fairness to people over-75, while also being fair to the majority of licence fee payers who would have to fund the £750m if the concession was to carry on.”The BBC has repeatedly pointed out that over-75s today are wealthier than previous generations, although charities point out that this is not the case across the board and television often provides a lifeline for the lonely.Iniduals who refuse to pay the licence fee will be committing a criminal offence, raising the prospect of elderly Britons appearing in court over their refusal to pay for the BBC. Women are also disproportionately prosecuted for non-payment of the licence fee.Hall said the BBC was forced to pick up the cost of providing free TV licences in the immediate aftermath of the 2015 general election, following the decision made by Osborne, with no opportunity to make any counter arguments.“I had a call from the then secretary of state, John Whittingdale, saying ‘I’ve lost the argument over the weekend and they’re going to impose the over-75s concession on you’.”“I said, ‘that’s nuclear’, and I laid out the consequences of that decision.”Hall was also baffled by the Conservatives’ pledge in their 2017 election manifesto to ensure TV licences remained free for over-75s, since the responsibility for the decision had already been transferred to the BBC.Tory party sources have previously suggested the pledge was included in error by copying and pasting lines from the 2015 manifesto in a rush to produce a manifesto to fit the deadline of Theresa May’s snap election."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b739366e8732d6cbae3e72ef4ea28f36fd5d1bd/96_18_3217_1930/master/3217.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa0976c2dffdddef55e08e499fe24959","title":"google suspends ticket website viagogo from its search rankings","story":"Search engine’s decision follows pressure from campaign groups and MPsGoogle has suspended the secondary ticketing company Viagogo from its paid-for search results, globally and with immediate effect, a potentially huge blow to the website’s ability to do business.The search engine’s surprise decision, which was welcomed by campaign groups and MPs including the digital minister, Margot James, comes with Viagogo also facing legal action from the Competition and Markets Authority.Google said it had found Viagogo in breach of its advertising policy and would begin removing its ads on Wednesday.The Swiss-based website’s listings have previously appeared at the very top of the page when consumers search for tickets, even for gigs by artists who have condemned the website, such as Ed Sheeran. Campaigners say this has led to buyers assuming the site is authorised by their favourite acts to sell tickets.It has plummeted down the search results after Google’s decision and sits among smaller rivals which have not paid to appear above standard search rankings – and well below its main rival, StubHub, whose ads are still being accepted.“When people use our platform for help in purchasing tickets, we want to make sure that they have an experience they can trust,” said a Google spokesperson. “This is why we have strict policies and take necessary action when we find an advertiser in breach.”James said: “Viagogo have routinely flouted the rules, and I’m pleased to see Google taking proactive steps to protect consumers.”Viagogo has come under fire for practices such as “profiteering” from charity concerts, selling tickets whose buyers might be denied entry and colluding with professional touts accused of exploiting fans.An undercover investigation by the  last year found that the company had resold tickets for football matches in England, bypassing laws designed to improve safety.The CMA is seeking to have the company found in contempt of court for allegedly ignoring repeated warnings to comply with consumer law.Google was urged to stop accepting money from Viagogo in an open letter signed by the Football Association, several MPs and the trade body UK Music last year.The letter said that Viagogo’s prominence in search results, via the search engine’s paid service Google Ads, was luring consumers into buying sports, music and theatre tickets that may be invalid.Google’s decision to stop taking Viagogo’s money is thought to have been influenced by action being taken against the company by multiple regulators worldwide, including the CMA.A spokesperson for Viagogo said: “We were extremely surprised to learn of Google’s concerns today. We are confident that there has been no breach of Google’s policies and look forward to working with them to resolve this as quickly as possible.”FanFair Alliance, a music industry group backed by artists including Iron Maiden, Adele, Nick Cave and Arctic Monkeys, has led the campaign to have Viagogo ads removed from Google.The organisation’s campaign manager, Adam Webb, said: “This is a landmark moment, and a major step forward to preventing exploitation of audiences in the secondary ticketing market.“After publishing extensive research highlighting the impacts of Viagogo’s misleading search advertising, FanFair Alliance has been in constructive conversations with Google for over two years in an attempt to address this issue.”The group called on other platforms such as Facebook to follow Google’s example.Claire Turnham, awarded an MBE for her work in securing refunds for consumers who bought tickets from Viagogo, said she was “ecstatic”.“Given almost every victim of Viagogo across the UK and beyond comes via Google we are thrilled they have taken this definitive action to protect the public from ticket abuse worldwide.”The Labour MP Sharon Hodgson said: “A well-respected brand such as Google should have done this a long time ago. But I am now pleased that this step has been taken, which will protect consumers and fans.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0c26cbda0569d3849daf80209f5406c11b014da/0_533_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1783d556f6870e42f5b120311c9a0400","title":"burt bacharach review hammersmith apollo london joss stone","story":"Hammersmith Apollo, LondonHis political fire may be dampened by syrupy backings, but Bacharach’s musical chemistry with guest vocalist Joss Stone is considerable‘This is the poshest cabaret night in the world,” the warm-up pianist tells an Apollo stalls largely seated at tables laden with fine wines, and tended to by scurrying waitresses. He’s not wrong. A full orchestra take their seats and welcome on stage Mr Malibu himself, Burt Bacharach, frail of foot but still dextrous at the piano and with some of popular music’s most ubiquitous tunes falling from the folds of his slacks.The aesthetic is extravagant supper club, with an underlying agenda. Having rested for decades on the laurels of his staggering 60s and 70s songbook, at 91 Bacharach is undergoing a late-career resurgence driven by emotional altruism. He wrote a score for the 2016 film A Boy Called Po, the true story of an autistic child, in tribute to his daughter Nikki who killed herself after suffering with undiagnosed Asperger’s syndrome.America’s descent into violence and despotism, meanwhile, has jolted easy listening’s Mr Nice into revolt. He introduces 2018’s Live to See Another Day, his response to the near-weekly school shootings in the US, with a desolate “nothing will change”, and his anti-Trump track With a Voice “would be more biting, edgy and angry” if he’d written it another 18 months into the presidency. These songs are too syrupy and suppliant to spark riots, but the fact that the man who wrote Walk On By felt obliged to pen them speaks volumes to America’s identity crisis. What the World Needs Now Is Love never sounded so pertinent.The vibe is plush and luxuriant enough, though, that it’s easy to bypass the politics and wallow in the ultimate lounge masterclass. Bacharach’s songs are at the mercy of the singer: when John Pagano steps from the trio of backing vocalists to handle the 1998 Elvis Costello collaboration This House Is Empty Now his cabaret delivery strips it of Costello’s barbs and renders it more Richard Marx-on-Broadway, but when Joss Stone slinks from the wings, barefoot in red, she wraps herself around the classics with a compassion and conviction that make her a Bacharach foil every bit the equal of Dusty or Dionne.In her hands, Burt’s finest compositions sweep by with the un-showy simplicity of songs fully aware of their own brilliance: Wishin’ \u0026amp Hopin’, I Say a Little Prayer, the melted military march of I Don’t Know What to Do With Myself and an utterly sublime I’ll Never Fall in Love Again. Their coy, giggly banter curls toes, and Burt almost blows his nice guy front when he admits he wrote Brazilian samba groove The Look of Love for Ursula Andress rather than then-wife Angie Dickinson, but their musical chemistry is palpable.Just as delicate and powerful is Josie James’s rendition of Anyone Who Had a Heart, lacking Cilla’s wallop but reined in to such perfection that its explosive climax gets the evening’s first ovation. But Burt himself steals the show with his fragile Alfie and by beaming his way through a singalong of Raindrops Keep Fallin’ On My Head: magic moments of pure affection for this master of the softest arts.

After being advised to do so by the prime minister, the Queen formally prorogues Parliament. This takes the form of an announcement in the House of Lords on the Queen\u0027s behalf. It is a speech, written by the government, which usually describes the bills which have been passed during that session, and summarises what has been achieved.It means that all work on existing legislation stops, and MPs and Lords stop sitting. Prorogation also automatically kills any bills, early day motions or questions to ministers going through parliament.\u0026nbspParliament can then be reopened a few days later with a fresh slate of legislation intentions, set out in a new Queen\u0027s Speech at the formal State Opening of Parliament.Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary and a supporter of Johnson, told a Commons committee on Wednesday that no-deal Brexit was “underpriced” and he believes preparations needed to be ramped up.Following reports that he clashed last week with Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, by telling him the EU withdrawal agreement was dead, Barclay said this was “not a controversial observation”.“In terms of the withdrawal agreement, what I said was that the House had rejected it three times, including the third time by a significant margin that the European election results in my view had further hardened attitudes across the house and that the text, unchanged, I did not envisage going through the house,” he said.He said: “A no-deal Brexit would be disruptive,” but added: “No Brexit is the worst of those two outcomes.”Barclay also revealed that the government was looking at compensating sheep farmers in the event of a no-deal Brexit, following warnings from the National Farmers’ Union that this would result in shepherds being forced to slaughter their flocks because there would be no market for their meat.Barclay set out his view that parliament would be asked to vote on any new deal achieved by the next prime minister, and then if that was rejected, it would be offered a choice of revoking Brexit or leaving with no deal.“But the question then will be is there a deal that is palatable to parliament and if not will parliament vote to revoke or will we leave with no deal?”However, any prime minister going down that path could face a no-confidence motion first. Tory backbenchers fighting a hard Brexit, including Hammond, Dominic Grieve, Justine Greening and Guto Bebb, would have to weigh up whether to vote to bring down their own government and risk a general election rather than allow the UK to depart on no-deal terms."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b54fd0332a522661c712c05d0730be3bc0610560/14_0_3293_1976/master/3293.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba35e6bc9b1f276c57bfa3f8c861881c","title":"montana fossilized dueling dinosaurs skeletons dino cowboy","story":"A Montana rancher found two skeletons in combat – the Dueling Dinosaurs. But who do they belong to, and will the public ever see them? The early June morning in Montana was already very hot and dry by 7.30, when Clayton Phipps and his friend, Mark Eatman, set out to search for fossils. Phipps, a rancher who calls himself the Dino Cowboy, was wearing his trademark black felt Stetson cattleman hat.The two had gone bone collecting before, but they were joined on this day for the first time by Phipps’s cousin, Chad O’Connor. The trio fanned out to hike through the badlands of what they thought was the Judith River Formation later, they would learn they had actually been in an area called Hell Creek, a ision of gray and ochre sandstone, shale and clay deposited about 66m years ago during the Late Cretaceous, when the area was a swampy floodplain.Phipps, like most locals, calls it the Hell Crik. It’s one of the most storied dinosaur fossil sites in the world.At lunchtime, the group reconvened for roast beef sandwiches. Phipps asked Eatman if he had found anything. Yes, he said⁠, a pelvis weathering out of a hill – not a big deal, except this one appeared to have an articulated femur, potentially suggesting a rare level of completeness. They went to the site. Phipps could tell right away it was from a ceratopsian, a group of herbivorous, beaked dinosaurs. He brushed away some of the sand, and thought there might be more of the dinosaur buried in the hillside.But excavating it would have to wait for another day: he had 260 acres of hay to cut for cattle feed.Eatman went back to Billings, where he had gotten a job at a carpet store after a run of bad luck put an end to his 13-year career as a full-time fossil hunter. (“His wife said: ‘We’re starving to death – you gotta get a real job,’” Phipps recalls.)O’Connor and Phipps headed home to Phipps’s ranch. “We weren’t all that excited,” he says. “It was a pelvis in the ground at the bottom of a canyon that was really remote and no roads to it at all. We had no plans to go back, but Chad convinced us to. I’m sure glad we did.”Phipps and O’Connor returned to the site about a month later, this time with Lige and Mary Ann Murray, ranchers who owned the land where the bones had been found. In the US, fossils found on private land belong to the landowner prospectors simply need their permission to dig. The Murrays signed off, and Phipps and O’Connor got to work. They built a road to the site. They began excavating the ceratopsian with penknives and brushes. Business partners were brought in secret contracts were arranged. Eatman came to help when he could, along with a rotating cast of confidants.After two weeks, the body of the plant-eater had been revealed. It was more than a pelvis and femur – it looked like a fairly complete skeleton of Triceratops horridus, which is the triceratops you’re thinking of. One day, Phipps was behind the wheel of his uncle’s backhoe, scooping out soil from around the fossil so it could be removed. Carefully watching each dump of the bucket, at one point he noticed dark fragments among the light-colored sandstone.Oh no, he thought. He jumped down, combed through the sand, found the claw of a theropod. Theropods, like Tyrannosaurus rex, are three-toed carnivores. That doesn’t match the plant-eater, Phipps thought. What is happening here?Phipps scrambled down into the quarry where he had been digging and brushed away more sand. A hand appeared. Then a leg. It was clear: there was another dinosaur in the outcrop.“It was just surreal,” Phelps remembers. “Obviously, these two dinosaurs weren’t friends, so what were they doing in there together?”Phipps had been hunting for dinosaur fossils since 1998, excavating and preparing them to sell at trade shows and to museums and private collectors. But he had never found anything like this. “I think,” he says, “my hat went in the air that day.”This was in 2006. Three months of intensive excavation followed, during which Phipps lost 15 pounds. In the end, he and his partners had a 28ft-long ceratopsian and a 22ft-long theropod in four multi-ton blocks. “A little cowboy ingenuity, and we got ’em out of the hills,” Phipps says.The meat-eater was either a juvenile T rex or its relative, Nanotyrannus lancensis, a rare dwarf species whose existence is disputed. Both dinosaurs were extraordinarily well-preserved, fully articulated, with envelopes of skin and, possibly, mummified internal organs.Best of all, they seemed to have died together, not washed into their grave separately. And they appeared to have been battling when they died: teeth were found in the spine and near the pelvis of the ceratopsian, and the theropod’s skull was split laterally, as if it had been kicked.Phipps dubbed them the Montana Dueling Dinosaurs. “They’re remarkable specimens,” says Mark Norell, chairman of paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History. “Especially the tyrannosaur – it could go a long way toward resolving whether nanotyrannus was its own species.”Thirteen years later, the number of people who have seen the fossils remains in the low double digits. They’ve still not been fully extracted from the rock matrix, cleaned, prepped, studied or put on display. Phipps isn’t even at liberty to say where they are – he’ll only reveal that they’re at an American museum, pending the resolution of Murray v BEJ Minerals LLC, which deals with who owns what’s on top of the land versus what’s beneath it.“Dinosaurs bring drama,” Phipps says, “and being a cowboy, I’m not a drama fan. You can have it.”For years after unearthing the Dueling Dinosaurs, Phipps and his team tried every tactic they could think of to drum up interest for a sale. They set up a website, and a marketing campaign called the Paleo-Incident Project. They tried to get sponsors, like Dr Pepper, to fund further work on the fossils. They posted videos on YouTube, men in western wear standing around the fossil jackets, taking turns talking into microphones.They contacted natural history museums around the world, including the Smithsonian – where the bones were offered for a reported $15m – and the Museum of the Rockies, in Bozeman, Montana, whose then head paleontologist, Jack Horner (the inspiration for the character played by Sam Neill in Jurassic Park) told them they were scientifically useless.“In order for a specimen to be of scientific use and publishable, we have to know its exact geographic position, its exact stratigraphic position, and the specimen must also be in the public trust, accessible for study, which this specimen is not,” Horner says.Phipps called Horner’s reaction “sad”, adding: “If somebody in his position is telling the world that the best dinosaurs possibly ever discovered in the world are worthless, what donor’s gonna donate anything to paleontology?”Acrimony between commercial and academic paleontologists is abundant. “The haters are always gonna hate,” Phipps says. “No question about that.”In the meantime, other valuable dinosaur fossils were found on the 27,000-acre Murray ranch, including a well-preserved triceratops skull and nearly complete adult T rex, which a Dutch museum purchased for several million dollars. The Dueling Dinosaurs themselves went to auction in 2013 at Bonhams in New York, but no bid met the reserve price of $6m.Though the fossils technically belonged to the Murrays, they ceded control of what to do with them to Phipps and his team via a contract, the details of which remain private. “We have a pretty loose arrangement, to be real truthful,” Mary Ann says. The deal specifies that any proceeds be split between the Murrays and Phipps Phipps will then subide his percentage with his team, which includes the owners of CK Preparations, a commercial fossil services company, and Peter Larson of the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research, which has unearthed some of the most complete T rex specimens ever found.Larson’s story is also one of loss. After the T rex known as “Sue” was discovered by Black Hills in 1990, a dispute arose over its legal ownership. Two years later, the bones were seized by the FBI and South Dakota national guard in a highly publicized case, and ownership was returned to the landowner, a Sioux rancher whose deed was held in trust by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. He sold Sue at auction for a record $8.36m to the Field Museum in Chicago. Subsequently, Larson was sentenced to two years in federal prison on separate charges related to trafficking fossils, including failing to report to customs traveler’s checks and cash transported internationally, and illegally taking a fossil worth less than $100 from federal land.His experience with the legal morass around dinosaur fossils would prove useful later.Lige and Mary Ann Murray were young hired hands in 1983 when they began working for George Severson, a longtime Montana rancher. The Murrays had a good relationship with him and a few years later, near the end of his life, Severson sold them half of his ranch, leaving the rest to his sons, Jerry and Bo, who live outside the state.For 14 years, the Seversons and Murrays operated the ranch in amicable partnership. But in 2005, the Murrays purchased the other half of the land. Exactly why is unclear the Seversons say Lige called to ask about buying them out, while Mary Ann says the Seversons approached them unexpectedly. An agreement was reached to split the estate: the Murrays would control all of the surface rights and one-third of the mineral rights, and the Seversons would retain the rest of the mineral rights.The following summer, the Dueling Dinosaurs were found.“Lige and I knew nothing about fossils,” Mary Ann Murray says. “We just ran cows and farms, that’s all we did.”Fossils, undoubtedly, can be composed of minerals, but they have generally been recognized as belonging to the surface estate owner – whom we normally think of as the landowner – in cases where the estate is split. The Department of the Interior ruled in 1915 that “fossil remains of dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals are not mineral”, after the Carnegie Museum of Natural History paleontologist Earl Douglass had tried to procure a huge deposit of dinosaur bones with a mining claim. (The site today is Dinosaur National Monument.) This imposed some semblance of order after the wild west days of fossil hunting, when rivalrous collectors like Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh would freely roam public lands, digging up fossils to sell to museums or wealthy collectors. It has been the precedent ever since.The Seversons say they didn’t know the bones were worth much until 2013, when they were appraised between $7 and $9m before the auction. So they decided to assert a mineral rights claim after the Murrays refused to share any of the future proceeds. The following year, the Murrays filed a lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment that the fossils were theirs because they owned the surface estate. A district court ruled in their favor, leading the Seversons to appeal to the US ninth circuit.In a test, last November that court ruled that fossils on Montana state and private land could be considered minerals. “Once upon a time, in a place now known as Montana, dinosaurs roamed the land,” begins Judge Eduardo Robreno’s opinion. “On a fateful day, some 66m years ago, two such creatures, a 22ft-long theropod and a 28ft-long ceratopsian, engaged in mortal combat. While history has not recorded the circumstances surrounding this encounter, the remnants of these Cretaceous species, interlocked in combat, became entombed under a pile of sandstone. That was then … this is now.”The decision sent shockwaves through the field of paleontology, jeopardizing as it did the status of any fossil found on private land in Montana. The Murrays filed for an en banc appeal, supported by an amicus curiae brief from paleontological institutions including the Field Museum, the Museum of the Rockies and the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology – which had opposed Larson in the Sue case.“By reversing a widely accepted understanding of land rights,” the brief states, “the panel decision subjects scientifically important fossil collections to damaging ownership disputes and impedes future efforts of the paleontological community to discover, collect and study fossils.”The state of Montana, meanwhile, unanimously passed legislation clarifying the definition of fossils and distinguishing them from minerals.En banc appeals are rarely granted, but in May the Murrays got good news: the ninth circuit, “in the spirit of comity and federalism”, vacated its decision and punted the case to the Montana supreme court, where it will be taken up later this year.Larson sees some similarities to the Sue case – “when people, through a lot of hard work, make a fantastic discovery, there’s always somebody with their hand open” – but he’s more optimistic about the outcome for the Dueling Dinosaurs. And while the Seversons, the Murrays and the commercial paleontologists disagree on much, they all claim to want the fossils to end up in a museum, where their immense scientific potential can be explored, and they can be put on display for people – the undisputed inheritors of natural history.The question of who owns a fossil gets slippier the further back one goes. Before the Murrays or Seversons ever set foot in Montana, it was Sioux, Cheyenne, Crow and Blackfoot territory. The oldest dated human burial site in North America is near present-day Wilsall, Montana. For millions of years before that, the uplift of the Laramide orogeny, which created the Rocky Mountains in the west, was depositing thousands of feet of sediment in what is now eastern Montana, creating the rare conditions needed to fossilize the remains of the terrible lizards that had roamed that land long before, for humans to later find and fight over.But that was then. This is now.“To get it down in cowboy terms, I’m getting an education in our justice system I never wanted to pay for,” Phipps says. “I’m in my 40s and I’d never needed an attorney until this. I try to live my life to avoid ’em.”• This article was amended on 17 July 2019.

He plays hard and fearless, keeps going and has a mental toughness and mature outlook on life. He will have plenty of big moments in his career. Malcolm EddingtonIndia were like a critically acclaimed television show. After power-packed leading performances from neo-noir legend Rohit Sharma and the experimental yet highly engaging directorship from Jasprit Bumrah, most expected that pair, along with a strong supporting cast, to help India execute a stunning finale. But, despite bringing in the biggest viewing figures, the show was cancelled at the last moment by the executives at the World Cup – the notorious Kiwis.MS Dhoni was a fan favourite, but his personal style did not suit the overall tone of the crew. Rishabh Pant, a cult hero on the local soap opera, Indian Premier League, wasn’t ready for the biggest stage just yet. Surely, by the time the next big show comes around, he will be in the spotlight. Scriptwriter Virat Kohli was excellent but still did not meet his lofty standards and fluffed the ending. Cameos from Sir Ravindra Jadeja grabbed bits and pieces of the public imagination and an unexpected starring role during India’s final moments justified calls for his regular introduction to the set-up in the future. Abhijato SensarmaDespite the horrible thrashing in the semi-final, we performed above expectations. Six months ago I didn’t think we’d make it to the last four in some respects we got through because other sides failed to deliver.Mitchell Starc was our best performer. It was a shame he went AWOL in the last two matches. Alex Carey looked a class above most in his ball-striking and attitude. He was a real find. To play a great knock after being cleaned up by Jofra Archer really showed he has what it takes. The performances of Glenn Maxwell and Marcus Stoinis were really disappointing. The one innings where Maxwell looked really like to kick into gear was the one where Usman Khawaja ran him out horribly.The semi-final revealed all our weaknesses at once, which was a shame. Unfortunately our domestic one-day competition is now contained in a short period at the start of our season. It’s not enough for players to improve their skills in this format on the biggest international stage. Scott MeehanPakistan did well. Our performance would be viewed much more positively had we reached the semi-finals, but that’s how fine the margins are. The game against West Indies was very costly and some fans think the Sri Lanka washout was a missed opportunity. Although we have no one to blame but ourselves for not reaching the last four.After beating both the finalists in the group stage, it’s a shame we weren’t consistent enough elsewhere. We have a few special players coming through and they will surely help. Although fielding remains a problem. Awais AhmedWe were hot favourites to finish in the bottom two, yet finished sixth and may have qualified for the semis had we won our two washed-out matches. We have a bright talent in Avishka Fernando. In fact, we could have a fearsome batting unit in 2023. The bowling will be the real concern. We have to search hard for the next Malingas and Muralis. Malinga still has a role to play in four years’ time. We need his personality and experience in the team. And our former cricketers need to take part in building cricket from scratch. The current administration is useless. Akesh SamudithaIt took us four games to get a point on the board and we had to thank the English summer weather for that. South Africa paid the price for a terribly slow start, and highlights were few and far between. The AB De Villiers debate before the tournament obviously didn’t help.I’m hugely disappointed that we were so poor early on. The late wins against Sri Lanka and and Australia, were spoiled by the fact that there was so very little to play for. Wasting a successful 300+ run chase against Australia in a dead rubber hurts. Nils LouwAfter a great start to the tournament – beating South Africa and almost forcing a win against the Kiwis – the Tigers threatened to be the story of the World Cup, but it never quite happened. Instead the campaign ended in a whimper with damaging losses against both south Asian neighbours. The defeat to Pakistan was particularly disappointing given the historical context and the fact they were playing in front of a packed house at Lord’s. It was easily their worst performance of the tournament.In contrast, the stunning run chase against the Windies on the postage stamp-sized Taunton ground was the tournament highlight, reaching the target of 322 with such ease and with so many overs to spare. It gave fans genuine hope for a top-four finish. Had fine margins gone their way, a semi-final place would have been a reality.The team didn’t quite live up to its billing for the emotional Tiger fans. A feeling of the wheels coming off was compounded by the swift dismissal of coach Steve Rhodes long before England lifted the trophy.Giving player of the tournament to Kane Williamson was obviously a sympathy vote. Shakib Al Hasan was the true star of the World Cup. After spending a decade being the most underrated international cricketer in the most underrated international team, Shakib finally became a household name – for those households with Sky TV anyway. His consistency batting at No 3, often arriving at the crease early in the innings, and scoring at nearly a run a ball was staggering. Add to that tidy reliable off-spin and you have the complete package. Tawhid QureshiWe were terrible for most of it. Bowling Pakistan out for 105 in the first game got our hopes up, but there wasn’t enough thought into anything after that and we played out the tournament as a Chris Gayle testimonial tour. At least we beat a plucky Afghanistan side.The authorities must begin planning for the next World Cup immediately by investing in players who will be available solely for the longer version of the game. We have become champions of the T20 game, but the same players struggle in longer formats. T20 is hurting the quality of players in the longer versions. The problem remains that we have a very small pool of players. Glen DucreayIt was always going to be tough. Always. I’m disappointed we didn’t take any points but there were some competitive performances. Falling 11 runs short of beating India, and two balls from shocking Pakistan, were the best memories.Captain Mohammad Nabi had plenty to say before the tournament, but his inexperience showed in the field. I’ll be happy if we can progress tactically and learn from the experience of playing against the very best.

Crystal Ocean is a 3-1 shot for British racing’s midsummer showpiece behind the odds-on favourite, Enable, who is 4-6 to extend a 10-race winning streak that dates back to May 2017.Frankie Dettori, Enable’s regular jockey, was aboard Crystal Ocean when the five-year-old registered his first win at Group One level in the Prince of Wales’s Stakes at Royal Ascot last month, while Ryan Moore, who seems sure to be claimed to ride for Aidan O’Brien in the King George, was in the plate for his two previous wins in 2019.That left Doyle as an obvious choice for the ride, not least as he steered the Stoute-trained Poet’s Word to victory in last year’s King George when Crystal Ocean was a neck away in second.Enable is the undisputed star of European Flat racing having won the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe for the past two seasons and made a belated return to action in exceptional style in the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park this month, beating Magical by three-quarters of a length on her first start for 245 days.Yet she is not the world’s top-rated racehorse. That honour belongs to Crystal Ocean, who was raised to a new mark of 127 after his Royal Ascot success, 4lb in front of Enable, who will receive a 3lb mares’ allowance from Crystal Ocean.This year’s King George promises to be an exceptional renewal, with at least half a dozen previous winners at Group One level among the possible opponents for Enable and Crystal Ocean. Aidan O’Brien’s entries include Antony Van Dyck and Sovereign, the winners of this year’s English and Irish Derbys respectively, as well as Japan, who took the Grand Prix de Paris at Longchamp last Sunday.Defoe, the Coronation Cup winner at Epsom last month, is also an intended runner, while Oisin Murphy has been booked to ride Cheval Grand, the 2017 Japan Cup winner, for Yasuo Tomomichi.Anthony Van Dyck, at 7-1, is the only runner apart from the market leaders on offer at a single-figure price. Defoe is a 10-1 chance while André Fabre’s Waldgeist, the winner of three Group One events, is 16-1."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cfe15160a07d47ba2ffd5f7371e07fcebdaf81b/0_153_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33fd5cce04df182efd301abc823cd838","title":"tour de france stage 11","story":"• Ewan pips Groenewegen in mass sprint to win in Toulouse • Alaphilippe retains his overall Tour de France leadCaleb Ewan of Australia, riding for the Lotto-Soudal team, won the 11th stage of the Tour de France from Albi to Toulouse, the first of his career, despite his usual lead-out man Jasper de Buyst tumbling into a ditch only a few kilometres from the finish.The diminutive 25-year-old follows in the wheel tracks of Mark Cavendish, absent from this year’s race following his non-selection by the Dimension Data team, who was the last winner in Toulouse in 2008. Ewan’s acceleration in the Boulevard Lascrosses proved too rapid for his rivals Dylan Groenewegen and Elia Viviani, after a stage-long break was swept up in the closing kilometres.France’s Julian Alaphilippe retained the overall leader’s yellow jersey while Geraint Thomas remains second after finishing with the peloton.Despite the Cofidis team being struck down by a bug so virulent their riders have been sleeping in separate rooms, two of their competitors, Stéphane Rossetto and Anthony Perez, made the day’s break with Aimé De Gendt of the Wanty Gobert team and Albi-born Lilian Calmejane of the Total Direct Énergie team.Eleven kilometres from the finish, De Gendt attacked to leave his three companions behind but was swept up 4km from the finish in the suburbs of Toulouse.Behind him there was the usual flurry of crashes as the peloton accelerated on narrow roads. Nairo Quintana, Richie Porte and Michael Woods hit the tarmac although all three chased back to rejoin the peloton.De Buyst’s accident came when he fell into a roadside ditch as he battled for position on the fast approach to Toulouse.

Here’s Boult, they’re going to push, are we in for a super over? They’ve got to go quick, they’ve got to go quick. OUT! I’m sure he’s OUT! We’re going for a super over!”The ICC montage of the last moments of the Cricket World Cup final has almost four million views – which isn’t that impressive considering three million of them are mine. Ian Smith’s commentary, in that gravelly Kiwi drawl, is spine tingling to the last second.“This is the moment. It’s Archer to Guptill. Two to win. Guptill’s going to push for two. They’ve got to go. The throw’s got to go to the keeper’s end … he’s got it! England have won the World Cup! By the barest of margins … BY THE BAREST OF ALL MARGINS … absolute ecstasy for England. Agony for New Zealand.”And there is sport. Right there. The reason you turn to these back pages before the boring but important stuff at the front. I literally cannot stop thinking about that final ball. It’s almost too much for those of us who don’t play elite sport to comprehend. Everyone on that pitch at that moment is at the pinnacle of their sport. They have trained for years for this moment.Jofra Archer is in the game. Martin Guptill is in the game. Jos Buttler is in the game. Jimmy Neesham knows he has to run as fast as he can for 44 yards. Everyone else is just waiting. Will any of what transpires be in their control? I can’t stop thinking about Jason Roy. The ball is hurtling towards him off Guptill’s bat, two balls after a misfield which probably cost a run out. Every time I watch it I worry he might not gather the ball cleanly, or fall over, or get cramp in both legs and just collapse – it happened to me once clean through in the last minute of a Sunday League football match.Then I worry about the throw. It could be wild, high, to the wrong end, right on the bounce or just straight through the square. I asked Darren Gough on TalkSport this week if he would have wanted the ball to come to him at that moment – the chance to be one of the heroes, to be part of a clip to be repeated on loop until the end of cricket. A beaming grin crossed Goughie’s face, as it often does. “I said to my kids as Archer was running up to bowl, whatever you do don’t hit that ball at me – every other fielder, every single one, would have been delighted when that ball went to Roy.” Even then I can’t relax – I check the montage again – what if Jos Buttler doesn’t take it cleanly, or treads on the stumps? I know he’s practised this. I know it’s regulation. And more pertinently, I know it’s already happened – it’s been set to music. Even still I’d like to check Guptill definitely hasn’t made his ground.There was nothing that could take away from this moment. But then there was. Jacob Rees-Mogg. I was enraged by his attempt to politicise England’s victory with an idiotic nonsensical tweet about not needing Europe to win. At a time when a ided nation comes together for one tiny moment, why try to score political points?I had my say on the radio – basically repeating many other more eloquent critiques. It was brave because he wasn’t there. You can see the two minutes online – where I play the role of a poor man’s James O’Brien – listing the reasons why it’s stupid, before explaining that I love this team precisely because they represent the England I know – erse, different, interesting – as Moeen Ali articulated so well Monday.The below the line comments were, in the main, surprisingly positive – plenty of “well said” and “spot on” to the equally supportive if slightly less helpful “imagine the absolute lake of gammon and white van man piss he’d have boiled when he said this on air”.At the same time I was told to “Give it a rest mate. Making a mountain out of a molehill just to show how PC you are is very boring”, while of course receiving many “Don’t mix politics and sport” and the mandatory “Max Rushden is a left-wing nonce though”.The conflict of politics and sport is a frustrating one. We want it to be pure. It felt pure on Sunday. We don’t want them to overlap, even if we know they do. Of course the players had to be invited to Downing Street. There’s precedent. What if they hadn’t been? Although I do wonder if Theresa May quickly hid the Windrush file in a pot plant as Archer walked in to the drawing room. And perhaps I’m as guilty as Rees-Mogg. I criticised him for politicising a moment none of us wanted to be political. Yet my response was and still is politically charged. Another response was slightly more provocative: “You guys creamed your pants when Meghan or whatever her name is politicised sport but now don’t like it when Moggy talks about it. Have a consistent standard you cunts”.At this point I turned off my notifications because I want to put my head in the sand to, just for a little while, enjoy an incredible contest that neither side deserved to lose. New Zealand certainly didn’t. And though winning matters because sport needs someone to hold the trophy, it also doesn’t matter at all. That’s why it’s in the sports pages, and not the boring but important bit at the front of the paper. The Kiwis’ humility and humour in defeat, led by Kane Williamson, was maybe the most impressive part of all of this.Nasser Hussain’s assessment of the New Zealand skipper nails it. “You end careers with wins and statistics and what you won but you also end your career with what sort of bloke were you, how did you play that game, and the way Kane Williamson carried himself – there are so many things that went against the Kiwis, and yet their skipper stood there at the end and did not make any excuses, what a man he is.”If there is a conclusion to any of this, it’s that I’d rather be Kane Williamson than Jacob Rees-Mogg."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a60971ffe9851245683f31bc73610281667d4aa3/0_0_3966_2644/master/3966.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d09a867a3b44c420684c4eadbff665f1 1760w","title":"tour de france 2019 stage 11 live","story":"Caleb Ewan sprints to victory in Toulouse after a short flat stage through the Tarn region of FranceRight, that’s it from me. Tomorrow? THERE BE MOUNTAINS! Be sure to join us again. Thanks for your emails and tweets today but for now, cheerio!Jeremy Whittle’s full report will be there soon enough.Here’s Caleb Ewan: “There’s no other race that I’ve dreamt of winning since I was a young kid. It was something so distant from Australia. To win a stage is a real dream come true.” Ewan’s clearly a popular man in the peloton – having spent the minutes since crossing the line being hugged by just about everyone, he can’t even get through the TV interview without another rider leaning in to shake his hand and congratulate him.Tell you what, there is a tiny change at the top of the GC. Ciccone, who was caught up in the crash that did for Niki Terpstra, drops out of the top 10. Thibaut Pinot jumps back in.All the GC contenders finished in the group so there’ll be no change at the top of the GC standings. Sagan stays in green, Wellens keeps the polka dots … it’s very much as-you-were. A terrific sprint there from the Australian, who picks up his first win of the Tour. The sprinters have really shared out the wins thus far in this year’s race and the lack of dominance has made for some incredibly tight finishes. That might have been the tightest. Van Aert gives Dylan Groenewegen the perfect lead out but Caleb Ewan storms past him to win by an inch, maybe two. A right-hander then the final straight …1km to go. Oss peels away and Van Aert takes up the strain again.2km to go. Alex Dowsett gets on the front … and turns around to see no teammates with him. He peels off and leaves things to Daniel Oss of Bora-Hansgrohe.3km to go. Jumbo-Visma, UAE and Sunweb are all over the front. Alaphilippe is also prominent, helping steer Viviani through these roads …4km to go. De Gendt is about to get swallowed up – he cracks with 4.6km left to the line. 6km to go. The peloton have got themselves sorted out and have the gap to De Gendt back to 30 seconds. It’s a brave effort, though, and he’s into the outskirts of Toulouse.8km to go. Aime De Gendt has attacked hard. He’s built up a 40 second lead.9km to go. Another (minor) chute. De Buyst ends up in a ditch on a narrow stretch. He’s Caleb Ewan’s leadout man and landed pretty softly so he’ll be able to recover.10km to go. De Gendt attacks from the break … and no one can go with him. Rossetto is furious with Calmejane as the Belgian disappears up the road. Cofidis will get nothing from this despite having two riders out of four in the break,11km to go. Jumbo-Visma, as they have been all day, are well positioned on the front of the group. Katusha-Alpecin also prominent.15km to go. Just 26 seconds for the break now. 21km to go. Terpstra has, in fact, abandoned. Ciccone, Langeveld and Nizzolo are four minutes adrift from the peloton. The break has just under a minute on the group.26km to go. And the peloton is one once more. Niki Terpstra has apparently remounted and is continuing, though he’s on his own and a couple of minutes adrift.27km to go. Porte and Quintana have 30 seconds to make up. Plenty of their teammates have joined them to help with the recovery effort. They should get back on in no time.Looks like Nairo Quintana and Richie Porte were caught up in that crash and now have to race to get back to the main group. Ciccone, 10th in GC, was also caught up in it and has gingerly remounted. Terpstra looks in a very bad way – could be race over for him.31km to go. Crash in the group. Sunweb, EF and Direct Energie riders are down on the road.32km to go. Ineos put their noses in the wind for the first time today. This is the section that might be vulnerable to crosswinds …35km to go. The peloton is beginning to get a little strung out as the pace on the front goes up. But the gap to the break is remaining consistent.41km to go. The lead quartet have stabilised things a touch, with the gap back to the peloton 1min 10sec or thereabouts. 48km to go. The break’s lead is tumbling. The quartet have only just over a minute now. 50km to go. And the break’s lead is down below two minutes. “I once heard the time trial be described as ‘televised admin’, so let’s not forget that Miguel Induráin won five Tours without ever winning a race stage – 12 stage victories, all in time trials. So Ineos’ tactics are positively thrilling,” writes Simon Thomas. “Throughout my time of watching the tour (since 87), there has always been a dominant rider with a team to match and routinely their dominance is ‘bad for the sport’. Until the next team that is …”“Watching TDF in a Spanish bar in the Costa Blanca with other cyclists,” writes Gareth. “Guess who nobody is talking about? Team Ineos. So I’m a bit concerned that Brailsford is talking about ‘sticking the knife in’. Seems uncharacteristic hubris on his part. People here are no longer seeing that team as central to the race this year, even if Thomas and Bernal are looking good.”Musettes all round as the peloton go through the feed zone.The breakaway have 2min 25sec – which is more or less what they’ve had since kilometre zero. Just over 72km to go. The break reach the intermediate sprint, and Perez holds off De Gendt to cross the line first and bag top points. A couple of minutes later Bora-Hansgrohe look to lead out Sagan but Viviani follows Colbrelli’s wheel before popping past his Italian rival and pipping the Slovakian.My US colleague and old mucker Tom Lutz gets in touch to point out that NBC Sports haven’t done their research on Geraint Thomas’s heritage. And his countryman Luke Rowe is listed as hailing from Germany.Perez pops over the top of the climb first, claiming the solitary mountain point. “As an accountant, can I just assure Dan Jenkins that it’s nothing like being on Team Ineos,” writes Thomas Atkins. “I’ll bet Jonathan Castroviejo’s excel skills are rubbish, and I wouldn’t trust Wout Poels to put our Q2 reforecast together if my life depended on it. Horses for courses.”A Deceuninck-Quickstep rider sets the pace on the front of the peloton but the front end of the group is stacked with Jumbo-Visma riders prepping to set things up for Dylan Groenewegen. The break has 2min 33sec with 100km to go.“Pffh, most teams in Ineos’ position do the same thing,” writes Dan Jenkins. “If they think they’ve got a real chance for the GC they put everything into winning it. Mitchelton Scott at the Giro \u0026amp Vuelta last year, Sunweb whenever Dumoulin’s is racing. Even FDJ at this year’s tour. Sunweb even had Michael Matthews training to support Dumoulin in the mountains for this year’s Tour! Michael Matthews!“They’re all in for the GC until they don’t think they can win it. People just complain when Ineos do it because they’re dominant and have the best GC riders. Oh, and if the way they raced on Monday is what it’s like to be an accountant then sign me up.”Having scrolled through the social media feeds of the four breakaway riders in search of an interesting tidbit or two (don’t judge – there’s not a huge amount happening out on the road), the best thing I can report is that Lilian Calmejane has an incredibly cute dog:An email: “Re David Brailsford’s “twisting the knife” comments: he seems to allude patronisingly that to win stages is for the others while his focus is always as ever on the GC win,” writes Alan McFarlane. “Surely the whole point of cycling racing is first across the line and not race like his teams as accountants. To win without winning a stage (not incl a TT) would of course be fine for him. Just imagine if all the other bigger teams raced like SkyIneos there would be no Alaphilippe, Pinot, Sagan etc, riders with panache and flair. Mitchelton-Scott are here for Adam Yates but fine for Impey to go for a stage win etc.”Well, he’s hardly kept that a secret over the years. The SkyIneosBrailsford plan for the Tour de France has always been to win the Tour de France. Rightly or wrongly, their tactics are purely focused on doing that and only that. And, given the results of the past seven years, you could say it’s paid off.The breakaway quartet have extended their lead over that hill to nearly three and a half minutes. Perez crests the hill first for a couple of mountains points with De Gendt just behind him. Highlight of the day so far is the glorious scenery of the Tarn region – absolutely stunning. One kilometre to the summit of this climb.The gap is still stable just under 2min 30sec as the leaders close in on the foot of the category three Cote de Tonnac.Local interest today: Calmejane was born in Albi, while Perez lives in Toulouse. The peloton have held the gap at just over two minutes so the sprinters’ teams clearly want to keep them within a manageable range. That has to be pretty dispiriting with 160km to ride.The breakaway lead stretches to over two minutes. The quartet are all over an hour down on GC so can be given plenty of space. Calmejane is either horribly out of form or has been deliberately keeping his powder dry in an attempt to gain admittance to a break. He’s got decent TDF pedigree, winning a stage in 2017 and finishing 35th and 30th in the past two years.The riders exit the neutralised early kilometres and immediately a four-man break scampers up the road. Anthony Perez of Cofidis, Stéphane Rossetto also of Cofidis, Total Direct Energie’s Lilian Calmejane and Aimé De Gendt of Wanty. Three French riders and a Belgian.“Thanks John, for sharing the EF racing film and for the tour coverage,” writes Robert Betts. “On a similar theme are the films made by the Morton brothers (Lachlan and Gus) as they go on various cycle touring adventures. The brothers are good company as they ponder life outside the sport and cycling for the love of it: Thereabouts. There are three ‘Thereabouts’ films each around an hour in length.”Thanks for that Robert. I have to say, I get very jealous of how good these videos look. Whenever I go out on a ride, the only photos I generally take (because I’m a mature inidual) are of ‘hilarious’ street names. Yesterday, for example:Off we go then. The riders roll slowly out of Albi (which looks rather lovely) in glorious sunshine. There’s the chance of a bit of wind later in the stage and therefore potential for nervousness in the peloton as we get close to Toulouse.The last time the Tour finished in Toulouse was 2008. That day – in the rain – Mark Cavendish sprinted to his second stage victory. Such a shame he’s not in France this time around.The riders are congregating in Albi – we’ll have some racing very soon.This is how today’s finish shapes up:Fancy it could be a day for Caleb Ewan to finally get a win under his belt, but we shall see.As this stage is short and pretty damn flat there’s a slightly later start today – racing will get under way around 12.45pm BST with the sprint to the line coming at around 4.30pm. One man who won’t be on the startline is Rick Zabel, the Katusha-Alpecin rider has the flu and has had to withdraw from the race.While we wait for things to get going here’s some rest day news from our man in France, Jeremy Whittle:Rest day can often bring some pretty decent #content from teams across their social media channels. It’s not Tour-related but I thought this from EF Education First on the GBDuro event was a really good watch:I can’t see anything changing much in these today (fact fans: the yellow jersey has never changed hands on a stage to Toulouse). Hello all. Hope you’re all feeling refreshed after a hard-earned rest day. Today the peloton blasts across Tarn, from Albi to Toulouse. It’s a day for the sprinters, the last one for a while with the first taste of the Pyrenees coming up on Thursday. That said, if Monday’s madness tells us anything it’s to take nothing for granted in this bike race.Here’s what William Fotheringham has to say about today’s stage:An amuse-bouche before the serious general classification racing begins, this is a short and probably rapid sprint stage across the south of France with only an early third-category climb to trouble the sprinters. There will be a break, but there are only two more sprint stages after this, so the fastmen will want their teams to control the race."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5750ac80bccd17180c74145a71a9af0837cc8134/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b342efe89192b7cd7eb2cbbae1b9e5c","title":"amazon faces eu inquiry over treatment of small retailers","story":"Investigation into possible anti-competitive behaviour is likely to spark US angerThe European Union has launched a formal investigation into Amazon, opening a new front against the US tech giants.Announcing the decision, the European commissioner for competition, Margrethe Vestager, said she wanted to take “a very close look” at whether Amazon’s business practices broke EU antitrust rules.The investigation into another US company seems bound to provoke the ire of the White House, only weeks after Donald Trump said Vestager “hates the United States perhaps worse than any other person I’ve ever met”.Google faced two massive EU fines for abusing market dominance in barely one year.

Earlier this month Bloomberg reported that the social network was under scrutiny from EU antitrust regulators, a move not confirmed by the commission.Amazon is now being formally investigated by EU competition authorities, who are concerned the e-commerce giant is abusing its position as host to tens of thousands of small and medium-sized retailers.\u0026nbspThe Danish commissioner, who is due to become one of two first vice-presidents at the commission this autumn, has won international recognition for her tough action on US tech companies such as Google and Apple when Brussels investigations found either an abuse of market power or underpayment of corporate taxes. The commission has always insisted that its actions are targeting anti-competitive behaviour rather than singling out companies by nationality.The latest investigation will assess the agreements between Amazon and the thousands of independent retailers that sell goods on its site. After a preliminary investigation launched last year, the commission said Amazon appeared to use “competitively sensitive information” from those independent retailers.The formal investigation, launched on Wednesday, will study how the use of this data affects competition, with a focus on Amazon’s “buy box”, which allows customers to add items from a specific retailer directly into their shopping carts.Amazon said in a statement: “We will cooperate fully with the European commission and continue working hard to support businesses of all sizes and help them grow.”More than 130,000 EU-based small and medium-sized independent traders sell goods on Amazon. There have been some anecdotal complaints that the tech giant is quick to move into bestselling products discovered by these smaller traders. “E-commerce has boosted retail competition and brought more choice and better prices,” Vestager said. “We need to ensure that large online platforms don’t eliminate these benefits through anti-competitive behaviour.“I have therefore decided to take a very close look at Amazon’s business practices and its dual role as marketplace and retailer, to assess its compliance with EU competition rules.”The commission said the announcement of the investigation did not prejudge the outcome.Officials want to understand whether Amazon’s dual role as seller and host gives it an unfair advantage, such as knowledge of hit products. The question was whether data was used “to enable or better the service for the smaller guys, or … used in an unfair way by Amazon to compete against the businesses, which they themselves are hosting,” Vestager said in a CNBC interview in March.The latest investigation follows an earlier antitrust inquiry into Amazon’s dominance in the ebook market, which ended in 2017 with a promise by the retailer to change clauses in its contracts. The company was also ordered to repay €250m in special tax breaks to Luxembourg as part of a clampdown on sweetheart deals.Vestager, who missed out in the race to succeed Jean-Claude Juncker, will become one of two first vice-presidents in the next commission, but her portfolio remains unclear.

People who upload their image to the app transfer the picture to a server controlled by the developer, with the photograph processing done remotely, rather than on their phone.These concerns have been heightened by growing awareness of online privacy issues in recent years and the fact that the developer is based in Russia, where many high-profile online misinformation campaigns have been based, in addition to a loosely-phrased privacy policy.The FaceApp CEO, Yaroslav Goncharov, said only a single picture specifically chosen by the user would be uploaded from a phone and the app did not harvest a user’s entire photo library, a claim backed by security researchers.He said the data was never transferred to Russia and was instead stored on US-controlled cloud computing services provided by Amazon and Google. “FaceApp performs most of the photo processing in the cloud. We only upload a photo selected by a user for editing. We never transfer any other images from the phone to the cloud.”The developer insisted that users had the right to request for their photographs to be removed from the server. “We might store an uploaded picture in the cloud. The main reason for that is performance and traffic: we want to make sure that the user doesn’t upload the photo repeatedly for every edit operation. Most images are deleted from our servers within 48 hours from the upload date.”Goncharov said his company did not sell or share any user data with any third parties, and that most features were available without logging in – meaning the app does not have a large amount of data it can sell on inidual users.However, users ultimately have to rely on the word of the developer that the images are being removed from the system.FaceApp’s has previously received attention for the ethics of some of its filters. In April 2017 the app’s makers apologised for a feature that whitened people’s faces when they selected the “hot” filter, leading to accusations that it considered lighter skin to be synonymous with attractiveness. The developers said this was due to a flaw in the underlying neural network, which was skewed towards Caucasian faces.Later that year the app pulled a different filter which allowed users to see how they would look if they were a different race, after it was accused of promoting “digital blackface”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f237ebad83038a6bad5935f35a776a8028da3c4/0_109_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c109570b99853b96241bb64772302847","title":"send tip off the tourist trail europe twin 200 pound hotel voucher","story":"You might know a hidden-but-wonderful village, town, historic site, landscape or beach.

If there is one quality the European commission’s first female president shares with her mentor Angela Merkel, it is that her political persuasions can be difficult to classify. Unlike Germany’s consensus-seeking chancellor, however, she is not afraid to raise hackles and ide opinion to drive through the policies she believes are right.Born in October 1958, Ursula Gertrud von der Leyen spent her first 13 years in Brussels, where her father was one of the first pan-European civil servants. She attended the European School in Uccle, graduating two years before a certain Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson joined the same establishment.One of seven children, she was raised in a Christian household that adhered to the traditional model of the West German nuclear family. As state premier of Lower Saxony, her father, Ernst Albrecht, became a leading figure of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and a bete noire for the burgeoning Green movement, with whom he clashed over the opening of a nuclear waste depository.Her mother, Heidi, took a supporting role, at times leading a family choir that serenaded its patriarch on German TV shows, and stating: “The best way for me to gain the respect of the public is through the role of motherliness.”But if her father’s career enabled her international upbringing, it also allowed Von der Leyen to step out from his shadow.When she was studying economics at the University of Göttingen in the late 1970s, her father was informed that his family could be a potential target for the Red Army Faction, a terrorist group also known as the Baader-Meinhof gang, and that his daughter should consider moving to another university.Von der Leyen adopted the pseudonym Rose Ladson – a combination of her family nickname and the surname of her American great-grandmother – and enrolled at the London School of Economics.“I lived much more than I studied,” she told the weekly Zeit. “No details, please. Only this: in 1978 I immersed myself for one year in this seething, international, colourful city. For me, coming from the rather monotonous, white Germany, that was fascinating.“For me, London was the epitome of modernity: freedom, the joy of life, trying everything. This gave me an inner freedom that I have kept until today. And another thing I have kept: the realisation that different cultures can get on together very well.”Switching to study medicine, she later worked as an assistant physician at a women’s clinic in Hanover and graduated as a doctor of medicine in 1991.After she joined the CDU in 1990, on the same day her father stepped down from his job as state premier, her inner freedom made its mark on the posts she held, first as a regional and national delegate and then at the family, work and defence ministries.“She has an incredible amount of energy”, said Daniel Goffart, a political correspondent for the news magazine Focus who co-wrote her biography in 2015. “You especially saw that in her bitter and protracted battle to modernise her party’s view on the role of the family.”Under her watch, Germany introduced a law guaranteeing every child over 12 months of age a place at a daycare facility, and a paid parental leave scheme that includes at least two months of paid leave for fathers. She forced Merkel to drop her opposition to boardroom quotas for women, even though the policy was later defeated in the Bundestag.Married since 1986 to a physician, Heiko, and mother to seven children, Von der Leyen has juggled a prolific career with family life – at the cost of popularity within her own party, some say. Instead of attending CDU summer fetes in rural Lower Saxony, said her biographer Goffart, she preferred to spend weekends at the family home in Beinhorn near Hanover when her children were still young.Among her critics, the 60-year-old Von der Leyen has a reputation as an Einzelgängerin, a lone wolf with an instinct for front page-grabbing interviews and photo ops, but lacking the gift to pass the inner freedom driving her career down to the teams she works with.If Von der Leyen’s approval ratings have recently plummeted, making her the least popular minister in Merkel’s cabinet, it is because her handling of Germany’s notoriously under-funded military at times displayed those same deficiencies.When she diagnosed the troops with an “attitude problem” after the emergence of stories about rightwing extremist activities and hazing of new recruits, she was accused – and not only by members of the Bundeswehr – of choosing a good write-up over loyalty to her staff. “If she has a weakness, it is her tendency to excessive stage management,” said Goffart.More recently, Von der Leyen grabbed negative headlines over the accusation that her defence ministry had allocated over-inflated contracts worth hundreds of millions of euros to external consultants. A parliamentary committee is investigating the ministry for accusations of nepotism, and Von der Leyen is expected to be invited as a witness in December. In Brussels and Berlin, she will have two stages to manage.• This article was amended on 17 July 2019.

Lady Justice is blind – she will defend the rule of law wherever it is attacked.”She emerged as a compromise candidate after Poland and Hungary led opposition to Timmermans, a Dutch socialist, who ran in a pan-European campaign to replace Jean-Claude Juncker.In a statement Timmermans said the rule of law had “come under attack in several ways” in the past five years, without naming specific countries. “The European commission has been fighting hard to resist these attacks with the tools available to us, and will continue to do so. Today we have decided to further strengthen our toolbox, to promote, protect and enforce the rule of law.”Von der Leyen has revealed little of how she intends to handle upcoming negotiations on the EU’s seven-year budget, with some member states wanting to tie EU funding to the rule of law, a measure that could hit Poland, a net beneficiary of European money."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eaa1fbcd3a2bf47a96b029fcfd0f95724add076b/0_130_2293_1377/master/2293.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5a465587fb770b05c285ff137b0a8ca","title":"iran tanker capture gibraltar chief minister flies uk talks","story":"Fabian Picardo to hold discussions with PM about potential release of the Grace 1Gibraltar’s chief minister, Fabian Picardo, has flown to London to hold talks with Theresa May about the possible release of an Iranian-owned tanker that was seized a fortnight ago by the Royal Marines.The detention of the Grace 1 and its cargo of 2.1m barrels of oil, which was believed to have been headed to Syria in breach of EU sanctions, has turned into a focal point of severe friction between Tehran and London as Iran threatens to take further steps way from the nuclear deal it signed in 2015 with the US, China, Russia and 3 EU states.The UK has been under pressure from some European and Gulf allies to release the ship. Suggested by the US, the capture occurred on 4 July when the ship unexpectedly put down an anchor in what the UK regards as its waters. Spain monitored the capture.Iranian sources say its intermediaries took up a weekend offer from Picardo to meet to discuss the situation.Speaking in the Commons, the UK’s Middle East minister, Andrew Murrison, said decisions about the Panamanian-flagged tanker were a matter for Picardo. But in reality the Foreign Office will have influence over the key strategic decisions around whether the retention of the ship is either legally or diplomatically wise.The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, following consultations with Picardo and the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, offered on Saturday to release the ship as long as Iran gave assurances that the ship’s oil was not bound for Syria, or any other entity under EU sanctions.In a statement, Picardo said: “We would be prepared to facilitate the release of the detained assets to the rightful owner if we received guarantees that it would not be going to Syria.”Speaking to the BBC’s Hardtalk programme in New York on Monday, Zarif said the ship had never been bound for Syria, but would not identify the true destination.He said: “We announced from the very beginning this ship was not going to Syria.” Asked where it was going, he said: “It was going to a place in the Mediterranean other than Syria. We made it clear.”Iran has been exporting oil to western Turkey, and looked to have resumed oil sales to Syria after a gap of more than a year in March this year.Zarif said he would “do anything to avoid the US knowing what we are doing”, pointing out that the US was unilaterally attempting to force Iran back to the negotiating table by trying to impose an unprecedented ban all Iranian oil exports. “The UK by confiscating our ship is helping the US in imposing its illegal oil sanctions against Iran,” said Zarif.It is not clear if Iran has been able to give stronger assurances through other private diplomatic channels that would satisfy the Gibraltar supreme court about the oil’s destination.Iran believes it is not party to the EU sanctions on Syria, one of its close allies, and has described the ship’s seizure as unlawful and an act of piracy.Some independent observers say it is unusual for the UK to have intervened to force a non-EU state to comply with EU sanctions.Gibraltar’s authorities arrested the Indian captain and first officer of the Grace 1, but have not pressed any charges."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de963e0c03e668a979038f04fa826935a4e91b6a/0_96_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d97adc4f5555da75066b30dcf7e9055","title":"russia denies visas to teachers at anglo american school","story":"Staff say decision is ‘blowback’ as a result of worsening relations with USRussia has denied visas to teachers of the Anglo-American school in Moscow, in a move described by one teacher as “blowback” over worsening US-Russian relations.The US ambassador, Jon Huntsman, called the decision to deny visas to 30 teachers at the Anglo-American school “unfortunate” and said it would “affect over 1,100 students and their families, who represent over 60 countries, including Russia”. The day school is popular among the children of western diplomats and businessmen.“Children should not be used as pawns in diplomatic disputes,” Huntsman said.The school appears to be the latest victim in a tit-for-tat of embassy closures and expulsions, which began after the US accused Russia of interfering in the 2016 presidential election.Russia disputed the report, calling the statement by Huntsman an “open lie”. The foreign ministry did not dispute that Russia had blocked the visas but said US authorities had been misclassifying the teachers as embassy employees.“Teachers in the American school are sent to Russia as embassy employees with diplomatic passports, although the school is a commercial enterprise,” the foreign ministry said, according to Russian state media. “The US government, clearly, has specially created a dead-end situation to invent its latest scandal, of which its citizens have become hostages.”It is not the first time the Anglo-American school has been targeted. In 2018, city officials in St Petersburg informed the school it would have to vacate its building within a matter of days. The school served 140 children in the city.US and British consulates in St Petersburg were closed earlier that year. The US has shuttered Russian consulates in Seattle and San Francisco, and ordered Russia to vacate several diplomatic annex buildings in New York and Washington DC.A teacher at the school said staff were not surprised by the visa troubles and they had been expecting “blowback” as a result of the chill in US-Russian relations. “It isn’t coming as a total surprise to anyone. We can all see how tense it is,” said the teacher, who asked not to be named because he had been told not to speak to the media.Founded in 1949, the Anglo-American school was chartered by the American, British and Canadian embassies and has educated generations of English-speaking children since the cold war. Its campus is located in north-west Moscow by a community sometimes called the “American settlement”.The 30 teachers make up an estimated one-fifth of the teaching staff, and the embassy said some students may be disenrolled as a result."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3959445.1563379092!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"merkel celebrates 65th birthday with another coup","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGermany’s new defence minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer (left), her predecessor  Ursula von der Leyen  and chancellor Angela Merkel  at Bellevue Palace in Berlin on Wednesday. Photograph: Fabrizio BenschReutersTo celebrate her 65th birthday on Wednesday, German chancellor Angela Merkel treated herself to her favourite kind of present: a political coup.The previous evening her defence minister, Ursula von der Leyen, was elected president of the European Commission, the first woman to hold the job and the first German since Walter Hallstein half a century ago.Two hours later, Merkel surprised everyone by naming as new defence minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer.In December Kramp-Karrenbauer succeeded Merkel as chairwoman of Germany’s ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU). It was a political coup for Merkel, under pressure to begin her orderly departure from office, to secure the party leadership for her chosen candidate.After early euphoria, though, it’s been downhill ever since. Kramp-Karrenbauer, a newcomer in Berlin politics, has struggled to reinvigorate the party after nearly two decades under Merkel’s leadership.Her problem: how to retool a political party while in government, alongside an active and visible predecessor, and with no real political authority and power base of one’s own. A series of beginner’s mistakes, compounded by a strategic stumble, have seen Kramp-Karrenbauer slide in polls.Now Merkel has come to the rescue again, granting the woman known to all as AKK a cabinet position and a seat on her Bundestag front bench.In Bellevue Palace on Wednesday morning, wearing a broad smile and with no shakes in sight, the chancellor watched as von der Leyen handed over\u0026nbspthe baton to Kramp-Karrenbauer.Later, the two women inspected the troops at the ministry in Berlin’s Bendler Block complex where, 75 years ago, Count Claus Stauffenberg was executed for masterminding the July 1944 plot against Hitler.Today, in a very different Berlin, the question doing the rounds is: will this end well for all three women equally?Von der Leyen escapes domestic politics and, for now at least, a parliamentary inquiry into whether, as defence minister, she had an excessive love of private consultants. Merkel has filled an empty cabinet seat without a major reshuffle, stabilising her hold on power before her summer break this weekend.But the jury is out on AKK who, weeks ago, insisted she was not interested in joining the cabinet. Some suggest she has made one of the oldest mistakes in the book: trying to solve existing problems by adding another one to the pile.Deep-seated problemsThe German armed forces are an even bigger building site than the CDU, and the new defence minister will be at least the fourth who arrived on site promising to finish the job.With her troops behind her, Kramp-Karrenbauer promised on Wednesday that “they have earned the highest political priority”.“We must never be allowed forget that men and women are standing for us outside our country and, in an emergency, also fight, to defend and ensure our security in Germany,” she said.The new minister can build on her predecessor’s efforts to make the German armed forces a more attractive employer, in particular for women and families. But she inherits deep-seated technical and staffing problems that mean just a handful of Germany’s 128 warplanes, 95 of its 244 tanks and only a fifth of 180,000 soldiers are currently deployable.A mid-air collision of two planes during training last month killed one pilot, while the renovation of Germany’s historic navy training ship has turned into an expensive cross between a money pit and a soap opera.As well as structural problems Kramp-Karrenbauer, who has no previous experience in federal government or in this portfolio, inherits pressures to expedite a rise in Germany’s defence spend.

Some portions of the mountain are sub-zero all year round where the sun doesn’t reach, it\u0027s pretty much a subarctic climate,” a spokesperson for the John Muir trust said.“It varies from year to year but in some parts for most of the year it\u0027s like being frozen.”The teams at the John Muir trust who lead the clean up of Ben Nevis said that that an increase in visitors has caused more problems than ever when it comes to climbers leaving rubbish on the mountain.Ben Nevis: the facts bigThe mountain ordinarily sees 120,000 take on the summit a year, but last year over 160,000 people visited Ben Nevis.A spokesperson added: “Although there\u0027s been a lot more improvements with litter due to a much greater awareness, it’s got worse recently.“There’s been a surge in visitors to Ben Nevis and the popularity for the Highlands is growing due to social media bringing it to life. “Where these kinds of visitors might not go the whole way up some mountains, they all go up Ben Nevis it’s not just experienced walkers who are more aware when it comes to climbing and dropping litter.”Peter Rutherford, the Snowdonia National Park Authority’s Access Officer said: “If you have 550,000 walkers a year on Snowdon alone and everybody has an apple or a banana in their bag, then this is a significant amount of organic waste that will take a few years to decompose. “It’s unfortunate that people don’t equate litter with organic litter. They think it\u0027s acceptable but obviously it\u0027s not,  even in the countryside. Our advice is that whatever goes up should go down.”Australian fisherman finds message in bottle that set sail 50 years ago French prosecutors recommend manslaughter charge for Air France over 2009 crashMoscow bars opposition candidates from city council election despite protestsComment: I don’t say this lightly, but Theresa May just gave the worst speech of her careerComment: The farcical EU is a cushy retirement home for has-been politiciansJoaquin \u0026#39El Chapo\u0026#39 Guzman accuses US government of \u0026#39torture\u0026#39 as he is sentenced to life in prisonAmerica\u0026#39s obesity problem spreads to its cats, new study findsMumbai attack \u0026#39mastermind\u0026#39 arrested as Imran Khan prepares to meet Donald TrumpAirport bureau de change outlets are charging \u0026#39extortionate\u0026#39 rates - here are the worst offenders\u0026#39Anti-vaxxer\u0026#39 parents face £2,000 fines as Germany makes measles vaccinations compulsoryHatton Garden mastermind claims dementia means he cannot go back to prisonComment: Why I resigned my government position to oppose HS2Impact of beauty industry on UK economy \u0026#39outstrips motor manufacturing\u0026#39Here come the girls: the rising Tory stars who could be set for promotion under BorisMini-Merkel handed \u0026#39ejector seat\u0026#39 job of German defence ministerComment: Transgender \u0026#39motherlessness\u0026#39 is a chilly fiction to impose on childrenComment: Donald Trump\u0026#39s crass attacks on immigrants were not just morally wrong, but strategically short-sightedTwisted carers jailed for murdering vulnerable Scottish teenagerSoldier archaeologists unearth musket balls and amputated leg bones at Battle of Waterloo field hospital siteUS and Italian police arrest 19 alleged mafiosi as organised crime clan tries to reclaim old turf in Sicily We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/07/17/TELEMMGLPICT000203995335_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqek9vKm18v_rkIPH9w2GMNoGXySPv9M1Jbe0Fc3Bi1Fk.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"going dump now like going customs telegraph readers rubbish","story":" readers argued that fly-tipping in their area had increased following the introduction of charges to dispose of household wasteA government review has been launched into the ‘arbitrary fees’, dubbed the rubbish-tip ‘tax’, charged by councils for householders to dump waste at rubbish tips. In response to the news,  readers shared their own experiences of trying to dispose of waste properly, only to be hit with charges.

They were a central part of a mission watched around the world, one which would define the century that followed, and which required intensive intelligence and ingenuity beyond our imagining\u0026nbsp– but at the moment they were engaged in housekeeping and sleeping.Now is the anniversary of perhaps the most unusual part of the Moon mission: that intermediate period after astronauts had completed the all-important liftoff, and as they waited, quietly drifting through space, on their way to the Moon.The launch happened on 16 July, 1969. The landing happened four days later, on 20 July.Between those days were a strange and eerie silence, filled with activities that would be humdrum were they not happening inside of the most ambitious activity ever launched by humankind.As the three astronauts – Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins –\u0026nbspfloated serenely through space, they began to think about what would happen at Earth. They were travelling at immense speed which meant that they had left the Earth quicker than many of those who had come along to watch would be able to get out of the parking lots they\u0027d viewed it from.Created with Sketch.

Collins was assisted by his two colleagues to separate the command module from the third stage of the Saturn rocket, and then spin it around and connect with the lunar module known as Eagle that would be used to descend to the service.Apollo 11 launch video shows immense power of Saturn V rocketThis of course was a critical maneuver in the flight plan, Aldrin later said.\u0026nbspIf the separation and docking did not work, we would return to Earth.There was also the possibility of an in-space collision and the subsequent decompression of our cabin, so we were still in our spacesuits as Mike separated us from the Saturn third stage. Critical as the maneuver is, I felt no apprehension about it, and if there was the slightest inkling of concern it disappeared quickly as the entire separation and docking proceeded perfectly to completion.The nose of Columbia was now connected to the top of the Eagle and heading for the Moon as we watched the Saturn third stage venting, a propulsive maneuver causing it to move slowly away from us.After that was completed, the really stressful work was over. The astronauts could get to sitting out the journey, waiting until they reached their distant target.By the next day, the astronauts were able to darken the windows with covers that served as curtains, and try and get some sleep as the command module slowly rotated them through space. They\u0027d spend the following days doing chores and talking with Earth.During those intermediate days, there was considerably less activity on board the craft. Nasa\u0027s official timeline – which gives detailed information on absolutely everything the crew did – lists only a few activities over the course of the 17th and 18th, as the three astronauts floated through space.On 17 July, for instance, the crew simply conducted three TV transmissions and did one small burn of their engines to correct their course. The day after, there was another TV transmission and a quick journey into the lunar module and back so that it could be inspected ahead of the landing.But the day later, as they approached the Moon and, the atmosphere would change.Day four\u0026nbsphas a decidedly different feel to it, Collins later said.\u0026nbspInstead of nine hours\u0027 sleep, I get seven –\u0026nbspand fitful ones at that.Despite our concentrated effort to conserve our energy on the way to the Moon, the pressure is overtaking us (or me at least), and I feel that all of us are aware that the honeymoon is over and we are about to lay our little pink bodies on the line.At this point, everything became much more real: for one, the astronauts could once again see the Moon properly for the first time in nearly a day. They were now in orbit around the Moon, and it was vividly clear.The Moon I have known all my life, that two-dimensional small yellow disk in the sky, has gone away somewhere, to be replaced by the most awesome sphere I have ever seen, said Collins later.To begin with it is huge, completely filling our window. Second, it is three-dimensional. The belly of it bulges out\u0026nbsptoward\u0026nbspus in such a pronounced fashion that I almost feel I can reach out and touch it. To add to the dramatic effect, we can see the stars again. We are in the shadow of the Moon now, and the elusive stars have reappeared.At this point, the work to get ready to touch the lunar surface begins. The astronauts each carry out the checks that would try and ensure that the descent was as safe as possible, and that the lander that would carry them down was as secure as it could possibly be.Collins would spent yet more time on his own, waiting, as Aldrin and Armstrong jumped around the lunar surface. As they did, he waited, floating above the Moon – occasionally disappearing behind it and being plunged into the all-consuming quiet of the far side of the Moon –\u0026nbspand waiting for his two colleagues to make their return, before heading back to Earth.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Housing costs were also deducted to account for income differences between outright homeowners, mortgage holders and renters.\u0026nbspThe recent drop in incomes forms part of a wider stagnation in living standards since the financial crisis, caused primarily by a severe slowdown in productivity growth, the Resolution Foundation said.\u0026nbsp“Restoring this – via greater investment in skills and capital across the UK, and resolving Brexit uncertainty – should be a top priority for the next prime minister,” it added.Rising output per hour accounted for two-thirds of\u0026nbspthe UK\u0027s overall economic growth before the financial crash, but just\u0026nbspover a fifth of growth since then, the report noted. Population growth has replaced productivity gains as the engine of economic expansion since 2007.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBritain predicted to fall into recession after no-deal BrexitAverage household incomes\u0026nbsphave been propped up since then by\u0026nbspmore people entering work and a halt to a century-long decline in working hours.The researchers also found that income inequality has “rocketed” over the past half-century and called on the next leader of the country to ensure a more equal distribution of income growth.However, that is the opposite of what the ongoing leadership campaign has focused on, they said\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspin apparent criticism of Boris Johnson, the frontrunner, who has promised to raise the threshold at which the higher rate of income tax kicks in. The move was widely criticised as handing more money to the better-off.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At the same time, the benefit freeze and other welfare cuts substantially reduced the real value of working-age social security.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Inveraray pipe band parades through the town at the start of the Highland Games in Inverarary, ScotlandExtinction Rebellion Activists block roads near the Tron Clock tower in GlasgowSerbia\u0027s Novak Djokovic raises the winner\u0027s trophy after beating Switzerland\u0027s Roger Federer during their men\u0027s singles final on day thirteen of the 2019 Wimbledon Championships at The All England Lawn Tennis ClubThe referee counts Nathan Gorman out as Daniel Dubois looks on during the British Heavyweight Title fight between Daniel Dubois and Nathan Gorman at The O2 Arena in LondonGiant Panda, Yang Guang, exploring his new home at Edinburgh Zoo after moving in last weekEngland\u0027s captain Eoin Morgan, left, celebrates with teammate Joe Root after winning their Cricket World Cup semi-final match against Australia at Edgbaston in Birmingham.

Housing costs were also deducted to account for income differences between outright homeowners, mortgage holders and renters.\u0026nbspThe recent drop in incomes forms part of a wider stagnation in living standards since the financial crisis, caused primarily by a severe slowdown in productivity growth, the Resolution Foundation said.\u0026nbsp“Restoring this – via greater investment in skills and capital across the UK, and resolving Brexit uncertainty – should be a top priority for the next prime minister,” it added.Rising output per hour accounted for two-thirds of\u0026nbspthe UK\u0027s overall economic growth before the financial crash, but just\u0026nbspover a fifth of growth since then, the report noted. Population growth has replaced productivity gains as the engine of economic expansion since 2007.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBritain predicted to fall into recession after no-deal BrexitAverage household incomes\u0026nbsphave been propped up since then by\u0026nbspmore people entering work and a halt to a century-long decline in working hours.The researchers also found that income inequality has “rocketed” over the past half-century and called on the next leader of the country to ensure a more equal distribution of income growth.However, that is the opposite of what the ongoing leadership campaign has focused on, they said\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspin apparent criticism of Boris Johnson, the frontrunner, who has promised to raise the threshold at which the higher rate of income tax kicks in. The move was widely criticised as handing more money to the better-off.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 443 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.543 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1343 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1443 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1743 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2143 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2743 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2943 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3143 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3643 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4343 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail.

But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3643 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4343 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. Ed Sheeran’s new album is bland, sincere and hygienically preparedWhy do celebrities find it so hard to play themselves?Intriguingly, the Moscow statue is not the first time Sheeran has served as inspiration for a statue. In 2016, a Sheeran-inspired pig statue wearing a plaid shirt and sporting messy red hair was planted in Ipswich, near Sheeran’s hometown of Framlingham. Named “Ed Sheer-Ham”, the statue was met with support from Sheeran himself.“I’m really excited to have a pig sculpture made in my honour,” he said in a statement.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 61Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.161 Lucie trying - and failing - to make ‘bev’ happenLove Island is known for adding new slang to the British lexicon, but 21-year-old Lucie’s firm insistence that ‘bev’ means a hot man failed to catch on.261 Amber’s anti-chemistry with Callum Straight-talking Amber quickly made mincemeat of Callum, the first boy she coupled up with. After correcting him when he said he looked younger than his 28 years, she confirmed it was his wrinkles which were aging him. She would go on to diss his sunglasses before ditching him for Anton during the next coupling.Sensitive boxer Tommy has been vocal about his love for Miley Cyrus’ teen sitcom since day one. His fandom reached new heights when he serenaded Curtis with a rendition of her hit song ‘The Climb’ to illustrate his path to winning Lucie’s heart. Aww.Blonde surfer Lucie was an instant hit in the villa, with almost every boy trying a cheeky graft. She seemed torn between Tommy and Joe, who each went nuclear in their attempt to woo her. Tommy pledged that he would crawl to the moon and back for her after knowing her for around 24 hours. Despite this, Joe’s jealous moping eventually won out. The confident Scotsman’s seduction skills manage to be both slippery smooth yet wildly erratic. His mile-a-minute chat has failed to land with any of the Love Island ladies, leading his to receive a cold shoulder from from Lucie, Anna and Mollie Mae. The raunchy challenge saw the boys strip down to chaps and speedos before hopping on a bucking bronco and getting covered in paint splatter. Performances ranged from smooth (Michael and Sherif) to deeply awkward (Callum and Joe).Amy had a minor wobble when newcomer Mollie Mae picked her man Curtis to join her for a date in the hot tub. She shouldn’t have worried: Curtis firmly friendzoned Mollie Mae and settled in for a gossip about his fellow housemates instead.Anton seemed confident at the first recoupling that pharmacist Anna would choose him. His confident smile on hearing Anna compliment her mystery love’s body quickly turned into disappointment when he realised she had been talking about Sherif.961 Calum leaves the villaThe aircraft engineer barely seemed to grace our screens before he was ejected after Mollie Mae chose to couple up with Tommy. 1061 Tommy makes his first cup of tea Tommy shocked the nation when he revealed he didn’t know how to make a cup of peppermint tea. With a lot of coaching from Sherif, the boxer managed to impress Mollie Mae without her realising the truth.1161 Tommy convinces himself he made an omeletteEncouraged by his success, Tommy tried to step up his culinary game by impressing Mollie Mae with a breakfast omelette (with Curtis doing the actual cooking.) Tommy even seemed to convince himself that he cooked the omelette, although he was rumbled after Sherif let slip who really made it.1261 Yewande’s quest for love Gorgeous scientist Yewande had been unlucky in love in the villa – until she was picked for a date by newcomer Danny. The rest of the Islanders encouraged her fledgling romance, from putting in a good word with Danny to criticising Mollie Mae’s attempt to woo the new boy for herself. Nine days into the series Love Island bosses confirmed that Sherif had been suddenly ejected from the show after “breaking the villa rules.” The 20-year-old confirmed his departure was due to his “poor judgement”, but it remains unknown which rule he broke. 1461 Curtis and Amy become a half-couple Amy may have never had a boyfriend before, but she was the first girl to make it official in the villa – sort of. During a date in the hideaway, Curtis asked her to become exclusive, which ended up with her getting the very high school label of ‘half-girlfriend.’1561 Amber opens up Amber gained a reputation for withering looks and cutting putdowns, but one man was able to get past her icy exterior. Firefighter Michael proved he could take her self-proclaimed a attitude, and was rewarded – on the second try – with a kiss.With Sherif out the villa, Anton resumed his moves on Anna. This time, it went even worse than before, with the Scotsman inadvertently comparing her with Mollie Mae, calling Anna beautiful ‘on the inside’. He thought the chat went well a dressing down from Amber and Michael soon put him in his place. Tommy was tasked with making a starter for his date with new girl Maura. “I’ve never put so much effort into cheese in my life,” he said, as he carved out lovehearts from limp sliced cheddar. The result, two slices of ketchup and mayo-smeared white bread, proved that Maura’s continuing lust for the 20-year-old boxer is made of powerful stuff. 1861 The girls freak out over Maura and Elma Amber, Yewande and Mollie Mae watched their respective partners meet the new girls from the balcony. “Confident sh*ts,” fumed Amber, while Mollie made fun of their flirty laughter.Michael brands Amber\u0027s behaviour as childish after the beauty therapist heckled his date with Maura.2061 Tommy and Mollie Mae fightMollie Mae wasn\u0027t happy when Tommy seemed interested in new girl Maura, and wasn\u0027t afraid to let the boxer know how she felt.2161 Amy and Lucie fall outLucie tearfully stood up for herself after Amy accused her of not spending enough time with the girls. Is Lucie just not a girl’s girl, or did Amy drive her away?2261 Maura gets a rise out of TommyMaura had her sights set on the 20-year-old boxer from the start, and things got steamy when she got him into bed. Her straight-up seduction techniques proved a bit too exciting for Tommy, who got a little hot and bothered under the covers. Just wait until he sees her eat an ice lolly…Maura went full factor 50 on Tommy when she ambushed him on the sofa.

Amy was not happy, storming off followed by an apologetic Curtis.Arabella stirred the pot when she accused Yewande of being overly-possessive of Danny, telling her a few uncomplimentary remarks Danny had made about her to boot. A devastated Yewande soon realised that her fledgling romance was in serious jeopardy.3161 Maura is livid at TomMaura’s carrot-swallowing skills won her first place during the gym bunny challenge, giving her a night in the hideaway as a prize. Maura chose Tom to join her, but things quickly went south after she overheard him brag to the boys about finding out whether or not the Irish beauty was “all mouth.” Tom got a scathing dressing down, and a night in the hideaway was firmly off the cards.3261 Yewande leaves the islandDanny chose Arabella during a recoupling, leaving Yewande as the eliminated singleton. She was devastated to leave best mates Amber and Anna, but Danny was left with a scathing parting shot: “What goes around comes around.” Ouch.3361 Danny faces the wrath of AmberAmber was furious after watching Danny kiss Arabella the same night that Yewande left the villa. She had some choice words for the model, although Danny stayed calm and collected during the confrontation.3461 Curtis and Tommy share an intimate momentAfter declaring how much their friendship meant to each other, Tommy and Curtis shared the season’s first bromance kiss. Perhaps if they ditched their girlfriends, Turtis could go all the way to the £50k?During a challenge which saw the islanders read the public’s tweets, some couples were left seriously shaken. Amy was called out for making Curtis feel “in the wrong,” Lucie and Tommy were named as a good potential couple and Mollie Mae was accused of faking her relationship with Tommy for the prize money.3661 Mollie Mae worries about LucieThe Twitter challenge made Mollie Mae re-examine Tommy’s close friendship with Lucie. After a chat with Mollie Mae, the boxer told Lucie they should stop being so affectionate with each other. A disgruntled Lucie complained about the new “rules” imposed on her, while also refusing to rule out a potential relationship with Tommy during a chat with the girls.Maura wasn’t happy to hear that Tom had called her “attention-seeking” and “cringey” behind her back. She stormed over and confronted him, later making it clear he had blown his second chance.3861 Arabella and Tom get dumped from the islandAfter four couples were left vulnerable following a public vote, the three safe couples decided that Arabella and Tom should be the pair to leave the villa. Maura comforted a devastated Danny, but didn’t appear to be that heartbroken about losing Tom.3961 Lucie confesses her feelings for Tommy Encouraged by Anton, Lucie revealed to Tommy that she would be interested in rekindling their romance. Tommy told her he was happy with Mollie Mae, and later told Mollie about Lucie’s confession, leading Mollie to brand the Cornish surfer “muggy” for not coming to her first.4061 The girls take a holiday to Casa AmorSix new boys entered the game when the girls took a trip to Casa Amor. A thrilled Maura took an instant liking to Dennon, while 6ft 7in basketball player Ovie immediately cracked on with Anna, leaving her relationship with Jordan in jeopardy. 4161 Six new girls cause the boys to have doubtsBack at the villa, heads were also turning at the arrival of six new girls. Jordan flirted with Jourdan, Anton shared a bed with Belle and Danny seemed ready to move on from his Arabella heartbreak. Michael and Curtis began to question their own seemingly-solid partnerships, thanks to pretty newcomer Joanna. Anton remained hopeful about his odds of finally finding love: “I’ve got six new chances to not get pied.”4261 Curtis tells Jourdan he wants to recouple with herCurtis took a risk and laid it all out to Jourdan, telling her he would choose to recouple with her over Amy. Smitten with Danny, Jourdan politely brushed him off: “Stay loyal to the situation you’re in now, because I need you as a friend,” she said.Michael and Amber’s romance appeared dead in the water as Michael finally made his move on new girl Joanna.4461 Amy confesses she has fallen in love with Curtis4561 There were some awkward recouplings after Casa Amor…Amy was thrilled that Curtis had chosen to recouple with her – although she was soon to find out that he had made a move on another girl and told everyone that their relationship needs work. Michael recoupled with Joanna, leaving Amber single – and absolutely fuming. Poor Jordan saw Anna return with basketball player Ovie, although she was more apologetic about it than Michael. Mollie Mae collapsed into relieved tears when she saw Tommy waiting for her, holding her favourite stuffed elephant toy Ellie-Belly. Anton finally found himself in a romantic couple with Belle, Lucie coupled with new blonde bombshell George and Maura seemed keen on sensitive Marvin.4761 Michael and Curtis catch some serious heatAfter seeing Amber in tears, Anna went straight for Michael’s jugular, accusing him of leading Amber on by not communicating his doubts about their relationship earlier. Michael went on the defensive, calling Anna and Amber “childish.” Meanwhile a tearful Amy gave Curtis a dressing down for making moves on Jourdan: “Do you know how worthless this makes me feel?”4861 Maura serves some cold, hard truthWhile Amy was discussing her drama with Curtis to Maura and Lucie, she seemed on the verge of forgiveness: “I love him,” she said. A doubtful Lucie interjected: “But does he love you?” A furious Maura took a less subtle approach: “Why are you asking her that? He doesn’t!” 4961 Lucie tells Tommy she has feelings for him – againAfter Tommy took Lucie aside to check they were still friends, she confessed she’s still attracted to him, wishes she had chosen him over Joe and was thinking about him the whole time she was in Casa Amor. Once again, Tommy brushed her off saying he was still smitten with Mollie Mae – perhaps third time lucky, Lucie?5061 Tommy and Mollie Mae get seriousAfter the latest declaration from Lucie, Tommy reassured Mollie Mae by telling her how much he liked her. Mollie Mae confessed she could see herself falling in love with him, before Tommy admitted he was already falling.5161 Anna and Jordan rekindle their romanceWhen Anna returned to the villa and saw Jordan was still single, she seemed to question her new romance with Ovie. After a few flirtations conversations with her old flame, she told Ovie that she and Jordan might not be over after all…5261 Curtis and Amy break upAmy was so determined to work out what had happened to suddenly derail her perfect half-relationship that she made a checklist to get to the bottom of it. But after a heartfelt chat, Curtis effectively ended things by telling Amy he couldn’t guarantee he would stay loyal to her. 5361 Maura reveals this years’ biggest plot twistIn a characteristically unpredictable move, Maura revealed to Lucie she had a crush – on the newly-single Curtis. “I want him to teach me how to dance,” she said, calling him “gorgeous”.Villa BFFs Maura and Lucie both grew tired of their Casa Amor romances, so agreed to tell the lads – as a group. George and Marvin were sat down and pied together, with Marvin reacting with outrage and George barely keeping a straight face. Ovie may have seemed like her perfect man in Casa Amor, but Jordan caught Anna’s eye once again when she returned to the villa. Anna sat down for a chat with the laid-back basketball player, but things got heated quickly. Ovie stormed off before Anna headed up for a sneaky balcony snog with Jordan. 5661 Tommy pulls off the perfect proposalTommy decided it was time to ask Mollie Mae to be his girlfriend. As with cooking, writing isn’t Tommy’s strong point, so he enlisted Curtis to write him a love note in eyeliner (who knew there were no pens in the villa?) Mollie Mae found the note tied to her toy Elly Belly, and happily agreed to making things official with Tommy.Not long after Danny coupled up with Yewande and Arabella the two girls were sent packing, leading presenter Iain Sterling to nickname Danny ‘the travel agent’ for his talent in sending girls to the airport. New partner Jourdan was the final girl to fall under Danny’s curse as the pair received the least votes, although this time Danny was booted from the villa too.5861 Amy leaves on heartbreaking noteAs she prepared to leave the villa, Amy took her ex Curtis aside for a chat. Days after Curtis had ended their relationship, she told him: You turned my whole world around and turned it into some kind of craziness. All I\u0027ve ever wanted is for you to be happy. And you\u0027re not going to be able to be happy if I\u0027m still here. As Curtis broke down in tears, she continued: I want us to be best friends and I want us to both find someone... I\u0027m not going to be ready in the next three weeks to meet someone else.He might be coupled up with Joanna, but it was Michael’s ex Amber who got his pulse racing fastest during the dirty dancing challenge. Amber was glad to hear it, saying: “So now I\u0027ve at least got something, I can\u0027t just sit and mope around because I know I raised his heart rate the most!6061 Anton and Belle hit the rocksShe may have shaved his bum, but Belle reached breaking point after a series of slip-ups from Anton. She wasn’t happy that he kissed Anna in the Snog, Marry, Pie challenge, and a confrontation ended in a heated exchange at the nightclub6161 Joanna and Michael say an awkward goodbyeAfter it was revealed that Joanna and Michael couldn’t stay in the villa together, their fellow Islanders chose to send Joanna packing. She was less than impressed with Michael after it became clear he wouldn’t follow her out of the door, refusing a hug and labelling him a “snake” for staying. 161 Lucie trying - and failing - to make ‘bev’ happenLove Island is known for adding new slang to the British lexicon, but 21-year-old Lucie’s firm insistence that ‘bev’ means a hot man failed to catch on.261 Amber’s anti-chemistry with Callum Straight-talking Amber quickly made mincemeat of Callum, the first boy she coupled up with. After correcting him when he said he looked younger than his 28 years, she confirmed it was his wrinkles which were aging him. She would go on to diss his sunglasses before ditching him for Anton during the next coupling.Sensitive boxer Tommy has been vocal about his love for Miley Cyrus’ teen sitcom since day one. His fandom reached new heights when he serenaded Curtis with a rendition of her hit song ‘The Climb’ to illustrate his path to winning Lucie’s heart. Aww.Blonde surfer Lucie was an instant hit in the villa, with almost every boy trying a cheeky graft. She seemed torn between Tommy and Joe, who each went nuclear in their attempt to woo her. Tommy pledged that he would crawl to the moon and back for her after knowing her for around 24 hours. Despite this, Joe’s jealous moping eventually won out. The confident Scotsman’s seduction skills manage to be both slippery smooth yet wildly erratic. His mile-a-minute chat has failed to land with any of the Love Island ladies, leading his to receive a cold shoulder from from Lucie, Anna and Mollie Mae. The raunchy challenge saw the boys strip down to chaps and speedos before hopping on a bucking bronco and getting covered in paint splatter. Performances ranged from smooth (Michael and Sherif) to deeply awkward (Callum and Joe).Amy had a minor wobble when newcomer Mollie Mae picked her man Curtis to join her for a date in the hot tub. She shouldn’t have worried: Curtis firmly friendzoned Mollie Mae and settled in for a gossip about his fellow housemates instead.Anton seemed confident at the first recoupling that pharmacist Anna would choose him. His confident smile on hearing Anna compliment her mystery love’s body quickly turned into disappointment when he realised she had been talking about Sherif.961 Calum leaves the villaThe aircraft engineer barely seemed to grace our screens before he was ejected after Mollie Mae chose to couple up with Tommy. 1061 Tommy makes his first cup of tea Tommy shocked the nation when he revealed he didn’t know how to make a cup of peppermint tea. With a lot of coaching from Sherif, the boxer managed to impress Mollie Mae without her realising the truth.1161 Tommy convinces himself he made an omeletteEncouraged by his success, Tommy tried to step up his culinary game by impressing Mollie Mae with a breakfast omelette (with Curtis doing the actual cooking.) Tommy even seemed to convince himself that he cooked the omelette, although he was rumbled after Sherif let slip who really made it.1261 Yewande’s quest for love Gorgeous scientist Yewande had been unlucky in love in the villa – until she was picked for a date by newcomer Danny. The rest of the Islanders encouraged her fledgling romance, from putting in a good word with Danny to criticising Mollie Mae’s attempt to woo the new boy for herself. Nine days into the series Love Island bosses confirmed that Sherif had been suddenly ejected from the show after “breaking the villa rules.” The 20-year-old confirmed his departure was due to his “poor judgement”, but it remains unknown which rule he broke. 1461 Curtis and Amy become a half-couple Amy may have never had a boyfriend before, but she was the first girl to make it official in the villa – sort of. During a date in the hideaway, Curtis asked her to become exclusive, which ended up with her getting the very high school label of ‘half-girlfriend.’1561 Amber opens up Amber gained a reputation for withering looks and cutting putdowns, but one man was able to get past her icy exterior. Firefighter Michael proved he could take her self-proclaimed a attitude, and was rewarded – on the second try – with a kiss.With Sherif out the villa, Anton resumed his moves on Anna. This time, it went even worse than before, with the Scotsman inadvertently comparing her with Mollie Mae, calling Anna beautiful ‘on the inside’. He thought the chat went well a dressing down from Amber and Michael soon put him in his place. Tommy was tasked with making a starter for his date with new girl Maura. “I’ve never put so much effort into cheese in my life,” he said, as he carved out lovehearts from limp sliced cheddar. The result, two slices of ketchup and mayo-smeared white bread, proved that Maura’s continuing lust for the 20-year-old boxer is made of powerful stuff. 1861 The girls freak out over Maura and Elma Amber, Yewande and Mollie Mae watched their respective partners meet the new girls from the balcony. “Confident sh*ts,” fumed Amber, while Mollie made fun of their flirty laughter.Michael brands Amber\u0027s behaviour as childish after the beauty therapist heckled his date with Maura.2061 Tommy and Mollie Mae fightMollie Mae wasn\u0027t happy when Tommy seemed interested in new girl Maura, and wasn\u0027t afraid to let the boxer know how she felt.2161 Amy and Lucie fall outLucie tearfully stood up for herself after Amy accused her of not spending enough time with the girls. Is Lucie just not a girl’s girl, or did Amy drive her away?2261 Maura gets a rise out of TommyMaura had her sights set on the 20-year-old boxer from the start, and things got steamy when she got him into bed. Her straight-up seduction techniques proved a bit too exciting for Tommy, who got a little hot and bothered under the covers. Just wait until he sees her eat an ice lolly…Maura went full factor 50 on Tommy when she ambushed him on the sofa.

Jake went down again and again and she just remained still for him\u0027Click to followThe IndependentA giant manta ray has been filmed appearing to beg a professional er for help saving her life.The three-metre-wide sea creature is shown swimming up to snorkelling guide Jake Wilton and flipping over in the water – apparently to show him fish hooks embedded in her right eye.The footage, caught near Ningaloo Reef off Western Australia’s north west coast, seems to show the manta ray then staying perfectly still as Mr Wilton gently removes the potentially deadly spikes.The animal – well known to locals and affectionately nicknamed Freckles – then swims away with a flourish as the er emerges triumphantly with the hooks.Monty Halls, a British marine biologist aboard the boat at the time, said: “That manta absolutely understood what was going on. Jake went down again and again and she just remained still for him.”Created with Sketch.Underwater Photographer of the Year Show all 45Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Winner: Behaviour and overall winner. I worry that this image will refuel the public\u0027s imbalanced perception of sharks but as an image capturing behaviour it has drama, adrenaline, grace, beauty and finality. That\u0027s a very rare combination in one image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: Wide Angle. The first moment I viewed this image I knew it would be a strong contender. For me it\u0027s the symmetry of the Humpback and the balance between the er and calf. Everything about it is in perfect alignment. The shape of the tail in relation to the four corners of the frame, not to mention the position of the free er and calf. Superb imagery at its very best.  Many congratulations Francois. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Winner: Macro. Fabio’s use of long exposure and panning has turned a classic portrait of a Sepiola into an unforgettable one. The sharp and ghosted images of the bobtail squid balance pleasingly in the frame and combined with the outstretched tentacles give the feeling of the cephalopod lunging for its prey. An innovative and most deserving category winner. - Alex Mustard (Judge) It is hard to imagine what it must have been like to have experienced such a large scale natural spectacle as this but this image, perfectly composed and timed, gets close. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: British Waters Macro. A mantra of mine is \u0027It\u0027s not what it is. It\u0027s where it is\u0027 and this long clawed Squat lobster is in a perfect position to make a memorable image. The author, instead of \u0027blasting\u0027 it with light, has gone in the opposite direction by restricting the strobe into a snooted spotlight in order to illuminate just the features of the lobster and the dainty sea loch anemones. It\u0027s an example of \u0027Isolation lighting\u0027 at its very best. A great deal of uw photographers invest their time in what they want to illuminate. This is an example which in my opinion illustrates features that they do not want to illuminate, hence the punchy black background and the soft delicate hues of dark sand, facial features topped off by the sea loch anemones. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Marine Conservation. The problems of plastic pollution and ghost fishing are both illustrated by this struggling loggerhead turtle. I am happy to learn this inidual was lucky enough to survive this deathtrap thanks to the photographer - Alex Mustard (Judge)What a chin, what a forehead, what a character. This picture has portrait written all over it, and such a fascinating species ideally suited to this close focus wide angle approach. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Portrait. Superb impact from the very first moment it was presented. Perfect composition within the image frame and the understated colours. To top it off the authors comments above say it all... a Smiling Happy Angel\u0027s Face. One of my favourites from the entire competition. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Winner: Up \u0026amp Coming. Beautiful split shot with both a perfect under and over split. A very strong favourite with all the judges and one of the best examples I have seen of this type of image for some time. Just Superb! - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Black \u0026amp White. It must be 11 out of 10 for this groundbreaking image. Conception, interpretation and perseverance coupled with black and white’s ability to concentrate on the key elements. It gets better with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Grey seals are a perennial favourite in UPY as one of the UK\u0027s star wildlife attractions. This upside-down portrait is quirky and cute and easily won the affections of the judging panel. Great to see an overseas photographer coming to the UK to show us how it\u0027s done! - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: Compact. This image was a very popular choice between the panel. Ideal for a split rendition. What makes this a winner for me, not withstanding the double exposure is the sympathetic balance of light \u0026amp colour connected  between the top half and bottom of the image frame. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: British Waters Compact. Does British ing get any better than a fun encounter with a grey seal pup? This youngster’s relaxed and curious face is captured perfectly by Martin, making us all want to be there too. - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: British Waters Living Together. Images tell stories but well thought out and executed ones speak volumes. This is such an example which feeds the eye with tales of the seaside on summer days, lively marine spectacles and excited human interaction. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)1545 Isles of Scilly, UKWinner: British Waters Wide Angle. Photographers often feel competition shots must be packed with new tricks to win. At UPY we always appreciate classic technique when it raises the bar of what has been done before. Rob\u0027s full technicolour wide angle scenic reveals the richness of UK seas with an elegant simplicity that is incredibly challenging to pull off in British conditions. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Wrecks. So simple yet so powerful the additional lighting of the turret and the main er perfectly positioned. This was a very strong category this year with a deserved winner and it\u0027s refreshing to read the acknowledgement to Leigh Bishop\u0027s pioneering work. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) The iconic silhouette of a seahorse is a graphically powerful picture. Here Zarina has raised that to another level with the addition of a red filter to her snooted strobe, reminiscent of a rim-lit animal at sunset. - Alex Mustard (Judge) All the judges found this to be probably the most distressing image to view but its uncompromising message must be seen by as many people as possible. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)As a subject we have seen our fair share of these colourful characters but this one shone through and the eggs almost look as if they have been inidually lit! - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Superb image with a perfect line across the split. Good exposure both above and below the water line and such an ideal subject to cap it all off. Excellent work. - Martin Edge (Judge)This is an excellent example for this category. It takes a tried and trusted angle but completely lifts it by using the fabric. It becomes more than an image a concept, a transition, a rebirth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)2245 Isles of Scilly, UKThis image stood out on many levels. Composition, colour vibrancy and contrast combined with an unusual angle kept us coming back to it and helped it rise in the rankings with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Perfect control of angle, light and focus. This was always up there with all of the judges. A clear favourite just like Nick Park’s genius creations. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I\u0027ve seen many images of eel and shrimp around Indonesia, however you have taken this two steps forward. 1) With your excellent idea to snoot the eye and 2) with your backlight on the shrimp. You can expect many photographers to practice your technique in the months to come. Congratulations for your vision. Very well thought out and executed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    It’s not what you’ve got, it’s what you do with it. The split may have been elusive but well worth the effort. This is a deceptively subtle excellent delivery. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)I have witnessed this behaviour from the surface with its high velocity \u0027testosterone and tonnage\u0027 and I remember thinking how happy I was to be in the boat. To have the presence of mind to time this shot whilst one\u0027s senses are being bombarded is heroic in my view. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) What an amazing moment. From the expression on the face of the unicornfish fleeing for its life, to the hunting pack of sharks, especially the leader with its mouth snapping open that fan out diagonally across this composition. And that is without considering what a great challenge it is to shoot these images of split second action, in the dead of night, underwater. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  There is so much energy in this image. If you look at it long enough you can begin to see just a hint of movement of all the fish around the coral. The colours are realistic and this top down shot works well.  - Martin Edge (Judge)A jaw-dropping wide angle scene with sharks, rays and mountains. A winning combination in the Up \u0026amp Coming category. - Alex Mustard (Judge)3045 Loch Long, Argyll and ButeThis is a subtle image with light and detail that are a delight to explore. The sunset, trees and underwater scene combine to create a wonderful feeling of the place. We particularly like how the composition allows the line of the shore to be continued underwater by the seaweeds.  - Alex Mustard (Judge)Photographing pike underwater is one thing but finding your own underwater artistic stamp is quite another matter. With this particular image the author has done just that! By using a slow shutter speed of 18th sec and a panning technique from right to left gives the impression of movement whilst the pike is pin sharp. - Martin Edge (Judge)Arthur’s image scores with both its foreground and background. The deadman’s fingers soft coral make an attractive foreground, enhanced by the crab sheltering within, and the striking sunbeams create beauty and atmosphere in the background. I also love the feeling of depth created by the legs of the jetty reaching up for the surface. - Alex Mustard (Judge)In recent UPY competitions UK macro images have lacked their overseas counterpart\u0027s flair and imagination but this magnificent shot raises the bar for everyone else to follow. World class from the UK at last. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Memorable photographs of people underwater are deceptively difficult and require both the photographer and model to be at the top of their game. The simplicity of the composition works to highlight the delicious details in the girl\u0027s pose. - Alex Mustard (Judge) This is a timeless scene that communicates a detailed story. The cavern, the silversides sheltering, the tarpon hunting and the er kneeling reverentially, taking it all in. It is a fabulous use of black and white to tell this story of shadows and light. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Sometimes it is the small detail which contributes so much. The white of the eye and the row of teeth in what could be construed as a smile convey mischief and menace in equal measures. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Once again Tobias you have succeeded in capturing one of the most photographed wrecks in the Red Sea and photographing it in a completely different way. You push the boundaries of wreck photography and I congratulate you for your vision and forward thinking of new ideas. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Perfect composition and framed against the stark black background. However it\u0027s the contrast of white on black which attracts the eye again and again every time this particular image popped up to greet us. The colour of the nudibranch was sufficiently bright enough to raise our senses again and again as it proceeded through the competition.  The soft delicate treatment of the snooted flash is also very well managed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    This shot puts you right in the picture and records a special encounter in a very special place. Every element contributes and the lucky or intended curve of the split creates great spatial depth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Symmetry, graphic simplicity and for once in UK waters a black background which contributes to a positive outer worldly delivery. A mould breaker. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I see and judge many images of the sockeye salmon but this is one of the best. The alignment of the two salmon not to mention the composition within the frame.  The surgy peak of the action is in perfect symmetry with the window which provides the viewer with topside influences of the trees against a vivid blue sky. There is so much image depth in this example. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Such a delicate image yet so full of emotion. There are times when there are no more words needed. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)UPY loves seahorse photos! Especially when they capture a fleeting behaviour, such as this. But we hadn\u0027t realised during judging that this was a new species of seahorse, nor did with know the incredible backstory behind this picture, we just loved the moment. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  Whether or not you like fashion photography underwater you would be hard pressed to see a more beautiful combination of complimentary colours and a very elegant pose. A very well executed image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)A portrait must leave you in no doubt. Simple lighting, illuminating all that is needed, captures this character. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Winner: Behaviour and overall winner. I worry that this image will refuel the public\u0027s imbalanced perception of sharks but as an image capturing behaviour it has drama, adrenaline, grace, beauty and finality.

Simple lighting, illuminating all that is needed, captures this character. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)The footage was released on Thursday by Ningaloo Marine Interactions, the tour company which Mr Wilton works for.The hero himself suggested it was all in a day’s work.First known nursery for giant manta rays discovered in Gulf of Mexico“I’m often guiding snorkellers in the area and it’s as if she recognised me and was trusting me to help her,” he said.“She got closer and closer and then started unfurling to present the eye to me. I knew we had to get the hooks out or she would have been in big trouble. I went for a few es down to see how she’d react to me being close to her.”When the animal stayed calm, he approached and took out the hooks.The manta stayed completely still in the water,” he said.“It’s pretty incredible behaviour if this is what happened,” said David Boyle, lecturer in marine biology at the University of Plymouth. “It’s not uncommon for animals – generally mammals – to interact with ers but for one in distress to seek out assistance would be novel indeed.”Manta rays are believed to be some of the most intelligent creatures in the ocean. Unlike stingrays, they don’t have an external spike and are generally harmless to humans.Experts believe the injured eye would have become infected, leading to blindness and possible death.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Gone is the ignorant Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) of the original in favour of a hardened badass who returns to the moon, accompanied by a group of space marines, to take on the alien queen. How many years between sequel and original? SevenIt wasn\u0027t until the arrival of Austin Powers sequel The Spy Who Shagged Me that Mike Myers\u0027s comic creations were fully wedged into the hearts of film lovers. If the original was the perfect introduction to Austin\u0027s groovy world, the follow-up was an altogether funnier, bigger and more quotable affair. How many years between sequel and original? TwoCapping off not only your own franchise but a decade-long series consisting of 22 films is no mean feat – and yet Avengers: Endgame balanced all the playing pieces to do so with gargantuan success. How many years between sequel and original? Seven437 Back to the Future Part II (1989)The first sequel to Robert Zemeckis\u0027s Back to the Future is an amusing adventure that sees Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) travel... well, back to the future, to prevent his own son from sabotaging the family legacy. How many years between sequel and original? FourIt was the addition of both Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny DeVito – as Catwoman and the Penguin, respectively – that made Tim Burton\u0027s sequel Batman Returns an even more memorable watch than the original. How many years between sequel and original? ThreeEach instalment of Richard Linklater\u0027s Before trilogy is as good as the last. But, if there is a peak, it surely arrives with number two – Before Sunset – which reunites would-be lovers Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) nine years after they first met in Before Sunrise (1995). How many years between sequel and original? NineThere\u0027s a blistering chase sequence midway through The Bourne Ultimatum involving Matt Damon\u0027s amnesiac spy and journalist Simon Ross (Paddy Considine). It\u0027s adeptly directed by Paul Greengrass – here at the top of his game – and is all the proof you need that the original trilogy improved with each new film. How many years between sequel and original? Five837 Bride of Frankenstein (1935)Depicting Mary Shelley\u0027s classic creature as a pleasant guy just looking for a companion, Bride of Frankenstein is one of the greatest monster movies, let alone sequels, in cinema history. How many years between sequel and original? FourBatman Begins may have been the perfect origin story for the caped crusader, but nothing could have prepared film fans for the classic its sequel would become. Christopher Nolan intelligently crafted The Dark Knight into one of the greatest follow-ups ever made, with several standout action sequences and an untouchable performance from Heath Ledger as the Joker. One for the ages. How many years between sequel and original? Three1037 Dawn of the Dead (1978)George A Romero ditched the entire cast of Night of the Living Dead for its first sequel, Dawn of the Dead, which showed the effects of the zombie apocalypse on a much larger scale than depicted in the black-and-white original. One of the most entertaining horror films ever made.  How many years between sequel and original? 10The glory you feel watching Hellboy II: The Golden Army comes from the knowledge that you\u0027re watching a studio allow Guillermo del Toro to do whatever the hell he wants. A scintillating oddity of a follow-up that surpasses the 2004 original within minutes. How many years between sequel and original? FourNot so much an improvement on the first as one that rips up its rule book completely: Sam Raimi took the character of Ash (Bruce Campbell), who viewers first met in influential 1981 horror The Evil Dead,\u0026nbspand placed him in the heart of what is essentially a slapstick comedy. How many years between sequel and original? SixAfter the lacklustre fourth instalment, Fast \u0026amp Furious 5 was the reinvention the series desperately needed. Bringing in Dwayne Johnson as the bad guy was a genius stroke and the final set-piece – a car dragging a bank vault through the streets of Rio – remains as entertaining as anything the long-running series has ever done. How many years between sequel and original? 10The Godfather Part II set the highest benchmark for what sequels should be, but so rarely are – a crucial chapter in a saga. The film won Robert De Niro an Oscar for his efforts, playing the same role Marlon Brando won an Oscar for two years before. This, alongside another film on this list, is one of two sequels to ever win Best Picture (keep scrolling to find out the other one). How many years between sequel and original? Two1537 The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)The fact that Sergio Leone had barely any money to make The Good, the Bad and the Ugly – the third film in his Man With no Name trilogy – fortuitously led to the casting of the relatively unknown Clint Eastwood. Leone\u0027s film, beautifully soundtracked by Ennio Morricone, is a masterwork that proves less is more: its most classic dialogue-free scenes derived from the fact that Leone had no time to shoot dialogue. How many years between sequel and original? Two1637 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)Gone was the warm glow of Hogwarts in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Alfonso Cuarón\u0027s adaptation of the JK Rowling novel proved the franchise could win widespread acclaim, as well as ticket receipts, if put in the hands of interesting directors. How many years between sequel and original? Three1737 How to Train Your Dragon 2 (2014)Could How to Train Your Dragon endure as one of the most beloved yet underrated franchises of all time? Quite possibly – and its first sequel, which features breathless flight sequences and animation to marvel at, is solid evidence of this. How many years between sequel and original? FourDespite essentially rehashing the plot of the first film, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a bolder, more exciting and, yes, deadlier outing for Jennifer Lawrence\u0027s heroine Katniss Everdeen. How many years between sequel and original? One1937 Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)If Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade isn\u0027t better than series opener Raiders of the Lost Ark, it\u0027s certainly as good. This is thanks to the addition of Sean Connery\u0027s Henry Jones Sr – the father of Harrison Ford\u0027s whip-cracking archaeologist. How many years between sequel and original? EightPerhaps it was down to relief that Iron Man 3 was so revered by critics (lest we forget Iron Man 2 is one of Marvel\u0027s biggest duds). But, Robert Downey Jr\u0027s third solo outing as Tony Starl boasts enough laughs and thrills, not to mention a doozy of a twist, that earns its placement on this list. How many years between sequel and original? FiveLethal Weapon 2 takes what made the original so fun – the wit and twist-filled action – and amps it up as far as it can possibly go. That it throws in Joe Pesci for good measure just makes the results even more sizzling. How many years between sequel and original? TwoLogan rectified the mistakes of Wolverine\u0027s earlier standalone films thanks to James Mangold\u0027s decision to place the character in a far grittier film than he was used to (it was rated 15 in the UK). The result remains a perfect send-off to one of X-Men\u0027s greatest characters, who first played the role in 2000.How many years between sequel and original? 17Gareth Evans\u0027s sequel to The Raid is more of the glorious same, only – somehow – more ambitious. Two hours and 30 minutes of breathlessly-paced fight sequences that\u0027s unlike anything caught on film before. How many years between sequel and original? Three2437 The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003)The second sequel to ever win Best Picture is all about the payoff. While each film in Peter Jackson\u0027s Lord of the Rings trilogy delivers in what it needs to, this final chapter balances all the plates to dish out an epic conclusion that surely would have been everything JRR Tolkien wanted from an adaptation of his classic novels. How many years between sequel and original? TwoNobody could have predicted quite how breathlessly entertaining Mad Max: Fury Road would be. George Miller\u0027s dystopian chase film refuses to relent from the very first second and is just as entertaining with every watch – and far superior to the Mel Gibson original, which was released in 1979. How many years between sequel and original? 36There has never been a bad Mission: Impossible film. However, since Christopher McQuarrie stepped into the fold as director, the series has taken just as many audacious leaps as its lead star, the stunt-loving Tom Cruise. Fallout is a multi-layered, twisty action film that will undoubtedly go down as a franchise classic. How many years between sequel and original? 22All it took was the spirit of Christmas for the Griswolds to get the film they deserved. Chevy Chase heads up this one liner-filled festive treat that\u0027s probably the only Vacation film worth your time. How many years between sequel and original? FourOne critic described Paddington 2 as the Godfather Part II of Peruvian Bear movies and they were not wrong. The sequel somehow manages to convey more charm than the original – which in itself is extremely charming – and has the benefit of starring Hugh Grant as a villainous actor named Phoenix Buchanan. A delight. How many years between sequel and original? ThreeAll eyes were on Shrek 2 thanks to the unprecedented success of the fantastic original, which was released in 2001. What people didn\u0027t expect, though, was that the follow-up would be just as hilarious and even more enchanting. How many years between sequel and original? ThreeSam Raimi managed to outdo himself with Spider-Man 2 (the first one remains a superhero standout) with help from Alfred Molina\u0027s Doctor Octopus and some nightmarish scenes in which the Evil Dead filmmaker delves into his bursting bag of horror movie tricks. How many years between sequel and original? Two3137 Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan (1982)By placing the emphasis on character as opposed to action, Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan righted the wrongs of the classic TV show\u0027s first big screen adventure, a dud that was released in 1979. The result is a staggeringly improved follow-up. How many years between sequel and original? thREEThe Empire Strikes Back would make this list for its twist alone, which ranks as one of the greatest in cinema history, but the film also represents so much more. Episode V established the Star Wars franchise\u0027s staying power by proving A New Hope was no fluke. How many years between sequel and original? Three3337 War for the Planet of the Apes (2017)With War for the Planet of the Apes, Fox\u0027s closing chapter of the rebooted trilogy, Matt Reeves delivered a near-faultless arthouse film parading as a mo-cap monkey-filled blockbuster. How many years between sequel and original?  SixIt would have been easy to chalk up 10 Cloverfield Lane\u0027s acclaim to the fact it was a secret up until a month before it was released. The fact remains, though, that this spiritual successor to 2008 found-footage thriller Cloverfield is a gruellingly tense chamber piece that\u0027s even more nail-biting than the first. How many years between sequel and original? EightThose who believed you couldn\u0027t get a more groundbreaking film than The Terminator likely burst a vessel after watching Judgement Day, a sequel that reshaped what people wanted from their action movies forevermore. It did so while subverting expectation in the most simplest of ways – by turning Arnie\u0027s killing machine, the terrifying villain in the first, into a cuddly force for good. How many years between sequel and original? SevenWhen Taika Waititi took the keys to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, he walked away with one of its greatest films: Thor: Ragnarok. The finished product is Asgards apart from the first of the hero\u0027s two adventures, starring Chris Hemsworth, that were released in 2011 and 2013. How many years between sequel and original? SixSure, the third and fourth instalments might have the emotional payoffs, but –\u0026nbspthanks to a series of standout scenes (the traffic cone pileup, anyone?) – it\u0027s Toy Story 2 that stands tall as the best of Pixar\u0027s sequels. How many years between sequel and original? FourRidley Scott\u0027s Alien may be an acclaimed horror film, but sequel Aliens – directed by James Cameron – is a stone cold action classic.

Aldi’s basket included its own-brand\u0026nbspVeuve Monsigny champagne.A further line stated: “Save 45 per cent”, while small text at the bottom of the page said: “Tesco may sell ‘own-brand’ products at different prices.”Tesco complained that the champagne products included in the selection unfairly skewed the price comparison in Aldi’s favour, and that the advert did not make sufficiently clear that Tesco also sold alternative\u0026nbspchampagne products that were cheaper than Moet.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Inveraray pipe band parades through the town at the start of the Highland Games in Inverarary, ScotlandExtinction Rebellion Activists block roads near the Tron Clock tower in GlasgowSerbia\u0027s Novak Djokovic raises the winner\u0027s trophy after beating Switzerland\u0027s Roger Federer during their men\u0027s singles final on day thirteen of the 2019 Wimbledon Championships at The All England Lawn Tennis ClubThe referee counts Nathan Gorman out as Daniel Dubois looks on during the British Heavyweight Title fight between Daniel Dubois and Nathan Gorman at The O2 Arena in LondonGiant Panda, Yang Guang, exploring his new home at Edinburgh Zoo after moving in last weekEngland\u0027s captain Eoin Morgan, left, celebrates with teammate Joe Root after winning their Cricket World Cup semi-final match against Australia at Edgbaston in Birmingham.

The ruling does not impact our ongoing Swap and Save adverts, which clearly show how much shoppers can save by switching to Aldi.”Additional reporting by PAOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Consumer Price Inflation measure\u0026nbsptargeted by the central bank does not include the costs of owning and maintaining a home nor council tax.Clothing and footwear prices were among the very few components of the CPI that fell last month and at a much slower pace than in May.The steady course of inflation looks unlikely to last.\u0026nbspSamuel Tombs, chief UK\u0026nbspeconomist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a comment on Twitter that a weaker pound and a recent pick-up in wage growth point to higher inflation ahead.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe pound fell to its lowest level against the dollar in more than two years on Tuesday after the two contenders to be Britain’s next prime minister promised\u0026nbspto scrap the Irish backstop, amplifying\u0026nbspfears of a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersMeanwhile, official data showed that growth in UK wages accelerated in the three months to May compared with a year earlier.\u0026nbspBut a disorderly Brexit risks giving a much bigger boost to inflation, as Suren Thiru,\u0026nbsphead of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, explained.“Such an outcome would probably trigger a significant decline in the value of sterling, pushing inflation materially higher and increasing the financial squeeze on businesses and households,” he said.The Brexit vote has already contributed to a bigger fall in living standards than the recession of the early 1990s, research by the Resolution Foundation has found.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSeparate official figures also published on Wednesday showed that UK house prices climbed by 1.2 per cent in the year to May compared with a 1.5 per cent rise in the year to April.

She needed 374 votes to reach the threshold to be elected, meaning she scraped through by just nine votes.Ms Von der Leyen, who was nominated by EU leaders earlier this month,\u0026nbspis the first woman to hold the top job in Brussels. The European Commission is the union’s executive arm and is responsible for proposing EU law, enforcing its treaties, and representing the interests of the bloc as a whole on the world stage.\u0026nbspShe is due to take office on 1 November after a handover period during which her cabinet of commissioners, one from each member state, will be chosen and their portfolios allocated. She has pledged to achieve gender balance in the top team – but could face a showdown with member state governments, who may have other candidates in mind as their commissioners.The German politician’s appointment is controversial because she\u0026nbspwas not a lead\u0026nbspcandidate in the EU elections last month. The European parliament had previously said that the next commission president should have been on the ballot paper during the contest and campaigned across the EU, under the so-called “spitzenkandidat” system.New EU commission cabinet will be half women, says Juncker replacementUrsula von der Leyen: the German minister set to run the EUEU leaders back Ursula von der Leyen to be commission presidentBut a majority of\u0026nbspMEPs gave Ms Von der Leyen their backing anyway after national leaders called their bluff and proposed a candidate who was not available to vote for. She was opposed by MEPs from the green and left groups in the parliament, but supported by the centre-right and the liberals. The centre-left socialist group was split, with some countries’ parties such as the German SPD opposing the appointment and others such as Labour supporting it.“The trust you placed in me is the confidence you placed in Europe,” she told MEPs in her acceptance speech.\u0026nbsp“Your confidence in a united and a strong Europe, from east to west, from south to north. Your confidence in a Europe that is ready to fight for the future rather than fighting against each other. Your confidence in a Europe that will take the big challenges of our times together. The task ahead of us humbles me: it is a big responsibility and our work starts now.”Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Rescuers work at the site of collapsed building in Dongri area of Mumbai, IndiaA motorist drives past a destroyed house after a large earthquake that hit Surigao City, in the southern island of Mindanao, Philippines French Gendarmes remove fences next to a burning portable toilet during clashes with protesters on the Champs Elysees avenue after the traditional Bastille Day military parade in Paris, FranceA recortador jumps over a bull during a contest in a bullring at the San Fermin festival in Pamplona, SpainJapan\u0027s Megumu Yoshida and Yukiko Inui compete in the duet technical artistic swimming event during the 2019 World Championships at Yeomju Gymnasium in GwangjuHot air balloons fly over the city of Igualada during an early flight as part of the European Balloon Festival in Igualada, Spain.

Mr Vardi\u0026nbspdescribed\u0026nbspthe complex society as the ancient equivalent of Jerusalem or Tel Aviv – “a real metropolis”.Before the discovery, it was widely believed the entire area had been uninhabited in the period, during which people were still shifting from hunting to a more sedentary lifestyle.Created with Sketch.Archaeologists uncover nearly 5,000 cave paintings in Burgos, Mexico Show all 4Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.One of 5,000 cave paintings uncovered in north MexicoMexican National Institute of Anthropology One of 5,000 cave paintings uncovered in north MexicoMexican National Institute of Anthropology One of 5,000 cave paintings uncovered in north MexicoMexican National Institute of Anthropology One of 5,000 cave paintings uncovered in north MexicoMexican National Institute of Anthropology One of 5,000 cave paintings uncovered in north MexicoMexican National Institute of Anthropology One of 5,000 cave paintings uncovered in north MexicoMexican National Institute of Anthropology One of 5,000 cave paintings uncovered in north MexicoMexican National Institute of Anthropology One of 5,000 cave paintings uncovered in north MexicoMexican National Institute of Anthropology The ruins were only uncovered during a preliminary survey conducted for the construction of a new highway in the area.A wider excavation exposed large buildings, alleyways and burial places, evidence of a relatively advanced level of planning, the antiquities authority said in a statement.“This is most probably the largest excavation of this time period in the Middle East, which will allow the research to advance leaps and bounds ahead of where we are today, just by the amount of material that we are able to save and preserve from this site,” said Lauren Davis, an archaeologist with the antiquities team.Vardi at Motza site (AFPGetty Images)The team also found storage sheds that contained large quantities of legumes, particularly lentils, whose seeds were remarkably preserved throughout the millennia.Also found were flint tools, including thousands of arrowheads, axes for chopping down trees, sickle blades and knives.“This finding is evidence of an intensive practice of agriculture,” according to the\u0026nbspIAA statement. “Animal bones found on the site show that the settlement’s residents became increasingly specialised in sheep-keeping, while the use of hunting for survival gradually decreased.”Additional reporting by ReutersOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And to honour the result of the EU referendum.If you give people a choice you have a duty to implement what they decide. I have done my best to do that.Sadly I have not been able to do so. I tried three times - I believe it was right to persevere even when the odds against success seemed high.May survived a vote of no confidence in December , but repeated thwarted attempts to pass her Brexit deal left her without authority.May will remain as Prime Minister until a new party leader is announced in the week beginning July ."},{"url":null,"title":"sun readers debate boris hunt live","story":"Both teams appeared much more relaxed this time around compared to last weeks ITV debate.There were jokes aplenty and both candidates ribbed each other and were well received by the upbeat audience.Boris tripped up a bit over immigration and refused to commit to getting the numbers down.But he did rule out an early election # something which will make many Tories extremely happy.They both attacked Donald Trump over his comments about democratic congresswomen, but refused to call him a racist.And they both agreed to having at least one top woman in their Cabinetthey become PM next week.All in all, both Boris and Hunt did well.

One Lord was described as a “notorious bullying pervert” by a Westminster worker.The verdict was that the prevailing culture and behaviour in the House of Lords “has not been conducive to an open and supportive culture to ensure all those working there are treated with dignity and respect”.Worse, the report concluded those staff on the receiving end of bullying and harassment generally did not complain because they thought nothing would change, or feared reprisal.Clearly, the House of Lords has issues. But it’s nowhere near as bad as the House of Commons. The second report, by Gemma White QC into inappropriate conduct in Westminster, concluded MPs’ staff face “unacceptable risk of bullying and harassment”.It found sexual harassment in Parliament is seen by young staff as a “necessary evil”they want to progress. Witnesses describe speaking out against any abuse as “career suicide”.Even though both reports state only a small minority of MPs or Lords behave in unacceptable ways, this has been tolerated for too long and shining a light on it will bring about change.What’s clear to me, both from reading the report and working at the House of Lords, is that this is a generational issue. The House of Lords is full of older people stuck in a time warp.Many of them live in a world where it’s still acceptable for women — often females of a lower status to them — to be patted on the bottom or on the head.The House of Lords can feel a bit like a boys’ boarding school, or Hogwarts. It’s populated predominantly by old white men, many of whom lead a le insulated from the real world.That said, the worst behaviour I witness is usually in the library, where Lords often retire after lunch and which rings with the sound of ear-deafening snoring and, I am sorry to say, farting.The only time I’ve ever seen anyone being actively rude was when one Lord commanded a member of canteen staff to get him a bag of crisps. He was so close he could have reached out and got it himself.I’ve also been on the receiving end of the odd condescending comment, such as when a Lord looked me up and down and said: “You’re dressed rather casually.” I was wearing Stella McCartney trousers at the time, so not exactly jeans.Crucially, though, I wasn’t wearing a dress. So I looked him up and down and said: “Dressing casually is better than dressing badly” — and that was the end of that.It must be horrible to work in an organisation where you feel inferior and can’t speak your mind — and,you do, people either shrug or shut you down. The report about the House of Lords suggested it should be mandatory for all employees to go on a “how to value people” course. Some people might see it as unnecessary — but we send West Ham staff on them and they are good.But that’s not the only change required. There’s neither enough women, nor cultural ersity. The only way that will change is by electing a more erse chamber.In the meantime, I hope this report does not diminish, in people’s minds, the important legislation work the House of Lords does and the role it plays in holding the Commons to account. I hope these reports don’t stop people from remembering what an important institution it is.As Spider-Man said: “With great power comes great responsibility” — and as one who sits in the House of Lords, I know I am not the only one who feels it is a great responsibility.BIG news.

Pundits give him an agonising  days from next Tuesday to honour that promise.In fact, we will know in an instantBrexit — and Boris — will live or die.The moment will come, perhaps on his first day, as he names the man or woman to prise the Treasury from the cold, dead hands of Chancellor Philip Hammond.If Boris picks Sajid Javid, Matt Hancock or Liz Truss — or anyone  who voted Remain — .million Brits can kiss goodbye to their dream of leaving the European Union.We will end up with a just another bodged version of Theresa May’s BRINO sell-out — Brexit in Name Only. It will be the beginning and the end of King BoJo the First.There will be no second chances. The next Chancellor of the Exchequer must be a proven Brexiteer in word and deedBoris has a chance of surviving his  days.The Treasury is the most powerful and implacable enemy of Brexit. “The new Chancellor needs three key qualities,” says a source close to Boris.“They must have a Brexit pedigree, absolute loyalty to Boris and the intellectual self-confidence to take on Whitehall and the Treasury.”Qualities such as these are scarce in the present Cabinet. The final choice is likely to surprise everyone, especially Remainers.Some names mentioned to me would, to say the least, offer a bracing challenge to pro-EU establishment fanatics who spent the past three years sabotaging the  referendum.Unless the new Chancellor takes them head-on, those forces will crush both Boris and Brexit. Observers have identied the tank traps and sniper nests facing the new PM.He is up against a Remain-dominated Parliament aided by slippery Speaker Bercow, an army of civil service mandarins skilled in the machinery of government and covering fire from BBC propagandists.In the face of such overwhelming odds, a pro-Leave PM is surely doomed to fail. Not so. Despite appearances, Boris has a plan.He will fly immediately to Brussels with a genuine bid to reopen Theresa May’s botched withdrawal agreement.He would seek a clear path out of the EU customs union, single market and European Court jurisdiction, plus a sensible solution to the Northern Ireland border issue.The alternative will be for Britain to leave the EU on October  with No Deal. Unless much has changed, Brussels will say: “Non!” Boris will announce he has no option but to call a snap “No Deal” election.Remainers are appalled at the idea, and for good reason. Poll after poll suggests No Deal Boris would win with an outright majority — at their expense.The public is sick to the back teeth with Theresa May’s dreary defeatism and Brussels’ bullying. Remain voters want this sorted, too.Elections are always risky. But a Tory Party still dithering and paralysed on the biggest issue of the age is the greatest risk of all. Right now, the omens are promising. Labour is committing ritual suicide, shedding voters in droves.Millions of Tory defectors would flock back to a party committed to a final, irreversible Brexit taking us past the October  dead-line and sucking support from Nigel Farage and his Brexit Party.In the intervening weeks, a Boris regime could recruit voters abandoned by both major parties over crime, low pay, high taxes and housing.According to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, blue- collar voters on less than £, a year, are “up for grabs like never before”.If Boris Johnson has one proven gt, it is for winning against the odds.

It has threatened journalists, too, that they face prosecutionthey dare to publish the content of the cables.Trying to justy his threats, the Met’s Assistant Commissioner, Neil Basu, said he was sure the leaks had “damaged UK international relations” and on that basis no one publishing the leaks could plead a public interest defence.What a ludicrous over-reaction to what is really no more than a diplomatic spat over the Ferrero Rochers.Sure, it doesn’t exactly help UK US relations when our Ambassador calls the President of the United States “inept” and his administration “uniquely dysal”.But I would say it is mildly less damaging than some of the things that the Leader of Opposition, the Mayor of London and Scotland’s First Minister have said about Donald Trump. I can’t see Mr Basu dangling his handcuffs in front of them — and neither should he.Obviously, Sir Kim has reason to feel aggrieved that someone — presumably in the diplomatic service or the Foreign Office, because there is no evidence of computers being hacked — has leaked information he intended to be private. But it is a matter for the Government to investigate, not the police.How ridiculous Basu has said of the leaker: “You are now also responsible for erting busy detectives from under-taking their core mission.”No, Mr Basu — it is only thanks to your decision that officers have been taken off front-line duties to undertake this investigation.You could have told officials what police officers are forever telling the rest of us when we report our houses broken into or our bikes stolen: Sorry, but we’ve got too much  to do.It would be a dferent mattersomeone had leaked material that really did harm national security.The sort of information leaked by Kim Philby and his Soviet-sympathising accomplices in the s put British lives at risk.But leaking and publishing a diplomat’s private thoughts hardly comes into that category. Mr Basu’s attack on the principles of the free Press echoes Operation Elveden, the failed attempt by the Met to criminalise journalists who had obtained information from police officers, in some cases for money.The Met switched more than  police officers from other duties and arrested  people. The police probe cost taxpayers £.million and yet of  journalists charged, only one was convicted at trial — and that was quashed on appeal. Just one journalist, Dan Evans, pleaded guilty to an Elveden offence and was given a suspended sentence.The prosecutions relied on an ancient offence, Misconduct in Public Office, which was only ever supposed to apply to public servants, not journalists.As many lawyers, including the Lord Chief Justice, pointed out, it simply isn’t a criminal offence for someone to receive or to publish most forms of state information — only for a public official to sell it.There is a very good reason for this. Leaks, and the freedom to put their contents into the public domain, are an essential ingredient of our democracy. It is what helps the Press to keep in check corrupt or over-bearing politicians and public officials.Without the freedom to publish leaked information, for example, we would never have known the extent to which MPs and Lords were abusing their expenses regime.That required a newspaper to publish information gleaned from a computer disk which had been stolen — but thankfully in that case the Met decided that the public interest over-rode a possible offence of handling stolen goods.Without the Panama Papers we would never have known the extent to which wealthy iniduals and corporations have gone into keeping their wealth out of the taxman’s grasp. Without the “climategate” leaks we would not have known how some climate scientists were prepared to manipulate past temperature records to support their theories.It took a leak, too, to establish that the Blair government knew it was unlikely that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, but that George W Bush had resolved to overthrow Saddam regardless.Then there was “Plebgate”, when a leaked police log revealed a bust-up between government chief whip Andrew Mitchell and police manning the gates at Downing Street — and led an officer to be jailed when it was revealed he had invented his witness statement.There are, of course, plenty of other countries in the world where journalists would be locked up for publishing information that has leaked from the government, but they are not countries in which most of us would want to live.By over-reacting to what is an embarrassment to the Foreign Office, the Met has taken a leaf out of the book of President Erdogan of Turkey, who has locked up dozens of journalists as he attempts to suppress all opposition to his regime.Neil Basu and other senior Met Police officers should back off and accept that the Press is quite within its rights to publish leaked information that does not threaten national security.We are, after all, one of the world’s oldest ing democracies — not a tinpot state where people get led off in chains for daring to reveal the truth. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Someone who denies what they appear to be, who professes to be one of the good guys working for a better world in which there just happens to be fewer of one sort of person, is harder still, because they simply refuse to be diagnosed.  Weaposre living in a world where absolutely everyone is racist. Donald Trump is a white racist. He says his critics are black racists. Jeremy Corbyn is called an anti-Semite. His supporters say Jews are Islamophobes. The comfortable, globe-spanning civilisation we lived in about  years ago has become a place filled with tribes who tell everyone  theyaposre in the wrong tribe.Thing is, the rest of the world has always been like that. Where the white enslaved the black, where those left behind warred with neighbours, where the Chinese now fight for control with Russians, where Nigerians or Australians or Venezuelans or Hutus or Tutsis are blamed for the remainder of problems. Itaposs just that now, everyone on the planet has the same madness. The Westaposs problem is not racism. It is that its tribe has shrunk - the us is no longer NATO, the United Nations, Europe, or the special relationship. Every tie that bound us into a larger group has been severed in a funding row of some sort, and the only tribes we have left are the ones we were born into.So a Jew who found a home in the Labour Party is now just a Jew. A Muslim whose values chimed with the Tories is now talking at mosque, not the constituency association. And a white Briton, like a white American, is ing to the past.Everyoneaposs going back to where they came from, and hates it.  Racism won when Donald Trump was elected leader of the Free World, that loose tribe we used to be members of. A man who said Mexicans were all rapists, who refused to let apartments to blacks  years ago, shouted at us until we were numbed. Like a patient whoaposs had too much electro-shock therapy, weaposre dazedly asking ourselves whether racism is really that racist.Because Trump says it, the same question is asked on radio phone-ins, on TV talk shows, in newspaper columns, pubs, workplaces, family dinners. The rest of the world is awful, says a tribe that doesnapost notice its own failings. Why donapost the awful people fix their awfulness  Thataposs pretty awful too, butyouaposre offended at that theyaposll be offended right back. For once, there really ARE good people on both sides, taking offence at the suggestion their tribe is less than perfect and the other might just be right.And now all of them are asking, out loud, what your ethnicity is, and comparing it to their own.   If tribalism was a good idea, weaposd all be happier right now. Africa would have been the most cheerful place on the planet for centuries, and the Labour Party would be thriving on its splits.But tribes make us smaller. Smaller in the head, in ambition, in influence and in power. A single building block cannot build a damned thing, and reducing ourselves to a unit of our birth is like evolution in reverse.We are at the edge of the swamp, looking at a place filled with things that slither and crawl, where there are no alliances and lots of death. A place where four legal citizens of a nation are called disloyal for wanting it to be a better place, where there are more guns than there are people, and where nutjobs call themselves a well-regulated militia able to gun down any target they choose.They forget that those who were dferent were the ones who survived the swamp. They grew fins and gills, then legs and lungs, and decided to live somewhere better.   If you are asked your ethnicity, there is only one answer. We are all % African. Thereaposs not a human on the planet who is indigenous aside from those who live in the Great Rt Valley of East Africa, and thereaposs no room for us all to go back there. Yet we introduce domestic abuse legislation that does not apply to migrants, and we free victims of human trafficking and send them right back to the places where they were enslaved. Trump is not responsible for the tribalism which has infected our race. Heaposs just ridden a wave which started in the  financial crisis, a wave similar to the one which started in the Great Depression and brought us the Nazis.But his praise of Nazis, his uttering of Nazi tropes, his constant ision of humans into smaller units, has enabled the same things to be discussed and done where in the world. Get rid of him, and America will have enabled the rest of the world to straighten its tie and tell the Nazis to shut up. Trumpaposs tribalism is useful. It will, one day soon, cause the USA to question its founding principles, reinvent its dream, correct the religious fundamentalism, slavery and narrow-mindedness with which it has been cursed for  years, and rebuild. That cannot, and will not, happen without Trump to kick against - evolution requires an existential threat.    When America unites, others will follow. Perhaps because tribalism just had its day, and perhaps because of coincidental global economic growth. But itaposs a matter of when, not , because innovation and improvement is inevitable in everything, except minds of hardliners in ISIS and the Republican Party.Death will come to Trump, one day, and maybe even the taxman. The voters will probably take him first, along with the financial realities of trade wars. If you ide your enemies, all you get is more enemies. Brexit is a dead end. Corbyn has nothing to do but fail. Putin, Duterte, Salvini, all aposstrong menapos rely upon tribes that do not question them, because they cannot withstand a question.When this tribalism dies - and it will - you must make sure to kill it everywhere. It lived on in Africa, Asia and the Pacic Rim because you left them behind, last time. Progressive is not an insult. Itaposs the only way forward, and everyone needs to move. We are not racist. We are the human race, a team of billions who all want to live somewhere better. Letaposs make humanity great again. ,,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\""},{"url":null,"title":"kevin pietersen there nothing fair","story":"NewsopinionKevin Pietersens open letter to Michael Gove: Its not a sport to shoot a lion for funThe former English cricketer has written a letter to Michael Gove calling for a ban on trophy huntingShareCommentsByKevin Pietersen:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsopinionKevin Pietersensays its time we ALL hit trophy hunting for six \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailDear Michael Gove, In your exclusive article for the Daily Mirror yesterday, you say you find trophy hunting troubling and are planning to call for evidence about its impacts. When we met a few weeks ago, I asked you to ban imports of hunting trophies. You declined.You claimed trophy hunting could be good for conservation. This is the absurd argument peddled by the trophy hunting industry.They will doubtless now lobby you furiously following your article.Don’t listen to their lies. Trophy hunters are not conservationists.They are people who kill animals for fun. They then make up excuses to try and justy their so-called ‘sport’. If trophy hunting was good for conservation, why have lion populations fallen from , in the s to just , today  Why have elephant numbers fallen from over  million in the s to just , today  Why are rhinos, cheetahs, leopards, hippos and giraffes ALL in serious trouble     Trophy hunters kill huge numbers of endangered animals every year, and – incredibly - this government lets them. You have to get an import permit from the government before going off to Africa to shoot one of them. Britain lets its trophy hunters shoot cheetahs. Even the Trump administration doesn’t allow that. We’re one of the worst countries in the world for hunting elephants. We’re also one of the worst when it comes to ‘canned lion hunting’. This is the disgusting practice of breeding lions in factory farms so that cowards can shoot them in enclosures. British values are all about fairness. There is NOTHING fair about shooting a tame lion in a cage. But don’t just ban canned lion trophies. We need to ban ALL wildle trophies. British hunters are shooting hippos, leopards, zebras, bears, baboons, and even monkeys. And the number of animals shot is climbing. What sort of legacy are we leaving our children     Britain is a signatory to CITES, the international law that prohibits trade in endangered wildle. But CITES says its rules don’t apply to trophy hunting. Why  Because apparently trophy hunting is not a ‘commercial’ industry. How is an industry worth  million not commercial  Trophy hunters can pay up to £, for their sick expeditions! You have rightly condemned poaching. We need to condemn trophy hunting too.When you poach a rhino, you kill it and take its body parts. When you trophy hunt a rhino, you do the same.The poacher sells the horn to make money. The trophy hunter sticks the rhino head over his fireplace.   It doesn’t matter what we label the killer. The fact is the rhino is dead. Michael, you worked hard to bring in the Ivory Bill. You introduced tougher sentences for animal cruelty. You have a chance right now to leave a lasting legacy.

The June  referendum did not create these isions - but Brexit has hardened the ides to the point where we are now a tribal society, with families communities, towns and cities riven, defined and stamped with one of two labels: ‘Remain’ or ‘Leave’. Remember the days when hardly anyone ever talked about Europe, when politics was about jobs, the NHS, social care, housing, transport and schools  Well, those days are gone, for now at least. A recent survey found that half the population identies with a religion and just under two-thirds feels attachment to a political party, yet % identy as a Remainer or Leaver - that’s % more than voted in the referendum.    The story of the last three years is the story of how a fringe issue has become the principal social ision of our times. Listening has been swept away by shouting, persuasion has been replaced by protest and co-operation, compromise and consensus have given way to conflict. We cannot go on like this. We’re in serious danger of tipping over into a culture war, and so we have to find a way of bringing some cohesion and common sense back into our politics. And this is why I am truly proud to be the founder and chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Re-uniting Britain Post-Brexit.

She attacked people who are adversarial but weaposre sure she didnapost mean Doanld Trump. And she attacked people who say theyaposll do things without getting them done, but weaposre sure she didnapost mean Boris Johnson. In fact, here is a whole list of very pertinent things the Prime Minister said without referring to any one person. And, alongside, is what we think she meant.   WHAT SHE SAID: Today an inability to combine principles with pragmatism - and make a compromise when required - seems to have driven our whole political discourse down the wrong path... Persuasion, teamwork and a willingness to make mutual concessions are needed to achieve an optimal outcome. WHAT SHE MEANT: This attack comes days after Boris Johnson said heaposd refuse to compromise over Brexit. The Tory leadership frontrunner said he would not accept  a time limit or exit clause to the Northern Ireland backstop clause of Mrs Mayaposs deal. Already last night Amber Rudd, a Cabinet minister, warned that view will collide with reality. Now Theresa May seems to be joining the warnings too.On aposadversarialapos world politics   WHAT SHE SAID: This absolutism is not confined to British politics... we see it in the increasingly adversarial nature of international relations, which some view as a zero sum game where one country can only gainothers lose. And where power, unconstrained by rules, is the only currency of value. This absolutism at home and abroad is the opposite of politics at its best. It refuses to accept that other points of view are reasonable. It ascribes bad motives to those taking those dferent views. WHAT SHE MEANT: This one comes after more than two years of Donald Trump wielding his raw power through his aggressive, often rude, occasionally racist Twitter account. The President branded Mrs May foolish after she refused to take his advice to sue the EU. And he branded the UK Ambassador to the US wacky. It could of course refer to many other world leaders too, and Mrs May went on to attack Russiaaposs Vladimir Putin by name."},{"url":null,"title":"baby left starve after doctors","story":"NewsPremature baby left to starve after doctors FORGOT to refer him for surgeryNikki Sharp says Hull Royal Infirmary put Hugo Sharp in \"no mans land\" after failing to insert a gastrostomy tube into his stomachShareCommentsByJoanna LovellBradley JollyOnline journalist:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsHugo Sharp was born  weeks prematurely \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA baby boy has been left to starve in hospital after doctors forgot to refer him for vital surgery, his mum claims.

Kass Stone and his family have slammed holiday firm TUI, claiming they made a terrible situation worse by refusing to move them from the contaminated cabin. Footage shows ankle-deep brownish water in the cabin which the Stones claim, even after heavy cleaning, stank for the remainder of the break. Kass, from Bexley, London, paid £, for the Adriatic cruise aboard the Marella Celebration, which departed from Dubrovnik on Thursday, May . The -year-old, his we and two children were sharing the cabin when raw sewage started bubbling up through the shower.  Kass said: We had to put up with this damp, unclean water smell and you just never really felt clean, you just felt dirty the whole time and we had to sit there for a whole week. It ruined the holiday, it got to the point where we dreaded going back to the cabin. After informing staff on board the ship, the drain was fixed but the family claim nobody came to clean up the mess until Kass complained again. Eventually a large heater was brought in to speed up the drying process, but Kass says the noise and heat from the machine only made matters worse as the awful stench became overpowering in the sweltering heat. Another video from Kass shows the heater in action, the loud whirring audible in the background as he can be heard saying sarcastically: Lots of loud machinery, right next to where we sleep, for the third day going - yay. The family was also unable to use their bathroom for the remainder of the holiday, forcing them to shower in the shipaposs public spa - much to the embarrassment of Kassapos two children aged,  and six. Kass said: My children were incredibly excited about the trip, but they were both so embarrassed about having to shower in a public spa. It took the wind out of the sails really, we donapost make a fortune and we saved up and the kids were excited, but now itaposs ruined. After getting no response to his complaint from TUI, Kass took to Facebook to vent his frustrations.He wrote: Our cabin flooded with waste water, no alternative accommodation offered in spite of persistent stench, wet carpet and overall unhygienic conditions, especially for two young children. The cruise was ruined and Tui Marella have not responded to our complaint over a month later. Is this how you treat customers  Kass says the family was offered £ of on-board credit as compensation, but added that this is not enough.

She was gripped by an overwhelming fear – convinced thatshe fell asleep, she would die. “Counting my breaths was the only way I could reassure myself that I was still alive and everything was OK,” says the mum-of three, , who lives in Surrey. Rachael was suffering from a rare sleep phobia, which developed after her two young sons were diagnosed with autism. Craig, Rachael’s husband, was in the armed forces and often worked away from home. And when he wasn’t there, Rachael would spend night after night wide awake. “I was terried thatI died in my sleep no one would find me or my ­children, and they wouldn’t be able to get help. “I’d worry about whether they’d survive until their dad got home.”    Often, Rachael would lie awake until am, only nodding off for a few minutes before her children woke up. “I was exhausted. But I was too afraid to let myself go to sleep and I thought that at leastI was awake, I knew I wasn’t dead.” Rachael is mum to Christopher, now five, and Jacob, three, who are both on the autistic spectrum, and Matthew,  months. Christopher was about six months when Rachael realised something wasn’t right. He didn’t want to be cuddled and would have uncontrollable meltdowns. He also had seizures where he would stare into space for minutes at a time. Eventually Rachael sought help from her health visitor and, after many tests, Christopher was diagnosed with autism when he was two. Rachael knew early on that his brother Jacob was just like him. “Jacob was only eight weeks when I realised he was autistic because he didn’t copy me when I poked my tongue out. He didn’t even look at me and I just knew.” Determined her boys would get all the help they needed, she read every bit of research on autism she could get her hands on and arranged portage training in her home, a type of early intervention therapy that develops learning in small steps. “I was % committed,” she recalls. But when Rachael was  weeks pregnant with Matthew, everything started to get on top of her. Craig, who had transferred to the Grenadier Guards in Aldershot, was retraining as a mechanic so he could eventually spend more time with the family. But this meant he would be away for a year, leaving Rachael alone. It was then that the sleep phobia really took off and before long Rachael says she was “like a zombie”. “The tiredness made me feel I was going insane. I was a mess. I was trying to keep everything together during the day and it all came out at night. Inside I was at breaking point.”    Rachael’s anxiety ­worsened and she became convinced she was ill. “If I had discomfort in my stomach, I was sure it was cancer. If I was anxious, it was a heart attack. Leg cramps were blood clots. “I lost weight when I was supposed to be gaining because I was pregnant. I was torturing myself, I was so desperate to stay alive. Sometimes I’d think ‘ anything is wrong with me, let it happen quickly as I can’t cope with this any more’. “I made sure everyone  was OK but I got lost and forgot about me. The doctor’s receptionist recognised my voice because I was calling the surgery so often.” Eventually, Rachael realised she had to get help and she booked an ­appointment with her doctor “I said, ‘I know it sounds crazy but I’m terried of going to sleep at night’.” Therapist Russell Hoyles, who works at Fairfield Independent Hospital, St Helens, Merseyside, says: “Sleep dread or somniphobia is a sleep disorder associated with anxiety and fear around going to sleep. Trauma, frequent nightmares, sleep paralysisand fear of something bad happening while you sleep, such as burglary or fire, are all recognised triggers. “Sufferers often feel distress and even panic as it gets closer to bedtime and can experience physical symptoms such as tightness in the chest and hyperventilation.“Even when a sufferer does sleep, the quality of sleep is poor and fitful, which has a debilitating impact on day-to-le, emotional wellbeing, concentration and relationships. “The number of sufferers is hard to quanty, but we do know a signicant proportion, at least a third of the population, experience some type of sleep disorder.“Indeed, one of the most common, insomnia, can develop into ‘sleep dread’, especially when the insomnia is related to a physical condition. “Treatment depends on the inidual but starts with good sleep habits such as avoiding caffeine before bed.“Medication can help with the symptoms but understanding and devising strategies to address the problem using talking therapies such as cognitive behaviour therapy, counselling and relaxation can also help.”"},{"url":null,"title":"jet2 passenger who led raf","story":"NewsJet passenger who stormed cockpit and shouted Ill kill you all gets £, billChloe Haines was arrested on suspicion of assault and endangering an aircraft after shaken passengers claimed she screamed “I’m going to kill everyone” during the mid-air rampageShareByMartin Fricker:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video exclusive-jet-passenger-arrested-stansted-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA female holidaymaker who allegedly tried to storm the cockpit of a packed Jet plane has been slapped with an £, bill by the airline.

More than , people have shared the post in the last two days alone and itaposs received more than , comments, reports Manchester Evening News.    Among those to comment was Kay Lunnon, who said: Why can’t they just have it the same price all year round so it is more affordable for someone in the peak season too  I get that they have more staff to pay and more activities but surely it’s still the same number of accommodation that they rent out so why should it be double the price  It’s not fair as parents want to be able to take their children away but the prices are too extreme for some families. If they made it the same price all year round so that the off peak was slightly higher than it is now and peak is slightly less then it’s fair for everyone.  Sandra Phillips said: Just an absolute rip off, there is no justication for doing this, just pure greed, this should be tackled, terribly unfair for people who actually can’t take their kids out of school. Others called for greater regulation of holiday companies to prevent such price hikes, like Jayne Foxwell, who said: You may complain about the school holiday prices being extortionate but actually,government had better regulation of the holiday companies we may see a fairer system. Iaposve worked for a holiday company and now work in a school so Iaposve seen both sides of this coin. By the way, schools do not fine, the council processes them, so in turn this means the government. The very ones who are not making things fairer for families.  And some were eager to stress the number of teachers and school staff, who also struggle to afford holidays at peak times. Averil Hudson said: I think itaposs so unfair. And also for the teachers and their families, not like they can take time off either. I wish something could be done about this, like a cap put on it or something. The Manchester Evening News did its own search of the Center Parcs website to compare the prices of breaks at the nearest site in Whinfell Forest.

The rare eclipse will reach its height at around .pm, the Royal Astronomical Societysaid. The stunning show will last more than five hours, ending at around .am, when the moon moves away from the Earthaposs lighter shadow. The redness will be caused by sunlight passing through the planetaposs atmosphere.    It happens when the Earth passes between the sun and the moon - which causes a large shadow to form. The eclipse comes  years to the day after the Apollo  mission blasted off from Florida. Four days later Neil Armstrong became the first man to set foot on the moon. Clear skies are expected, meaning the eclipse should be visible across most of the country. Experts say it is safe to observe the lunar eclipse with the naked eye.    Stronger atmospheric scattering of blue light means that the light that reaches the lunar surface is predominantly red in colour. So for observers on Earth, the eclipsed part of the Moon may be brick-coloured, rusty, blood red, or sometimes dark grey, depending on terrestrial conditions. For this reason, the lunar eclipse is often described as a Blood Moon - or in the case of a partial lunar eclipse, a Half-Blood Moon.

Joe Blackaby, , was bitten by the tick while at Reading Festival, but simply pulled the tiny bug from his leg and thought nothing of it. When Joe, from Caldicot, Wales, woke up feeling unwell the next morning, he brushed it off as a hangover. But when Joeaposs health continued to deteriorate, he knew something was wrong with his body and went to see his GP. Incredibly, it took three years for the -year-old to be diagnosed with Lyme disease - an infection caused by bacteria spread by ticks. Joe said the disease, contracted at the festival in , has taken his le away and has left him struggling to walk, talk and do simple tasks without feeling exhausted. He also has major problems with memory, cannot focus his vision and suffers spasms similar to a Parkinsonaposs patient.    Joe said: Itaposs an awful feeling watching your body deteriorate so rapidly, yet I would do anything to get better from this disease. He claimed that so little is known about his condition that doctors in Wales do not know how to treat him. My doctor has given up on me getting better, but I have not given up on myself, he added. In most cases patients begin to improve following a three-week course of antibiotics, but in Joeaposs case it has lasted six years and counting.  Stick to paths - Try not to stray from paths and avoid overhanging vegetation unlessnecessary. Ticks do not jump or fly so sticking to clear areas without tallgrass or shrubs will decrease the chances of being bitten. If in an areawhere there is no footpath, try and avoid tall grass or shady areas that aresurrounded by shrubs. Light Clothing - When in areas of woodland remained covered, wear long sleeve tops andfull- trousers. Protect areas such as the back of the knees, armpitsand the groin area. Opt for light coloured clothing in order to easilyidenty any ticks present that may become attached. Footwear - Wellies are not only reserved for rainy days and are perfect when in highrisk areas, as you can tuck trousers into the wellie boots. Tucking trousersinto socks is also a great defence mechanismwellies are not an option. Regular checks - Ticks are very small and hard to identy when not paying attention. Checkregularly whilst outside and also when home in order to remove any feedingticks. The longer a tick is left attached the harder it is to remove. Right tools - Avoid any home remedies to try and remove ticks such as covering theaffected area of the body in Vaseline or nail nish or even burning themoff. Instead, use a tick removal tool, which are sold in outdoor shops and somesupermarkets and pharmacies. This will help avoid aggravating the tick andlower the risk of secondary infection. When removed, use an antiseptic wipeand be aware of any symptoms of Lyme disease   He said the infection has affected most of his major organs, including his heart and left him with debilitating neurological issues. Every day is a battle to keep fighting, added Joe who used to be a keen surfer. I have memory issues and I do not remember things from my past. Photos of me feel like someone aposs le. It makes le feel meaningless when you forget everything you have done. My brain will often feel like it is on fire as it gets inflamed. At these times I canapost communicate at all. I just lie in a dark room for weeks waiting for it to pass. Joe said he has lost a considerable amount of weight as his body is no longer able to absorb nutrition from his food properly. I feel like a shell of my former self, he added. The bacteria is eating the cartilage in my body and causing bones in my spine to move out of place, resulting in muscle tears. Itaposs very painful and upsetting.  I know the more time that passes the more irreversible damage my body goes through, but currently there is nothing I can do but watch it happen. Joe insisted the only way he can get his le back is by travelling to Jemsek Clinic in the United States, which specialises in Lyme disease. He said clinicians will offer him a structured antibiotic protocol in a bid to combat his complex range of symptoms. The clinic has helped thousands of others overcome this illness and I have faith the same can happen for me, he added. A friend of Joeaposs set up a GoFundMe page to try and raise the money he needs to get to the USA.

The last of the showers should take place on Sunday in parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland, with sunny intervals and cloudy conditions in the rest of the country.  The mercury is expected to rise to C on Sunday, ahead of a C heatwave next week.    A spokesman for netweather.tv said: The summer holidays are on the way, so it stands to reason that the weather is taking a turn for the worse this week. Rain will be spreading in from the west . That leads us into an unsettled period, with wet and windy weather arriving Friday and into Saturday standing out at the moment. the often showery rain will push its way south-east, introducing fresher, brighter weather behind it. But the cloud and patchy rain will invade all the while, leaving the south-east most likely to stay dry until after dark. As the rain moves through, winds will become quite blustery for a time, helping to knock the edge off of any early warmth.    The cloud and showery rain will take its time to clear the south-east on Thursday. The showers will become more widespread during the day though, especially in the north and west, with some heavy, thundery downpours likely. The spokesman added that rain and strong blustery winds will hit Britain on Friday afternoon.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

Apart from the cones on the street, we never had any issues with bad parking or disturbance from people attending the event.ldquoI could hear some music on the evenings but I liked the atmosphere and it certainly wasnrsquot a nuisance. We did attend the family ride on the Sunday, and while there was plenty of mud, I thought theyrsquod done a great job creating such a big event in its first year in Innerleithen.With the proposed plans to redevelop the old mill to create the Mountain Bike Innovation Centre, Tom added: ldquoI think its exciting times to be a resident in Innerleithen and I hope events like these continue to grow and do well here.ldquoI remember when Innerleithen was a poor cousin to Peebles and Glentress as an MTB and tourist destination, and I think itrsquos the hard work of local people who have brought Innerleithen to the fore. Most people are excited about the prospects and possible future developments here, and Irsquod hate people to get the wrong impression of the overall community support based on the reported views of a few people who were disturbed in the eventrsquos first year.ldquoHaving said that, I hope the organisers take on board the negative feedback and incorporate improvements into any future events. I know they were in touch with the community council earlier this year before the event, hopefully theyrsquoll keep up this close relationshipthey come back.Meanwhile, Allan Graham who has lived in the town all of his le said without events such as Transcend, the Innerleithen community has nothing.He added: ldquoThe mills have all gone and what we have is biking, walkers etc. Letrsquos embrace whatrsquos coming to us and make the most of it.Jamie Birks echoed this sentiment adding: ldquoThe town has a real and deserved opportunity to be a national hub for outdoor events such as this.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"letter open letter to dog owners","story":"While responsible dog owners take care to ensure their dogs are under control at all times, there are still a number who do not # and seem unaware of the potential consequences of their actions.There has been a disturbing rise in the number of sheep and other livestock attacks, and we are hoping to enlist your help in raising awareness of dog #worrying# which will, in turn, assist the authorities, farmers and land-users.If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land the owner, or person in charge of the animal at the time, is guilty of a criminal offence.Section  of the DogsAct  defines #worrying# as:Such incidents cause distress to the animals and often lead to them being injured and or killed.

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time.

History is the way we view and see things that happened in the past. That view is limited by a number of factors. The availability of surviving records and evidence is one.The vast majority of what happened in the past is inevitably lost to us. This is true even for our own personal memories. So history is the small tip of the iceberg of events and times gone by, brought to the surface by the survival of some accounts more than others.And these records are never unbiased. Often historical records and evidence are purposely partial, influenced by ideology and personal allegiances. But all are biased in some way, as the limited viewpoint and interests of those recording events is based on their experience or motives.As a result, we can only see historical events through a narrow keyhole, with most characters and goings on out of view. Itrsquos the common people who are most always invisible in history. Our own ideological preference and belief in what is important will then affect how we interpret the limited evidence we have.This is why history is often subject to furious debate, and rightly so. Irsquod say itrsquos almost impossible not to allow our own perspectives, interests and values to influence the way we interpret the broader meaning of historical events and their signicance for contemporary society.Such a debate is being had in East Lothian just now, as to the name of the new town to be built on the Blindwells site, between Prestonpans and Longniddry and just to the north of Gladsmuir and Tranent.The name can be romantically translated to mean lsquohidden springsrsquo and it was across this once-marshy ground that the Jacobites crept stealthily at night to mount a surprise attack on the Redcoats on September , . That famous battle lasted  minutes and was a victory for the Jacobites, and the launchpad of Bonnie Prince Charliersquos march into England.Consequently, the Scottish Battlefields Trust has submitted a petition, as reported in the Courier last week, to name the new community Charlestoun and build a statue of Charles.When I was at school, he seemed a dashing and heroic figure. The songs and stories about him are infectious and I totally understand how the stories told about him have created a romantic and thrilling image.But then I studied the topic in more depth, at both university and afterwards. The period has suffered from the romantic treatment but there are fascinating stories of loyalty and sacrice to a man who, in reality, saw the common people chiefly as cannon fodder for his personal and family ambitions.It is for this reason I feel there are enough name places and statues to aristocratic and powerful men whose main historical role was to make and wage war, evenhe has a famous and romantic reputation.This is not to say we shouldnrsquot remember the fascinating history of the area, including that fateful day of battle when the Jacobites crossed the land.But itrsquos how we commemorate it and who we include. What makes the Jacobite period truly fascinating is the tapestry of stories of the many people involved, on both sides. It was a brutal time, in which there was certainly deep loyalty on both sides, but there were many other reasons why people found themselves on one side or the other. It was a brutal civil war, brought on by the aspirations of the exiled Stuarts.Do we commemorate the memory of the man who caused that war or do we commemorate those who were caught up in it  Is it really the case thatwe do the former we do the latter  Irsquom not convinced.There are other stories to consider of course for the site. There was coal mining there for generations. The lives of mining families, men, women and children who toiled in horric conditions, still remains mostly unheralded by history. Maybe itrsquos not lsquoromanticrsquo enough. Likewise with farming, which was a constant economic activity in the area for generations.There was also another unusual underground activity on the site after the early mine closed. Smugglers made an illegal whisky still deep down in the mine shaft once it was disused. It took a while for the customs men to realise East Lothian had an illicit whisky-making enterprise deep below ground in the old mine workings. When they finally raided the mine, they found the still, but no sign of the makers of the whisky. It kind of gives new meaning to the name lsquohidden springsrsquo!It is suggested the children in schools should have the final say in the new name, which is a great idea. But let our children be introduced to all aspects of our local history and allow them to understand how the way history is taught influences what we believe is important in contemporary society as well, and that there is no lsquocorrectrsquo view on this.Irsquod love to be part of that discussion and debate."},{"url":null,"title":"parents-launch-petition-school-bus-operator-change","story":"Families whose children attend two secondary schools in East Lothian were stunned to discover that local firm PrenticeCoaches would no longer be used to transport the youngsters when schoolsafter the summer.The news was broken to them by Prentice, which is based in Haddington, last week, sparking a furious reaction from a number of parents.Now a petition has been launched calling for Prentice to have the contract, which has allegedly been awarded to a rival firm, given back.One mother whose children attend Knox Academy in Haddingtonand are bussed in from Gford said that she was shocked by the news.She said: ldquoPrentice have been looking after our children for  years and they are being replaced with no consultation or discussion.ldquoParents know the drivers and trust them to look after their children.ldquoIt is beyond belief that the council would simply put a dferent company in place without even consulting with the families affected.A petition calling for theof Prentice has collected more than  signatures since it was launched online.It says: ldquoPrentice provide a community service where parents feel reassured and comfortable putting their children on the buses.ldquoWe believe East Lothian [Council] has chosen to put cost over service and safety.ldquoThere is absolutely nothing wrong with the current service.ldquoThis is simply a cost-cutting exercise which could potentially put our children at risk.Prentice provided bus services for Knox Academy and North Berwick High School but has now lost the contract for those services.Ross Prentice, the company boss, admitted that he was ldquodisappointed by the councilrsquos decision.The company said: ldquoIt is a sad day.

Industry figures insist this represents a crucial opportunity for supply chain companies and technology developers to meet demand.There are more than , wells and around , tonnes of s due to be disposed of, reused or recycled over the next decade in the UK, at a cost of around poundbn.In the  Budget, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced a call for evidence on plans to make Scotland a global hub for decommissioning.The UK Government has argued Scotland will ldquopioneer the future of the global oil and gas industry, with the North Sea representing ldquoone of the first regions in the world to start decommissioning on such a large scale .This provides opportunities for innovation, while the challenging environment in the North Sea is also seen as an advantage in refining techniques.Earlier this year, a report by Westminsterrsquos Scottish Affairs Committee said: ldquoDecommissioning represents a signicant export opportunity for Scottish businesses.ldquoScotland has the opportunity to become a global base for the decommissioning industry.Mike Tholen, upstream policy director at Oil and Gas UK, said decommissioning is a growing market of which Britain is well-placed to take advantage.He said: ldquoThe Decommissioning Challenge Fund underlines the Scottish Governmentrsquos ongoing commitment to the oil and gas industry as we look to harness decommissioning opportunities at home and indeed, globally.ldquoAlthough decommissioning only accounts for  per cent of total spend in the North Sea, it is a growing market in which the UK has first-mover advantage.ldquoThis will not only provide the supply chain with a steady workflow in the UK, but these competitive capabilities are exportable to a global market.ldquoAt the same time, we remain focused on providing security of energy supply through home-produced resources, providing energy sovereignty as recognised recently by the Committee on Climate Change in its net zero report.ldquoAll of this will ensure that we continue to provide highly skilled jobs, remain a major economic contributor and are best placed to become a key partner in the transition towards a low carbon future.Some environmental campaigners have advocated a ldquorigs to reefs approach which would see oil and gas infrastructure left in place rather than removed at the end of its lespan.This would allow subsea structures to act as articial reefs, providing a refuge for a wide iety of marine le.A spokesman for the Scottish Wildle Trust said: ldquoDecommissioning of oil rigs, evencarried out sensitively, will cause some disturbance to the marine environment.ldquoThe alternative to removal is leaving the structure in place, which may seem like abandonment but there can actually be ecological benefits to leaving oil rigs in place because marine le tends to gather around large objects such asthe legs of oil rigs, using them asarticial reefs.ldquoImportantly, the decision on what

If anyone on the pro-UK side of politics had issued an equivalent and shameful and fear-mongering warning, just imagine the faux nationalist outrage.Coincidentally, at the same time as their latest fear mongering, it is revealed that Scotland, under the SNP, is fast becoming the \"drugs deaths capitalrsquorsquo of the planet. Its spinners will be madly trying to find out how this human tragedy can somehow be blamed on Westminster.No doubt there are many reasons for the startling increase in these horric deaths but an SNP administration, fixated on breaking up the UK and citizens assemblies and anything that may aid its search for the Holy Grail ndash leaving little or no time for the day job ndash does not help.Alexander McKay, Edinburgh EH.NEIL Mackay rightly rejects the idea of pursuing a route to independence outside of the law . Any route that smacks of pronouncing UDI is a bad look for a Government that wants to be taken seriously on the international stage.Yet Mr Mackayrsquos suggestion that the Scottish Government go to the Supreme Court or the European Court to try to overrule a UK Government refusal to grant a section  order for a second independence referendum is equally likely to end badly. He says ldquoitrsquos hard to see any court flouting the democratic will of the Scottish people, but that is surely the wishful thinking of an independence supporter.First, the court is likely to conclude that this matter is outside of its competence, with the decision to issue a section  order or not one that is fully the right of the UK Government. Secondly, any court will in any case be disinclined to get involved when, based on opinion polls, it is far from clear that there is majority support for having another referendum anytime soon. If such support were already overwhelming, then perhaps a court might be tempted, but instead, it is only the will of independence supporters that is being frustrated, not the will of the people of Scotland as a whole.Keith Howell, West Linton.LIKE Neil Mackay I am not a member of the SNP, but would like Scotland to be a self-governing country the international norm. Some points around his article, however.Plan B is not an original idea. It was first promulgated by Margaret Thatcher as the route to Scottish independence, and as such would be dficult for Unionists to argue was ldquobullying and illegal. All elections in Scotland for some years, driven by Unionists, have been fought only around independence and a referendum. The Supreme Court would certainly follow the English concept of constitutional law, and find Westminster sovereign. Its whythe Supreme Court was established: to override the Scottish constitutional view of ldquosovereignty of the people. Itrsquos time the Scottish media put pressure on Unionist politicians to give us their alternative to a second referendum, given many thought a second EU referendum was OK.GR Weir, Ochiltree.SO enthusiastic is Martin Redfernwith his obsession to denigrate First minister Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP, that he lets exaggeration of the rhetoric get in the way of the actualityndash even his frequent use of the conditional-tense phrase ldquoit would seem. . . does not get him off the hook.First, historically, it was Scotland being subjected to a Westminster government Conservative when it had voted otherwise Labour that was the main driver of the movement towards independence. Devolution, it was said, would kill nationalism stone dead ndash so what went wrong  Well, for a start, Tony Blair likened it to a parish council, so it can only be a stepping stone.But the flaws in Mr Redfernrsquos proposition are that it was not the nationalists that lost the  independence referendum, but the Yes campaign, which reflected non-nationalists too. And is he seriously suggesting that when a new first minister, or even a prime minister, is appointed as governing party leader, there should be a general election, which is the consequence of his assertion Douglas R Mayer, Currie.YOUR article about the impact of Boris Johnsons proposed reduction in rUK stamp duty on the willingness of people to remain in or move to Scotlandhighlights the problems the SNP has in adjusting taxes ndash especially income tax ndash while being joined at the hip with the UK.This is a situation that wont change with independence when, I assume, close economic ties and freedom of movement will be a main foundation of any SNP manesto and subsequent treaty.Far better to remain in the UK with harmonised fiscal policy and the equalising effect of the Barnet formula which compensates for regional iations, the benefits of which are obvious in the GERS reports which show Scotlands notional \"deficit\" is in effect an overdraft guaranteed by rUK which enables the Scottish Government to claim we balance our books every year.Allan Sutherland, Stonehaven."},{"url":null,"title":"issue-day-148th-open","story":"How old is The Open It was first played in  at Prestwick Golf Club in Ayrshire, which hosted the first  Opens.

This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : amComedian and television personality, Alan Carr, is set to perform in Orkney, later this year.

And I understand that it is very unfortunate that this problem, while unrelated to the air traffic controllers’ industrial action, has coincided with it. However, that is not much consolation to frustrated users of the service.“The issue here is that this is a leline service and there are no alternatives for people who simply have to fly. Local people and businesses in the Northern Isles need a reliable service, and we simply cannot afford local service-levels to be reduced. We accept that we have to live with unavoidable weather events, but the recent disruptions have been workforce-related.“HIAL is a Scottish Government-owned organisation and one of the reasons for that is a recognition that it provides a strategically critical part of our transport infrastructure in the Highlands and Islands. It’s way past time for ministers to take a long hard look at the situation and reassure us that they are prepared to intervene on behalf of the travelling public.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In   this was done by providing an annual assistance amount of £ million to consumers in the area, which Ofgem estimates is worth around £ per household.Mr McArthur said: “It is simply unfair for islanders to be surcharged when so many households in our island communities already experience the highest levels of fuel poverty anywhere in the country.“If these plans are implemented, it will be good news for consumers across the highlands and islands. It’s also evidence of the benefits of pooling and sharing across the UK.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The move is a result of a partnership with the organisation PAMISwhich campaigns for these facilities, and has been supported by Transport Scotland.The move comes as a result of research highlighting that , people in the UK need such special assistance and facilities. Users include people with profound and multiple learning disabilities and people with a range of other disabilities including Cerebral Palsy, Motor Neurone disease, Multiple Sclerosis, stroke, some older people and other specic disabilities.The requirements are set out in British Standards, and include:The new toilets are already open on deck six of MV Hjaltland and MV Hrossey, and will be available on board MV Hamnavoe by the end of the year.“This investment is another sign of our commitment to making our facilities as welcoming as possible to everyone in the community,# said Stuart Garrett, managing director at Serco NorthLink Ferries.#It will open up opportunities for many people with disabilities and their familes to visit some of the most beautul parts of Scotland. It also supports those living on the islands when travelling to and from the mainland for leisure and essential healthcare.”The move is the latest in a series of measures aimed at improving journeys for all travelers. Earlier this month the company became the first Scottish transport operator to introduce the pioneering Neatebox support service. This followed improvements to the NorthLink website, disability awareness training for staff, and a new partnership with a sign language interpreting agency.Mum and carer Jenny Whinnet, who helped to start the PAMIS campaign  years ago, said: #This is an exciting development for families and carers.#It permits people who need these facilities to travel further afield confidently and with dignity. This is very dferent to the early years of this campaign, when it was so dficult for me to travel with my son Craig because there were no Changing Places toilets available.”Jenny Miller, Chief Executive Officer of PAMIS added: “We’ve been very impressed with the commitment and consideration shown by Serco NorthLink Ferries in developing changing places toilets on their ferries.#They have really listened to the stories from the families and people we work with and who feel excluded from so many activities that we all take for granted. We’re delighted that the Orkney and Shetland ferries will be the first in the country, and possibly the world, to have a Changing Places toilet.”Paul Wheelhouse, minister for energy, connectivity and the islands is pleased to see the new facilities up and running.He said: #This type of improvement is exactly why we set up the Ferries Accessibility Fund.#We know accessible travel not only enables people to enjoy equal access to our beautul country, but it also enables people to fully participate in society and improve the quality of their lives, so we want to continue to identy and remove any disabling barriers which prevent people from making journeys or lead to them having an unpleasant time on board.#It’s very important that Scotland’s ferry services are fully accessible, offering the best passenger experience possible to everyone and this targeted investment marks very welcome progress on that journey.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is they, after all, who made history as ambassadors of humankind, setting foot onto a ­­\u2028far-flung celestial body. Michael Collins, Apollo ’s ­command module pilot, who watched on, fearful that catastrophe would intervene to ensure he would make theto Earth alone, played an integral part in the mission. So too did the many pioneers whose names occupy a mere footnote of history, despite the fact that without their expertise and composure, the disaster Collins feared – or much worse – would have almost inevitably come to pass. The semicentennial celebrations of the Moon landing is an occasion to remember those who occupy the foothills of the credits. One of the statistics surrounding Project Apollo, which seems to me both remarkable and entirely rational, is that around , people were involved in rendering the impossible possible.This army of engineers, scientists, programmers, mathematicians, and technicians defied technological limitations and bureaucratic wrangling to produce approximately five-and-a-half million parts which, working in unison, spirited Apollo’s crew to the Moon and back. : How moon landing conspiracy theories began and why they persist today – Professor Peter Knight:  years since the moon landing: why Scotland is the true home of astronaut Neil ArmstrongIn any other corporate environment, the prospect of workers on the ground feeling disconnected from the mission’s overall goal would barely warrant concern. But Project Apollo’s programme ­manager, George Müller, knew fine well the risks of letting such apathy go unchecked. He ensured the astronauts toured factories across America tasked with manufacturing the spacecraft components. This was no mere public relations exercise. It reminded workers that a single oversight on their part could kill the men standing before them, and it forged a sense of collective responsibility. Nowhere was this esprit de corps more evident than Building  of Nasa’s Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas, home to the Apollo mission operations control centre , where the spacecraft’s ­navigation, propulsion, le support, and communications systems were monitored with unflinching ­scrutiny.At any given time, between  and  men – and one trailblazing woman, JoAnn Morgan, the instrumentation controller – held in their hands the lives of three men a ­quarter of a million miles away. Their number included Stephen Bales, the son of a janitor and a ­beautician, who less than five years previously had moved from the farming community of Fremont, Iowa, to join Nasa as an intern, responsible for guided tours. In an interview with  Minutes to the Moon, a superb BBC World Service podcast detailing the graft, ingenuity, and composure which underpinned the final descent to the lunar surface, Bales recently reflected on the mission that would define his career. Without him, it would have probably ended in failure. As the Eagle craft neared the Moon, an alarm code known as  flashed on its on-board computer display. It was the only moment in the entire mission when a degree of urgency,not fear, could be heard in Armstrong’s voice.Bales, by then one of Apollo ’s guidance officers, saw the alarm four seconds later. Initially unsure of its signicance, he remembered the last simulation he and the flight controllers had carried out before the landing proper. Back then a similar code, known as , had appeared, prompting Bales to call an abort. In the subsequent debriefing, he immersed himself in the myriad alarms that could be triggered, working with Jack Garman, a computer specialist, to understand their meaning.In doing so, they realised a  referred to a software reboot which cancelled all the processes that the computer was running crucially, it happened so fast, no vital guidance or navigation data would be lost. So when the code appeared for real, Bales knew the mission could continue. It was a decision made in the space of  seconds – “an eternity,” said Bales – but it saved Apollo . There are countless other stories like his. Take that of John Aaron from Oklahoma, the son of a cattle rancher and a minister, recruited by Nasa at  without an interview. He felt ashe had walked into a foreign country where people spoke another language, on account of the dizzying number of acronyms being hurled around. After just six weeks, he contemplated jacking it all in. Fortunately for him, and the Apollo programme, he knuckled down. Only a few months later, his split-second decision making was credited with saving Apollo  after its rocket was struck by lightning. It is dficult to conceive of the pressure these men worked under, as they analysed the spaceflight while listening to three,not four conversations simultaneously on communication channels known as ‘loops’.The average age of those inside MOCR was just , and as Gerry Grfin, the flight director during Apollo ’s fraught re-entry into the Earth’s atmosphere, has pointed out, their youth counted in their favour. “It was the lack of fear,” he explained. “It wasn’t the lack of knowing it was risky.”It also means that, half a century on, many of them are still with us, able to reflect on an epoch-defining moment and receive our thanks for the part they played in it.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"can you help theatre make the world a better place linda crooks","story":"Next month, Scotland will be at the epicentre of the global arts and culture movement as the Edinburgh International Festival and Fringe blossom into le once again.The Traverse Theatre is at the heart of this cultural celebration – both physically and figuratively – and we welcome the heightened exposure and attention these festivals bring to the work of our theatre and many others in the capital. As Scotland’s only theatre dedicated to new writing all year round, the Traverse is much more than the bricks and mortar of the building we occupy off Lothian Road.The Traverse is a place where artists and audiences are invited to meet and attempt to make sense of the world, to question, learn, empathise, and to encounter dferent people and experiences. Our influence extends around the globe with our productions of Ulster American, What Girls Are Made Of, Mouthpiece and Locker Room Talk touring to audiences in Australia, New Zealand, North and South America, Ireland and the UK already this year.: Joyce McMillan: The rise of the far-right in Europe is no Cabaret, old chum: Theatre review: Mouthpiece, Traverse, EdinburghTheatre is fundamental to a healthy democracy and we believe the Traverse – defined by a bold and unique body of work that harnesses the erse talents of everyone in the team here and the artists and communities we work with – is a force for good in this sense. We provoke and encourage debate and facilitate a fusion of disparate groups and ideas. To maximise the scope of those conversations we must ensure the Traverse continues to be accessible, attractive and welcoming to the many, not just the few.If we are to achieve that, we need to react to the many changes in the world around us and open up new pathways for people to come to the theatre, both as writers and as audience members.To that end, today we launch the search for two people who will be instrumental in shaping the work of the Traverse through to its th anniversary in  and beyond. After a period of consultation and reflection we are bolstering our leadership team by recruiting for a new artistic director of the Traverse Theatre Company, and a director of creative development. This investment will ensure we give equal energy to creating a vibrant programme of work that celebrates new material and developing routes into the theatre for new writers and audiences.The director of creative development will devote time and effort to strengthening those pathways by nurturing our relationships with communities here in Scotland and further afield. We believe creativity is an attribute everyone has and that everyone should be given the opportunity to explore their artistic talents. In creating a new role which has ultimate responsibility for that work, we will in turn enable and empower the incoming artistic director to focus exclusively on overseeing a new writing programme that represents an ambitious artistic vision for the Traverse.The people we appoint to these two roles will be joining a talented and determined team that has been instrumental in shaping this new structure and is eagerly awaiting this next phase in our growth. We believe these changes will not only help us deliver our vision, but meet our ambition to change the world we live in through the work we produce and the creative development programmes we champion. The Traverse exists to amply unfamiliar voices and to reach fresh eyes and ears with the work we produce all year round.

As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well.

What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists! Never mind, I am sure they enjoyed their day off school.Nuclear power  Thatgreat physicistRobert Oppenheimer , on seeing the first atomic bomb explode said with horror—-“ I am become death , the destroyer of worlds.”. The people of Japan and Chernobyl have had a taster and I suspect they arenot eager for a repeat. .However,Shetland is####..Hmm.Rock on.Haydn, Thorium reactors, not Uranium! no atom bombs, no long term isotopes decaying for millennia. Almost infinite clean energy with really cheap fuel.Where would your preferred site be for the Shetland nuclear power station be Dr Tinkler  Aith  Bigton  Would bring plenty work to the west side. You could include it in your manestoyou stand for the council again.Well, Ray Purchase, it is already here. Thousands of Shetlanders have had radiotherapy and had their lives saved by a nuclear atomic reactions of one type or another.I seriously doubtthere is a single person on Shetland who has not had their own, a member of their family or close friends le saved by the products of nuclear reactors.Are you so moronic as to deny that or is that a bit too deep for you to understand or Oh dear Dr Tinkler, it seems you’ve come down with a nasty case of whataboutery. I didn’t ask you about the undoubted benefits of x-rays and radiotherapy I asked you where you would build a nuclear power station in Shetland. Now do you think you could give a straight answer to a straight question  Physician heal thyself!If thorium proves viable, I would be happy for such a station in Lerwick. Safe, clean, small and less damaging than the district heating woodchip waste burner we have at present and infinitely less toxic. I also asked is that a bit too deep for you to understand  # So it seems to be!!Well done Ian, you answered the question! There was a lot of unnecessary waffling and needless aggression but you got there. So, in the incredibly unlikely event of a, totally safe, nuclear power plant being built in Shetland you’d still want it as far away from where you live as possible. Fair dos.Instead of nuclear power or gas have you ever put any thought into wind power  I’ve heard that they don’t cause any carbon pollution at all, so they’d be ideal. They’re very pretty too and scientic. Like an actual windmill, I’m a big fan.Sadly Ray, you are being misled. take Viking for example. Peat disturbance alone. over  kilometres of tracks, the ground footprint of over  square kilometres. A fair amount of COreleased there. Then tens of thousands of tons of concrete basses.emissions, Chatham House.  kilometres of the interconnector, Copper plastic!!! Now just imagine the peat is so unstable that helicopters are being used, just to move survey teams to reconnoitre the site. Tracked vehicles to damaging for the peat!! . Just what is that carbon footprint  Laughableit was not so sad!How something you and Mark Ryan Smith may understand. The very latest scientic information on controlling climate change “Tree planting #has mind-blowing potential# to tackle climate crisis” , now would not planting a tree be a more rational action for these children  That would be the sensible, intelligent and educated option. PS, could someone please inform the SIC SNP SCT and Green Lunatics!No one here has denied climate change Brian Smith. Just a discussion on the merits or otherwise of the School children#s strike. Our youngsters being encouraged to jump on the #Greta Thunberg# bandwagon. There you really do have a sacricial lamb to the European Green lunatics but that is another really sad story!You mustcarefully, Mr T.Well, Brian, I have never denied Climate change. I just dispute the best way to combat it.Deft footwork here from Ian. His, and his hero Farage’s position # not that he cares to own up to it # is not that there is no climate change. Obviously the climate changes over time. What he is conveniently avoiding are the questions around cause and appropriate response.Please do not make up speculative little stories porkies Peter. Farage is not my hero, however, I find him infinitely preferable to Corbyn and Salmond, however, here is not the place to digress further.Will Hell freeze over before Ian tells us what he presumes the protestors are ignorant of  Answering the question he posed Brian is not too mammoth a task for him surely. I suspect he is trying to dodge it for a reason.Read and weep Peter. If your intellect stretches that far. !! In the most simple of Science, It is set out below. The protestors are ignorant of the very most basic understanding of carbon capture and the prevention of climate change. Trees!! Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least.That would be self-evident Peter. Read up the following. Bio-Fuels, palm oil plantation. Diesel fuel promotions, particulates. Germany non-nuclearpolicy,brown coal burning. Shetland exports clean gas imports polluting wood chip. Tree planting reverses CO build up, wood chip more polluting than coal burning and deforests huge areas. The EU % of renewable, Biomass .Greenies promote non-nuclear. more people killed in wind farm accidents in Uk than nuclear ever has. All the above would indicate a somewhat lunatic approach from the Greens. Now we have, using helicopters to survey Viking Energy sites as peat too unstable for tracked vehicles to reach, unbelievable!!! I hate to say the cult of #Greta Thunberg#,depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks,Asperger’s syndrome, high-ing autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism and self-harm. The sacricial lamb of the Greens across Europe. The inspiration behind the school strikes!!!!! Nowthat#s not lunatic, what is Ian’s position on global warming is either well grounded or is, well, hot air. He knows how this goes. Either he has a reputable theorist publishing an article in a reputable journal, or even a weblink to a news story referencing such, or he doesn’t. Because some vested interests have bought and paid for their own pet scientiststhere may be dferent opinions regarding whatever his as yet unclear point was with his unnamed and undated second ice age. If he really wants to be taken seriously he should put up or# consider his alternative.C’mon Ian, one reference to one reputable scientist backing up whatever it is you so obviously don’t want to say. You know you can do it.I am would be intrigued to opinions relating to climate change due to agriculture and what would be the answer to providing food but reducing or stopping climate change due to agriculture. I may be wrong but I believe agriculture produces  times more greenhouse gases than all of transportation put together, but this has, conveniently, been avoided by the media and scientic community. There is a terrible dilemma between producing food to this of attempting to reduce green houses gases and the progressive climate change taking place Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough and we are confused.One minute providing grants to preserve Shetland#s peat carbon store, and the next proposing digging acres of it up, releasing all that carbon, to build Viking.Giving out paper straws in McDonalds with juice in a plastic cup .I mind askingabout planting trees on my croft. They said #oh we dont want these clumps of trees any more, not our landscape#, when I had always thought tree planting was good.Such a mixed message. Why dont we have a green rating system like we have for our washing machines. You could rate biomass, nuclear, windfarms from construction to operation in terms of green to red, so we would know where we are in the scale with our choices.Any way, still have a patch of high hill that would be great for a mini woodsI referenced Greta with a very heavy heart, a truly exploited child whose background would fire concern with any child specialist in the UK, psychologist or Social worker.Sorry, Johan, who isn#t #taking climate change seriously# Theresa May and the Tories are taking it very seriously, indeed, passing Mrs May#s unilateral # net zero# plan into law. The Treasury says it will cost over £ trillion , enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years.Too little for Greta Thunberg and her #Extinction Rebellion pals, apparently.This will find its way on to consumers# electricity bills, including those in fuel poverty, a clear majority of homes in Shetland #  percent, before the recent price hikes.The Shetland Labour Party that I grew up with was concerned with alleviating poverty, not creating it. They were not interested inwinning #Green Blue Peter Badges# for futile, bourgeois bagatelles like#tackling climate change#, without any hope of success.Britain, far less, Shetland, can achieve nothing alone.The only candidate to exhibit concern for Shetland#s poor is Ian Scott.Im confused. You state that the Tories are proposing  net zero and then you say Labour creating poverty.I am very seriously concerned about fuel poverty everywhere and especially in Shetland. I hope that there are no price hikes in our fuel bills, this is something we need to resist, and I also hope more help is forthcoming for retrofitting better heating systems and more insulation to improve housing quality.Please do not try to tell me what I believe.Johan, I don’t recall you ever mentioning fuel poverty before. Do you support or oppose “ net zero”, which was done in knee-jerk response to the campaigns of Greta Thunberg and her pals “Extinction Rebellion” Only, you have been supporting Ms Thunberg’s “climate emergency” campaign at local level, have you not Mrs May’s , nurses salaries for  years isn’t “emergency” enough for them, they want more.You can huff and puff as much as you like, the cost will find its way to the fuel poor, increasing their number.I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Greta Thunberg AND the fuel poor, whom you have now mentioned for the first time.Mr Scott has been arguing for Shetland’s poor since long before he became a councillor.No John I have not been supporting Greta#s campaign locally and yes I have mentioned fuel poverty before and I think I can support greener politics and the poor. It is an important point tho, how we are going to pay for it all. I heard somewhere the Tories are going to pay for it from the proceeds of G.Johan, I responded to your comment above that Greta Thunberg is right .You have also defended the Shetland schools strike “climate emergency” demonstration in this self, same thread.I quote: “Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough#..etc..”That sounds awful like you think Mrs May committing  years’ worth of , nurses salaries isn’t “taking climate change seriously enough” If you are now saying that you do not support Greta Thunberg and do wish to tackle Shetland’s lamentable fuel poverty, will you be making a clear, prominent statement to that effect in your campaign literature Including your and Shetland Labour’s proposals for solving the fuel poverty The twisting of my words is really uncalled for, and completely ignoring the main point of my post which is that we need a green rating system to stop you all arguing about what is green and what is not # but then you enjoy the fight too much and would poo poo any system anyway I suppose.Strange move of support from Wir Shetland to Ian Scott  You#re scraping the barrel, now, Johan, getting personal. After your Up Helly-Aa performance, your comment about #enjoying the fight# is, frankly,a bit rich.It appears you are not prepared to make the campaign commitment I suggested. That#s ok.I#m not supporting anyone yet as I haven#t heard from all the candidates. I merely pointed out that Mr Scott is the only one so far to have shown any real concern for Shetland#s poor. He needs to say more about that. Under the present arrangements #climate emergency# will dump on the fuel poor. They have votes, too, of course # more than  percent of the electorate.Good luck with your campaign.Given his concern for the fuel poor John Tulloch will presumably be supporting whichever candidate puts the cancellation of Brexit first and foremost in their manesto  The largest driver of upward pressure on heating bills over the past two years is the devaluation of the pound following the Brexit vote. Greta Thunberg had nothing to do with it. In the event of further declines in the value of the pound post prime minister Johnson increased hard Brexit probability, the suffering of the fuel poor will continue to worsen as the wholesale price of gas becomes relatively more expensive when purchased in pounds sterling.The  dilemma that John Tulloch posed to Johan Adamson could equally well be phrased thus: I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Brexit AND the fuel poor.I apologiseI have gotten personal. Be as naesty as du wants, I just cant fathom why you need to be so  Breakfast TV only this morning were talking about how the market is not working, people not changing utility supplier and these people paying more as a consequence.Its surely not fairyour contract runs out that they are able to leave you on a higher rate Action on fuel poverty needs to include tackling the inequalities in the market as well as action to make our houses warmer.Ok, Johan. I’ve made my points about fuel poverty and there’snothing I want to add.So forgive meI don’t digress into bickering about who has or hasn’t been “naesty”. Readers may judge.Good luck with your campaign.Yes, Ian can answer a question when he chooses to. And there is sense in some of what he says. Wind farms on peat, for example, happen when commercial interests chase subsidies, so it is up to governments to get the correct approach. Not all that blame goes at the Green’s door, and they are either correct to claim there is a climate emergency or they are not.On the climate emergency Ian’s thoughts can only be guessed at. They have something to do with an ice-age, which is appropriate as progress towards getting him to answer his own question is, as yet, glacial.A big problem inside these debates stems from some people get beguiled by fake scientic claims. This is why genuine people making genuine scientic claims are generally happy to back them up by referencing the work of the real scientists involved. This offers folk who may or may not be less expert than Dr. Ian Tinklersome protection from charlatans with an axe to grind. Again,Ian is serious, rather than just being a contraryIan, he will reveal his ice-age source s. Or would doing so would reveal his actual movitation  C’mon Ian, youknowyouwantto.I actually sent them to the Times. They failed to print them as perhaps regarded as irrelevant pertaining to the school strike. I will do so again so Peter can untwist his knickers.The book you really should read, Mr T., is The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace Wells. Things are far more precarious than you think.David Wallace Wells. I would rather believe scientic specialists in ious fields than blindly take the word of a Journalist, Brian.

We still haven#t founda proper way of storing spent nuclear fuel, i can seethe repository at Sellafield being under miles of snow through the many ice ages to come before it issafe again.The nuclear nonsensewas never about cheap and safe electricity it was of course about weapons grade plutonium tons,produced here in Scotland alone,why that amount when a few tons could polish off the entire planet does anyone know Do we trust Boris and fruitcake farm with this ,aye right- their record speaks for itself! Maybe the bairns protesting about climate change holds a candle of hope up - -we are all going to need it.Graham Fleming, Thorium breakdown isotopes have short half-lives. Long term storage is nor an issue. Ask a standard grader that is beyond your understanding.Incidentally, the global stockpile of separated plutonium is about  tonnes. That is  tonnes too much, however Thorium reactors produce none at all. Sad you cannot get your facts straight Graham Flemming, so very SNP.Having read these pages for a long time Peter, it should be apparent by now that Ian is a dental surgeon by training and therefore qualies for Dr status.No need to have a PhDor any other bits of paper !Ok, well thanks to Ian, andthe Times did withhold the links as irrelevant to the school strike they maybe had a point. It was Ian that insisted to Brian Smith way back when that this issue was relevant, for whatever reason.I#m still not clear what Ian draws from these articles though, or why anyone would have to have this knowledge to take a view on the current level of threat, but I get that global warming isn#t about to lead to another ice age. I don#t recall the protest saying it would# It#s a welcome change to have Ian express himself without resort to petty insult though. Long may that continue. On his earlier point on science, however, I#m not sure most scientists would agree science means knowledge only, as Ian proposed, without including the search for it by using scientic methods.But here is the big unanswered question # whatever it is Ian take from these links # does he, or does he not, think we are facing a climate crisis  If we are then surely the kids are right to be concerned, especially as some government sponsored action on climate change is potentially green-wash.Slight problem with the colour test Johan.About % of men have problems when distinguishingbetween red and green .

Striker Ian Bray was particularly unfortunate when he shot narrowly wide, saw another effort deflected for a corner and then his header bounced off the bar.Spurs were holding on at the end with the players relieved to hear the full-time whistle.Best for the winners were centre back Andrew Flett and youngster Brandon Talukder in midfield, while Bray and midfielder Harry Thomson both stood out for Ness. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"exciting new designs in latest shetlandmade exhibition ","story":" summer programme at Weisdale Mill#s Bonhoga Gallery will open on Saturday.Celebrating local contemporary craft and its role in Shetland#s culture and economy, the main gallery will host the work of some of Shetland#s most popular and talented practitioners.This showcase will champion fine craftsmanship and innovative design from six artists and makers, all of whom are exhibiting new work alongside their current collections.Examples of the work in the ShetlandMade showcase.There will be exciting pieces from jewellers Mike Finnie and Esme Wilcock, contemporary textiles from designers Andrea Williamson and Nielanell, wooden furniture and designs from Paparwark as well as colourful glass creations from Cheryl Jamieson of Glansin Glass.The showcases provide an opportunity for visitors to engage with craft at a closer level, and discover what it is that inspire local designers and makers to create their amazing pieces.All work featured in the showcases will be for sale, providing a unique opportunity for both visitors and locals alike to purchase from a large and erse collection of high quality, contemporary applied art and craft and consequently support our local craft sector.Shetland Arts retail manager Angela Smith said: #We are very excited about this opportunity for Shetland makers.

The Loch Ewe farm has failed the required environmental standards for nearly  years. Mowi, despite virtually unlimited resources, were apparently unwilling or unable to make the necessary changes. broadcast in May.In January , the Scottish Parliament#s Rural Economy and Connectivity Committee agreed to undertake an enquiry into the state of salmon fishing in Scotland and in November  the regulatory body SEPA published proposals for a revised regulatory regime for the finfish sector. Within these proposals, SEPA said it would begin a programme of work to #modernise the regulation of existing sites#.Mowi#s head of environmental management, Stephen MacIntyre, said that the company wanted to #align its growth# with recent recommendations. The company had plans to sustainably grow their fish production levels over the next few years by #expanding into new high-energy farming areas located further offshore#.Bill Whyte, convener of the Wester Ross Area Salmon Fishery Board, said he welcomed Mowi#s recognition of the wild salmonid habitats and added: #We will expect further clarity about the process of biomass relocation. However,Mowi can provide evidence through EIAplanning and SEPA regulatory structure that the relocated biomass will have reduced potential impact on wild migratory fish, then we would be prepared to support biomass relocation on a conditional basis.#*A spokesperson from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency , said: “It is really encouraging to see that industry is proactively choosing to consider more sustainable locations for fish farms, away from more sensitive waters where pressures on the marine environment are greatest. “SEPA’s new regulatory framework for marine cage fish farming, launched on  June, , combines more accurate modelling and enhanced monitoring to encourage a more sustainable approach to the siting of fish farms. “In practice, we anticipate this will lead to fewer fish farms in shallower, slow-flowing waters and more fish farms in offshore locations where the environment capacity can better assimilate wastes. The new framework is designed to actively support operators who are seeking to relocate to more sustainable locations, and through improved practices and the innovative use of new technologies, reduce their impact on the marine environment.#They went on to add: “Indeed, our new framework provides exactly the type of flexibility and outcome-focus Mowi outlines it is looking for.Within this new framework, we will consider each inidual proposal on its merits against the legal standards.We encourage Mowi and other operators to work with us and other interested parties to explore their innovative proposals under our new framework.We look forward to doing so."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Kara-with-100m-IM-Gold.jpg","title":"inspirational western isles swimmer kara hanlon wins four gold medals at international island games in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine July.And the -year old was not the only WesternIsles athlete to celebrate a podium place in the shadow of the famous rock, asmore joy followed in the pool and in the athletics stadium.Isla Budge won bronze in the -metres freestyle event, while in Thursday’s triple jump final Mary Macleod won silver and Heather MacKinnon took bronze.Eriskay jumper MacKinnon had won gold in the event in Gotland two years ago with a shorter jump than it took to win third this time around.Hanlon’s week of glory began on Monday whenshe retained the  metres breaststroke title she won in Gotland in .

We’re guests every year at the place we go.“As guests we are very conscious that we want to be part of the community. We are very clear that we want to spend money in the community. We want to help with legacy funds in the community. But we will be gone in a couple of weeks. And so we want to live with the community.”He added: “There’s always things going on around the golf. And that’s wonderful. And the community carries on. Our job is to put on the Open Championship and to respect the fact that we are guests.”Portrush home-grown golf star Graeme McDowell also tried not be to drawn into the realm of politics when asked about the musical event on the final practice day.“I certainly don’t really want to start getting into politics and religion and that kind of stuff,” he said.“I’m not intelligent and educated enough in the real intricacies of why and how we still do this stuff.“People like to celebrate. As long as it’s all respectfully done, we’ll listen to people. It’s a free country, right “I don’t really want to get into that stuff.

They have provided assurances that she will not be disadvantaged as a result of losing out on the experience of acting up nor will she be victimised in any way. The Board has also committed to liaising with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, head of legal services at the Equality Commission, welcomed the result. \"This is a good result all round,\" she said. \"One of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change.\"While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future. \"Its good that this has been resolved productively and amicably.\"Ms McKernan said the case should serve as a reminder to employers of the need to treat staff fairly. \"Were publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part-time working arrangements, even unintentionally,\" she said.The legal expert pointed out that % of female employees work part-time in NI compared to % of male workers.Women make up % of part-time employees here. \"Because of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women,\" Ms McKernan explained. \"Thats why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination.\" Ms McCormick, who will continue teaching at the grammar school, also welcomed the outcome which she believes has led to positive change. \"I love my job and am happy at the school,\" she said. \"So Im pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with in a formal and procedurally correct manner.\""},{"url":null,"title":"private jet numbers soar at derry airport for the open","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But, that short daily journey must have taken as least twice as long as it would have taken anyone  simply because almost everyone he passed knew him, stopped him and engaged in conversation with him.On the th anniversary of the school’s opening in  I was asked to help compile a book to mark the occasion. When I sat down to write a list of those who would have to be interviewed, John Dunne was the first name on the top of the pile.When I started to transcribe John’s interview it began like this: “In this era of media created ‘stars’, famous for nothing more than seeking fame-or infamy, in many cases-the tag of legend is one that is all too easily doled out.“Most people in their formative years can point to a mentor who influenced them greatly and provided knowledge and encouragement when these vital commodities were often all too scarce. More often than not, these people are unassuming and go about their lives in the same manner.“These people are society’s real legends and in the history of St Joseph’s, fewany, earned that accolade more than John Dunne.”That chapter of the book on St Joseph’s was entitled ‘One of nature’s gentlemen’, and there’s absolutely no reason to change that title for the purposes of this appreciation of John Dunne’s le because in my opinion its accuracy cannot be upgraded in any way.‘Big John’ as he was affectionately known to all former pupils of the school, made a positive mark on thousands of young lives in his four decades at St Joseph’s. It would be hard to find anyone that would disagree that the word big when applied to John Dunne not only represented his physical stature but also his intelligence and patience.By , the Dunne family had lived at Brandywell Road, Burnfoot and then back to Derry and more specically the newly developing Creggan estate.John Dunne began his career at St Columb’s College in  in the company of contemporaries such as Nobel laureates John Hume, Seamus Heaney.In  he told me: “I enjoyed the time at St Columb’s without really realising or wondering what le was about. There were people then who went back up to the College at six o’clock and studied until nine o’clock.“But, I and another man, Bill Smyth, who also ended up teaching at St Joseph’s, instead of going to the school, followed a great interest we had discovered-greyhounds. That was our main pursuit. Strangely, we both also ended up training as teachers at St Joseph’s College in Belfast which was linked to Queen’s University but separate in that it awarded its own accreditation.”It was at training college that John Dunne encountered a dilemma. Already well-known for his ability as a footballer, his lelong passion, he had to make the choice of whether he would pursue as a career as PE teacher.“I had distinct limitations, because when I was very young, I nearly died twice. When I was six months old and again when I was five, I caught pneumonia. I remember the second time and having to lie from about December to April before I came around.“I was in a sort of comatose state for a long time, but my mother God rest her, battled away and I survived. But, it left me severely limited in terms of stamina. In terms of pace, I was very quick off the mark, but I couldn’t sustain it. And, the further up you went in football, the more of a problem it became. I loved reserve football, but the full senior game was just too fast for me,” he said.In September  John began his teaching career at the newly opened St Joseph’s Secondary School in Creggan for the princely sum of £ per month. It was here that he spent the entire span of his professional le.The new school with its emphasis educating those who had not successfully navigated the old  plus exam, it was a ready-made home for John Dunne and many of his contemporaries alike. Like many of his era, John benefitted from easier access to grammar school system because of post-war changes to British education policy. But, also like many of his generation, John spoke candidly about his reservations on it. His words also revealed why he preferred the non-selective route through school.“The thing about going to St Columb’s is that we weren’t completely accepted. We were dferent somehow. The boarders who stayed there were the ‘real’ St Columb’s boys as far as the clergy were concerned.“There are things now that are still etched in my memory. Where I lived, there was a protest after a child lost a leg having been hit by a bus. The people were worried about the safety of their children so they weren’t prepared to let the bus keep travelling that route.“Anyhow, the protest could be seen from the College. A priest, who shall remain nameless said, ‘well, what would you expect from people like that ’“We took great umbrage at that. I had been through a kind of elitist system at St Columb’s, where you had to prove yourself in the first place by getting so many marks in an  plus exam, in English and Maths-and they weren’t easy. They were quite dficult examinations. I went to the Christian Brothers at they drilled us kept us on in the afternoon for an hour, got us up on Saturday mornings and drilled us and drilled us.“When I went to teach in a secondary school it was very dferent. You had children there that for one reason or another had fallen through the system. They hadn’t perhaps done themselves justice in the system that surrounded them. In my time at St Joseph’s there were children who should not have been there because they could not get anything out of the system at all, no matter how much we tried or how much sympathy we had for their position. But we did try.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I had been through a system where I met good teachers, people who had made a good impact on my le. So, what I did when I saw what they were doing was imitate them. I wove all the goodness in other people into a fabric that I could use myself, and I found that it worked,” said John.At the end of John Dunne’s first decade as a teacher, the Troubles erupted on the streets of his native city. St Joseph’s geographical location meant that major disturbances often encroached upon the school itself. It befell people like John Dunne to provide a calm backdrop to the mayhem outside the gates of St Joseph’s.In  he said: “It was a very, very strange environment to be working in, because all hell could have broken loose in the immediate vicinity of the school at any time. There were teachers out on the streets, acting as buffers, trying tom keep a lid on things.“In practical terms, I found it very hard because in summer time it was very hot and you had to open the windows to let a bit of air in. But, there were helicopters flying about and the noise was unbearable and the youngsters couldn’t hear you. A lot of young people became involved and some of them lost their lives as a consequence.”Apart from a very quick but understated wit, John Dunne was blessed with a fantastic voice, full of dramatic intonation, that would have been the envy of many stage actors.As a teacher of the English language John had the ability the bring the most boring text to le and kept his students enthralled. He could have been reading the contents of the back of a cereal box aloud, but when he spoke people listened.The ability to relate a story, complete with an array of accents when required, was one that he credited his grandfather John Downey with.“He was a great storyteller. I remember as a young boy he used to take me early in the morning for his pension. We used to go to Mass about seven or eight o’clock and then go to the train station on the Strand Road and out to Bridgend for his pension and then visit people in the area.“But when we were walking, he always told me stories about haunted houses, about what kind of flowers were at the side of the road.“There seemed to be no end to his knowledge and then he could deviate and tell me another yarn. I just thrived on his stories.“I think also it was the way I was taught at the Christian Brothers. They were very precise about language. It’s become too loose now. People are very loose, especially when using mobile phones.“I’ve even read about the use of the apostrophe being lost. I was taught these things were important when you wrote something. I stuck to it and I tried to instil it into youngsters without being overly heavy about it.”John Dunne’s dulcet tones were employed again when Derry City FC re-entered senior football in  and for many years after he commentated on many of the games played by his beloved Candystripes.This interview with John Dunne was conducted in  at Pilot’s Row community centre. At this stage he had been retired from teaching for almost two decades. But, the huge capacity that he had to retain swathes of information was still very much evident.Asto prove that very thing, in the later stages of this conversation a young boy, no more than ten or eleven years old walked past and said cheerily, ‘hello John!’Without blinking an eye, John Dunne recounted the boy’s family history and how many of his relatives attended St Joseph’s. That was proof that you could take the man away from St Joe’s, but not St Joe’s away from the man.The interview with John Dunne ended with him speaking about the five decades since the school opened.He said: “It’s been some fty years, especially for somebody like me who has finished up living in the Bogside. When I got here, I was a little bit apprehensive about being someone who worked in St Joseph’s and being accepted into the local community. But, it’s no bother. I am on first name terms with people.“I was walking over to Mailey’s pub one night in the summer about .. It was a beautul night. There was a group of young men sitting in a garden. I was walking in the middle of the road and one of them came out and addressed me by my name.“He said, ‘John, there are not many teachers that could do what you are doing and walked through this area untouched.“That’s good to know I said.”CAPTION: The late John Dunne."},{"url":null,"title":"operation motorman findings seamus bradley inquest made public next month","story":"The Inquest findings into one of the most controversial killings of the Troubles in Derry will be made public next month, the Derry News can reveal.Seamus Bradley was shot dead in highly disputed circumstances by the British Army during Operation Motorman in the early hours of July , .The Coroners Service for Northern Ireland has now confirmed that the findings of the Inquest will be announced by Judge Patrick Kinney on August  at Laganside Court in Belfast. The Inquest hearings took place over a twelve-day period last year.The British Army have claimed for the last  years, that Mr Bradley a -year-old IRA member, was armed when they opened fire on him close to the Bishop’s Field area of Creggan. This claim has consistently denied by the Bradley family over the decades.Danny Bradley, brother of the deceased man told the Derry News: “At the end of the day this is good news. It has taken  years and caused a lot of hurt for so long.“I am hoping that the findings will come out the way that we want it and we will be travelling together as family to Belfast next month to hear the outcome.“It destroyed our family, but I had to get the answer about what happened and I am certainly looking forward to that. After  years I will be glad to put it to bed because it has been a struggle.Seamus Quigley, solicitor for the family told the Derry News: “We share the relief of the Bradley family that after  years the findings of the case are now finally in sight.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshIn April this year the Public Prosecution Serviceannounced that it would proceed with charging a former British soldier with the murder of a teenage boy also killed on the morning of Operation Motorman.-year-old Daniel Hegarty was shot in the head on the morning of July , . His cousin Christopher Hegarty was also struck in the head by a round fired by the same soldier but survived the shooting. Soldier B, the man responsible for both incidents will also face a charge of wounding with intent in relation to Christopher Hegarty.The decision to prosecute the soldier represented the reversal of a decision taken in  not to prefer charges against the former British serviceman. That decision was however overturned after a Divisional Court ruling last year.Previous decisions not to prosecute in the Hegarty case were taken in  after the original Inquest and again in  following a review of the case by the former Historical Enquiries Team.Announcing the decision in relation to the Hegarty case, Director of the PPS Stephen Herron said: “I have given careful consideration to all of the available evidence. This has included material obtained in the course of the initial investigation by a later investigation carried out by the Historical Enquiries Team material generated by Inquest proceedings and a number of forensic reports-the most recent of which was provided after the Court ruling in .“I have concluded that the evidence which can be presented at court is sufficient to provide a reasonable prospect of conviction and the Evidential Test for Prosecution is met.”Nine people also died in Claudy on July ,  as three car bombs tore through the heart of the County Derry village.CAPTION: -year-old Seamus Bradley who was killed by the British Army on July , . "},{"url":null,"title":"scrapped bogside parking scheme blocks roll areas","story":"A Derry MLA has criticised a government department for its failure to deliver a Bogside residents’ parking scheme over the past decade.The comments made by SDLP MLA Mark H. Durkan come after the latest public consultation attracted over  objections which he now believes will scupper plans for similar schemes in areas such as Rosemount and Bishop Street.Mr Durkan said the Department for Infrastructurehas been “extremely ham-fisted” in its handling of the consultation process.The parking scheme issue stretches back around ten years, with ious public consultations having taken place in that time. At one stage, it was expected to be introduced in  but had to be pushed back until .In  then Roads Minister Danny Kennedy gave assurances that, “in the absence of signicant objections”, the scheme would be in place no later than Spring .However, this week, after a consultation ended last April and a further information session was held in November, a spokesperson for the Department explained that the proposed Rossville Street Residents’ parking scheme received a large number of objections from the residents.Of the  responses received, there were  objections to the scheme.The DfI told the Derry News that key areas of concern coming out of the consultation included the number of permits allocated for visitors, access for family carers and concerns over costs.The Department has since confirmed that the resident and visitor permits would be free and that a special permit would be available for family carers, also free of charge.The DfI spokesperson added: “The Department acknowledges that there is still a need to manage car parking in the Bogside and is now considering how to progress matters.“Consideration is being given to advancing a smaller scheme within the Rossville area to include Abbey Park, Glenfada Park and Columbcille Court, possibly as a pilot. The Department would hope to commence consultation for a smaller scheme in September.“The Department will write out to all residents living within the limits of the original Rossville scheme as soon it is confirmed how an alternative scheme will be progressed.“The Department is not in a position to consider other schemes at this time.”StaggeringMark H. Durkan is worried that delays to the Bogside parking scheme will now hamper the roll-out of similar schemes.“The fact this is happening will now block progress on any residents’ parking scheme where in the city.“Bogside residents want a parking scheme so it must be the design of it that people are objecting to. It’s staggering that a much-needed parking scheme in an area where residents struggle and have been crying out for a solution to the problem of getting parked outside their homes during the day has been scrapped.“This scheme has been deliberated over for ten years and the department has brought proposals forward that have been met with such opposition. It begs the question, was enough done to liaise and interact with objectors, and could they respond in turn to these objections.“Bogside was identied as a key area, as was Bishop Street and the next was the lower Rosemount university area. But now it seems asthe department has pulled the plug on those schemes and there is no chance of progress.”Parallel schemesThe SDLP representative had enquired about the possibility of a similar scheme in other areas which are badly impacted by students such as Rosemount, and Abercorn Place and Terrace which are both affected by city centre workers.“These could have been done in parallel so that at least one scheme could be advanced. People in Rosemount are frustrated that they’ve been put on the back burner while this other scheme was being progressed, but they’ll be even more frustrated to see it isn’t being progressed.“Rosemount and Bishop Street will now be way down the line, the handling of this by the Department of Infrastructure seems extremely ham-fisted,” Mr Durkan added.The Rossville Street area Residents’ Parking Scheme would be the first such scheme for the City and involves over  residential properties mainly in the Rossville Street, Fahan Street, Little Diamond, Creggan Street and Chamberlain Street areas.A DfI publication in March stated that, proposals for the Scheme were first announced by the previous Minister for Infrastucture, and following informal consultations “there has proven to be signicant support from residents who are experiencing increasing dficulties parking outside their homes.”The Department wrote to all residents within the area and encouraged all interested parties to formally respond to the proposals before  April.If introduced as proposed, the scheme would have designated free of charge parking places for residents only between the hours of . am and noon and between . pm and . pm from Monday to Saturday inclusive.Visitors would have been able to park within areas designated for residents provided a valid visitor’s permit is displayed on the vehicle.

There needs to be swt action as an enhanced facility could alleviate the problem people are currently facing.A Department for Infrastructure spokesman said the current Driver and Vehicle test centre network was built around  years ago.ldquoMuch has been done to maintain and modernise the test centres in that time, particularly to meet the growing demand for vehicle tests. However, present and future legislative requirements, coupled with increasing and changing demands for testing services, mean that the current network is no longer sustainable, he said.ldquoAs such, we have been reviewing the network with a view to determining the most appropriate network of test centres to meet our future needs. To date, with the exception of a new test centre being built at Hydebank in Belfast, no decisions have been taken on the size of any other specic test centres within a future network.The spokesman said the new test centre at Hydebank and will provide additional testing capacity for the Greater Belfast area.He added: ldquoOur plans for a new network are continuing to be progressed, specically in terms of the design for the new test centres and the acquisition of land.ldquoHowever, in the absence of the NI Executive there is currently no means to progress proposals beyond the construction of the new test centre at Hydebank..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Carryduff man honoured with major accolade  ","story":"A CARRYDUFF country sports enthusiast has been honoured with a major award.John Leighton, who is the president of the Ulster Gundog League, has been presented with The Great Game Fairs of Ireland letime achievement award.The awards, made each year at the Irish Game Fair at Fine Food Festival held at Shanes Castle, Antrim, are designed to recognise and reward outstanding iniduals who devote themselves to nurturing rural heritage.Announcing Johnrsquos award, Albert Titterington, managing director of The Great Game Fairs of Ireland, said: ldquoIt is an absolute pleasure each year to have the opportunity publicly to recognise some of the outstanding members of the game show family who commit their time, talents and enthusiasm to preserving rural traditions and promoting country sports.ldquoThese people work tirelessly behind the scenes and without any thought of reward mdash and John epitomises that blend of modesty and high achievement.ldquoOver the years John has enjoyed considerable sporting success with the dogs he trains and we have been proud to have enjoyed his support and insight as he served as spaniels directorrsquo with our fairs, shaping competitions and ensuring top quality entries.Mr Titterington said Mr Leightonrsquos  years of gundog competition experience commanded ldquoinstant respect in gundog circles and described him as a ldquopopular figure across this island and beyond..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Dee and Mackenzie never take a breather  ","story":"THE Murray family began the first of what was to prove an historic and richly rewarding week in athletics circles when they took part in the latest North Down Track and Field event on Tuesday night at Bangor.Mackenzie really set the standard for what was to follow when, after competing in the kg shot putt in which he scored . metres, he then proceeded to set a new PB .. in the ,m race in which he was second overall, in a field of  which contained several top quality adult runners.Dee, meantime, was in equally good form setting a new PB of .. for the k race, was only  seconds behind the race winner.Lucy OrsquoNeill also took part in the m U- girlsrsquo sprint and later scored an ever-improving .m in the U- girlsrsquo shot putt, an encouraging warm up for next weekendrsquos All Ireland TF championships in Tullamore.GreyabbeyAlready one of the most prolic and competitive duos anywhere, not only in the number of races participated in, but in terms of miles travelled to meetings, the father and son pairing then made the trip to Greyabbey on Friday night to take part in the two races there.Dee opted for the k and Mackenzie, having no choice, as the rules presently restrict him to the k distance, gave it a real go. He crossed the finish line in ., in sixth place overall, but first U-, a real eye-catching performance out of  finishersMeanwhile, Dee was not letting the side down as he again proved best in his age group, clocking yet another sub  time, his clocking of . was also good enough for overall seventh out of the  finishers.Ford kNewcastle was the venue for a nearer home race on Friday night and several East Down men and women took advantage of the opportunity to warm up for the action in Delamont the next day.Gordy Graham took third place overall in . a mere  seconds behind winner, Newcastlersquos David OrsquoFlaherty, while Catherine OrsquoConnor was second female in . to Gordyrsquos cousin, Laura Graham, who won in ..

It was great to see also that several relative newcomers to the club, Gillian and Gerard Grant, Donal Smith, Michael Morrissey and Alison Graham are happy to get involved with some of the older hands and the younger ones to enjoy the delights that a team relay can bring.Performances of the day have to be shared by Gavin Hynds whose third leg run for the EDAC male B team, which effectively hauled them up from last place to th.His time of . for the leg was only bettered by runners from the top two teams on the day, and by Neil Curran, the anchor leg runner for the EDAC A team.His final leg of . only put paid to the battling St Peterrsquos AC quintet during the final lap.

Your efforts are greatly appreciated by everyone in the club and especially by the athletes themselvesNevertheless, it proved a great day at Tullamore at the first of three days of action with the sun shining for a nice change.East Down had four athletes taking part all in the m, but in two dferent age groups. In the U- race Anna Gardiner and Lucy Foster both ran in separate heats with both finishing in sixth position.The top three in each heat qualied automatically for the final later in the day along with the fastest two finishers outside the top six.Unfortunately, both EDAC girls missed out on qualication, but they ran super races with Lucy gaining a PB of .. and Anna running ...Lauren Madine and Kirsti Foster both competed in the U- race with both winning their heats and automatically qualying for the final later in the day.A last minute change of time table meant the final was brought forward by an hour so that meant quick warm-ups and back on the track was not the ideal preparation that would normally take place before an All-Ireland final.Nonetheless, the two girls put their minds to it and gave it their best shot. Having two out of eight from one club in an All-Ireland final is an achievement in itself.Kirsti came fourth overall in .., just missing a medal by tenths of a second. Lauren had to settle for seventh in . as she was hampered by ankle issues which had developed after her heat.Well done to all four for their efforts.

These are two key elements of Delamontrsquos future success.Cllr Walker said he hopes that the public will be given time to view the content of the master plan when it is completed and that money to provide a raft of new facilities can be secured to allow work to potentially start next year.ldquoThe Education Authority stuck to its promise to invest in Delamont and I hope that the local authority will honour its commitment and start planning to provide more facilities at the country park which offers huge development potential, he said.ldquoWhile already a signicant tourism attraction, there are not that many facilities apart from a childrenrsquos playground, stunning walks and the hugely popular Steamerrsquos cafe and miniature railway.ldquoWhile I am not advocating that the beauty of the area is spoiled in any way, there are hundreds of acres of space which could be used to boost the parkrsquos tourism offering.Cllr Walker said the availability of finance to enhance the park is critical to its future development, providing new attractions and creating a boost for nearby businesses in Killyleagh.He added: ldquoThe eagerly-awaited master plan is the key to unlocking Delamontrsquos future development and can also pave the way for much-needed investment.

If Fascism hadnrsquot been beaten we would be living in a very dferent world today. ldquoWe would be living in fear of a regime which would not tolerate any descent. We are very lucky and should be thankful to those veterans who risked all and gave their tomorrow for our today.Cllr Hanna said the districtrsquos surviving veterans were small in number and well into their nineties, and that society owed a debt to them for their part in the battle to secure the freedom people enjoy today.He said he included the Merchant Navy in his proposal because many risked their lives on merchant ships to ferry supplies which helped win the war.ldquoThis was a cruel war where many lost their lives and I really hope we never have to face anything like this again. Those from Northern Ireland who fought and served during World War Two came from all sections of the community.ldquoBefore it is too late, I believe this council should acknowledge what these brave people did for us all by presenting surviving veterans with a silver poppy at a cross community service in November, said Cllr Hanna.He added: ldquoI hope that the council will support this motion as a mark of respect for the generation which has given us freedoms we take for granted.The SDLPrsquos Declan McAteer said he was ldquosomewhat dubious about the suggestion for the council ldquoto go out on a limb and procure silver poppy medals.ldquoI fully respect the sentiment of those wishing to identy with what is essentially a British symbol which wonrsquot by endorsed by all Irish men or women. The poppy, for better or worse, is associated with all conflicts that Britain was involved in from the First World War right through.ldquoI would say that perhaps thatwe do anything around this we take a lead from the British Legion in Ireland which decided on a shamrock poppy which has been worn by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.Cllr McAteer proposed that the issue be referred to the local authorityrsquos Good Relations Forum, with Sinn Feinrsquos Mickey Ruane in agreement.Cllr Ruane said he was respectful of the motion Cllr Hanna and his party had tabled, suggesting the Good Relations Forum was the ldquoideal committee to send the issue to.He added: We need to look at this issue and decide what event we are going to have and come to a respectful decision.At the debate conclusion, Cllr Hanna reaffirmed he had no issue referring his proposal for further debate, highlighting the need for the matter to be dealt with quickly.He also said he had no dficulty with awarding veterans a

problems within the districtrsquos planning department have been laid bare in a Newry, Mourne and Down Council report which has been made public.The local authority mdash which is responsible for district planners mdash has revealed in its annual audit committee report that the current number of live planning applications in the system is just over ,.The confirmation comes after local politicians recently pointed to what they described as ldquoserious problems at council management level for not taking the planning backlog seriously enough.Politicians have expressed concern that planners are not responding to their telephone calls and emails, with people who lodge applications also concerned that they are not getting any information from officials.Elected representatives say while all the fault does not rest with planners, they are firmly of the view that there are simply not enough staff to deal with the huge volume of work.Concern has also been expressed that the planning department is having problems retaining staff to work in a department that receives the second highest number of applications across the Provincersquos  councils.Politicians say there is a need to ensure the planning department is running properly which the council explains in the new report is exactly what it aims to do.A major review of planning has already been undertaken and amendments made to the so-called scheme of delegation which is a set of rules which determines whether a planning application will be decided by the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee or planning officers.A critical look has also been taken at staffing structures in tandem with the arearsquos chief planner, with council officials conceding that while there are issues with staff turnover, positions are filled as quickly as possible.In addition, the council has admitted there is a communication issue within the planning department with the change that needs to happen something that cannot be achieved overnight.Signicantly, the new council report warns that failure to deliver timely planning decisions is a ldquorisk within the corporate risk register, with the number of live planning applications increasing, not decreasing, with the figure standing at , at the end of May.The report says an internal audit of the planningrevealed that there are a number of key controls absent from the local authorityrsquos planning system, in particular, its performance against legislative targets, the completeness and validation of documentation supporting applications and enforcement actions.The audit also points to a lack of clarity in respect of key performance indicators within the planning department and the lack of non-compliance by the local authority with its own planning and enforcement procedures.The report says senior council management is considering ways forward to ensure compliance with policy and legislative targets, while maintaining the number of live cases to an acceptable level.Council officials say that over the coming months they intend to take steps to address the ious issues within the planning department to further enhance governance arrangements and are satisfied that these steps will address the need for improvements..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Plans for new

I also had the pleasure of meeting campaigners from across the UK as part of the Extinction Rebellion protests in Parliament.And I recently bumped into some students from Stanwell School who have been taking part in the climate strike movement and standing up for action on climate change and the climate emergency. I was glad to help get their and other constituentsrsquo voices heard on this in Parliament, because itrsquos not being debated enough - itrsquos getting lost behind other things.So whether itrsquos local action we can take on recycling and packaging, or global action on climate change and carbon emissions, we all need to do more to deal with an emergency thatrsquos going to affect us all for generations to come.I was out and about again in Penarth this weekend, along with a team of our fantastic Labour town and Vale councillors, talking to people about the forthcoming European elections. There was a lot of support for our clear Welsh Labour position backing a final say in a peoplersquos vote for the public on any Brexit deal.Following the mixed results in the local elections in England and Northern Ireland last week, there was much talk about Labour lsquobailing outrsquo the government. Let me be crystal clear on this ndash I will never lsquobail outrsquo the disastrous Tories on Brexit, and neither will the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs.We can resolve the situation, but not by any backroom stitch-up that would risk letting down both those who voted Leave and Remain. The only way forward out of this mess is to let the people have the final say on any deal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans.

It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme.

Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.

Peter Allen, partner at Deloitte, said: “For  years, the Technology Fast  awards have celebrated the success and growth of Ireland’s leading indigenous technology companies. “It is fantastic to be able to look back and see how some of the companies which appeared on the Fast  list in the early days have become global businesses and market leaders. “The likes of First Derivatives and Novosco, who were early stage tech companies when they first made the Fast , are now major employers and shining lights within the NI economy.” One of the few Northern Ireland companies to have topped the Fast , appearing in it  out of the  years since the ranking’s inception, is Newry-headquartered financial software company First Derivatives.

The paper, which examines the negative impact of a ‘no deal’ EU exit, warns the “Northern Ireland Civil Service’s assessment remains that a ‘no deal’ would have a profound and long-lasting impact on NI’s economy and society”. Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says.
