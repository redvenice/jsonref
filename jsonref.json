Tory Andrew Bridgen said: ‘He is in the pocket of JP Morgan. It is difficult to believe, when he has taken money off them, that he can be impartial when he’s reporting on matters that impact Wall Street.’The engagements could also cast doubt over his ability to be impartial when reporting on the US President. Mr Dimon riled Mr Trump last year after claiming at a conference he would beat the President in an election campaign because he is ‘smarter’.         Mr Sopel presided over two sessions at JP Morgan’s Global Markets Conference in Paris in 2017 – which included an interview with Mr Dimon. And in 2016, Mr Sopel appeared at JP Morgan’s Board Summit in New York. Pictured is Mr Sopel giving an off-the-record keynote address at the world\u0027s biggest tobacco company\u0027s Miami conference in AprilMr Trump responded on Twitter, saying Mr Dimon did not have ‘the “smarts”’ and branded him a ‘poor public speaker and nervous mess’.The BBC’s rules state ‘public speaking commitments should not compromise the impartiality’ of the broadcaster.They include a special provision for news and current affairs staff that they ‘should not chair conferences which are a promotional exercise for a commercial company that... is not impartial on a matter of public policy... or any other “controversial subject”.’But yesterday BBC sources said the JP Morgan events did not represent a conflict of interests. A spokesman said: ‘BBC staff are allowed to undertake certain outside engagements which they are required to clear with us, as long as they maintain objectivity and impartiality.’         A BBC spokesman said: ‘BBC staff are allowed to undertake certain outside engagements which they are required to clear with us, as long as they maintain objectivity and impartiality\u0027The JP Morgan events are not the only occasions on which Mr Sopel has accepted a controversial speaking engagement.Earlier this year, he spoke at an event by Philip Morris International, the world’s biggest tobacco company. The ‘open mic’ event was held at a five-star hotel in Miami, where he regaled an audience with his tales of covering the Trump presidency, it was claimed by the cigarette firm staff.Philip Morris told BuzzFeed that Mr Sopel gave ‘a keynote speech on covering the Trump White House’ but claimed it was ‘an internal meeting and an off-the-record discussion’.The arrangement sparked fury both inside and outside the BBC. One radio host said staff were angry that Mr Sopel was ‘foolish’ enough to accept such a controversial gig, amid fears the controversy could lead to a crack-down on the lucrative sideline hundreds of presenters enjoy.The BBC said it did not break rules, but former BBC News director Richard Sambrook said: ‘So is he now prevented from reporting on Big Tobacco? Should be.’This lucrative sideline has helped Mr Sopel fund an enviable lifestyle. He lives in Washington with his wife, but keeps a four-bedroom house in Hampstead worth more than £2million and a £1.2million flat in London’s Belsize Park.  Revealed: BBC presenter Huw Edwards \u0027earns £400,000 in speaking fees for 16 events in five years\u0027 Huw Edwards has raked in an estimated £400,000 in speaking fees in the last five years.The News at Ten anchor has fronted at least 16 events since the start of 2014, and commands fees of up to £25,000 a time.Some of the events are so dull that audiences could be baffled at why Mr Edwards would want to take the work, when he is already paid up to £495,000 a year from licence fee funds.He is also thought to have hosted numerous other events over that period – but the BBC does not make the engagements public or keep a central register so the extent of his moonlighting work is unknown.However it lays bare the scale of the lucrative sideline enjoyed by many BBC presenters. Yesterday, insiders at the corporation said that speaking work is such easy money, it can become addictive.         The News at Ten anchor has fronted at least 16 events since the start of 2014, and commands fees of up to £25,000 a timeOne broadcaster – a household name who has also earned huge sums from public speaking – said the amount of cash on offer for so little effort is too tempting to turn down. He described how writing an article for a national newspaper required a ‘huge’ amount of work, and leaves presenters exposed to criticism if they make a mistake.By contrast, he said that BBC hosts can ‘wheel out the same jokes they have told a thousand times before’ to a conference audience that is unlikely to criticise because they are dazzled by the speaker’s star power. ‘Obviously we are all as venal as anyone else so that is appealing,’ he said.Mr Edwards does not tend to accept money from firms that could be a conflict of interest. He also undertakes charity events for free. However, he has fronted a series of events for railway firms, regional law societies and insurance brokers. The Mail has previously revealed that he has hosted the Concrete Society Awards.This year alone, he has hosted the National Rail Awards in London. He has also fronted events for the Birmingham Law Society, the Women’s Institute and Thames Valley Business Magazine.He also hosted the British Insurance Brokers Association conference where Boris Johnson revealed his ambition to be Prime Minister. Mr Edwards announced the ‘scoop’ on his Instagram account, raising questions over the way public figures could exploit BBC journalists thirsty for speaking fees to make announcements.According to JLA, one of the speakers’ agencies which has him on their books, he charges between £10,000 and £25,000.Yesterday, Mr Edwards said that his speaking fees ‘vary enormously’ and that he does not accept fees for charity events. He added: ‘Like broadcasters from other organisations, I am always happy to host events celebrating the best of British.’The BBC said that none of the events broke its impartiality rules, and that BBC staff are allowed to undertake outside engagements as long as they maintain objectivity and impartiality. "},{"url":null,"title":"Marmite favourites like Pot Noodles Magnums face sold Unilever","story":"Share this article          Magnum are among a number of ice cream brands which could be axed Speaking to investors Mr Jope said the decision was due to the changing consumer market where products that don\u0027t promote sustainability or fit with the company\u0027s ethics are no longer enough.Regarding the potential cut of loved products Jope said: \u0027Principles are only principles when they cost you something.\u0027 Unilever\u0027s 28 flagship brands with a strong sustainable and meaningful image and therefore set to stay, include Dove, Hellmann\u0027s, Knorr and Persil.  Of the 400 brands under the company\u0027s umbrella, the 28 top earners accounted more than half of the £45billion turnover last year.Responding to consumers fears over single use plastics the company recently introduced refill pods for their Cif cleaning products and wrapper-less Solero lolly multi-packs. However experts question whether the dropping of iconic British brands may be a sign of the potential break-up for the Anglo-Dutch group following Mr Jope\u0027s comments, reports The Sun.

One of four vehicles created for the movie is due to be sold at auction later this year and Jaguar is recreating a selection of new £300,007 examples of the classic Bond favourite .The second model to feature in the upcoming 007 flick is the 1987 V8 Vantage, which was used in The Living Daylights with Timothy Dalton as the Secret Service agent.It is also understood that some the baddies in the next movie – which is currently being referred to as \u0027Bond 25\u0027 – will be seen driving the new Land Rover Defender , until now seen only in a camouflage disguise, due for unveiling at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September.

A keen reader, 60, UK.A: Julie Myerson, author, writes:Rather depends on how you define an enemy, doesn’t it? I’m tempted to list books with memorably well-drawn villains I wouldn’t want to come up against – Thackeray’s Becky Sharp in a heated debate, for instance nor would I want to meet Hilary Mantel’s Cromwell down a dark alley, though both Vanity Fair and Wolf Hall are beacons of complexity, insight and understanding. But I’m pretty sure that’s not what you’re after.Being more literal, Anger: Buddhist Wisdom for Cooling the Flames, by Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh, helped me see my own “enemies” for exactly what they were: ordinary, inept and helpless beings who, like me, could be assuaged with understanding and forgiveness.But if you’re looking for a novel that explores the queasy nature of actual and moral culpability, then look no further than Bernhard Schlink’s deeply disquieting classic The Reader, where what begins as an erotic crossword puzzle blossoms into something altogether more morally daring.Every bit as unsettling and still chillingly relevant is Athol Fugard’s 1982 theatrical masterpiece Master Harold… and the Boys, which delves into the corrosive and devastating effects of the enemy that is state-sponsored racism.However, the “enemies” most of us encounter on a daily basis – all constantly demanding that we love them – are members of our own family. Ann Patchett’s Commonwealth, Anne Tyler’s Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant and Elizabeth Strout’s The Burgess Boys are not only works of real stature, but all show siblings terrifyingly in need of forgiveness.Finally, isn’t the enemy we most fear the weakness, selfishness and loneliness within? Every one of the late, great Anita Brookner’s novels is a sublime meditation on human fallibility, each so astutely observed and sharply, meltingly sympathetic that we are forced to care, to understand and, yes, forgive – and in doing so, hopefully to come to terms with ourselves.Submit your question to book clinic below or email bookclinic@observer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cea0627a87ccc09a3f511d6725b74e70bc62425/0_0_2185_1311/master/2185.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fad10737a310c2a78086cd6c32561851","title":"the disinformation age a revolution in propaganda","story":"Troll farms, bots, dark ads, fake news ... from Putin’s Russia to Brexit Britain, new methods are being used to change politics and crush dissent. It’s time to fight backFather came out of the sea and was arrested on the beach: two men in suits standing over his clothes as he returned from his swim. They ordered him to get dressed quickly, pull his trousers over his wet trunks. On the drive the trunks were still wet, shrinking, turning cold, leaving a damp patch on his trousers and the back seat. He had to keep them on during the interrogation. There he was, trying to keep up a dignified facade, but all the time the dank trunks made him squirm. It struck him they had done it on purpose, these mid-ranking KGB men: masters of the small-time humiliation, the micro-mind game.It was 1976, in Odessa, Soviet Ukraine, and my father, Igor, a writer and poet, had been detained for “distributing copies of harmful literature to friends and acquaintances”: books censored for telling the truth about the Soviet Gulag (Solzhenitsyn) or for being written by exiles (Nabokov). He was threatened with seven years’ prison and five in exile. One after another, his friends were called in to confess whether he had ever spoken “anti-Soviet fabrications of a defamatory nature, such as that creative people cannot realise their potential in the USSR”.Forty years have passed since my father was pursued by the KGB for exercising a citizen’s simple right to read, to listen to what they chose and to say what they wanted. Today, the world he hoped for, in which censorship would end – as the Berlin Wall would fall – can seem much closer: we live in what academics call an era of “information abundance”. But the assumptions that underlay the struggles for rights and freedoms in the 20th century – between citizens armed with truth and information and regimes with their censors and secret police – have been turned upside down. We now have more information than ever before, but it hasn’t only brought the benefits we expected.More information was supposed to mean more freedom to stand up to the powerful, but has also given the powerful new ways to crush and silence dissent. More information was supposed to mean a more informed debate, but we seem less capable of deliberation than ever. More information was supposed to mean mutual understanding across borders, but it has also made possible new and more subtle forms of subversion. We live in a world in which the means of manipulation have gone forth and multiplied, a world of dark ads, psy-ops, hacks, bots, soft facts, deep fakes, fake news, Putin, trolls, and Trump.Forty years after my father’s interrogation, I find myself following the palest of imprints of his journey, though with none of his courage, or certainty, and none of the risk. I run a programme at a London university that researches the newer breeds of malign influence campaign across the world – and tries to find ways to combat them. But the language, ideals, tactics and stories that sustained the struggle for democracy in the 20th century are now used by the very forces they were meant to fight.Consider the Philippines. As my parents were enjoying the pleasures of the KGB in the 1970s, the Philippines were ruled by Colonel Ferdinand Marcos, a US-backed military dictator, who used the army to impose censorship and indulge in spectacular forms of torture, leaving victims’ skulls stuffed with their underpants by the side of the road, so as better to intimidate passersby. Marcos’s regime fell in 1986, when millions came out on the streets demanding an end to the censorship and torture.Today Manila greets you with sudden gusts of rotting fish and popcorn smells, wafts of sewage and cooking oil. Soon you start noticing the selfies. Everyone is at it: the sweaty guy in greasy flip-flops riding the metal canister of a bus the Chinese girls waiting for their cocktails in the malls. The Philippines has the highest use of selfies in the world, the world’s highest use of social media per capita, the highest use of text messages: 20th-century style censorship would be near-impossible to impose here. But the new president, Rodrigo Duterte, is rehabilitating Marcos’s reputation he has also found new ways of exerting oppression.Glenda Gloria remembers the Marcos years. In the 1980s she was a student journalist covering the regime’s torture of opposition figures. Her boyfriend had been arrested for running a small independent printing press and had had electrodes connected to his testicles.“The psychological warfare that Marcos mastered is very similar to what is happening now,” Gloria told me. “The difference is, Duterte doesn’t have to use the military to attack the media … How is it made possible? With technology.”Gloria is managing editor at Rappler, the Philippines’ first online news agency, designed not merely to report on current affairs, but to crowdfund for important causes, and gather vital information to help victims of floods and storms. Experienced journalists like Gloria and editor-in-chief Maria Ressa hired 20-year-olds who knew about social media. When you walk into Rappler’s orange, open plan office you notice how young and largely female the staff are, with a small band of older journalists overseeing them with a hint of matronly severity. In Manila they are known as “the Rapplers”.When Duterte decided to stand in the presidential election of 2015 he and Rappler seemed made for each other. A mayor from a provincial town with a reputation for being tough on drug offences, Duterte got relatively little TV time and so focused on social media. When Rappler hosted a Facebook presidential debate, he was the only candidate to turn up. It was an overwhelming success. His message – to vanquish drug crime – was catching on. Rappler reporters found themselves repeating his soundbites about the “war on drugs”. When Duterte later went on his killing spree, they would regret using the term “war”. It helped to normalise his actions: if this was a “war”, then casualties became more acceptable.His famous “earthy” humour, the trademark politically incorrect jokes that Duterte indulges in much like Trump, Putin, Boris Johnson, Jair Bolonsaro and other showmen “populists”, also took on a darker dimension. When jokes are used by the weak to poke fun at the powerful, they can bring authority figures back down to earth. But when such language is used consistently by men of real power to degrade those who are weaker, this humour grows into something menacing: it lays the linguistic path to humiliating victims in other ways as well, to a space where norms disappear.No one knows exactly how many have been killed in Duterte’s “war on drugs” since he became president. Human rights organisations estimate 12,000 – the government claims 4,200. At one point an average of 33 people were being killed a day, by police and vigilante gangs riding around on motorcycles. There is little due process to ascertain if the murdered were guilty. There are frequent reports of drugs being planted on the corpses that filled up the alleys of Manila’s slums.When Rappler began to report on Duterte’s killings the site’s carefully curated online community suddenly turned on it. At one point there were 90 messages an hour: claims that Rappler was making up the deaths, that it was in the pay of Duterte’s enemies, that it was all “fake news”. The messages were like an infestation of insects, swarming into email inboxes and descending like a scourge on to the site’s community pages. Rappler journalists were shouted at in the malls: “Hey, you – you’re fake news! Shame on you!” Hashtags calling for the arrest of Ressa began to trend. The government launched a court case against her. She walked around town with bail money on her. As soon as one case was thrown out another would appear. International human rights groups call them politically motivated.After several months of this onslaught, the Rapplers dedicated themselves to making sense of the attacks. First to catch their eye were the Korean pop stars. They kept appearing in their online community, commenting on how great Duterte was. How likely was it that Korean pop stars would be interested in Filipino politics? When they checked out the comments the pop stars were making they matched one another word for word: obviously fake accounts, most likely controlled from the same source.They ran a program that scoured the internet to see who else was using the same language. They found other accounts repeating the same phrases. These looked more realistic, claiming to be real Filipinos with real jobs. The Rapplers began researching each one inidually, calling their purported places of employment. No one had heard of them. Altogether they found 24 well disguised but fake accounts repeating the same messages at the same time and reaching an audience of 3 million. This was a coordinated attack. But proving who was behind it was near impossible.Gloria remembers how in Marcos’s time you could see the enemy. There was a sort of predictability: they could kill you, or you could skip town, contact a lawyer, write to a human rights group, take up arms. You knew who the agents were, who was coming for you, who your enemy was. But now? You couldn’t tell who you were up against. They were anonymous, everywhere and nowhere. How could you fight an online mob? You couldn’t even tell how many of them were real. And of course this allowed the government to claim they had nothing to do with these campaigns. Wasn’t it just a question of concerned citizens exercising their right to free speech?It is a tactic repeated across the world. Campaigns can be incited by pro-government online rabble rousers as in Turkey, or run through “troll farms” owned by tycoons loyal to the Kremlin in Russia (when one such Russian operation had its “news” pages taken down by Facebook, it sued the company for abuse of its freedom of expression). Nor are democracies immune. As a report by the thinktank the Institute for the Future elucidates, when President Trump identifies critics on Twitter, a cascade of abuse then descends on them. This habit was already apparent in the 2016 presidential campaign, but has now reached new intensity in the Trump supporters’ demands to “send home” opposition congresswomen of colour.What we are seeing is, in the words of Columbia law professor Tim Wu, a situation where “speech itself is seen as a censorial weapon”. This questions the old idea that the answer to “fallacious speech” is “more speech” – that we live in a “marketplace of ideas” where the best “information products” will win out. What if that market can be rigged?Alberto Escorcia is a social media wizard and has helped coordinate some of the largest anti-corruption protests in Mexico over the last half decade. He and his friends started with pranks to provoke the police: after students were beaten by police officers, they went on silent marches and staged lie-ins, where they stretched out supine on the street, blocking the road. In time, he realised that if he knew in advance which subjects brought people together, and which words strengthened the interconnections between people, he would be able to “summon up” and strengthen protests. He had long believed that, at its best, the internet can connect society with its deepest needs for social change. He was inspired by how Google managed to predict and nip in the bud a flu epidemic when the company saw how many people were looking up flu symptoms at the same time in one place. Something similar, Alberto argued, could be done with political issues. You can tell what people really care about from their searches and online conversations.But by the time I met Escorcia in Mexico City he looked too tired even to be frightened any more. Someone had been ringing his doorbell then running away again so he couldn’t sleep at night, shining acid-green lasers into his bedroom, pinging online death threats with his name spelt out in bullets – thousands every day so that his phone vibrated with alerts 247, turning it into an instrument of psychological torture. One takes such threats seriously in Mexico. During my visit I was told the story of a social media activist who had run an anonymous Twitter account cataloguing crimes committed by narcos. When the narcos found out who she was they first shot her and then posted her blasted off face on her own Twitter feed: “TODAY MY LIFE HAS COME TO AN END. DON’T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AS I DID … I FOUND DEATH IN EXCHANGE FOR NOTHING.”It wasn’t just the personal threats that Escorcia was worried about – he feared troll farms were doing something more fundamentally damaging. The government was intervening in the relationship between people and their own desire for social change, spamming the internet with messages from fake accounts impersonating support for the government, using part-automated, part-human “cyborg” accounts to distract protesters from organising, sending in social media sock-puppets who pretend to support protesters, and then encourage violence to discredit movements. For 70 years, during the 20th century, Mexico had been a one-party state in which “truth” had been dictated top down. Today bots, trolls and cyborgs could create the simulation of a climate of opinion, which was more insidious, more all-enveloping than the old broadcast media – as it wormed its way into the feeds on your phone and you couldn’t tell whether it was coming from a friend or propagandist. This simulation, Escorcia worried, would then become reinforced as people modified their behaviour to fall in line with what they thought was reality. “Dark days are coming, Peter,” Alberto told me, “a new generation of bots and trolls are pushing us further and further into a world of pure simulation.”In their analysis of the role of bots, researchers at the University of Oxford called this process “manufacturing consensus”. Similar techniques are being used across the world. Researchers at Harvard have shown how the Chinese government posts 448m social media comments a year, the aim of which is not to engage but to distract, as critical topics are replaced with positive ones.It’s not just the belief that “more information” leads to better democracy that has been undermined by the digital era. Something more insidious is going on, in relation to our very idea about what a free person is.Back in 1977, as my father was being interrogated by the KGB, the conversation would often turn to literary matters. The KGB agents would chide him for his love of modernist authors who, instead of writing in the impersonal, officious language of Soviet socialist realism captured their inidual impressions of life. “Is there any joy greater than writing in the first person?” my father had written, in a novella published that year. “I feel any good book which acknowledges the human being, iniduality, uniqueness is also anti-Soviet because the state dictatorship is directed against the human being as an inidual.”Today social media puts absolutely no constraints on our limits of self-expression, each of us can be a modernist author on our Facebook feed. But this self-expression is then transmuted into data: the language we use, our likes and shares, are all passed to data brokers and then on to advertisers and spin doctors who target us with specially tailored campaigns we might not even be aware of. The more we express ourselves, the less power we have.This has produced a propaganda model that is very different from the 20th century. Instead of stuffing an ideology down people’s throats via TV and radio, a spin doctor has to tailor different messages to different social media groups. A country of 20 million, the chatty digital director of Vote Leave, Thomas Borwick, told me, needs 70 to 80 types of targeted message. Borwick’s job is to connect inidual causes to his campaign, even if that connection might feel somewhat tenuous at first.In the case of the vote to leave the EU, Borwick, who seems to approach such challenges like a Rubik’s Cube, claimed that the most successful message in getting people out to vote had been about animal rights. Vote Leave argued that the EU was cruel to animals because, for example, it supported farmers in Spain who raise bulls for bullfighting. And within the “animal rights” segment Borwick could focus even tighter, sending graphic ads featuring mutilated animals to one type of voter and more gentle ads with pictures of cuddly sheep to others.I’d heard of similarly varied messaging used by spin doctors across the world. The challenge with this sort of micro-targeting is that it requires some big, empty identity to unite all these different groups, something so broad these voters can project themselves on to it – a category such as “the people” or “the many”. The “populism” that is thus created is not a sign of “the people” coming together in a great groundswell of unity, but is actually a consequence of the people being more fractured than ever, of their barely existing as one nation. When people have less in common than before, you have to create a new version of “the people” for every election. As too many concrete policies and coherent ideologies would risk alienating parts, these pop-up people need to be united around a leader’s personality and a vague feeling, such as “take back control” or “optimism”. Facts are a hindrance rather than a help: you are not trying to win a rational debate with floating voters you want to say whatever gets more attention in fragmented social media groups, where the more outrageous you are the more likes you’ll get. Indeed there is something of a rush in throwing a middle finger up to facts, farting at glum reality. Trump and Johnson are both products of this environment.But if one sells a campaign in so many different ways to different people, then how does one know what it is meant to represent? Was Brexit about animal rights? Immigration? What did the “people’s will” mean? In the words of the interim report of the UK parliamentary committee on fake news, the new information games “reduce the common ground on which reasoned debate, based on objective facts, can take place … the very fabric of our democracy is threatened.”Earlier this year I sat at the back of a room in the Commons as members of the committee where I helped as one of many specialist advisers wrote up its final report. Behind the MPs was a painting that showed a scene from the House of Commons in the 18th century, depicting men in wigs making some sort of elegant argument, while the other side listened attentively. It was unlikely to have been a realistic scene – the Commons has always been a rowdy place full of cads and liars – but it did, at least, envision an ideal, what I imagined the committee meant by “reasoned debate” and “fabric of democracy”. Does it have a chance in an age of infinite digital disinformation?One reaction from governments, including democratic ones such as Germany, France and maybe soon the UK, has been to try to impose censorship on “disinformation”. It’s an understandable reaction – but the wrong one. It imposes a political logic where censorship is normalised again, and so reverses the triumphs of 1989: no wonder Putin loves to invoke a German law on “fake news” to impose new censorship at home. Even more important, it misunderstands how the internet, as opposed to broadcasting, works.Back in Soviet Ukraine information was scarce. Every morning, father rose at dawn, gently turned the Spidola radio to “ON”, pushed the dial to shortwave, wiggled and waved the antenna to dispel the fog of jamming from Soviet censors, and climbed on chairs and tables to get the best reception, steering the dial in an acoustic slalom between transmissions of East German pop and Soviet military bands. He pressed his ear tight to the speaker and, through the hiss and crackle, heard the words: “This is the BBC in London” “This is Radio Liberty in Washington.” He was listening for news about current affairs, banned books, the arrest of other dissidents. Smuggling information about political arrests to the western radios was like being granted a second life it meant your case would be known, you could be defended. Eventually, after many adventures, he would end up working at the BBC Russian service himself, broadcasting censored art and information into the USSR.Today there is less censorship of content in many places. But there is a more subtle form of censorship about how the information environment around us is shaped. Instead of closing down rights to receive and impart information, we should demand more. For starters, we should have the right to know whether an account online is a bot or someone genuine, whether content is organic or amplified by trolls, who is behind a “news” site. Anonymity is a necessity for many activists, as I’d learned in Mexico, but we should still understand if an account is using a false identity. We need to know why computer programs show us one piece of content and not another why any ad, article, message or image is being targeted specifically at me and not you which of our own data has been used to try to influence us and why. Perhaps then we would become less like creatures acted on by mysterious powers we cannot see, made to fear and tremble for reasons we cannot fathom, and instead would be able to engage with the information forces around us as equals. This, in turn, would become the difference between democracy and dictatorship today, for these are just the sort of digital rights the Putins, Dutertes and Trumps need to deny people to secure their power.Information was the front line in the battle of democracy and dictatorship in the 20th century, the space where victory was articulated and supposedly secured. Since then it has become the arena where democracy is undermined. But it can also be the place where big words such as “rights” and “freedoms”, words that have been appropriated by a new generation of manipulators and oppressive regimes, are given meaning again.• This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality by Peter Pomerantsev is published by Faber (£14.99).

One point he made was that the politan police policy that “complainants will be believed has had an influence on this whole case. With another approach, Mr Beech’s allegations would have been dismissed.”There is no harder task in advocacy than mitigating after a jury has convicted your client of every count on the indictment, and I am reluctant to criticise Mr Thompson, but the argument that the police should not have been so stupid as to take Beech seriously was probably best left to others.Nevertheless, it was entirely correct. Beech would never have achieved such notoriety and caused such damage had many others, who should have known better, not believed him, or at least pretended to do so.The Met’s then spokesman, Det Supt Kenny McDonald, supposedly one of the country’s top detectives, announced soon after meeting Beech that his account was “credible and true”. Whether he actually thought that or whether he was merely repeating what was then the official line that “victims must be believed” is unclear. The effect, however, was to confer plausibility upon a little-noticed internet news site called Exaro News, Beech’s handlers and publicists.Labour’s Tom Watson had already met and been convinced by Beech, while other prominent journalists and politicians enthusiastically joined in the ensuing moral panic, ranging from LBC’s James O’Brien to RT’s George Galloway, all of whom, for various reasons, were determined to encourage the belief that the British establishment had been penetrated by a secret conspiracy of paedophiles and murderers.That is not to say that the Met should automatically have disbelieved Beech. That would have been equally wrong. Faced with his appalling allegations, its job was to investigate them, something that it signally failed to do. It was left to a combination of a BBC Panorama team and Northumbria police to uncover the evidence that Beech was a cunning liar.There are wider, and rather uncomfortable, lessons for the criminal justice system as a whole. Criminal trials depend on the premise that magistrates and jurors can safely spot liars. Yet it is often impossible to tell whether someone is telling the truth simply by listening to them. Those, such as top detectives and investigative journalists, who might seem likely to be well practised in spotting liars can be taken in just as easily as anyone else.Beech’s police interviews show him behaving for all the world as you might expect a victim of long-concealed sexual abuse to behave: speaking softly, mumbling, dabbing his eyes as he fights back the tears. He was, at first blush, an entirely plausible witness.Nor, by the time he came to speak to the Met, was there any obvious motive for him to lie. Perhaps he hoped to gain more money than the £22,000 he had already claimed for being a victim of a “group” that included Jimmy Savile, but, if so, he never made any monetary claim based upon his abuse by politicians. It seems likely that he obtained gratification from the attention that came with being seen as a victim, just as much as that which came from driving around in a fraudulently obtained Ford Mustang.Fortunately, Beech’s dishonesty was proved beyond any doubt, but it was not an easy process. It required, among other things, the forensic examination of his computers, the uncovering of a hidden email account, the tracing of witnesses from decades earlier, the study of old school records and even a medical examination to disprove his assertions that he had had bones broken by his childhood abusers.Every day, jurors are asked to assess the credibility of witnesses talking about events from decades earlier. Such cases are hardly ever investigated with the thoroughness with which Northumbria police investigated Beech and the danger of juries coming to erroneous conclusions on the basis of inadequate investigation is real.Jurors these days are rightly warned not to make assumptions about how victims of sexual crime should behave. Long delays in reporting, inconsistency over details and contradictory accounts do not, for example, necessarily mean that a witness is lying. But, as the Beech case demonstrates, there are huge dangers in going too far in the other direction. Liars do exist, people sometimes lie about sexual crime, they are sometimes very convincing and the damage they do is incalculable.• Matthew Scott is a criminal barrister at Pump Court Chambers "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5896a1502ba3ac14a125bdfca3da635eb247fe7e/64_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22637946ac305ae7ff2983d71d6dbf8e","title":"holidaying alone glorious grace dent","story":"I’ve long suspected that the term ‘family holiday’ is an oxymoron, and now I feel more sureAt 6am in Portugal, at the pristine breakfast buffet, unbesmirched by human hand as I’m its first customer, I fill a plate with sugary pastries. Yes, they’ll bloat me in my bikini, but who cares? I’m holidaying alone. Flying solo. A “single Pringle”, one holidaymaker joked, as I chuckled along at our shared bit of fun, inwardly imagining hammering him to death with a flip-flop.But the fact is, “single occupancy” has turned out to be so much fun, I wonder if its life-enhancing loveliness has been hushed up for decades? By travel agents and multidenominational faith leaders, and other forces dedicated to preserving the status quo. I’ve long suspected that the term “family holiday” is an oxymoron, and now I feel more sure.I pen this missive from the sun-battered Algarve, where I’ve spent seven days in glorious isolation and, for long stretches, in complete silence. I’ve tottered about from dawn to dusk like a slighty less pickled Princess Margaret, quite literally pleasing myself. This was not meant to happen when I booked a last-minute break, sensing that yet again, as a child-free woman, I was about to let summer ride past without downtime, covering the gaps of other people’s summer breaks, letting July quickly become September. I wasn’t meant to prefer it. I wasn’t meant to think: “Next time: two weeks.” This break has made me realise just how much a normal #squad holiday is about compromise – exactly like everyday life. We bite our lips and bury our needs. We’re on holiday, so let’s not bicker. No, I don’t mind washing up. No, I won’t upgrade my flight if you can’t. Oh you like bullfighting, how charming! On holiday alone, I have not been available for this bullshit.As a naturally very early riser, I’ve been first in the hotel gym, before grabbing the best-positioned pool lounger. No dead wood has held me back. Apologies to all friends and family who have vacationed with me in the past, but we all know that getting five grownups plus kids to a beach within 120 minutes is like a terrible Crystal Maze puzzle. During the day, I’ve cut a solo figure on the tourist trail, examining eerie skull-encrusted crypts in Faro – which I know would have been too brutal for some eyes. I’ve cracked into a goldfish bowl-sized G\u0026ampT on the cusp of midday and taken a long, indulgent nap by mid-afternoon. At night I dine earlier than a pensioner, then pass out asleep as the resort goes out partying.Repeat seven times, blissfully, swapping out “visit to the bone crypt” for “round trip of the resort on the silly Noddy Train with the parpy horn”. It was the sort of train that I always want to go on when I’m on holiday with my partner or in a group, but everyone always says is ridiculous. The thing is, I am ridiculous. I love a stupid parpy tourist train. It reminds me of the train at Pontins when I was a little girl, trundling along, holding hands with my dad. I like waving back at strangers when they wave at me. “Hello! Look at me! I’m on a train!” I say, flapping my hand. It’s pure joy.This is my very first holiday alone and it pains me that I’ve waited so long. And although I wasn’t stopped by fear, because I’ve flown all over the world for work purposes for decades, I was certainly held back by shame. “Are you meeting friends there?” asked the British Airways hostess, as she served me champagne (I upgraded: bite me), which felt a little like pity but could also have been surveillance on whether I was trafficking narcotics into the east Algarve in my ridiculous boil-washed Helena Bonham Carter crow’s nest hair. I’ve watched at least 100 episodes of UK Border Force on Channel Pick, I know what goes on.“Yes, they’re all out there already,” I lied, wondering if I should embellish further. Add in some children? No, no more lying, I told myself. If anyone else bothers to inquire, I shall answer their nosiness with unflinching honesty. It happened a few days later at dinner, when I found myself chatting to a group in a restaurant. My situation had intrigued them. Was I a widow? A orcee? An air hostess? Just chronically antisocial? No, I said, I am none of these things, I am just a normal human being and very tired. My partner is working right through the summer and my friends presently need to holiday in places with ball pits and nightly Macarena Kids’ Club performances.And, well, my father is dying. Slowly, very slowly, of Alzheimer’s, which has left me in a perpetual decade-long state of what I realise now is ambiguous grief, a grief which never truly has closure, because although he is no longer here, he is here. Vivid and breathing. This makes it easy (and I think it’s like this for a lot of people, in different hard situations) to believe that the trick is to keep going. To keep working. To keep being useful. To never, ever take a holiday. Because who could holiday when all this is happening? And when I get there on this holiday, a woman alone, what will strangers think?The answer to this, after a long pause, was a stunned but empathetic nod, and then more silence. But seeing as I love silence, and I was having the greatest holiday of my entire life, this worked out incredibly well."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18903fc11feb7f2f94fcaa1a82bd9d56c4d83758/0_382_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46c6b8811d334153fcbfa107d2a1f049","title":"male genitalia week in patriarchy women","story":"16 complaints filed by a Canadian trans woman make a mockery of the hate crimes committed against trans people every daySign up for the Week in Patriarchy, a newsletter​ on feminism and sexism sent every Saturday.Should a woman be forced to wax male genitalia?The answer to that is clearly “no”, right? If a female beautician has only been trained to wax female genitalia and only wants to offer these services to women then that should be her prerogative. But, hang on a minute, what if the person who wants their intimate areas to be waxed is a woman with male genitalia? What happens then? A court in Canada has been trying to figure that out. British Columbia’s Human Rights Tribunal has been holding hearings on the issue after Jessica Yaniv, a transgender woman, filed 16 complaints against female estheticians, arguing that she was denied service because of her gender identity.“This is not about waxing,” Yaniv wrote on Twitter last week.While the Yaniv case has been going on for a while now, you may not have heard much about it, as it has largely been covered by the rightwing press. The sort of outlets that normally joke about consent and women’s rights are now outraged that women are being forced to handle male genitalia against their will. The sort of writers that are normally whipping up hate against immigrants are now outraged and concerned that at least one of the beautificians that Yaniv has filed complaints against is a poor migrant. In short there has been a hell of a lot of bad faith and transphobia involved in the reporting around the case. A number of the world’s worst people have used the story as an example of “political correctness gone mad” and as a way to stoke hatred against trans people.But does that mean that Yaniv is a brave crusader for human rights who should be supported? Absolutely not. Yaniv seems to be a troll, not an activist. She has also made a number of racist comments about immigrants, saying they aren’t the “cleanest of people” and allegedly said very disturbing things about underage girls in the past. Yaniv also seems to have tried to book the waxing services with fake Facebook profiles – the Spectator reports that in at least one case, she used the profile of a pregnant woman.The long and short of this story is that Yaniv does not seem to be acting in good faith and a lot of women who were running small businesses out of their homes are now being dragged into court and branded as bigots as a result. If those women had refused to wax Yaniv’s legs because they had a problem with her being trans then she would have been absolutely right to take action. However, surely things are more nuanced when it comes to handling genitalia? Surely a woman shouldn’t be forced to wax testicles if that makes them feel uncomfortable? Yaniv argues that if you are a woman who is uncomfortable working with a penis then you are automatically a “transphobic bigot... committing a hate crime.” Not only is that untrue it makes a mockery of the hate crimes that are committed against trans people every day.A growing number of South Korean women are rejecting marriage and motherhood – a trend that is alarming the government, which is worried about the country’s very low birth rate. In response the government is offering incentives to get married, which many women see as tone-deaf and offensive. One South Korean YouTuber told Bloomberg that government policies “to force a woman into marriage and childbearing represent a deeply ingrained perception of a woman in our society as an object, not an inidual”.Clean up your act (and your house), straight men! A new study by University College London analyzed data from more than 8,500 heterosexual couples in Britain and found “gender norms remain strong” when it comes to the ision of household chores. This will come as a surprise to nobody as there are already about a gazillion studies saying the exact same thing.Earlier this year two women called Melania and Chris were brutally attacked on a night bus in London after a group of teenage boys allegedly demanded the couple, who were on a date, kiss. Four teenage boys have now been charged with an aggravated hate crime. If you haven’t already please do have a read of the powerful op-ed Chris wrote for the  last month. “The press coverage, and timely law enforcement response, was not coincidental to our complexions,” she wrote. “Learn the names and stories of Muhlaysia Booker, Dana Martin, Chanel Scurlock.

It was “a slow, suburban kind of town… a very chill place to grow up,” says Alia Shawkat. “By the time we were in high school, we would drive around in cars and park them and smoke weed, look at the mountains and be like: ‘One day we’re going to get out of here.’”Shawkat did get out of there: in 2003, aged 14, she joined the cast of sitcom Arrested Development, which ran for three seasons to critical acclaim but poor ratings, only to become a cult show after it was cancelled in 2006. Shawkat has since starred in films ning roller-derby drama Whip It to punks versus neo-Nazis horror Green Room she is now the lead in the smart, caustic comedy series Search Party.Perhaps it is has to do with the characters she plays – often carefree, slightly lost, with a deadpan sense of humour – but Shawkat has the aura of someone you could imagine being friends with. Speaking on the phone from Los Angeles, she is open and relaxed, veering between serious and amiably goofy. When she’s telling stories, she’ll sometimes impersonate the people speaking, in a subtle way that enhances the anecdote rather than showing off her thespian talents. She seems like the sort of person you’d have a really, really good conversation with around 3am on a night out.Which is perhaps why she is perfectly cast in Animals, the new film directed by Sophie Hyde and based on Emma Jane Unsworth’s book of the same name, described by Caitlin Moran as “Withnail with girls”. Shawkat plays Tyler, the Withnail of the relationship: the larger-than-life yet complex and vulnerable foil to the marginally more restrained Laura, played by Holliday Grainger. Shawkat was leaving a boozy brunch with friends when she remembered she had a Skype call with Hyde from Australia. “I’d forgotten I had a work meeting – but it kind of worked: a couple of shots and a champagne in, and we got along really well.”When shooting started in Dublin, Shawkat and Grainger had a few days to create a bond that could pass for being best friends. Hyde set tasks for them: go to some bars, have a few drinks, and ask each other questions from a list Hyde provided. Who was their own Tyler or Laura when they were younger? How did their first relationship affect their friendships? When were they partying too hard, to the point where they had to question themselves?On screen, they portray a friendship that’s both riotously fun and fraught with the kinds of setback common in any long-term relationship: priorities change, directions start to erge. “As women we have these relationships in our lives, even more intense than a romance in some ways. And that’s when it gets hard: when one doesn’t feel like they’re moving, and the other one does, someone’s going to get hurt.”Shawkat’s interpretation of Tyler’s character, she says, was based on “a certain kind of girl I used to hang out with who was just so free-spirited and wild that, when you’re at the party, they seem like the biggest hero. But you realise: ‘Oh, she is sacrificing a lot in order to be that person every night.’” Shawkat turned 30 earlier this year, and this has brought with it a newfound introspection. “For me it’s the first year I dropped a certain kind of excess emotion. Not that I feel disconnected, but it was just: ‘Oh, I don’t really need to overthink this as much,’ or: ‘I don’t need to define myself based off of this feeling.’”From an early age, Shawkat started going back and forth to Los Angeles to act in film and TV. “I felt like I was living two lives,” she recalls. Film runs in her family: her maternal grandfather was actor Paul Burke (Valley of the Dolls, The Thomas Crown Affair) her father is a film producer. Back in Palm Springs, there wasn’t much to do for teenagers: restaurants closed early every now and then someone’s rich grandparents were out of town so there would be a house party. In the summer, when the heat became overwhelming – temperatures regularly reach 49C (120F) – it turned into a ghost town. “People were partying really hard at a young age because they were bored,” she says. “I smoked pot, not much else. But looking back, people were doing heavy drugs, just in high school.”Her upbringing also provided her with material for a TV show she is currently writing. Apart from working in film, Shawkat’s parents run a strip club: ShowGirls Gentlemen’s Club in the neighbouring Cathedral City. Although Shawkat was not allowed in until she was 21, it was a formative experience. “It definitely affected my perspective. It was never a secret, there was no shame around it.” Her parents were “very normal, slightly conservative”: her dad taught the football team, her mum brought snacks to school. “It wasn’t like they were seedy club owners: it was a business.”The show will explore the ways these years shaped Shawkat’s attitudes to gender and relationships: how it made her popular with boys at school whether it affected “some form of performative nature I have in sex or with men” her figuring out her bisexuality. It also made her interrogate her dynamic with her father. “I’m close with him, but I always have this kind of anger towards him: ‘But you own a strip club, you’ll never fully understand me.’” She doesn’t judge strip clubs, she adds: she loves the dances, she respects it as a profession. “But it’s about the power the male gaze has, and how strip clubs have been around for ever and always will be. The male gaze drives not only society’s view of women, but how women view themselves.”Shawkat is “still grappling” with the ways that, as someone in the public eye, she is turned to for political comment. She is increasingly being asked to speak on panels, which she is pleased to do, though part of her thinks: “But I’m just a clown, I’m just an artist.” Art and politics have always reflected each other, she says, but recently the lines have become more blurred. “Katharine Hepburn wasn’t telling people to vote. But now that is important: especially younger kids, they’re looking up to people like that. So I think there is more of a responsibility.”This development comes with its own set of problems, she says: “Donald Trump became president because of some version of celebrity culture.” Almost a decade ago, when he was on TV a lot, Shawkat drew a series of Ralph Steadman-inspired sketches of him. “I got fascinated with the way his face looked: his skin, that hair – it felt very fake. Little did I know he’d actually become a political cartoon.” To find hope these days, she turns to travelling (“to have a perspective on things”) and organising large gatherings (“When anything’s happening that feels so destructive to a whole community, you have to get closer”). Shawkat’s Twitter page reveals some of her concerns: immigration, Palestine, abortion, rape. But the primary way she is responding to the political crisis is through her art.This is also a time when women are racing to tell their own stories. After #MeToo, says Shawkat, the most noticeable change has been that more women are being hired. “Friends of mine are making stuff they’ve always wanted to. Who knows how long it’ll last, but it’s definitely a window of time where people are like: ‘Oh, it’s cool to have a female of colour directing.’ I mean, it always has been, but sure, whatever you say – give us the money.”Shawkat’s Iraqi, Irish, Italian and Norwegian heritage was something she attempted to downplay as a kid. In school, she was aware of a feeling of otherness (“Me and the one Korean kid in my class became friends, because we were kind of different from everybody else”), and when she started acting she was told she was “too ethnic” for parts. But, now, there is an appetite for different stories. “It’s nice to be seen for who you are.”In 2018 Shawkat wrote her first feature, Duck Butter – a love story in which she stars opposite Laia Costa – and directing is something she sees further down the line. A third season of Search Party is out next year, but Arrested Development is “finally getting put to rest”. She thinks fondly of those years: “It was such a big part of my life, from 14 to 28. It’s like family: I love it, but I’m happy we’re moving on.”Looking back to her teenage self, gazing at the palm trees and distant mountains, does she think she’d be pleased with the way her 30-year-old self has turned out? “She’d like all the new clothes, I guess. I think she’d be happy I was doing the art I wanted to. That’s something I always wondered: ‘Will I have enough confidence to do what I want?’ I think she would be happy. I like to think so.”Animals is in cinemas from Friday"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7754eda9f9cf5dda96201ca1417d2b5a03b6b6fa/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62f8e5d227361631f62998f7c9f61cbe","title":"frances barber interview musik pet shop boys edinburgh","story":"The actor on starring in a new Pet Shop Boys musical, her addiction to Twitter and Strictly, and the impossibility of avoiding Brexit chatFrances Barber, 62, was born in Wolverhampton and studied drama at Bangor and Cardiff universities.

Her film roles include Prick Up Your Ears, Sammy and Rosie Get Laid and Film Stars Don’t Die in Liverpool. TV credits include Silk, Doctor Who and Mapp and Lucia. She stars in the new Pet Shop Boys musical, MUSIK, which premieres at Edinburgh festival fringe.How are rehearsals going for the Pet Shop Boys musical?I’ve just got back from my first full run-through, doing the whole play in front of Pet Shop Boys. Not in the least bit frightening! Chris Lowe took his sunglasses off, though, which is high praise indeed.How many songs do you perform?Six, four of which are brand new, ning her music through the decades. It starts off a bit Lotte Lenya, then she leaves Berlin for New York and there’s a song about Andy Warhol’s Factory, a Vietnam protest song, a disco anthem, a torch song, and we end with an uplifting, lighters-in-the-air number. Or phones-in-the-air, as it is nowadays. Jonathan’s script is hilarious. Amid all this doom and gloom, it’s 50 minutes of absolute joy.Were you a Pet Shop Boys fan before you worked with them?Completely. Their music is fantastic and catchy, so I was keen to be involved in Closer to Heaven and we’ve been friends ever since. I went into their studio to record the songs and after we’ve opened, they’re going to put them on Spotify. They’ve worked with Dusty Springfield, Liza Minnelli, Chrissie Hynde, all these iconic songstresses. Now it’s me with my rubbishy old voice. They didn’t have a music stand in their studio, so the lyrics were taped to a mug. That’s how professional I am!You sang on their 2006 live album, Concrete. How was that?I’ve never been more terrified. The secret guests were Robbie Williams, Rufus Wainwright and me. I turned up on my bike and the security staff said: “Where are your people?” I said: “I haven’t got any people!” Robbie had come with a whole posse, Rufus had come with an entourage of 25 and I was just me on a bike.Have you performed at the Fringe before?Only twice. Way back in 1980 with Hull Truck, which was my very first job, then in 2004 when I did One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest with Christian Slater. We had a traumatic time because poor Christian caught chicken pox, so we had to cancel some shows. When we finally opened, there was a scene where he stripped to the waist and he still had scabs all over him. It was bizarre.You’re politically outspoken on Twitter. Do you get a lot of flak for that?It was OK until Brexit sent everyone mad. I’ve been through the whole gamut of emotions about it myself. My frustration is that we haven’t had an effective opposition. I was part of the Better Together campaign, I went on marches and leafleted. Obviously antisemitism is a huge issue too. Every day I tell myself, “I’m not going to look at Twitter today”, but I’m addicted. It used to make me howl before it became a vile cesspit. Some of the wittiest people I’ve ever come across are on Twitter. I’m still there for the jokes.Is acting becoming too dominated by people from privileged backgrounds?You could get student grants in my day without those I’d never have been able to become an actor. We need to hear working-class voices and see erse characters. I get letters all the time from drama students asking for help and I do as much as I can. It’s beholden on us because otherwise, how will new talent come through?How was your involvement with Doctor Who as the villainous Madame Kovarian?Absolutely loved it. I was lucky enough to work with Matt Smith, who was the perfect Doctor. He’s got one of those extraordinary faces that can either be 20 or 200. I’ve still got Madame Kovarian’s eyepatch. They gave it to me as a memento.Ever fancied moving to Hollywood?I did work out there and had a lovely time for two years but I missed home too much. Besides, LA’s a bit boring. Everybody’s on prescription drugs but they frown upon anyone who has a glass of wine.You’re a big Strictly Come Dancing fan. Would you ever compete on it?I originally started watching Strictly because I know Craig Revel Horwood, but it’s so joyful and addictive, I’m still watching 15 years later.

Welcome to Ottawa – Canada’s bustling capitalMondayOttawa’s most notable building is its majestic gothic parliament and it’s one of the landmarks you can take in when exploring the city on foot. Try Ottawa Walking Tours, Ottawa Free Tours, or your own river- and canal-side wanderings on paths around Parliament Hill. For bygone tales of brawling French and Irish gangs, don’t miss the city history on show at the old stone Bytown Museum. Finish the day at ByWard Market, the hub of the city’s most happening central district and one of Canada’s oldest and biggest public markets. Shop the unique stores along the market streets and cobblestone courtyards. You can sip on a locally brewed craft beer and try a gourmet hotdog at Tavern on the Hill, with a spectacular view of Parliament Hill.TuesdayIf the weather’s fair then don’t wait to head to the Gatineau Hills. The Gatineau Park Visitor Centre will help you choose the right hiking trail and is located in the village of Chelsea, where the Nordik Spa-Nature vies with Le Pub Chelsea as the best place to unravel after a day in the hills. Which is better: a view of Ottawa’s twinkling city lights from a hot tub, or a craft brew in a gregarious country tavern? Best do both to check.With both central Ottawa and its most attractive park under your belt, it’s time to explore everything in between. This is best done by bike and RentABike has a good selection of tours and downloadable routes. Key options follow the city’s waterways: the Rideau canal loop connects attractive neighbourhoods such as Little Italy and The Glebe with waterfalls the longer Ottawa River paths provide grand city views.Before you head out, limber up at the free drop-in Parliament Hill yoga session (summer Wednesdays at noon). You’ll be among hundreds, so no need to worry about smooth moves – though PM Justin Trudeau has been known to pop by and greet participants. Try trendy Hintonburg for a delicious meal at Supply and Demand or Bar Laurel.At least one day in Ottawa should be devoted to its terrific national museums – they’re all free on Thursdays 5-8pm, though three hours is rarely enough. With Canada’s National Museums Passport, you can choose admission to any three museums for just $35.Guarded by a giant Louise Bourgeois spider sculpture, the National Gallery of Canada is memorable for its indigenous art. If you like this, then visit the ethnographic collections of the wide-ranging Canadian Museum of History, whose on-site Children’s Museum is in a class of its own for educational interactive play.There’s more education and play, along with painstakingly made dioramas of wildlife habitats, at the Canadian Museum of Nature. For a change of pace, try the Canadian War Museum, whose coverage of Canadian conflicts and military hardware collection is moving and engaging. There’s also the chance to continue your museum visit after hours – on specific Fridays the Canadian Museum of Nature turns the museum into an adult zone, with music and mingling.You could grab a nightcap at Copper Spirits \u0026amp Sights, the rooftop patio of the Andaz Ottawa Byward Market hotel, and watch the sunset.Enjoy Ottawa’s out-of-town attractions before the weekend crowds arrive. Parc Omega is a Canadian safari park with deer, elk, caribou, bison, bears and wolves – you can even feed many of them. There’s more action to be found at the Great Canadian Bungee, where North America’s highest jump (61 metres) and a giant zip-line are located beside a pleasant little beach and picnic spot (for non-thrillseekers). From June to September, you can also get your thrills white-water rafting – try River Run Rafting or Wilderness Tours Packages for organised trips on the Ottawa River. For a more vintage experience, don flying goggles with Ottawa Biplane Adventures, which offers open-cockpit city tours from its base at the Canadian Museum of Space and Aviation, itself a worthwhile aeronautical outing. Back in town you may round the day off with an After Dark Tour, a walking tour that recounts some seedy and grisly history before dropping you at the free Northern Lights show, a must-see nightly laser-light extravaganza at the parliament from early July to early September.Ottawa’s neighbourhoods bustle most on Saturdays. Breakfast on the Golden Triangle’s Elgin Street, visit the home of the city’s LGBT community on Bank Street, have lunch in Chinatown then head to the hipster frontier of Hintonburg to pick up repurposed souvenirs by local artists and craftspeople at Maker House, such as coat hooks made from an old ice hockey stick. It’s also from here that brewery tour operator Brew Donkey strikes out on fun five-hour weekend tours of local craft beer breweries in an old school bus.Sunday is farmers’ market day in Ottawa and the biggest option is the Ottawa Farmers’ Market in the Glebe, a blue-collar-gone-hip neighbourhood where old-school independent shops and restaurants thrive. Don’t miss Kettleman’s, a longstanding 24-hour place where you can watch and smell bagels being baked. The Glebe’s TD Place is where the Redblacks play Canadian football, Ottawa Fury play football (or rather soccer), and the Ottawa 67’s play ice hockey. Between them, there’s at least one fixture most weeks, often on Sundays. Round your busy week off with a well-earned nightcap at Chateau Lafayette, also known as the Laff, Ottawa’s oldest tavern (it dates from 1849).Photography: Cole Burston for the  except lead image and the view from Gatineau Hills (Alamy)Plan your trip to Ottawa with Canadian Affair."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73a31a5d3658317f68a621ab2e8bf75b8ba24b17/0_131_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=160d167081dc0d764541348e2a9574ff","title":"most people back drinks bottles deposit scheme survey finds","story":"‘All-in’ model would mean charge added to plastic, glass, aluminium and steel containersAlmost three-quarters of Britons would support a nationwide deposit return system for plastic and glass drinks bottles and aluminium cans, a survey has found.The results follow the announcement last week during a speech at London’s Kew Gardens by Michael Gove, then environment secretary, in which he expressed support for a comprehensive deposit return system. In his speech, Gove suggested that “an ‘all-in’ model will give consumers the greatest possible incentive to recycle”.The all-in model would see a small charge added to the cost of drinks containers made from glass, PET plastic, aluminium and steel. When the empty container is returned to a collection point to be recycled, the charge would be refunded.In Scotland, the government has already committed to introduce a deposit system for glass, steel and aluminium drinks containers of all sizes. Maddy Haughton-Boakes, litter campaigner for CPRE, said: “With Michael Gove having thrown his weight behind a truly ‘all-in’ deposit return system, and with the Scottish government’s decision to introduce one earlier this year, this latest wave of public support is surely all the evidence needed for the government to get this over the line.”A deposit system could change this. This month, the CPRE reported that an “all-in” deposit return system could generate £2bn for the economy over 10 years, as detailed in the government’s own impact assessment. This economic boost would come from a reduction in the amount of waste sent to landfill, fewer littered drinks containers and associated cleanup costs, reduced air and water pollution, and less carbon emissions caused by the extraction and production of raw materials needed to produce new drinks containers.Haughton-Boakes said: “It’s absolutely fantastic that so many people have shown such high levels of support for the scheme before its even been introduced.“A deposit return system will transform the way we deal with waste, boost recycling and as a result, finally put a stop to the harm that drinks containers are causing our countryside, environment and wildlife.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbda9da3e64ea1107c5c37d5e5d55df8eb1dcc7f/0_0_2500_1643/master/2500.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=472fbe53d50d6e1602f052c62b145bfe 1400w","title":"international incident work mistake official secrets film","story":"It was the Observer’s big scoop of 2003, and as a young journalist, I was asked to type up a top-secret memo. Now my mess-up has made it to the big screenHave you ever wondered who’d play you in a film? I had, occasionally, until the day I got the answer. In spring 2018, a message pinged on to my phone via Facebook from a journalist friend. “So this is a bit weird,” it read. “A sister of a friend is playing you in a movie, apparently. You aware of this?” I wasn’t.“Hanako Footman is playing you in the film Official Secrets. She wants to meet you, like actors do. She saw we were pals and asked if I’d ask you. What did you do in that story?”“That story” concerns British whistleblower Katharine Gun, played by Keira Knightley in a film that premiered at Sundance festival in January. Fluent in Mandarin, the 28-year-old Gun was employed as a translator at GCHQ in Cheltenham. In 2003, she leaked a top-secret memo to the Observer about an illegal spying operation ordered by the US National Security Agency. It intended to bug the phones and emails of six United Nations delegates, from Angola, Cameroon, Chile, Mexico, Guinea and Pakistan – nations that could determine whether the UN approved the invasion of Iraq.The memo, which outraged Gun, ordered staff to increase surveillance operations “particularly directed at… UN Security Council members (minus US and GBR, of course)” to provide real-time intelligence for Bush officials on voting intentions. I was working at the Observer at the time. And, although I was just a bit-player in the story, the film dramatises a monumental mess-up on my behalf – the biggest mistake of my career.It’s 2003. The airwaves are filled with Beyoncé’s Crazy In Love, Justin Timberlake’s Cry Me A River and Hey Ya! by OutKast. Cool young things wear absurdly small clothing – low-slung jeans nicknamed “bumsters”, for obvious reasons thongs crop tops and, most ill-advisedly, “shrugs”, unflattering miniature cardigans. An incredible heatwave sweeps Europe, too, with the mercury hitting 38.5C in Brogdale, Kent.The feverishness of those days extends to geopolitics. Three years earlier, George W Bush narrowly won the 2000 US presidential election after a recount in Florida and a debacle involving hanging chads. In 2001 came the terrorist attacks of 911, propelling al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden into the public consciousness. Britain’s “special relationship” with the US grew ever closer, thanks to the manoeuvrings of the then prime minister, Tony Blair.It was an interesting time for a young journalist with no newspaper experience to be joining the foreign desk of the Observer. Aged 24 and having held only junior positions at women’s magazines, I applied for the role of foreign desk assistant in late 2002. State-schooled in Sussex and with no newspaper contacts, I had a thirst for foreign news. As a teenager, my heroes had been foreign correspondents Kate Adie, Michael Buerk and John Simpson. At university I devoured the works of George Orwell – himself a former Observer journalist – Ernest Hemingway, Martha Gellhorn and Graham Greene, before devoting a year of my degree to the impact of reporting on the Vietnam war. What I offered in keenness must have made up for my lack of experience because, after two interviews, I took a call and was told: “You’ve got the job… if you want it?” Of course I did.Joining was a culture shock. Our working week ran from Tuesday to Saturday, with knocking-off times getting progressively later (9, 10, 11pm) as Sunday approached. Everyone was constantly available on their BlackBerry – the height of tech at the time. The neighbouring Coach \u0026amp Horses pub was our unofficial canteen. My colleagues were impressive: charismatic raconteurs, supremely well-read and worldly wise. I was entrusted with an A4 contacts book – a ringbinder of phone and satellite phone numbers and emails for correspondents all over the globe. Dusty reporters would fly in from assignments in far-flung places, handing over a bundle of disorganised receipts for obscure items: four camels, for instance, “replacements for a herd accidentally hit and killed on a road by driver”.It was intense, collegiate and fun, and I felt privileged to be part of the team – but also out of my depth. My brilliant predecessor had left to make documentaries for Channel 4. I set about looking after flak jackets and foreign currency, visas and travel plans. I called to check in with reporters on high-risk assignments and watched the international news wires for stories. Not long after I started, I was asked to look into flights for a foreign correspondent to go from London to Diyarbakir and then help find a fixer to assist with crossing a border. I didn’t even know which country that was, let alone which border they might be crossing.Towards the end of my second week, I was handed a printout of an email by Martin Bright (then the Observer’s home affairs editor, played in Official Secrets by Matt Smith) and Peter Beaumont (the foreign affairs editor – played by Matthew Goode). Could I type it up and save it into the system? I wasn’t given any other information. Their only instruction: “Don’t make any mistakes.” And so I set to painstakingly typing in each sentence.Importance HIGHTop SecretAllAs you’ve likely heard by now, the Agency is mounting a surge…… We’d appreciate your support in getting the word to your analysts who might have similar, more in-direct access to valuable information from accesses in your product lines.It took about 10 minutes. I double-checked it, sent it through, moved on to my next task.On Sunday morning, I woke up to see the paper’s front-page splash: “Revealed: US dirty tricks to win vote on Iraq war”. Underneath was the memo I’d typed up.Of course, the story – broken by Bright, Beaumont and the inimitable New York correspondent and investigative journalist Ed Vulliamy (played with great aplomb and accuracy in the film by Rhys Ifans) – was huge. But my pride in being a tiny part of the team soon crumbled when, first thing on Monday morning, my phone rang. It was an unknown number and, as Monday was a day off for most of the news team, I didn’t expect it to be the office. It was – I think – Stephen Pritchard, the paper’s readers’ editor. He was very polite, but informed me with deft understatement and a total lack of drama that I had caused “something of an international incident”.Fastidiously typing in the memo, and not knowing what the document was or its origins, I’d changed all the American spelling “mistakes” to British English. “Recognize” became recognise, and “emphasize” emphasise. “Favorable” was amended to favourable. I thought I was being helpful. Instead, it was a disaster.The story that Gun had risked so much to reveal was thrown into doubt. How could this be a leaked US memo, asked websites such as the Drudge Report, when it was all spelled in British English? The wobble caught on. Was it a fake? Some outlets due to report on the Observer’s story cancelled interviews over doubts about the memo’s authenticity. It was decided the readers’ editor should publish a special dispatch to counter the thousands of complaints from readers, many American, calling us “lying limey bastards”, claiming that the story’s authors had fallen victim to a hoax and that the email was part of a campaign of misinformation.Of course, it was not. Despite my “administrative error”, the story still made shockwaves around the world. Some days later, Gun went on to reveal her identity, and her life imploded she lost her job, was arrested and ultimately faced a trial under the Official Secrets Act, which collapsed after the prosecution declined to offer its evidence.Meanwhile, I struggled to make peace with the ramifications of what I’d done. Humiliated, and just a few weeks into my dream job, I rang my former magazine editor and asked for my old job back it had, of course, been filled.By Tuesday morning, there was nothing to do but go in and face the music. I assumed I’d be fired, and sobbed in the office loo before going to my desk. But while I am sure everyone involved was cursing my name – one of the biggest stories of their careers had been plunged into unnecessary doubt – they were outwardly kind and magnanimous. I was summoned to meet Pritchard and Bright to explain what had happened, and while there were a few eye rolls I think they understood why I’d done what I did, being in the dark about the genesis of the document. How the mistake wasn’t spotted by anyone else was also a matter of some consternation.Somehow, I managed to put the disaster behind me. The senior editors forgave me, and I remained on the foreign desk for three years.When, 16 years later, I found out that not only was the story being made into a film, but my mistake had been included, I had some sleepless nights. I met Footman, the young actor who plays me, at a cafe in London early last year with some trepidation. She told me she couldn’t ulge any specifics about the movie. “But is it made clear I wasn’t fired over what happened?” I asked. She was noncommittal, but said I did appear in a later scene. She wanted to talk details: what did I wear back in the day? What colour did I paint my fingernails? How did I get on with my colleagues? What were the foreign correspondents like? “Most of my outfits were probably too casual,” I said. “I was frequently hungover and more than once fell asleep in the canteen.” And how to describe the foreign correspondents? Simultaneously impressive and unpredictable.Around nine months after we met, I was invited to a first-cut screening of the film. I watched as “Nicole” got bawled out by the Observer’s famously sweary then editor, Roger Alton (played by Conleth Hill, Lord Varys in Game Of Thrones) in front of the entire team – thankfully not something that happened in real life. Footman played a blinder as me – albeit a more groomed version.I knew it would be hard to watch my mistake unfold, but when it came, it felt like being punched in the throat. I felt the shame all over again, and sobbed silently into my tissue. Nevertheless, the film is as brilliant as it is important. And while I wouldn’t recommend carrying the burden of a catastrophic fuck-up, as Alton would term it, through one’s career, it did provide a salutary lesson in attention to detail. It was my first serious mistake, and hopefully it will be my last.• Official Secrets is released in the UK on 18 OctoberIf you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6d11c8ab9487dc427d07d2ad02ccded6914626f/0_1471_3723_2233/master/3723.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f80427c8d5f7dc9fbe57506b13c85cf2","title":"yotam ottolenghi miso recipes gochujang eggs leeks sticky bananas","story":"Miso’s umami hit gives depth to these leeks with miso and chives, rösti-style braised eggs, and is the perfect foil for these sticky bananas with brown sugar and limeOpen my fridge, and you’ll find a load of ‘trick’ condiments for injecting food with flavour, the trick being fermentation and its deep impact on cooking. Fermented ingredients, of which miso is a shining star, have multiple layers and serious depth, which saves on time and effort creating that complexity yourself. My miso jar comes in especially handy for cooking vegetables without any help from animal-based products. It gives food – even desserts, notably when caramel is involved – an umami boost and an unmistakable, yet very delicious, funk.Here, eggs are baked nestled inside a giant rösti with a crisp bottom, giving you a perfect brunch combination. Try to stick to ½cm batons for the vegetables and not grate them, because you won’t get the crispness you’re after. You can do this with a sharp knife or, more conveniently, a mandoline or a food processor with the appropriate attachment. Be sure to source a good-quality gochujang (a fermented Korean red pepper paste), because they’re much punchier than most supermarket brands.Prep 20 minCook 50 minServes 4 as a main3 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for greasing400g large baking potatoes (ie, 1-2 potatoes), peeled and cut into ½cm batons1 small kohlrabi, peeled and cut into ½cm batons (160g net weight)1 tbsp gochujang paste2 tsp white miso paste2 small garlic cloves, peeled and crushedSalt8 eggs1 lime, cut into 4 wedges, to serveFor the salsa1 tbsp lime juice1 tsp gochujang paste 2 tbsp oil2 tsp chives, finely chopped2 tsp mixed black and white sesame seeds, toastedHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)425Fgas 7. Using a little olive oil, lightly grease a 28cm nonstick saute pan for which you have a lid, then put it the oven to heat for five minutes.In a large bowl, toss the first six ingredients and a quarter-teaspoon of salt until well coated (you may want to wear rubber gloves). Remove the pan from the oven, tip in the potato mixture and spread out evenly, then return the pan to the oven and bake for 25 minutes, rotating the pan once halfway, until golden brown and crisp on top.Use the back of a dessertspoon to make eight wells in the potato mixture, then crack an egg into each one. Cover the pan and return it to the oven for eight minutes, or until the whites are cooked and the yolks are still runny (if you like, use a small spoon and carefully peel away the white film over the yolks to reveal their colour). Season the eggs with a little salt.While the eggs are cooking, mix all the salsa ingredients in a small bowl. To serve, drizzle the salsa all over the eggs and potatoes and serve straight from the pan with the lime wedges alongside to squeeze on top.The punchy dressing is the star here, and it pairs brilliantly with the mild sweetness of the leeks. It’s also great tossed with new potatoes or drizzled over fish, chicken or tofu. The fried leek tops and garlic add aroma and crunch, but if you want to save yourself from deep-frying andor time, leave them out and serve the leeks with the dressing alone.Prep 20 minCook 1 hrServes 4 as a starter12 medium leeks, trimmed – leave some of the green tops intact300ml vegetable oil 1¼ tsp cornflour4 garlic cloves, peeled and finely slicedFor the miso and chive dressing2cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and roughly choppedFlaked sea salt1½ tbsp mixed black and white sesame seeds, well toasted5 tbsp chives, finely chopped, plus 1 tsp extra to serve1½ tbsp white miso60ml mirin¾ tbsp rice vinegar1 tbsp olive oilRemove the tough outer layers of the leeks and wash them well to remove any grit. Cut off and reserve the green tops so each leek is about 22cm long. Finely slice 60g of the reserved tops into thin, 8cm-long strips. Rinse the leek greens again, to ensure you’ve removed any grit, then drain and dry thoroughly with kitchen towel.For the miso and chive dressing, pound the ginger and a quarter-teaspoon of flaked salt in a mortar (or with the flat of a knife). Put in a small bowl with all the remaining dressing ingredients except the oil, stir well to combine and set aside.Take a pot that’s wide enough to hold the leeks lengthways, half-fill it with lightly salted water, then put on a medium-high heat. Once the water is simmering, add the leeks and turn down the heat to medium. Put a lid that’s smaller than the pan on top of the leeks to weigh them down and keep them under the water’s surface, then simmer gently for 20 minutes, or until a knife goes through easily but they are still holding their shape. Transfer the leeks to a colander and stand them up vertically so they drain thoroughly.Put the vegetable oil in a medium saucepan on a medium-high heat and line a plate with kitchen paper. Toss the dried, sliced leek tops in a teaspoon of cornflour. Once the oil is hot (170C on a thermometer), fry the leek tops for about two minutes, stirring with a fork, until golden and crisp. Transfer to the lined plate with a slotted spoon and sprinkle with flaked salt.Toss the sliced garlic in the remaining quarter-teaspoon of cornflour and fry for about a minute, stirring regularly to keep the garlic slices separate, until crisp and golden brown. Add to the plate of fried leeks and sprinkle with more flaked salt.Arrange the braised leeks on a platter and spoon over the dressing. Drizzle with the olive oil and top with the fried leeks and garlic. Sprinkle with the extra chives and serve.This punchy dessert has everything – sweetness, acidity, saltiness and umami – which makes the creme fraiche essential for rounding out the flavours and mellowing them a little. The bananas you use should have almost completely yellow skins, with only the faintest bit of brown spotting. If you don’t have a spice grinder, it will be virtually impossible to grind the rice sufficiently, so leave it out or use chopped toasted peanuts instead.40g unsalted butter70g soft light brown sugar½ tsp ground star anise150g creme fraiche1½ tbsp white miso 4 semi-ripe medium bananas, peeled and halved lengthways1 lime – zest finely grated, to get 1 tsp, then cut into 4 wedgesFor the toasted rice topping1 tbsp uncooked white rice2 tsp black sesame seeds½ tsp ground star aniseSet the oven grill to its highest setting. Meanwhile, put the rice in a small frying pan on a medium heat and toast for 12-15 minutes, shaking the pan from time to time, until deeply golden. Transfer to a spice grinder, blitz very finely, then tip into a small bowl. Return the pan to a medium-high heat, add the sesame seeds and toast, shaking the pan regularly, for about a minute, then tip into the rice bowl. Add the ground star anise and mix to combine.Put the butter, sugar, star anise and a tablespoon of creme fraiche in a large, ovenproof cast-iron pan (or large saute pan) and put on a medium heat. Stir the mixture until the butter has melted and the sugar dissolved, then, off the heat, whisk in the miso until smooth. Add the bananas cut side-up, and use a spoon to coat the tops with some of the caramel. Transfer the pan to the oven and grill for eight minutes (timings will vary depending on your grill), or until the bananas have softened and taken on quite a lot of colour.Sprinkle over the lime zest and a tablespoon of the rice topping, and serve hot straight from the pan, with the lime wedges, remaining creme fraiche and some extra crunchy topping alongside."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd1f4981c4dabc36c6893b748f2dbe1bd3f23481/1492_177_3230_1937/master/3230.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1c1c9d3f237c71ba5fc4c041b35f8bf","title":"gareth bale aims to have beckham like impact with move to jiangsu suning","story":"• Welshman has until 31 July to complete China move• Relations with Zinedine Zidane entirely broken downGareth Bale believes he can be at the forefront of a football revolution in China should he complete his impending move to Jiangsu Suning.While the deal, which is worth around £1m per week to the Real Madrid forward, is being finalised, a key motivation for the Welshman is the chance to effect fundamental change in the game, rather as David Beckham energised the game in the United States with his move to MLS.The 30-year-old believes he has achieved everything in European football, having claimed four Champions Leagues, one La Liga, one Copa del Rey, three Uefa Super Cups and three Club World Cups in six years at Real. He scored three times in the Champions League final triumphs, and six times in six Club World Cup matches, the second highest tally, behind Cristiano Ronaldo. When at Tottenham Hotspur Bale was twice voted the PFA Player of the Year. He is Wales’ highest scorer with 31 goals in 77 appearances.The transfer window in China closes on 31 July so there are four days left for Bale to complete the move to the Nanjing-based club, who stand sixth in the Chinese Super League and have a squad that includes the Brazil defender Miranda, who is 34, and the latter’s compatriot, Alex Teixeira, a 29-year-old former Shakhtar Donetsk midfielder.Bale is poised to leave Real since Zinedine Zidane made it clear he was not wanted after relations between the Welshman and the head coach broke down. Bale featured as a substitute as Real suffered a humiliating 7-3 defeat by their city rivals, Atlético Madrid, in Friday’s pre-season friendly in New Jersey.While Bale came off the bench for the last half-hour, Zidane admitted the defeat “hurt”, Diego Costa having scored four goals before being sent off on 65 minutes along with Real’s Dani Carvajal in what was an ill-tempered game.“I’m not concerned, but I’m hurt,” said Zidane. “You don’t play to lose. But we can’t be looking backwards. It was a bad game and now we have to focus on what went wrong, so we can try and make sure it doesn’t happen again in the next match. We don’t need to dwell on it. This is a pre-season game. They were better in every respect and that’s all there is to it.“We can’t be pleased with this defeat, that much is clear. We just really lacked the intensity you need at this level. But I’m convinced I’ve got a team here that is going to compete at the top level. We’ll be motivated and hungry to keep going, I have no doubt about it. I’m convinced we’re going to have a good season.“This won’t change what we’re looking to achieve this season. The players are not letting me down, we’re just preparing for the new season and we have to remain calm. We have to be ready for when La Liga comes around.”Diego Simeone, the Atlético head coach, told the club’s website: “We prepared the game knowing it was a derby. We played well and I told the lads. The players are very excited. The goal is to arrive at the first La Liga match in the best possible shape.”João Félix, Ángel Correa and Vitolo scored the other goals for Atlético while Nacho, Karim Benzema and Javier Hernández Carrera registered Real’s consolation goals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5391b2d97cf4017548654d892d6aabc4367ea952/712_1753_5145_3086/master/5145.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef92260e6b5ebeb4f4874f09a932cdd8","title":"blowing bubbles in cambridge","story":"Retro style is given a surreal twist by two designers who use their home as a testing groundIf Lewis Carroll’s Alice had done up a house, she might have sought out Brendan Young and Vanessa Battaglia. The Italian-English duo have a knack for art and design that confounds expectations – and pigeonholing. In the world of Mineheart, the company they founded in 2010, nothing is quite what it seems. Tiny beaded chandeliers seem to float inside overscaled Edison bulbs that dangle from brass chains. The sitters of grand 18th-century portraits blow bubblegum, and haughty flamingos in ruffs look like fugitives from an Elizabethan menagerie.Like their designs, the couple enjoy the element of surprise that greets visitors to their home. Set in a tree-lined cul-de-sac of cottages and semis, from the outside it looks like a standard 1970s house – panels of weatherboarding framing wide picture windows. Inside it’s a different story. By knocking down walls and painting everything white they have conjured the illusion of a modern country cottage, with flourishes of the surreal, in the heart of Cambridge.The hands-on couple, who have a young son, did all the work themselves. Downstairs, one of their first tasks was to remove the wall, complete with retro serving hatch, that ided the old galley kitchen from the main living area. They found the long, rustic island on eBay. It used to be a carpenter’s workbench and they appreciate the “dents and bashes” and the deep drawer used to store tools. The white kitchen units are B\u0026ampQ and Brendan’s father, a design teacher, made the sociable table from floor joists and piano legs. The dining chairs are a motley mismatch, but each one – by Thonet or Hans Wegner – has a story, as do the deep-buttoned Chesterfields, bought for “less than £16 each”, says Vanessa.Before they moved in, the two-storey property had been rented out to students and was in a predictably awful state of neglect. They have kept the decoration simple, adding traditional panelled doors with brass handles, swapping dingy carpets for wood flooring, distressed for antique effect. The couple has always worked at home and recently added the glazed extension at the back. It doubles as studio and yoga room for sun salutations overlooking the garden. Upstairs, they painted the floorboards white and numbered the stair treads for Antoni, now five, as he learned to count.As their business has grown, they have gathered a “support network” of artists who share their aesthetic. “We’ll swap ideas and images, it’s a process of filtering until we hit on something original,” says Brendan. Upstairs in the master bedroom, what appears to be a delicately painted mural of Baroque architecture turns out, on closer inspection, to be wallpaper, based on drawings by the German artist Simon Schubert. The pair of classical portraits that hangs over the bed is another illusion of digital imagery overlaid with real brushwork, as if an abstract artist had been let loose in a museum of old masters. By the bed, a table made from moulded concrete to look like petrified wood might have come from an enchanted forest.An air of stepping through the looking glass stretches to Antoni’s bedroom. The coronet-wearing flamingo that gazes out imperiously from a black frame is a digital image by Angela Rossi – another collaborator. A Renaissance painting inspired the wallpaper of cherubs, aloft on fluffy clouds. On the back of the door, the painting of a galleon in full sail used to hang over the bath in their previous home and still has two holes, cut to fit over the taps. It is by Vanessa’s father. “He is a mathematician, but he’s painted since he was tiny. The family wouldn’t let him become an artist so he became an academic. But he still paints every day. It’s therapy for him.”They have always used their home as a testing bed for prototypes – lighting, furniture, rugs – believing that “If we can live with them, then other people can.” The trompe l’oeil library wallpaper that launched their business began life in their last cottage. “We needed something to decorate the sitting room so we photocopied the spines of old books and stuck them on a pair of cupboards to give the illusion of wallpaper.” They sent the image to an interiors magazine who devoted a full page to the design. “We were getting orders before we’d even printed the wallpaper.”Sustainability, too, has always been important for the couple who have a shared background of designing for large companies, including Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana and Versace, until, says Vanessa: “We decided to do things that we like – even if they’re not always obviously commercial.” Now, proceeds from sales of their wallpapers are put towards a tree-planting scheme in Africa. Mineheart, the name of their business, was inspired by Shakespeare. “We took it from the first words of sonnet 46, ‘Mine eye and heart.’ It says everything about us. We design things we’re proud to have our name on. Things which come from the heart and make us smile,” says Vanessa.  mineheart"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ad42bde6fc2e2805e0d4136ae0b71dad66aa102/113_152_2693_1614/master/2693.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4ce733f1e0718e3eacc237819f54964","title":"professor green my roast dinner instagram posts get more likes than my music ones ","story":"The rapper, 35, on strong women, knife crime and his rotisserie ovenI thought success would bring me happiness – fuck me, was I wrong.

People who work fewer hours work better and are happier. I go into huge corporations to talk about this. Presenteeism causes mental health problems for their own employees, which they then have to supply the support for.I’ve recently got into the habit of sleeping with the curtains open.

After all, it was to be the “biggest ever” edition of the Women’s World Cup, a turning point in the development of the women’s game and the best showcase of its improving quality. But as the crowd joined the US women’s national team in sending the chant for equal pay echoing around the Stade de Lyon, the magnitude of the effect of this competition started to sink in. The tournament was expected to break new ground on the pitch and spur footballing change off it, but no one could have predicted the extent to which the players themselves would use their four-yearly platform to demand more than they were being given.I tweeted “I’m having the time of my life” during the final. I was. Five weeks in France, and a journey which ultimately began with being asked to write a weekly women’s football blog in June 2017, had reached a momentary conclusion. For someone who relishes writing about the social and political effects of sport, the sporting and – let’s be realistic – political victory of Megan Rapinoe and her US teammates was liberating.It’s hard to describe the experience of covering a first World Cup. With childcare carefully coordinated, I sped into the Gare du Nord on the Eurostar keen to start bathing in the tournament atmosphere. Yet, seemingly, France was indifferent. There were Roland Garros tennis banners lining the Champs Elysée and posters advertising the French men’s national team matches in the autumn peppered around the metro, but the absence of Women’s World Cup branding was stark.Fifa had already been embroiled in a ticketing fiasco in which families had been seated separately, and which was only solved, extremely late in the day, by the complete recall and reissuing of tickets for affected games. Now it, or at least the local organising committee, had shown a disappointing level of interest in building any kind of tournament hype. And so, where the tournament build-up had been dominated by coverage of England, now attention turned to the deficiencies of the organisations responsible for hosting the showpiece competition.More would follow. The introduction of the video assistant referee and new rules on handball and penalty kicks prompted much debate, and sparsely filled stadiums only served to reinforce the idea that not enough had been done to promote the tournament on home soil. For me, 15 matches in 34 days meant these issues, and the football itself, were experienced in a whirlwind of travel (four planes, eight trains, eight hire cars), typing and questionable levels of sleep. Now and again the editors would check in. Did I need a break? Was the latest request one too many? Could they take anything off me? Probably yes, but there was no way I was saying it. Rest was for after.I have not covered a men’s tournament, but by all accounts the camaraderie and collaboration between journalists here – a mixture of young women’s football writers and older, battle-hardened national writers more traditionally from the men’s game – was refreshing. At its centre was an entertaining England media WhatsApp group - set up for logistics, but instantly home to social organising and constant banter.With the opening game came the first spine-tingling rendition of La Marseillaise, the disrespectful announcement of Eden Hazard’s signing by Real Madrid mid-match to push the result off back pages, and the first of many 9pm kick-offs. These late starts put print deadlines to the test. Every game required a “runner” - first-half copy sent at half time, second-half copy sent on 70 minutes, and a “top and tail” sent on the 85th. Luckily, the Sweden v Netherlands semi-final was the only match I covered which went beyond 90 minutes. Sophie Lawson though, less luckily, was tasked with her first ever runner as Scotland threw away a 3-0 lead in the last 15 minutes against Argentina. The resulting draw was not enough for either team to progress to the last 16, prompting multiple mid-game and post-match rewrites.It was on day 24 that I crashed under the intensity of tournament life. A day in bed, watching Love Island (the Lionesses were hooked so I’m chalking that up as research), before heading out to another 9pm kick-off, somewhat recharged the batteries.A reunion with the England press pack in the industrial jungle of Le Havre was followed by the most complete England performance of the tournament. When Jill Scott’s third-minute goal slipped in, press box etiquette went out of the window and I celebrated wildly with a member of the FA communications team beside me. As England’s third against Norway, Lucy Bronze’s wonder-volley, flew into the roof of the net - robbed of winning goal of the tournament by the voting masses in Brazil - the late journey from the stadium felt like so much less of a chore.A 1-2am finish was followed by an early start for an England media day in distant Deauville, then a mad drive to Paris for the Rapinoe show against the hosts and, the next morning, a train to Lyon for a more settled, but packed, final week.With the Lionesses’ ultimate test against the reigning world champions, the US, looming, tensions were whipped up by “Hotelgate”: England manager Phil Neville’s anger that US team officials were checking out their hotel – in case they needed it for the final, the US said. I hurriedly helped arrange a press and FA group to take part in Equal Playing Field’s world record attempt for the longest ever five-a-side football match at 9pm. It was exhausting but liberating – a bit of mindless fun and exercise we didn’t realise we needed – and we returned with medals and a world record to our names. They would be the only medals “coming home”, as England’s run was ended with relative ease by the Americans.Also, after months of contact while working on exposing the violent sexual abuse of players by the president of the Afghanistan Football Federation, I had my first face-to-face meetings during the tournament with the country’s women’s head coach, Kelly Lindsey, her assistant coach Haley Carter, and players Shabnam Ruhin and Mina Ahmadi. It was a very emotional experience.The final at the Stade de Lyon –where water was confiscated by security for not being “on brand” in close to 40F heat – was a formality. With England out of the picture, my hopes were on a Rapinoe performance against the Netherlands that would emphatically silence her loud-mouthed presidential critic. Another penalty for the US team’s purple-haired conscience ensured she bagged the Golden Boot, the Golden Ball and the all-important trophy. Now bring on the 2021 home Euros!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9829d87a0036773af702a40b198638c53c015181/77_0_3345_2008/master/3345.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc57bc794fdaa9703a60fd7411a4c299","title":"hmrc data shows unearned income britain wealthiest doubles in five years","story":"The “unearned income” of the most well-off people in Britain more than doubled while millions endured austerity and stagnant wages, an Observer analysis of government data reveals.The data only counts inidual UK taxpayers, and excludes those who did not receive any investment income – between a quarter and a third of the population, meaning the highest gains are even more concentrated at the top. Meanwhile, average weekly earnings from paid employment fell in real terms between 2010 and 2016, so most people’s jobs were not paying enough to keep up with the cost of living. Benefit cuts worsened the impact on the poorest.Reacting to the figures, Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: “An economic model that rewards wealth creators less than wealth extractors is not sustainable economically or morally.”Dividends are taxed at a lower rate than normal income. An income of £38,000 made through paid work incurs nearly £9,000 of tax at present, whereas the same income made up of idends attracts tax of less than £2,000. As a result, some small business owner-managers pay themselves idends, rather than a salary, to cut their tax bill.Dividends, interest and property rent are all ways of making wealth profitable. HMRC analysis suggests around 100 people withdrew idends averaging £30m each from their companies shortly before idend tax rates rose for higher earners in 2016. Despite this rise, idends are still taxed more lightly than job salaries.Liam Kennedy, research officer at the thinktank Class, said: “These figures go to show how our economy rewards those with wealth and not those who work. The UK suffers from extreme levels of wealth inequality and we need a much more progressive tax system that reflects this.“Aligning capital gains tax with taxes on income would be a good place to start, but we need to also think about replacing inheritance tax with a lifetime gifts tax to prevent unjust, intergenerational transfers of privilege and wealth.”Rise in company idends "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2857783368fb56cbb989ce72f7bf56cd26e8f922/132_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=247ce5e9ddba67593ac2c294f6cc738b","title":"thousands without mobiles could be frozen out of online payments","story":"Under new fraud rules, codes will be sent to phones, which could leave some users excludedThousands of UK consumers who can’t get a mobile signal at home – or don’t own a mobile phone – face being frozen out of internet shopping as banks are increasingly insisting that online payments are verified by text.HSBC has told customers they will have to register a mobile phone to enable it to verify future online card payments. And with other banks set to follow its lead, MPs have warned a third of online purchases could fail.This relates to tougher new European requirements for authenticating online payments laid out in the second payment services directive (PSD2). These come into force on 14 September (see below) and will change the Verified by Visa and Mastercard SecureCode processes used by banks to reduce fraud.Customers verifying online purchases – or logging in to online banking – will not be able to do so just by inputting a password as they do now. Instead, they will most likely have to input a code sent to them by the payment provider – in most cases by text.Non-mobile users, and those who cannot get a signal at home, face having to start using card readers that generate a pin every time they make an online purchase from a company they may not have previously bought from. But if you don’t bank online, you may not have a card reader, so you would have to apply for one.HSBC customer Chris White*, who lives in north Wales, just 20 miles from Chester, has already fallen foul of this. He says he has been told his online shopping days are effectively over because of HSBC’s requirement that all payments are only verified by text.“Until recently, when it came to making online payments, it would be done by Verified by Visa. But last week HSBC insisted I give my mobile phone number. I am happy to do that – the only problem is that I get zero mobile service at home, meaning I can’t receive the text. Without a code the payment is refused,” he says.White says he visited his nearest HSBC branch in Mold, only to be informed by staff that nothing could be done. He says they told him he was not the only customer complaining about this.“I don’t bank online because I don’t trust it,” says White. “But to be told that I can no longer shop online is ridiculous. HSBC will have to find another way to verify its customers like me. It could send a WhatsApp message or email, which will come over the home wifi, but apparently it won’t. What will happen to all those who don’t have a mobile and don’t bank online? They are being treated like second-class citizens by HSBC.”It now says it will email customers an OTP, but only if they have pre-registered an email address.The EU regulations appear to have caught the payments industry off-guard, prompting a recent rush of requests to online shoppers for mobile phone numbers – despite the fact that the technology behind mobiles and texts has been proven to be insecure.The Financial Conduct Authority has indicated it will delay the enforcement of the new rules to give the industry more time to implement them and keep online tills ringing.“We make a range of options available, but it is up to the banks to decide on which measures they choose. They decide on how customers verify payments, not us,” says a Mastercard spokesman.What’s clear is that banks are taking different approaches. Santander told Money that its customers will have to have a mobile phone to receive an authorising code as a text or via its app. Clearly, non-mobile users are going to struggle to make online purchases if that policy is maintained.Barclays, NatWestRoyal Bank of Scotland and Nationwide said customers would be able to receive their code via their card reader if they did not have a usable mobile phone. Customers who don’t bank online will have to request one, and face the hassle of having to use it.“We are working on other solutions that will enable customers to keep shopping,” says Nationwide.TSB is the only bank so far to say that it will offer automated calls to landlines – the obvious solution for those in White’s shoes.A number of big retailers such as Amazon have been asking customers to hand over mobile numbers. Online shoppers can expect a host of similar requests in the coming weeks and months, say payment experts.It is unclear what impact Brexit could have on the requirement to introduce these rules. But it seems unlikely the UK’s regulators would row back on a policy that is designed to make online payments safer and reduce fraud.* Not his real nameA new regime – known as strong customer authentication (SCA) – will require customers to be “authenticated” by at least two different methods from three options. These categories are: something only the payer knows, such as a password or pin. Something only the payer has, such as a mobile phone or card reader. Or something personal to the payer, such as a fingerprint, or their voice or face, or bizarrely something as obscure as the angle at which they hold their phone.So a password and a fingerprint would meet the rules, but a password and a pin would not. A password and a generated code sent as a text or via an app, would. The rules apply to online shopping as well as logging into online bankingThere will be exemptions – for example, for “low value” purchases (under €30), and recurring payments where the amount stays the same. However, a customer who made a series of smaller purchases could trigger the requirement to input a code.While the new regulations are likely to make some transactions more cumbersome in the short term, it is expected that fingerprint and facial recognition will help in the future.It is understood the regime will allow consumers to set up a list of “trusted beneficiaries” – basically, retailers or other companies that the cardholder trusts and uses regularly which could be exempt from the SCA rules.UK Finance, the trade body for the banking sector, says it expects providers will have appropriate solutions in place to allow their customers to authenticate themselves, amid concern for the elderly and those who don’t or can’t use a mobile.“This could mean your bank or provider using a number of verification methods including, for example, a phone call, text, banking app andor card readers to check your identity,” says a spokesman."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/386778909a9bec38c8e6abaedf0232161f84c523/0_83_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54fb3d6de9e5756840588bc806564e25","title":"mohicans zipped trousers zimmer frames punk keeps rocking","story":"Inside Blackpool’s Winter Gardens I saw my mum and dad enjoy an impromptu dance in 1977 just after we’d watched a film called Star Wars in a nearby cinema. I also kissed a girl called Olivia there that night – my first teenage clinch. At the same venue 19 years later I witnessed Tony Blair’s speech to New Labour while covering my first national party conference, the year before his election triumph.But I have never been to the UK’s most important punk event, held annually in the seaside town – the punk Rebellion Festival. This is odd, given I was among the first wave of younger punks to emerge in Belfast in the 1970s during the Troubles. But this week I will be joining up to 10,000 punks, young and old – including many veterans of the 1970s Belfast scene – in Lancashire for the four-day extravaganza, which includes sets from the Damned, the Stranglers and UK Subs.As I plan my trip, I reminisce about that first family holiday to Blackpool and how I moped around the resort grumbling about “morons” and “idiots” with my spiky hair and torn-up school blazer with chains, razor blades and Johnny Rotten button badge. Just another teenage rebel with nowhere to go.Except that in Belfast at the time adopting punk was a far more radical statement than for fans in the rest of the UK. A couple of years after that Blackpool holiday I found myself invading the stage at the end of the 1980 Belfast Punk Festival when Terri Hooley, the “godfather” of the alternative music scene in Northern Ireland and discoverer of bands such as the Undertones, made a declaration that has stayed with me all my life.As the concert ended, with DJ John Peel looking on as an esteemed guest, Hooley grabbed the mic, mobbed by all the young punks, including me, and boomed: “New York has the bands, London has the clothes but Belfast has the reason.”What Hooley – founder of the Good Vibrations record store and independent music label – meant was punk in Northern Ireland had more depth, social reach and impact compared with what was now a dying fad in Britain and America.Organically, without any state or official sanction, this music “movement” brought together youth from all sections of society, and most notably either end of the Ulster sectarian ide. For a brief few years this scene united young people like never before in a society constantly on the edge of outright civil war. Some of the most memorable songs produced reflected the war weariness, disgust and boredom about a conflict still barely a decade old. Tunes such as Stiff Little Fingers’ Wasted Life expressed a plague-on-all-your-houses frustration even with the paramilitary forces that were meant either to liberate or defend us from the other side. It didn’t last as disruptive events such as the 1980-81 hunger strikes inexorably drove many back across neutral no-man’s land into their tribal trenches again. Yet that experience did produce lifelong friendships among people who would never have met otherwise. Some of them will be reunited in Blackpool later this week.“Reunion” and “family” are the two words you hear most when you talk to anyone planning to attend Rebellion, one of the largest and most enduring punk festivals anywhere in the world.Thomas Ian Murdock of Belfast punk veterans the Defects has been at Rebellion for 10 years. “It’s like meeting up with one big family every year,” he says. His friend Jennie Russell-Smith founded the festival in 1996 with her partner Darren. She sums it up with one word: “Family”.“Rebellion,” she contends, “brings people together. You leave your politics and your problems at the door. It also cuts across the generations.”The Hartlepool-born punk veteran says three generations of punks now come to Rebellion each year. “I know grandfathers of punks who will attend with their grandchildren. It is a true, trouble-free family event.”One of the acts that regularly play are UK Subs who shot to fame in the late 70s after the demise of the Sex Pistols. Their lead singer, Charlie Harper, is now 75 but still touring, including dates in Japan and China in the autumn.“The festival is a chance to meet some of your old mates from the old punk scene – some of the best people in the world. I’ve even taken my 21-year-old grandkid to one of the Rebellions and he played his guitar at it. That’s what so great about the festival. All the old mates and the new generation that are still interested in punk music,” Harper says.He recalls with fondness one of our mutual friends, the late Bill Guiney, who came from a loyalist part of inner south Belfast but commanded respect and love from punks from every part of the city and beyond. After his death the Belfast punks held a memorial service for him in a city centre subway where they drank carry-outs and played classic punk tracks from a beat box amid the graffiti.“Don’t get me wrong – I love playing in Ireland and I always found the Dublin scene to be very chilled and really friendly, but Belfast was the best. There was something amazingly energetic about the place that was unique,” Harper remembers.Praise indeed for my native town from Harper, who laughs when I suggest that there might be as many Zimmer frames as zipped trousers on display when Rebellion opens on Thursday.But they will all be taking part in one of the most trouble-free, peaceful and family-orientated music festivals in the world. And in the case of the Northern Irish punks, remember they discovered punk when it was important for a reason, not just for the music and the clothes.

Her work has been the focus of BBC documentaries on Egypt, ancient Rome and the Vikings. In 2016 she won the $1m TED prize to build a website where anyone can help make discoveries using space archaeology. Now the professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham has a new book: Archaeology from Space: How the Future Shapes Our Past.What is space archaeology? It is archaeology using satellites, high-flying aircraft or any other platform that allows you to take pictures remotely of the Earth’s surface. You’re looking back on Earth to find subtle hints of ancient features buried under the ground. Sometimes things show up visually, but more often we are looking in different parts of the light spectrum that we can’t see. For example, the near infrared shows small differences in vegetation and you might expect the vegetation growing on top of buried stone to be a little less healthy. Many thousands of new Mayan sites were found recently in the Guatemalan jungle using Lidar imaging. It is a laser system, flown from an aeroplane, that bounces pulsed laser light off the ground, revealing features which would normally be hidden below the vegetation.Do most archaeologists use space archaeology? The field was born in the early 1980s but only took off about 15 years ago when satellites started being much more widely used. It’s become part of archaeology’s common toolkit and the number of trained archaeologists that do this kind of work is increasing.What got you into the field? I completed my degree at Yale in 2001 in archaeology and Egyptology – the early Indiana Jones movies helped fuel my interest. I took my first remote-sensing class while there, inspired by my grandfather. He had pioneered the use of aerial photography in forestry to map and measure tree heights, having learned about the technique as an officer in world war two. I took the class betting loads of archaeologists would use it. I found out just how new the field was.You have used space archaeology to deepen our understanding of the end of ancient Egypt’s Old Kingdom, best known for its pyramids. What did you find? Some Egyptologists believe the Old Kingdom ended mostly for economic, social and political reasons. Others have argued its demise was caused more by drought. I used satellite imagery of the Egyptian delta and on-the-ground survey work to show that the number of settlements dropped, from the Old Kingdom to the period directly following. Smaller settlements were likely abandoned while larger settlements remained occupied. It has given more evidence to there probably having been a serious drought that lasted for a lengthy period of time and played a more major role in the decline than previously assumed. That has ramifications for today with our civilisation facing climate change, in that more rural areas will be abandoned for cities.You have mapped looting across Egypt over time, showing that it got exponentially worse following the 2009 global recession, with another spike after the 2011 revolution. How does mapping looting from space stop people doing it? Aside from getting western collectors to stop buying antiquities, the first step to stopping looting is identifying where it’s happening. In 2014, I shared the results of the project with the US state department. My testimony, along with those of my colleagues, helped get restrictions to stop Egyptian antiquities being imported into the US. The state department needed proof that there was looting and that this was an ongoing problem. How will technology further shape archaeology in the future? The highest resolution satellite imagery we have right now is 0.3 metres. In the next five to 10 years, I’m expecting that to get down to about 0.1 metres. Imagine being able to zoom in from space and see a pottery shard! There are also more archaeologists using drones which allow you to see at a resolution of a couple of centimetres, though they can’t map hundreds of square kilometres and they are banned in some places like Egypt. In the book I imagine a future where robots do the actual digging and collection. I am expecting a lot of eye-rolling from my colleagues. But look at how much surgery is done robotically. Why wouldn’t archaeology adopt it too?Where are you hoping to apply space archaeology next? Later this year I will be going back to an ancient Egyptian site at Lisht to carry on with our excavation work there. The Egyptian government asked our team to work on a specific tomb to secure it from looters. I want to apply some of the highest resolution satellite imagery, as well as thermal infrared imaging, to see whether we can find additional buried tombs nearby. Also, we know Egypt’s capital in the Middle Kingdom, Itj-Tawy, was situated around there, but the city has never been found. It beckons! Beyond that, I am keen to experiment with new sensor systems on drones. And it would be amazing to design an archaeology-specific satellite. We don’t have one of those yet.

The biggest change was to raise the pension ages in most schemes to match the rising state pension age. The other major change was to pay pensions on the basis of someone’s “career average” earnings rather than their final salary.Other important changes were made to the rate at which pension benefits were built up for each year of service, and to the way in which those benefits were “revalued” up to retirement age to take account of inflation. Each scheme was changed in different ways in response to inidual negotiations between the government and trade unions.One big issue was whether the changes should be applied just to new members of these schemes or to everyone including existing members, or whether there should be “transitional protection” for those closest to pension age. Following consultation with trade unions, the government agreed it would be wrong for those closest to pension age to see last-minute changes to the rules. As a result, it applied a principle that those closest to retirement (generally within 10 years) should stay on the old rules.It was this age cut-off that was the subject of an employment tribunal case brought by firefighters and judges, which ended up in the court of appeal. The unions argued that an age cut-off was discriminatory because it meant younger workers faced changes in their entitlements while older workers did not. The courts agreed with the unions and, on 27 June this year, they told the government it could not appeal against this decision.At first it was unclear whether the decision would apply only to these two particular schemes. But earlier this month the Treasury announced that it had concluded the judgment did “read across” to all the other public sector schemes where a similar age cut-off had been used.So the big question is: what happens next? We can safely assume that the government will not simply scrap the reforms. The Treasury’s recent statement said that putting things right would cost around £4bn per year. While the government does have to abide by the court judgment, this does not stop it from coming back with revised proposals for the future that will make sure the price of these schemes remains within the same overall cost bracket.In terms of process, the government has said it will engage with the employment tribunal to propose remedies for the firefighters and the judges, and it seems likely this approach will then be applied to other public sector schemes.The difficulty in finding a solution is that the changes have created both winners and losers – and putting things right could do the same.One obvious response would be to scrap the idea of transitional protection and impose the changes on all public sector workers, regardless of age. But it seems inconceivable that these could be imposed retrospectively from 2015.Alternatively, the government could move forward the effective start date for the changes to, say, 2021. This would mean younger workers might accrue pensions on the “old” terms for an additional six years. But calculations by my colleagues at Royal London have established that some workers have done better out of the new rules than the old ones. It is hard to believe that the government would retrospectively cut the pensions they have built up in the past few years.So one option that avoids creating new winners and losers would be to pay people the greater of their “old rules” pension and their “new rules” pension for that period – though this would be messy administratively.There are also issues about what would happen with people who retired in the intervening period, or those who started to draw pensions on the basis of ill-health or bereavement, and whether their pensions would need to be adjusted.Further complications could impact higher earners who are affected by annual or lifetime tax relief limits.Agreeing a way to untangle this mess is likely to take us well into 2020, and may require new primary legislation, which suggests implementation in 2021 or beyond. Even this assumes that potentially contentious legislation can be got through a House of Commons where the government may not have a working majority.Ultimately, the court judgment means some public sector workers may enjoy a period of faster pension buildup than they had been expecting. But it would be surprising if the government did not attempt to reinstate the overall spending reduction that was the purpose of the reforms in the first place."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/276f442ef211d2dcafe06529728fa5fac21ed8c9/0_220_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33b5cdea1ecaa8a94b291fbdefd19af7","title":"share your experiences of netball","story":"Following New Zealand winning the Women’s Netball World Cup, we would like to hear your stories of playing the sportThe world of women and sport is rapidly changing.

The job spec for it depends on the particular dynamics of the team at that moment and the whims and preferences of the captain and coach. England have had three of the vice-captains in their Test team in the past 18 months: James Anderson, Jos Buttler, and, now, for the second-time around, Ben Stokes, who lost the job in the fall out from that brawl in Bristol.Anderson had it because he was the senior man and a steady pair of hands at a time when the team was in crisis Buttler because he is the brightest of the young batsmen and the man most likely to take over the captaincy of the one-day team when Eoin Morgan retires and Stokes because he is a talismanic player, “the real heartbeat of the team” was how Ricky Ponting put it this week and compared Stokes to Andrew Flintoff: “The guy they go to whenever they’re in trouble and they need something the guy Australia need to keep quiet if we’re going to win the series.”Now he is back acting as Joe Root’s right-hand man for the Ashes, with the explicit backing of every last member of ECB’s hierarchy, from the kitman up. England’s press release made a point of mentioning that the appointment had been endorsed by the director of cricket, Ashley Giles, the chief executive, Tom Harrison, and the chairman, Colin Graves. All Stokes needed to do was win them a World Cup.However, this promotion is less about rehabilitating Stokes than it is about acknowledging how much responsibility he has taken on for holding together this fragile England team. Like Ponting said: “It seems like he’s playing with a lot of maturity he doesn’t seem like he’s in much of a rush now as he might have been.”If you split his career into what happened before and after he was dropped by England, you can see the change reflected in his statistics. Beforehand, Stokes had a batting strike rate of 64 in Test cricket and 98 in the one-day game since he has come back, he has a strike rate of 46 in Test cricket and 87 in one‑day cricket. At the same time, his batting average has fallen from 36 to 29 in Tests, but risen from 35 to 54 in ODIs.He is a slower, steadier batsman now less threatening in attack, perhaps, but more formidable in defence. He has become a player who will turn his hand to whatever the team need him to do. Whether it is the 89 from 115 balls in that defeat against Australia in the group stages of the World Cup, when he came in with the score 26 for three in the sixth over. Or the 79 from 54 he clobbered in their very next game against India, his innings beginning when they were 207 for three in the 34th. Or even the eight off three balls he scored in the Super Over at the end of the final a week later.You can see that flexibility in his bowling too, where he has learned to take on very different roles for England’s Test and one-day teams. When he is playing with a white ball, Stokes tries to dry up the runs. Among the 71 fast bowlers who played in this World Cup, only three of them bowled as many cheap overs as Stokes did. He got through 50.5 at an economy rate of 4.83 each. Amazingly, he was not hit for a single six in the tournament, which is some turnaround for a man who once got walloped for four sixes in four consecutive balls in the last over of the World T20 final.Upshot is, he is taking fewer wickets with a white ball than he used to. But in Test cricket, where he his role is to make breakthroughs, his bowling is more penetrative than ever. He has taken 32 wickets at an average of 26 with a strike rate of 49 since he came back into the team, compared with the 95 at 34 and 60 he did in the years before.Whether all this adaptability means he is the best man to take over the team if Root goes down injured is another question, because it is surely asking a lot of him to bat, bowl and captain, too. England will be hoping they never have to find out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c2a8c36cc76d97205ff9d2a49b7de2fcaa80d90/918_414_2409_1445/master/2409.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb9e4087446260f1a12288e002294a35","title":"egan bernal set for tour de france title stage 20 report cycling","story":"In the thin, chilly air of Val Thorens ski station, Dave Brailsford might have allowed himself a wry smile as he watched his new Tour de France champion, Egan Bernal, and last year’s model, Geraint Thomas, embrace. Only six months ago, Brailsford was looking for a sponsor for his super team, and fighting to hang on to his big names, after Sky unexpectedly opted to end its relationship with cycling.Many doubted if Brailsford could keep his all-star team together, and if he could ever replace the big-money sponsorship that had led to accusations of him “buying” success in the Tour, no less than six times between 2012 and 2018. There were those too, who viewed him as damaged goods, in the aftermath of Team Sky’s flawed zero-tolerance policy, the fudged salbutamol investigation into Chris Froome and the damning verdict of a House of Commons select committee into anti-doping.Yet he now has bagged a seventh Tour. Despite the numerous criticisms, the loss of Chris Froome through injury, the huffing and puffing of the French, “Teflon Dave” has done it again. Brailsford’s ability to “reach into the toilet and pull out chocolate,” as rival manager Jonathan Vaughters once put it, has seen him through with a new sponsor and a new Tour de France champion – his team’s fourth since 2012 – in Bernal.The 22-year-old Colombian’s win was sealed at altitude in Val Thorens, after Julian Alaphilippe cracked and the Jumbo-Visma team’s best efforts to set up a last-ditch bid by Steven Kruijswijk to claw his way on to the podium finally dislodged the Frenchman.Bernal remained in a state of disbelief, even when presented with the yellow jersey for the second day running. “I’m really happy but when we arrive at the hotel and I’m alone, maybe only then I will believe it.”“It’s our first Tour, so you can imagine the reaction,” Bernal said when asked what it meant to his home nation. “I think it’s really important for us. I’m really proud to be the first Colombian to win the Tour.”The final mountain stage, truncated and missing two major climbs due to continuing severe weather and landslides in the Alps, in effect became a team time trial to the 2,365-metre ski station, while the final outcome boiled down to a heavyweight bout between the Tour’s best climbers.Best of the bunch was the 2014 Tour winner, Vincenzo Nibali — the only professional to interrupt Brailsford’s Tour dynasty. The Sicilian was the last aggressor from a large group that had attacked at the start of the stage, and rode into the final kilometres desperate to rescue an under-achieving Tour with a stage win.Brief accelerations from Simon Yates, Warren Barguil and Nairo Quintana threatened his lead but Nibali held on to notch his first Tour stage win since 2015. Behind him, Bernal, shepherded dutifully by Thomas, crossed the line, right fist raised in triumph, as the Welshman slapped him on the back.Alaphilippe’s hopes of a place on the Paris podium definitively unravelled with 13km still to race, fatigue combining with his limitations at altitude as he failed to stay with the pace set by the leading riders.“It would have been hard for me to do better,” said Alaphilippe , who slid down the standings to fifth overall. “I was waiting to ‘pop’ at any given moment, and I hung on pretty well. Without my team, I would have finished 15 minutes behind everyone. It’s my temperament to be like this, all or nothing.”A Colombian Tour champion has been long-awaited, with the country’s first major impact on the European scene being made as long ago as the 1980s through climbers such as Luis Herrera, Fabio Parra and Martín Ramírez. In recent years, the Colombian presence has been even stronger, with Nairo Quintana, winner of the 2014 Giro d’Italia and 2016 Vuelta a España, finishing second to Froome in the 2013 Tour.Both Quintana and Rigoberto Urán, runner-up to Froome in the 2017 Tour and second overall in the Giro in 2013 and 2014, have A-list status in Colombia. Such is Urán’s standing back home that during Brailsford’s search for a sponsor, the 32-year-old finessed a meeting for his former team manager with his nation’s President.At the start of this year, Brailsford returned fired up and enthused about the possibilities for Latin American cycling after his latest visit to Colombia. Bernal’s victory has kicked down a door that was already slightly ajar and that now opens up new territories for cycling, both in commercial and sporting terms.Bernal spearheads Brailsford’s youth policy, which also includes riders such as Tao Geoghegan Hart, Tom Pidcock, Pavel Sivakov, Eddie Dunbar and Iván Sosa, also Colombian. Meanwhile, the scramble to sign other young Colombians is gathering pace, with Sergio Higuita, snapped up recently by Vaughters for his Education First team, tipped for success.If Brailsford, his staff and his riders are to be praised for their resilience during a Tour dogged by crashes and ill-discipline through Luke Rowe’s disqualification, then there is little doubt that Bernal’s win ushers in a changing of the guard for the British team, with both Thomas and the injured Froome now entering the twilight of their careers.The outgoing champion maintains he is not finished yet, which might make next year’s Ineos team a little top heavy. Asked if he can win another Tour, Thomas said: “I think so. A lot of people probably don’t but that spurs me on. It’s disappointing that I didn’t win my second but it’s not about me today, it’s all about Egan. It was an incredible performance from him.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec39d92dc6d051c6900ee441ae2ef75c21fe5aac/0_8_1883_1130/master/1883.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5dc5491509bf1b2467e7b2af0fe34dc","title":"i almost lost it admits tour de france champion in waiting egan bernal","story":"• Colombian reflects on time-trial struggle• ‘He was born to go uphill fast’ says teammate Geraint ThomasEgan Bernal has admitted he came close to defeat after a disappointing time-trial performance on this year’s stage 13 time trial in Pau.“I almost lost it on that stage,” Bernal said after closing in on overall victory at Val Thorens, with only the final processional stage in Paris remaining. “I have to work very hard on the time trials but I lost a lot of time.”But the new Tour champion also acknowledged that, in what was called the highest Tour in history, his high-altitude background gave him what he described as “a bit of an advantage”.“I live in Colombia at 2,600 metres,” the 22-year-old said, “so when we are up high in the mountains I feel much better than in the first part of the climbs. I’m a climber and when we are going up, more and more, it’s better.

Others saw a heavyweight title fight, with two great boxers toe-to-toe. But the image that perhaps came into most minds after Enable’s narrow defeat of Crystal Ocean in the King George here on Saturdaywas Grundy’s epic duel with Bustino in the same race nearly half a century ago.That battle up the home straight has become embedded in the collective memory of racing fans, including many who were not even born in 1975, never mind at Ascot to see it for themselves. The latest King George will surely join it.“In all my career that’s probably the hardest-fought Group One I’ve ever had,” Frankie Dettori, Enable’s jockey, said. “Two great champions, the last two furlongs. It doesn’t come every day.”Dettori’s composure throughout the race, and above all when battle was joined in front of the grandstand, was remarkable. He used his whip only once during the half-minute or so in which Enable and Crystal Ocean fought out a compelling, unrelenting struggle for supremacy. At 48 he still has no equal as a big-race rider and he needed all of his experience to get Enable home at the end of a race that did not unfold in her favour.Dettori and Enable were drawn widest of all in stall 11 and then caught four wide in the early stages. He was forced to drop back to get closer to the rail, conceding ground to Crystal Ocean and James Doyle as he did so.Doyle had a perfect trip on Crystal Ocean and appeared to be going slightly better than the 8-15 favourite on the turn for home. Dettori then made rapid ground in the straight to draw alongside Crystal Ocean, a big move that left Gosden concerned that Enable was in front too early.“There was a lot of guts,” Gosden said. “He had a nicer position and a better draw and correctly saved his ground, but she said no, I’m going to win this race.“So much of this is mental strength in horses and they showed it today, both of them. They outclassed the whole field.“I just thought we hit the front too soon quite frankly but the great jockey will tell me why he had to move then and, of course, I’ll always agree.”“Then James was sitting pretty going really well, so I jumped on him and made a race of it, and I probably took him by surprise. Then he was fighting back and the gloves were off.“In fairness he served it up to me and we had a right titanic battle. I always had the edge but it was one of those flies that wasn’t going away. He was there and annoying me to the line.”Crystal Ocean was conceding a 3lb mares’ allowance to Enable and also emerged from the race with huge credit, having contributed so much to an unforgettable spectacle. He is also, on official figures, still the world’s top-rated racehorse.But Enable is the sport’s biggest star and will now attempt to extend what is already an 11-race winning streak until she retires to begin a new life as a broodmare at the end of the season.Whether her hard race on Saturday will make that any easier is arguable. A couple of bookmakers extended her odds for an unprecedented third consecutive success in the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe in October, and that could yet be her next – and final – start if Gosden feels she needs time to recover from her latest exertions. “Maybe we go straight to the Arc, I don’t know,” Gosden said. “She goes well fresh, why not?”The alternative is a trip to York’s Ebor meeting next month before she returns to France, for either the Yorkshire Oaks – which she won in 2017 – or the International Stakes, which is sponsored by Juddmonte Farms, the breeding operation of her owner, Prince Khalid Abdullah.“She is extraordinary and she really surprised me,” Dettori said. “She’s an amazing horse in every way: ability, courageous, uncomplicated.“I love her, I ride her twice a week. She’s special, she gives me emotion that no other horse has given me in my life and she’s only with me for another three months, so I’m trying to enjoy every moment. You will probably only see her two more times, at York and the Arc, so let’s enjoy her. She’s a superstar.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/853426eb12b406207380a61891d9914a7ce85b0c/50_128_3860_2316/master/3860.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8da654a2d37f5bf4d9555ab4269ce4e","title":"lewis hamilton german grand prix f1","story":"• Briton dominates as Ferrari suffer mechanical failures• Max Verstappen qualifies second, Valtteri Bottas thirdIf one failure was clearly unpalatable, a second in quick succession by Ferrari in qualifying for the German Grand Prix must have left the team sick to the very stomach. Lewis Hamilton was on pole but every eye was on the Ferrari garage where ashen-faced team members stood, impotent around the machinery that had defeated them.At Hockenheim Sebastian Vettel managed only a single lap and his teammate Charles Leclerc could not set a time in Q3, leaving Ferrari facing another calamitous setback in a season beset by problems.The weekend that had begun with such promise for the Scuderia, who have still yet to win a race this season, simply fell apart in less than an hour. Two separate mechanical failures dumping them out of qualifying.Vettel’s car suffered a problem with the airflow to the turbo in Q1 and although the mechanics tried to work on it they could not put the car out after a single installation lap and he was unable to set a time. He will start from the back of the grid. “It’s bitter for us,” Vettel said. “The car feels great and we have missed a big opportunity here.”Worse followed. Leclerc had been on point in pace all weekend and had looked to be the man to beat. Then as the moment came for him to put it all together when it mattered, his car too let him down. Despite mechanics furiously working on it they eventually had to concede defeat to a fuel system issue. There was dejection and clearly not a little disbelief as he climbed resignedly from the cockpit. Having not set a time in the final session he will start from 10th.“Ferrari have an illness that they need to cure and we need them to have a competitive championship,” was the damning verdict of Mercedes’ head of motorsport Toto Wolff.It is perhaps a nadir for Ferrari this season and brings even more pressure to bear on the team principal, Mattia Binotto. This year their car has failed to match Mercedes for pace, a hindrance exacerbated by driver errors, mechanical failures and operational mistakes. They have had opportunities to win in Bahrain, Baku, Canada and Austria but failed to convert them. In Germany every indication was that they were at very least a match for Mercedes if not superior. The current formula has been defined by the often bullet-proof reliability of the cars, a field in which Mercedes have excelled and Ferrari been found wanting. That it should happen when they had a strong shot at pole will be doubly galling.“It is a shame but we will try to understand what happened to not reproduce it,” Leclerc said with some stoicism. “I felt great in the car and the car felt great. Today and all weekend. It is shame it ends up like this.”He did however soundly beat Red Bull’s Max Verstappen, who was second and his Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas, who was third. Hamilton has always enjoyed the challenge from Ferrari and acknowledged that F1 itself needed the Scuderia to perform.“It’s not just unfortunate what happened to Ferrari today, but unfortunate for the sport too because it was building up to be a really exciting qualifying session,” he said.The British driver grasped his chance, as he has done repeatedly this season. He set the quickest time on his first hot run in Q3 with a time of 1min 11.704sec. It proved to be enough. Neither he nor any of the other drivers could better it on their second runs. The lap was superb, a full four-tenths clear of Verstappen, the only question it left was whether it would have been good enough to deny Ferrari. Hamilton however will not be overly concerned with what-ifs. He believed it would have been competitive but what mattered was that he once again ruthlessly took his opportunity.Hamilton and Mercedes had expected their car to struggle somewhat in the high temperatures in Germany, as it had in Austria. In practice Ferrari had the advantage, even in the cooler temperatures of Saturday. Since the circuit was curtailed from the layout of grand straights disappearing into the forest it presents a far more technical challenge.That Ferrari could match and potentially beat Mercedes here was encouraging for the Scuderia but they could not make it count. The spotlight will now fall firmly on Binotto, an honourable, personable and honest man who has been a welcome breath of fresh air at Ferrari. He has taken every setback thus far on the chin but recovering from this will require the very sternest of constitutions.Elsewhere in qualifying, Pierre Gasly was in fourth for Red Bull, with Kimi Räikkönen in fifth for Alfa Romeo. Romain Grosjean was in sixth for Haas, with Carlos Sainz in seventh for McLaren. Sergio Pérez was in eighth for Racing Point with Nico Hülkenberg in ninth for Renault.Antonio Giovinazzi was 11th in front of the Haas of Kevin Magnussen and the Renault of Daniel Ricciardo. Daniil Kvyat was in 14th for Toro Rosso with Lance Stroll in 15th for Racing Point.McLaren’s Lando Norris went out in Q1 in 16th, with Toro Rosso’s Alexander Albon 17th. Williams brought their first major aero upgrade of the season to Hockenheim and the team were pleased with the results although George Russell and Robert Kubica remained at the back of the grid in 18th and 19th."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a42494511ec1444fb045a8888c082391fbeef831/401_651_4316_2589/master/4316.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69c11d827e55f5f57727b72f44a084ac","title":"tour de france diary","story":"Foix likes the press and the press really likes Foix.

After the team’s rest day press conference, held thankfully in air-conditioned splendour, I walk back to the car only to find the gates of the hotel car park I’d hurriedly parked in, firmly locked. Luckily, a resident is drying his smalls on the windowsill and, after some begging, yells down the code for the gate. I punch in the digits, dash to the car and then yelp in pain as I burn my hands on the steering wheel.My hotel has a pool, and after six hours working in a sweltering gymnasium on the Nîmes Peripherique, the cool, blue waters beckon. But it also has a significant crew of the chiselled kids from the race’s publicity caravan camped out in the loungers and e-bombing each other, making it look like the Tour’s equivalent of Love Island. After a moment’s hesitation, I reluctantly turn on my heel and opt for iced rosé instead.The sun hammers down on the start village at Pont du Gard, a stone’s throw from the village renowned as the hottest place in France. A digital display at a local chemist reads 43 degrees and the mountain of drained single-use plastic rolling around on the back seat of the car grows by the hour. At the finish line in Gap, there’s a welcome breath of fresh air, but as the peloton wilts on the hills of the Vaucluse and Drome, tempers fray and Luke Rowe and Tony Martin are given straight reds.The weather is changing and so, it seems, is the race. Julian Alaphilippe is finally reaching his limits near the top of the Galibier climb, as Bernal and Thomas lead the accelerations over the summit. Perhaps this is where the dream ends and French cycling resumes its normal status as also-rans. But non – ‘Super’ Julian flies down the mountain, narrowly avoiding ending up in the kitchenettes of camper vans and motorhomes, and then reels his rivals in, as if they’re overladen cyclo-tourists pootling their way to a camp site.D-Day for the Tour de France’s crowded overall classification. Finally, Bernal shows his true colours, leaving the other contenders for dead on the huge ascent of the Iseran. But as soon as he crests the summit, the race is over as landslides flow across the route, making it impassable. Thibaut Pinot is back at home and Alaphilippe is no longer in yellow. The peloton race on to Val Thorens, more out of duty than expectation. What happened to the sky-scraping, cliffhanging finale of the ‘highest Tour in history’?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/464a5ed729f2642993819e7e09994dfc35e99567/0_749_5425_3255/master/5425.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bae8eede79a0bf88802e95dcd6cb193c","title":"tour de france fans in pictures","story":"As the Tour de France nears a thrilling close, we look at the cycling fans who have lined the roadside from Brussels to the Alps"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/201ace3264e351852ddc37b2caf8d221e226139c/0_183_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f854a9ea52e0562728cd544bf21105b3","title":"whisky business how do you drink yours","story":"For too long a snobbery has lingered over how best to consume whisky. Can there really be a right – or wrong – way to enjoy your favourite malt?It can often seem as if there are only two schools of thought when it comes to how you should enjoy your whisky. Some treat the drink with an almost austere reverence, insisting that it should only be taken neat or with just a touch of water – maybe, at a pinch, with an ice cube or two. Others, which in reality means most people who enjoy a tipple every now and then, are happy to mix it to taste with whatever works for them, use it as a base for a cocktail, or simply sip it from a mighty tumbler towering with ice.But is there a right way to drink whisky? It might be that you can do whatever you want with the house blend down at your local pub, but what about something more refined – in other words, what about a single malt?For the uninitiated, the distinction between a blend and a single malt is a fairly easy one to mark out. A scotch blend is simply a mixture of grain and malt whiskies from two or more distilleries. A single malt, on the other hand, is nothing more and nothing less than a whisky from a single distillery, bottled and sold as a whisky from a single distillery.But, of course, things are always a little more complicated than that. Blends are sometimes thought to be inferior to their single malt cousins, and while this is by no means a settled question, it is true that they don’t quite inspire the same scholarly devotion as single malts. So, while plenty of whisky purists may have no problem with you topping up an inexpensive blend with a yard of Coke, they’re likely to take a less charitable view of you doing the same with their favourite malt.Luckily, there is an answer to all of this.“It really just depends on what you’re looking for,” says Kirstie McCallum, senior blender at Distell International, which owns and produces Tobermory. “For me there’s a real difference between wanting to sit there and appreciate a whisky for all its flavours and complexity, and just actually wanting to sit there and enjoy a drink with friends.“If I want to appreciate all the flavours in a whisky and appreciate that maturation and the work that’s gone into it I love it with just a wee touch of water to open it up,” she says. “Then just sip it, let it rest in your mouth a bit so that you get a proper chance to take in all of the flavours. At the same time, if you’re just sitting around having a drink with your friends, do whatever you want with it.”McCallum’s refreshingly unpretentious take is rooted in her view that whisky – and that includes single malts – is on the whole a social, relaxed drink. That means there is plenty of room at the table both for those who want to contemplate their whisky – either neat or, as she prefers it, with a touch of water – and those who want to let their hair down a bit more.“I think for too long whisky has been seen as kind of standoffish,” she says. “There’s always been this view of whisky that it’s maybe a bit like how people see wine – they worry about not knowing what to ask for or about getting it wrong somehow. But whisky shouldn’t be like that at all, because it’s a drink for everybody.“We make the whisky for people to drink it, and whatever you like adding to it, as long as you enjoy it that’s how you should drink it,” says McCallum. “The great thing is that whisky is just such a versatile drink. You can do cocktails with whisky, you can do long drinks, or you can have a nice single malt with water.”With that in mind, McCallum suggests a number of tantalising options for enjoying Tobermory 12 Year Old. “I think with Tobermory being such a citrusy, caramelly, kind of sweet whisky, it mixes well with something that’s nice and light and fresh,” she says.“It works really well as a long mixed drink with lots of ice. I’d recommend trying it that way with either ginger ale or some fresh apple juice,” she says.On the cocktail front, McCallum says that the citrus and caramel notes of Tobermory 12 Year Old are particularly complemented by berry flavours – so a Scotch bramble, or perhaps a malt old fashioned with a blueberry garnish, could be well worth trying.“For me, whisky is a very personal drink,” she says. “I drink my whisky and it’s about memories of being places and being with friends – it’s not about ‘you can’t do this and you can’t do that’. In the end, it’s about enjoying it on your own terms – do whatever you want with it.”To learn more about the art of the Hebridean distillers visit tobermorydistillery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ea4ed20e17d81318b9e77bfc42026a3815502bc/36_367_1869_1121/master/1869.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00499578fd49811cdb109617ac66a56e","title":"francisco galicia us mexico immigration border","story":"Francisco Galicia and his mother are speaking out on the inhumane conditions they say he endured while detainedA mother and her American-born teenage son are suing two US government agencies and speaking out over the inhumane conditions they said he endured while taken into border custody for more than three weeks.Francisco Galicia, 18, from Edinburg, Texas, was released from detention earlier this week after an ordeal in which he said he lost 26 pounds, was kept in a crowded space with 60 others and, for 23 days, wasn’t allowed to call his family or a lawyer, brush his teeth, or get access to a toilet, shower or bed.He was so desperate in the face of the conditions, and unable to communicate with anyone outside, that he almost allowed himself to be deported to Mexico, as first reported by the Dallas Morning News.And his mother, Sanjuana Galicia, might not have found out where he was if it weren’t for his younger brother, 17-year-old Marlon, who is undocumented and who agreed to be swiftly deported to Mexico, from where he called his mother to tell her what had happened.“We’re conflicted,” Sanjuana Galicia, a single parent, told the  in a phone interview on Thursday night from her home in Edinburg, close to the border town of McAllen. “Overjoyed that Francisco is home, but half our heart is in Mexico. We talk to Marlon every day, but we want him here at home.”Francisco was kept in custody, variously, by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) after going through a federal checkpoint 75 miles from the US-Mexico border in Texas, in Falfurrias, while driving to a soccer scouting event.When he presented his state-issued identification, a wallet-sized copy of his birth certificate and his social security card, they were rejected by agents, the family said.She added: “They wanted to psychologically intimidate him to the point he’d sign his own deportation order. We’re suing over the abuse my son endured.”They are now desperate to try to get Marlon back across the border, as he is in Reynosa, Mexico, a city where many locals live in fear of the drug cartels.“He’s my best friend. We went everywhere together,” Francisco Galicia said. “All my friends are so used to always seeing us together, even they think it’s unnatural for us to be separated. If they’re saddened, imagine how my mom and I feel.”Francisco was freed this week from the South Texas detention complex in Pearsall, near San Antonio, amid pressure from friends and advocates in a campaign that spread via social and mainstream media.His attorney, Claudia Galan, believes Francisco was a victim of racial profiling. The lawyer is now working on getting Marlon back to the US. He has found his way to his grandmother, who lives in Reynosa, across the US-Mexico border from McAllen.“I’m so worried. It’s one of the most dangerous parts of Mexico. That’s why I left. To escape the violence and presence of the drug cartel,” said Sanjuana Galicia.She said the brothers are so close they are like twins.“There are times when we’re overcome with immense sadness. We both cry over it,” she said.Francisco Galicia is an avid soccer player and said he is an aspiring businessman who dreams of attending college. He was born in Dallas in 2000.When detained by border patrol almost a month ago, Francisco, Marlon and some friends were en route to visit with coaches at Ranger College, near Fort Worth, with aspirations to land a soccer scholarship. But the group was detained at a checkpoint in Falfurrias.Galan said she suspects her client was taken into custody despite providing a copy of his birth certificate because another document, a tourist visa his mother had obtained for him in the past, said incorrectly that he was born in Mexico.The documentation mix-up does not justify the time Francisco was kept in custody, nor the way he was treated, Galan said.“Law enforcement said his birth certificate was fake. That he was not born in the US, The way he was interrogated and harassed, it’s a scare tactic that shouldn’t be allowed in law enforcement at all,” Galan said.Ice did not respond to requests for comment. CBP has asserted that Galicia didn’t claim US citizenship.“We really need Congress to demand oversight and accountability for law enforcement, especially in Ice and border patrol,” Galan said. She said Galicia’s case isn’t unique. She cited US citizen Julio Cesar Ovalle, of San Antonio, who was deported to Mexico, where he was kidnapped and later freed with assistance from US authorities.“If you’re not white, you can pretty much be deported even if you’re a US citizen,” Galan said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9808512f70b7ddba2b4c82747ae6b4ce29f3628/0_227_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e998aa660046fc02785d90dc6af58d4","title":"jeffrey epstein 2008 documents secret","story":"Court grants prosecutors’ request amid concern that releasing materials could hinder investigation of financier’s associatesA judge in New York has granted a request from prosecutors to keep secret documents relating to Jeffrey Epstein’s controversial 2008 sexual abuse plea deal, on the grounds that the materials could hamper their investigation of others in the financier’s milieu.The documents, which will be shared with Epstein’s attorneys, are believed to concern not only the deal itself, which allowed Epstein to plead guilty to low-level state solicitation charges, but also a clause that granted immunity to any and all potential co-conspirators and named four women suspected of facilitating or participating in alleged crimes against minors.The documents may also shed light on the 2008 deal, which was kept secret from accusers for nearly a year in what some claim was a violation of the Crime Victims’ Rights Act. Controversy over the deal forced the resignation earlier this month of the US labor secretary, Alex Acosta, who was US attorney in Miami at the time.The order is only one of several signals that prosecutors plan to widen their investigation into what they allege was a years-long scheme to recruit and sexually abuse dozens of girls.Epstein, denied bail and remaining in custody pending trial, has pleaded not guilty to federal sex-trafficking charges. He is on suicide watch in a Manhattan detention facility, after being found unconscious with marks on his neck.On Friday, it was revealed that pilots of Epstein’s private jets, including a Boeing 727 that carried high-profile friends to and from his home in the Virgin Islands, have been served with subpoenas.According to court filings, the pilots were responsible for keeping flight logs of passengers on the jets. Their testimony could be used by prosecutors to corroborate accusers’ accounts and provide details of Epstein associates.Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew, who was named in a civil suit brought by Epstein accuser Victoria Giuffre in 2003, are regularly named among associates of Epstein.Clinton has denied flying with the financier as many as 26 times, as has been reported, although he did say he took “a total of four trips” with him in 2002 and 2003.In a statement, the former president said he “knows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago, or those with which he has been recently charged in New York”.Buckingham Palace has repeatedly denied the accusations against Prince Andrew.In 2015, Giuffre brought a defamation suit against Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late press baron Robert Maxwell, for publicly calling Giuffre a liar after she claimed Maxwell participated with Epstein in sexually abusing her for two years starting in 2000, when she was 16 years old.This month, Maxwell, who has long denied allegations that she played a central role in the procuring of young women, told a three-judge panel in New York a media “feeding frenzy” justified keeping documents from the defamation suit secret.But Josh Schiller, one of Giuffre’s lawyers, argued: “There is an overwhelming public interest both in getting access to these documents as well as the indictment of Mr Epstein and his prosecution.”The judicial panel agreed. As soon as next week, 2,000 pages of documents relating to that case, which was settled in 2017, will be made public.In its ruling, the panel said the documents included descriptions of alleged abuse by Epstein and other iniduals “including numerous prominent American politicians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a well-known prime minister, and other world leaders”.In April, Giuffre filed a defamation suit against the Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, Epstein’s longtime lawyer and friend, after he denied her claim that he abused her.The shockwaves from Epstein’s arrest on 6 July could travel further still. Central to the mystery of his operations is how he acquired his wealth, which was listed at his bail hearing as more than $550m.Last week, Deutsche Bank confirmed that Epstein moved millions of dollars through dozens of private accounts. Executives said they had believed they had severed the relationship with Epstein but had discovered accounts still controlled by him as recently as June.“Deutsche Bank is closely examining any business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, and we are absolutely committed to cooperating with all relevant authorities,” a spokesman said.Authorities in Florida, meanwhile, have launched an investigation into whether Epstein was properly monitored during the 13-month sentence for soliciting prostitution from underage girls that was the product of the controversial 2008 deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4440ffcd6c94dc3d6249264d623cae5063253a7e/0_115_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52b318d0ecafe1b3e101112cd1b7d4d8","title":"morbidly sensible adulting no way getting life insurance is empowering","story":"Does the thought of tackling life insurance send you into a slumber? Here’s why it could be worth giving it another shot …TV, takeaways and, erm, life insurance – I know which I’d rather commit to tonight when I get home. Admittedly, insurance isn’t exactly the sexiest of weeknight propositions, so it’s hardly any wonder so many of us choose to bury our heads in the proverbial sand when it comes to facing it. But before you fall into a slumber deeper than Snow White on a hangover, let me tell you why it might be worth giving it five minutes of your time (it won’t take any longer than that, promise).You see, life insurance is one of those things that makes perfect sense on paper - the kind of task you wonder why you didn’t get round to sorting once you realise what it actually involves (before swiftly ignoring it again for another six months, if you’re anything like me). I mean, think about it, how many important things have you taken the time to insure in your lifetime? I can name several - a car, the odd holiday, my home and a smartphone (or six). So why is it we’re neglecting to insure the most important thing of all?A quick straw poll of my friends reveals the many reasons we don’t. Some figure that not having children, a partner, or owning a home, means they don’t need it – they reason there’s no point spending money on something they don’t actually need yet. But if either of those things could plausibly happen in the near future, it might be worth planning ahead (after all, you’ll have more pressing things to worry about once any #wedmin kicks in, and doing it sooner likely means lower monthly payments, too). It’s also worth asking whether any dependants or loved ones would be financially stable without you, since life insurance could take care of that (something not many of us like to think about, granted).Life insurance could also be very useful for anybody jointly responsible for mortgage payments. What happens if one person dies before the mortgage is paid (nope, not a fun discussion but an important one)? Experts flag that we shouldn’t assume death-in-service cover or life insurance via your employer means we don’t need to worry about life insurance, either, unfortunately. While useful, workplace cover tends to pay out benefits as a multiple of salary (eg four-years’ salary) to ensure your family has cash available to make up for the loss of your salary to maintain their lifestyle it may not cover any large financial commitments, such as a mortgage.What are the available options? Well, Aviva offers three types of life insurance: cover that remains the same, and so do the payments cover and premiums that increase over time and cover that decreases.For the latter, the value of the cover goes down each month, but your regular payments stay the same. People usually use this product to cover a repayment mortgage, which also decreases.If you’re looking to help cover your salary and maintain loved ones’ living standards or to settle your mortgage and provide reassurance – then you may want to go for the same level, or increasing if you want some protection against the effects of inflation. Still with me? Good.The best part is there’s minimal legwork – most customers could get a quote and decision in just over five minutes (reading this is probably the most arduous part, sorry) and it might be cheaper than you think, with policies starting at around £5 a month. So we could all start protecting our loved ones immediately.Pretty awesome, right? And probably much smarter than putting it off until your next birthday, and spending more when we do bite the bullet (since policies tend to get more expensive the older you are). Making that decision suddenly feels like a no-brainer to me – what about you? Then we can all get back to that boxset and tikka masala …For more information, visit avivalife"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28a6de2c76afec46909b7f9ff0bd41427a6531b1/90_0_1243_746/master/1243.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7991f32e914f3eff55daa259ca2576db","title":"canada hunt military join search as suspects mother pleads for safe ending","story":"Police being given military air support as authorities scour areas of Manitoba for teenage murder suspectsCanada’s armed forces have been drafted in to provide air support as police go door to door in the search for two teenagers suspected in three killings in the country’s remote wilderness.Authorities have urged “all Canadians” to be on the lookout for 19-year-old Kam McLeod and 18-year-old Bryer Schmegelsky, after the fatal shooting of a tourist couple – American woman Chynna Deese, 24, and her Australian boyfriend Lucas Fowler, 23 –\u0026nbspand the murder of Vancouver professor Leonard Dyck, 64.As the hunt continued, Deborah Sweeney, Schmegelsky’s mother, pleaded for him to come home safe, in a note dated 25 July handed to local media. “Bryer is a caring, loving boy, that would never hurt anyone,” she wrote. “He grew up in a loving home. We miss and love him dearly. We want both boys to come home safe.”Canadian police said on Friday they would scour two communities in Manitoba over the next three days, but Corporal Julie Courchaine said officials were “open to the possibility” that the suspects could have inadvertently been given assistance in leaving the Gillam and Fox Lake areas of Manitoba. They may have altered their appearance and someone could have inadvertently helped them leave the area, said Courchaine. “It is possible that someone may not have been aware of who they were providing assistance to, and may now be hesitant to come forward,” she said at a police update in Winnipeg. No cars had been reported stolen, she added.Canadian public safety minister Ralph Goodale said the military had now been called in to give police air support during their hunt for the young men.Gillam is more than 2,000 miles from northern British Columbia, where the three people were found slain in two places last week. McLeod and Schmegelsky have been charged with second-degree murder in Dyck’s death, whose body was discovered five days after Deese and Fowler were found shot dead.McLeod and Schmegelsky themselves had originally been considered missing persons and only became suspects in the case on Tuesday.Police also released surveillance video of McLeod and Schmegelsky as they walked through a store in the neighboring province of Saskatchewan. Schmegelsky is dressed in army fatigues.Schmegelsky’s father, Alan Schmegelsky, said on Wednesday he expected the nationwide manhunt to end in the death of his son, who he said is on “a suicide mission”.The separate discoveries of three bodies and burning cars have shaken rural northern British Columbia and rural Manitoba.During the investigation in British Columbia, police found Dyck’s body roughly a mile from the first burned-out vehicle.That was about 300 miles from the spot along the Alaska Highway near Liard Hot Springs where Deese and Fowler were found, over a week ago.Fowler, the son of a chief inspector with the New South Wales police, was living in British Columbia and Deese was visiting him.Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c8dd04fb26e30236516f8621a1ef8e8121db56f/568_615_3552_2132/master/3552.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af7259360b066139fa6e0b4c3e8f2d7b","title":"hong kong yuen long fresh clashes triads","story":"Activists defy police ban to stage protest at site of last weekend’s violent clashA peaceful march in the town of Yuen Long to condemn an attack by suspected gang members on commuters turned violent as Hong Kong riot police fired teargas and rubber bullets on the crowd and used batons to beat protesters.Almost 300,000 protesters and residents on Saturday afternoon defied a police ban to descend on the town in Hong Kong’s western New Territories. They marched to the mass transit station where masked men in white T-shirts had chased and beaten passengers the previous Sunday.By evening, the march had turned tense as demonstrators pushed close to villages surrounding the town, where some of the triads believed to be behind the attack are based. Police shouted warnings through loudhailers telling people they were involved in illegal gatherings and ordering them to leave immediately.After hours of standoffs near two of the villages, police fired volleys of teargas at protesters, who tossed some of the canisters back. Police also appeared to fire tear gas and rubber bullets at journalists.The protesters – many of whom were wearing black T-shirts and hard hats and were armed with shields made from boards of wood and surfboards, as well as hiking sticks – retaliated by throwing umbrellas and water bottles. Others hurled rocks and bottles at the police. Demonstrators dismantled roadside barriers and built makeshift barricades between them and the police.Most demonstrators left by about 7pm as news spread that police had deployed a special tactical squad to clear the streets and protesters saw reinforcements arriving, hemming them in.Hundreds of protesters remained, however, and continued to face off with the police late into the night, regrouping in the Yuen Long train station and along the main road.In one episode that protesters and critics have begun comparing to the attack on passengers in Yuen Long last week, a special tactical unit rushed into the train station where protesters had gathered, some getting ready to go home. The police fired tear gas and pepper spray on them, while beating some with batons.“The police rushed in without any warning. They were hitting and hitting, they were beating protesters and regular people continuously for at least 20 seconds,” said Mathew Lam, 18, who said he had seen five people injured.Protesters tried to use a fire extinguisher to push back the police. At least one protester was pushed to the ground, bleeding. Blood smears could be seen on the floor in the station lobby.“It was terrible … it was the same as what happened last week in Yuen Long station,” said Stephy Chan, 19, who was in the station at the time. “Last week it was the men in white. This time it was the police,” she said.Hong Kong’s hospital authority said 17 people had been hospitalised following the clashes, including two who were in serious condition.Earlier, a group of protesters had smashed the windows of a Lexus near the train station after spotting wooden rods similar to those used against passengers last Sunday, leaving fliers criticising the police on the bonnet.The Hong Kong government said in a statement in the early hours of Sunday that protesters had also vandalised a police carand hadblocked roads. The government said it “strongly condemned the protesters for breaching the public peace and breaking the law deliberately”.“The police will take serious follow-up actions with those violent protesters,” it said.The police had issued a statement earlier on Saturday reminding protesters that they were participating in an “unauthorised assembly” and could be punished with up to five years in prison. Amnesty International condemned the police’s response to protesters.. Man-kei Tam, director of Amnesty International Hong Kong said: “There were repeated instances today where police officers were the aggressors beating retreating protesters, attacking civilians in the train station and targeting journalists.”He added: “Such a heavy-handed response now appears the modus operandi for Hong Kong police and we urge them to quickly change course.”Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous region of China, is facing its worst political crisis in decades. The protests, which began over a controversial extradition bill, have evolved to take in other demands, including a police inquiry into the violence in Yuen Long last week.Residents, activists and opposition lawmakers have accused the government and police of colluding with the triads in an attempt to suppress protests, a charge vehemently denied by Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam.Those attending the rally on Saturday said they were not there to make political demands, but to speak out against violence. Protesters surrounded the police headquarters chanting: “Black police” – a reference to the triads, known in Chinese as “black societies”.“It’s not so much about democracy as it is about trust,” said Fong, 30. “If every Hongkonger chooses to stay at home, then we will surely die … This is the way Hongkongers show their trust to each other – by showing up and standing up for each other.”The attack in Yuen Long and the response by authorities have added fuel to the protest movement, with rallies planned for Sunday and threatened “industrial action” from civil servants and other groups.Observers say the escalated tensions also raise the likelihood that Beijing will push the Hong Kong government to take a harder line on the protesters. In a rare move, police denied the demonstrators’ application for the rally on Saturday in Yuen Long.Authorities also rejected a request to hold one on Sunday in Sheung Wan, near where police fired teargas and rubber bullets on demonstrators who had defaced China’s representative office in Hong Kong.Protesters have vowed to hold the rallies anyway and to continue the movement. Max Chung, who helped organise the rally on Saturday, said he believed residents had shown their resolve: “Hongkongers have stiffened their backs to say no to authoritarianism.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd59b4889ac664f9342d37885d4728302142791e/0_0_669_401/master/669.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e59a97345bd17f8d598b682e435b9ae","title":"iran tanker standoff tehran releases nine crew of mt riah vessel","story":"India urges Tehran to release remaining three crew of tanker seized on 13 July amid Middle East tensionsIran has freed nine of 12 Indian crew members of MT Riah, a Panama-flagged tanker it seized this month as part of a growing diplomatic crisis in the Middle East, the Indian foreign ministry said on Saturday.The MT Riah was detained by the Iranian coastguard on 13 July, with 12 Indian crew members on board, the Indian foreign ministry said, and appealed for the release of the remaining crew. No reason has been provided as to why the three are being held.“Nine crew members have been released and they will be on their way to India soon,” foreign ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar said. “Our mission in Iran has requested the release of remaining crew members from the Iranian authorities concerned.”Dozens of Indian sailors on ships in the Gulf have been caught up in rising tensions between Iran and the west.Iranian state TV aired footage of the vessel a few days after it was seized, saying it had been detained by Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards for smuggling fuel.Indian and Iranian authorities said this week Iran had granted India consular access to 18 Indian crew seized on another ship, the British-flagged Stena Impero, that Iran seized in the Strait of Hormuz on 19 July.The seizure of the British tanker in the world’s most important waterway for the oil trade has deepened a crisis between Iran and the west that was triggered in May when the US tightened sanctions, in effect barring all countries from buying Iranian oil.Iran said it had seized the Stena Impero because it had collided with a fishing boat.India’s junior foreign minister, V Muraleedharan, said India was pushing for the release of the Indian crew on the British vessel.India has had longstanding political and energy ties with Iran, but it has cut all its oil supplies because of US sanctions.

Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDUP Brexit spokesman  Sammy Wilson pictured  at a ‘Leave Means Rally’ in Bournemouth, England last October. Photograph: Matt CardyGetty ImagesThe DUP has accused the Government of being “hysterical”, self-centred and overplaying its hand on Brexit.In a statement on Saturday, DUP East Antrim MP and Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson strongly criticised comments made by Tánaiste Simon Coveney at Stormont on Friday.Mr Coveney had said new British prime minister Boris Johnson’s approach to Brexit was “very unhelpful” and had put the UK on “a collision course” with Ireland and the EU.“Only he can answer the question as to why he is doing that,” the Minister for Foreign Affairs added. “It has been made very clear from the Taoiseach, from Michel Barnier, from presidents Tusk and Juncker that the approach that the British prime minister seems now to be taking is not going to be the basis for an agreement. And that is worrying for everybody.”In response, Mr Wilson said: “The hysterical and self-centred response from the Irish government to the reasonable demands of the prime minister to have the backstop removed from any exit deal from the European Union speaks volumes.”Mr Wilson said the “megaphone reaction” demonstrated “blatant attempts by Leo Varadkar and Co to use the Irish border as a means of undermining Britain’s referendum has backed fired on them and they know it”.He said: “The Irish Government walked the world stage and styled themselves as the victims of British aggression. ‘Poor little Ireland’ may have worked in the past but people are growing tired of the same old tune.”“The game is up. They have overplayed their hand and they need to change course.”He believes instead of “pandering to Ireland’s grumbles” the UK should make clear if there is a no deal Brexit it would impose tariffs on Irish goods if Ireland is going to impose tariffs on UK goods.He said it was clear if Ireland believes tariffs can be collected on goods travelling from the North to the Republic on the Border, there is “absolutely no reason why the taxes can’t be collected on the other side without disrupting trade flows or requiring physical infrastructure”.“It’s very obvious that a deal which avoids the backstop is possible,” he added.“Ireland’s own admission that it will not be imposing a physical infrastructure in the event of no deal, demonstrates there is no chance of a hard border being required or even happening.“If there is any side which is to set itself on a collision course it is the EU and the Irish.”He believes Mr Johnson “must stick to his commitment to leaving on the 31st October, it’s his best chance of getting a touch of reality in Brussels and Dublin”.The DUP MPs said he would also be “enquiring as to who gave the Irish Foreign Minister access and permission to use Parliament Buildings for a press conference to attack the UK prime minister. If courtesies are going to be disrespected, then the matter will have to be carefully looked at”.Mr Wilson did not address Mr Varadkar’s comments on Friday in Co Donegal that a hard Brexit would raise the issue of Irish reunification.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Jessica TaylorUK ParliamentAFPGetty ImagesLeader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg has issued a set of rules for staff in his office to follow, including a list of banned words and a requirement to use imperial measurements.Mr Rees-Mogg, who was brought into the government by Boris Johnson on Wednesday, wasted little time in issuing the guidance to staff.According to the style guide obtained by ITV News, Mr Rees-Mogg insists that all non-titled males are given the suffix Esq - short for Esquire - and says words including “ongoing” and “hopefully” are banned.In a call for accuracy, he tells staff: “CHECK your work.”The guidance was drawn up by Mr Rees-Mogg’s North East Somerset constituency team some years ago, but has now been shared with officials in his new office.Other directions include a call for a double space after full stops and no comma after the word “and”.He also set out a series of banned words and phrases that should not be used by his staff.They include: very, due to, unacceptable, equal, yourself, lot, got, speculate, meet with, ascertain and disappointment.Staff should avoid “too many ‘Is’” in their writing, Mr Rees-Mogg will not be “pleased to learn” anything, he will not “noteunderstand your concerns” nor will he “invest (in schools etc)”, and the phrase “no longer fit for purpose” has been deemed no longer fit for purpose.As chair of the European Research Group - an influential, hard-Brexit Conservative backbench grouping - Mr Rees-Mogg has increased his influence in Westminster in recent years.The official transcript of parliamentary proceedings, Hansard, records more than 700 instances of Mr Rees-Mogg using one or other of the banned words or phrases.He is an Old Etonian, like the prime minister he serves, and, like the prime minister he serves, has cultivated a reputation for formality and upper-class eccentricity, gaining the nickname the “honourable member for the 18th century”.When standing for the Conservatives for the Central Fife seat in 1997, he took his nanny and his mother’s Mercedes out canvassing.Mr Rees-Mogg has also used his position of influence to argue against abortion, even in cases of rape, and same-sex marriage.He has been one of the most prominent backers of a hard Brexit and, last year, it was revealed that a City firm he co-founded had set up an investment fund in Ireland and was warning prospective clients about the financial dangers of a hard Brexit.Following his appointment by Mr Johnson this week, he is responsible for organising government business in the Commons.The Commons Leader’s office would not comment on the leaked document. – PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Its kit can be found in just about every Airbus jet, for example.\u0026nbspFootasylum could run a lot faster under JD’s wing after £90m takeoverCobham hit by US defence spending cutsAdvent’s offer represents a 34 per cent premium over Wednesday’s closing share price, and it looks like a shoo-in to get the 75 per cent support from shareholders that\u0026nbspit requires for the deal to go through.The premium looks like a tasty one, and the majority of its investors will likely sign up in a heartbeat.\u0026nbspFor a start, the board has backed it unanimously, as has Artemis, one of\u0026nbspits bigger institutional shareholders. While the company has found its feet of late, its recent history has not been entirely happy. It issued a string of profit warnings between 2015 and 2017. In the last of those years it tapped shareholders for an emergency £500m to help with a debt-mountain built up in part through a botched acquisition.\u0026nbspThe new shares, issued through the cash call, were priced at 75p. Investors who signed up and held on to them are getting 165p in cash from Advent. Cha-ching.\u0026nbspCould Cobham have got there on its own, though? The shares were at a higher level than that as recently as the beginning of 2016. It might seem like a tall order given Britain’s desperate political climate, but the question is rarely asked even when things are going well. The rule in the City is you take the money and run when it’s offered. \u0026nbspAnother rarely raised question, unless the company involved is a big household name, is whether the deal is a good one for this country.\u0026nbspIn the case of Cobham, the government may not even need to lie about this being an investment in Britain that shows off its vim.\u0026nbspAdvent has surely been assisted by the climate that government has created. Its behaviour has so tarnished Sterling that shares denominated in the UK’s currency are unnaturally cheap for overseas bidders, which can therefore afford to make their offers look generous.\u0026nbspWith the requirement to act like a good little vassal of the US, any muted objections to the deal will fall on deaf ears. There’ll be no question of using the slightly beefed up powers the government has to halt takeovers involving sensitive companies like this one.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

That is more than double the 18.9 per cent currently charged on overdrafts with its standard current account and in line with some of the most expensive credit cards available.Nationwide will also no longer allow customers with its FlexPlus account a £250 overdraft without charges.The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has banned daily fees on overdrafts, requiring lenders to charge through an annual interest rate instead by April 2020, following years of complaints by consumer groups that customers were being charged excessive fees.Although an interest rate is clearer than the confusing array of daily charges that banks levy and it can be compared with other types of borrowing, it is not necessarily cheaper, as Nationwide’s move demonstrates.Created with Sketch.Deutsche Bank: Sacked staff clear out their belongings Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a Sainsbury\u0027s bagA man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a cardboard boxA woman leaves the US offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankMembers of the press wait outside Deutsche bank as firings beginStaff members look down on members of the press as they swarm outside the offices of Deutsche Bank in LondonA man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a Sainsbury\u0027s bagA man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a cardboard boxA woman leaves the US offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankMembers of the press wait outside Deutsche bank as firings beginStaff members look down on members of the press as they swarm outside the offices of Deutsche Bank in LondonIn May, when the FCA announced what it described as the “biggest shake-up to the overdraft market for a generation”, it anticipated that lenders would attempt to recoup any loss of revenues by increasing interest rates among other changes.The regulator warned that the new rules could create “winners and losers” as banks change their overdraft charges to comply.The new rules also include a ban on charging different rates for authorised and unauthorised overdrafts, intended to stop lenders saddling a small number of borrowers with large fees, which can in some cases be over 10 times higher than the cost of a payday loan.Other major high street lenders have yet to announce how they will respond.Overdraft fees slashed in radical shake-up of ‘dysfunctional’ marketOne-third of Nationwide’s customers who use their overdraft will see no change or a reduction in fees and interest because interest payable on small overdrafts will be less than the daily charges currently charges. Of the remaining two-thirds, Nationwide said, most will see a rise of 20p per day or less.Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert, said overdraft charges from many providers had been “hideous” for some time.“All overdraft providers will have to charge via APR, so comparisons will now be easier.\u0026nbsp“For existing Nationwide customers though, there are winners and losers. Those with smaller overdrafts who are currently being charged will gain, as the cost is directly in proportion to the amount they’re overdrawn.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He pointed out that the sharp fall in sales recorded in the June survey was at odds with a healthy rise in sales subsequently reported by government statisticians.However, the factors that have supported consumer spending this year may be starting to fade, he said. He pointed to a recent slowdown in employment growth and evidence from surveys that pay rises are running out of steam.In addition, with UK consumers saving a very low share of their income, they may “at the very least” want to stop dipping into their savings, especially given the uncertainty around Brexit, he said.“Meanwhile, lenders have cut back on the availability of unsecured consumer credit,” he added.The CBI survey was conducted between 27 June and 16 July.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 443 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.543 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1343 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1443 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1743 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2143 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2743 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2943 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3143 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3643 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4343 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail.

There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1343 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1443 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1743 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2143 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2743 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2943 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3143 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3643 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4343 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. Of Monsters and Men, Fever Dream review: A shift in a new directionThe 30 greatest album covers of all timeAlbum reviews: Kaiser Chiefs, Mini Mansions, and Spoon The record has been the subject of discussions by the Chicago artist for years, with a number of references to how it would be different from his self-released mixtapes.\u0026nbsp“Something that you can consider an album, it might not be physical, or a disc or something, but an album that comes with its own live show is important,” he said in 2017.Between his own releases, Chance has made a number of high-profile guest appearances on hit singles including DJ Khaled\u0027s I\u0027m the One, and Don\u0027t Cross Me, from Ed Sheeran\u0027s recent No .6 Collaborations Project album.The Big Day\u0026nbspis available on major streaming services.\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The sun beating down. No one around for miles. We all have our desert island fantasies. How might you fare marooned on a strange land? Could you fend for yourself? In the spirit of Robinson Crusoe, I’ve decided to spend five days castaway on an uninhabited island in the south Pacific.\u0026nbspThe place is Kabakon, one of Papua New Guinea’s 13 Duke of York islands, 800km east of the capital Port Moresby. It is owned by the tribe who live on the neighbouring island of Karawara, who use it as their garden.A hotel on the mainland sets up the basics for me but, to all extents and purposes, it is a term of solitary confinement. Just me and my flimsy penknife. Bouncing over the waves to the island, we pass the steaming volcano Tavurvur, a startling reminder that I’m slap bang on\u0026nbspthe Pacific ring of fire.\u0026nbspThen we run into a pod of frolicking dolphins, which\u0026nbspskip along with the boat like they’re old friends. It’s a cheery omen for the adventure ahead.After about 45 minutes,\u0026nbspKabakon\u0026nbspheaves into view.The island is\u0026nbsp80 hectares of white sand, fringed with palms and blue water, and is as close to a paradisiacal idyll as I have ever seen. There’s no luxury here. I’m staying in a two-roomed shack with a mattress on the floor, mosquito net, and some chairs and a table on the veranda. The hotel has provided basic food – bread, dried noodles, fruit and a few tins. There’s no wifi or TV\u0026nbspno signs of digital life. Nothing to tie me to the world outside.Showing me the ropes is Corey Eron, councillor of Karawara, and the brainchild of the trip. He wants to encourage tourism to the island to help the village economy. He is an idealist but practical with it and charismatic to boot. His dreads shake with mirth as his infectious laughter punctuates the conversation. You can see why the islanders hold him in high regard, voting him their council representative every year for the past seven.\u0026nbspHe’ll keep me company some of the time but I’ve told him I need to do this alone.\u0026nbspMy first task is to explore the island. My shack faces Karawara in the east with the mountains of New Ireland shimmering dimly in the distance. The side I’m on is beach and sand while the other is tall rocky cliffs that block the battering encroachment of the sea. Inland is thick vegetation and the Karawaran garden. I determine to walk around the island, which should take two to three hours…\u0026nbspprobably.A guy stops on the path and pulls out some betel nuts and lime powder from his bag, which I chew, turning my lips red. I’m invited to eat taro (root) and freshly cooked fish stew. And I’m offered homebrewKabakon is filled with curious life. Blue and red starfish and sea cucumbers bask in the water, little darting fish weave between your toes. Inland, there are red-beaked parrots, multicoloured lizards and black and white willie wagtail birds with their absurd rear-end movement like they’re doing the twist. The plant life is equally fascinating. Spiky pandanus palms and coconuts dominate but there is also a single huge banyan tree, the tallest on the island and for miles around, with roots hanging like thick dark ropes from the trunk. As I’m walking along, I come across a sudden bloom of colourful flowers and weeping willow trees, which seem incongruous in their surroundings.In fact, this is part of Kabakon’s strange history.\u0026nbspIn 1902, the island was bought by one August\u0026nbspEngelhardt, a 26-year-old German, who was looking for somewhere to develop his utopian philosophy based on principles of sun worship and cocovorism\u0026nbsp– the notion that eating nothing but coconuts is key to solving man’s physical ailments. He’d come into a substantial inheritance and purchased Kabakon for his new Eden.The first few years were idyllic. Engelhardt established a coconut plantation and called his followers to join\u0026nbsphim in this brave new world. They called themselves Sonnenorden and practised sun worship and nudity and lived off coconuts. But it didn’t last. The alien living conditions took their toll and several died. Others turned their back on him. Engelhardt was eventually left alone, was gripped by malaria and\u0026nbspwent insane. He died aged 46 and was rumoured to have been\u0026nbspburied on the neighbouring island of Mioko, though his grave was never found.The ghost of this eccentric man occupies me as I weave my way around the island, but progress is hard. The vegetation is thick and my path is blocked by tall plants draped in spiderwebs, while the cliffs prevent me walking along the water. Eventually, I decide to turn inland, where I stumble upon the village plantations.The island garden is a beautiful sight. Immaculately tended plots of banana and coconut trees mixed with yams, peanuts and all kinds of tropical fruit. It looks, indeed, very Edenic. But I’ve now no idea where I am or how to get back. Even as I’m thinking that I might be stuck a young face appears from the undergrowth.“The beach path?” he asks.“Yes,” I say sheepishly, trying to excuse my intrusion and wondering if I have trampled on his hard work.He gestures me to follow, then asks if I’d like to eat some singapo. Unsure what it is, I say yes – in for a penny, in for a pound. He takes me up a different path where we come upon a group of boys cooking yams on a fire. One offers me the singapo: “Crunchy,” he says, while another asks if I want a kulao (green coconut). I nod and he immediately leaps on to the base of a 30ft-coconut tree and starts shimmying up using no more than a leaf harness hooked round his feet. In a flash, he’s up there hacking down coconuts, suspended upside down with one hand. Madness, I think, and eat the purple, smoked yam and drink water fresh from the coconut with a new appreciation.The islanders are quick with humour and generous to a fault. It’s one of\u0026nbspmy first lessons about\u0026nbspthe Karawaran people. Language might be an issue but communication is easy\u0026nbspthey are charming.Later I chat with Corey about life here. It looks like paradise but living isn’t easy. The relentless march of modernity is inescapable. Customs are being eroded. The islanders used to trade exclusively with shell money (kina) but that is dying off as notes and coin currency become de facto. With coconuts and fish, the island’s only two money earners, it is harder to buy things.Corey says they are lucky to have the garden island, which provides them with food. But for everything else, they need money. Better medicine, for example –\u0026nbspseven people died of malaria last year. Or school equipment, and clothes. The PNG government is well-intentioned but notoriously poor in execution. The country draws explorers and anthropologists to the fascination of a land that has over 800 languages, wild and ancient tribes and customs, some that seem truly outlandish and brutal to us. Yet the real trouble here is not the ancient customs but modern governmental mismanagement, which\u0026nbspis unlikely to change soon.Corey’s grandmother once tasted human flesh. She told of how the tribe caught a man, tied him up, removed his eyes and turned his head around, then kept him by the fire still alive for three days while they collected sweet potatoes until finally he was thrown inCollapsed on\u0026nbspmy mattress, I’m ready to sleep but the night brings strange noises and even stranger visitors. Things come hissing and creeping into my feverish mind. It seems to take hours until finally, hot and sweaty, I’m soothed by the sounds of the tropical rain that thrums on\u0026nbspthe thatched roof and fall into a deep slumber.In the morning I find the table covered in delicate ant wings, their bodies seared off by the lamp I left lit overnight. It is something of a symbolic sacrifice.Waking on the second day there is a pull for the familiar. The desire for something you know, because you’re stuck here in these unfamiliar surroundings. I wonder what the weather is like back home. If Boris is PM yet. Whether anyone’s missing me.\u0026nbspI walk along the sands until I come upon a man tying crabs he caught overnight. They call him “Sir Crab” because he is a specialist in\u0026nbspcatching them.\u0026nbsp“The crabs are clever,” he says, “so you have to be cleverer than them.”He gives me two freshly caught mud crabs, which, when\u0026nbspboiled,\u0026nbspproduce the freshest meat broken off the shell. Simplicity and patience are key here. Life is slow and meandering. Villagers paddle along in their canoes to the sound of birds and the rik rik of crickets. You quickly\u0026nbsplearn there’s no need to chase time.Corey takes me to Karawara. At every turn, the islanders greet me\u0026nbspwarmly. A man stops on the path and pulls out some betel nuts and lime powder from his bag, which I chew, turning my lips red. I’m invited to eat taro\u0026nbspand freshly cooked fish stew and drink\u0026nbsphomebrew. The village is just 30 minutes walk from one end to the other but is so overflowing with life, generosity and community that I wonder how or why this place is slowly slipping away to western mores.It’s clear the spirit of Engelhardt endures. One of the men shows me old photos of him – whom they call Tokelau or Mr Coconut – sitting on a chair looking into the camera with a haunted expression on his face. Apparently\u0026nbsphe was a good man but the customs – nudism and all – disconcerted them. Some called him a ghost.Papua New Guinea hit with 6.4-magnitude earthquakeThe local legends and myths border on the fantastically insane but somehow seem believable here. Corey speaks of the magic men who went through extreme initiations, fasting for months, eating 20 or more ginger roots in a go, and other crazy acts of torture before they acquired magic powers. These men could become tiny and transport themselves to different places by stepping on rocks or were carried around by flying foxes. They had power over nature – asking the coconut tree to bend down and provide them with coconuts.There are darker things too. Cannibalism. Corey’s grandmother, who died aged 115 last year, tasted human flesh. She told of how the tribe caught a man, tied him up, removed his eyes and turned his head around, then kept him by the fire still alive for three days while they collected sweet potatoes until finally throwing him in – a custom which has fortunately also slipped away.At some point, I express an interest in fishing and lo and behold the next morning four boys rock up in their boat with spearguns and goggles and take me with them to the other side of the island to catch fish. The boat stops and sways as waves dash\u0026nbspagainst the rocky face. I’m feeling a\u0026nbsplittle grim but try not to show it. Wilson hands me my fishing tool – a homemade speargun that’s been whittled out of wood with a thick rubber band attached to it. I’m supposed to get in the water and load this with a spear before catching something.“Don’t point it at anyone, it goes off easy,” he warns.I’m not convinced by their chances, but the boys are specialists, ing with ease like they have since they were kids. I’m less effective but it’s exhilarating all the same. The coral is teeming with marine life yet to be diminished by overfishing. We return with a bucket of multicoloured tropical fish that we\u0026nbspsmoke\u0026nbspover the fire and share. I doubt I’ve had fresher – straight from sea to coals to stomach.On my last evening, I sit on the sand\u0026nbspand watch villagers paddling back to their island, canoes loaded with crops. Songs echo out into the air as the light fades and the mountains in the distance get dimmer and dimmer and then…\u0026nbspsilence. Just the waves and the darkness and the stars, hundreds and thousands of them, glimmering in the sky.It is a place of perfect peace.The mornings have been a little overcast so far but the final day brings a cloudless blue sky. The sun is peeping over the distant mountains of New Ireland. I rush to the water and see it rising, shyly at first, then exploding into golden beams that illuminate the world. Augustus would have been happy. But there is a final twist to the tale.While we are waiting for the boat to take us back to the mainland, one of the villagers – Vapot, a quiet one who speaks little English – tells Corey that two Germans came in 2002 and she and some of the other villagers went with them and dug up bones in the north of the island.It was the same spot where Augustus planted his flowers. I’m frankly agog. But then again there’s nothing too fanciful about this strange, crazy, beautiful place that should surprise me. He was right here all along.The trip was organised through the PNG Tourism Authority. Air Niugini flies daily from Singapore\u0026nbspto Port Moresby and has connecting flights to Rabaul.

That is more than double the 18.9 per cent currently charged on overdrafts with its standard current account and in line with some of the most expensive credit cards available.Nationwide will also no longer allow customers with its FlexPlus account a £250 overdraft without charges.The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has banned daily fees on overdrafts, requiring lenders to charge through an annual interest rate instead by April 2020, following years of complaints by consumer groups that customers were being charged excessive fees.Although an interest rate is clearer than the confusing array of daily charges that banks levy and it can be compared with other types of borrowing, it is not necessarily cheaper, as Nationwide’s move demonstrates.Created with Sketch.Deutsche Bank: Sacked staff clear out their belongings Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a Sainsbury\u0027s bagA man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a cardboard boxA woman leaves the US offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankMembers of the press wait outside Deutsche bank as firings beginStaff members look down on members of the press as they swarm outside the offices of Deutsche Bank in LondonA man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a Sainsbury\u0027s bagA man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a cardboard boxA woman leaves the US offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankMembers of the press wait outside Deutsche bank as firings beginStaff members look down on members of the press as they swarm outside the offices of Deutsche Bank in LondonIn May, when the FCA announced what it described as the “biggest shake-up to the overdraft market for a generation”, it anticipated that lenders would attempt to recoup any loss of revenues by increasing interest rates among other changes.The regulator warned that the new rules could create “winners and losers” as banks change their overdraft charges to comply.The new rules also include a ban on charging different rates for authorised and unauthorised overdrafts, intended to stop lenders saddling a small number of borrowers with large fees, which can in some cases be over 10 times higher than the cost of a payday loan.Other major high street lenders have yet to announce how they will respond.Overdraft fees slashed in radical shake-up of ‘dysfunctional’ marketOne-third of Nationwide’s customers who use their overdraft will see no change or a reduction in fees and interest because interest payable on small overdrafts will be less than the daily charges currently charges. Of the remaining two-thirds, Nationwide said, most will see a rise of 20p per day or less.Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert, said overdraft charges from many providers had been “hideous” for some time.“All overdraft providers will have to charge via APR, so comparisons will now be easier.\u0026nbsp“For existing Nationwide customers though, there are winners and losers. Those with smaller overdrafts who are currently being charged will gain, as the cost is directly in proportion to the amount they’re overdrawn.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is a production preview of the Jaguar I-PACE, which will be revealed next year and on the road in 2018After the deal, Intel will retain the right to develop modems for non-smartphone applications, such as PCs, industrial equipment and self-driving cars.New iPhone line-up said to be revealed in huge new leakModem chips connect devices like the iPhone to wireless data networks, but Apple has always relied on outside suppliers for the part. Intel has positioned itself as the sole source of iPhone modem chips over the past year after Apple got into a prolonged legal fight with previous supplier Qualcomm over patent licensing practices.Apple, based in\u0026nbspCupertino, California,\u0026nbspreached a surprise settlement in April that called for the iPhone to once again use Qualcomm modem chips. Within hours, Intel said it would quit the smartphone modem business.Apple’s acquisitions have mostly been much smaller companies, making the Intel deal its second-largest ever after its $3.2bn purchase of Beats Electronics in 2014.The deal with Intel will bolster Apple’s goal to make its own modem chip. Two of Apple’s biggest global rivals – Samsung Electronics and Huawei – already have the ability to self-supply modem chips.Technology news publication The Information last year reported Apple’s efforts to develop its own modem, but the iPhone maker\u0026nbspnever formally acknowledged it. In February, Reuters reported that Apple moved its modem engineering efforts into the same chip design unit that makes the custom processors for its devices, signalling a doubling down on the pursuit of self-designed modem chip.Apple chief executive Tim Cook has also long said the company wants to control its own technological fate – analysts call this\u0026nbspthe “Cook Doctrine”.“We believe that we need to own and control the primary technologies behind the products that we make,” Tim Cook told investors back in 2009.The purchase of Intel’s assets could help Apple meet its aggressive timeline for producing a modem.A person familiar with the matter said Apple plans to use Qualcomm’s modem technology for a 5G iPhone in 2020 but wants to have its own ready for use\u0026nbspby 2021.But any replacement of Qualcomm is likely to happen in phases, this person said, as Apple builds up its ability to ensure that its modems work on all the networks and countries where it sells phones. Ensuring worldwide compatibility is Qualcomm’s historical strength, and Apple might still have to rely on the firm\u0026nbspfor some modems during a transition period to its own devices.“There’s a fierce desire (at Apple) to have independence, but they also realise it has to be done responsibly,” this person said.Apple’s licence deal with Qualcomm lasts six years and its accompanying chip supply agreement could also last that long, said one chip industry veteran who requested anonymity to discuss confidential matters. Apple is likely to continue to use the San Diego firm’s chips in its flagship models even if it phases in its own silicon for lower-end and older models, this person said.Apple has engaged with Taiwan’s Global Unichip Corp, a chip design house in which Apple supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is an investor, to explore a modem design, but the work is in early stages.“Clearly Apple saw the handwriting on the wall, because they came around and did a deal with Qualcomm,” this person said.Apple declined to comment on its plans, and Qualcomm and Global Unichip did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The most valuable aspect of the Intel deal for Apple could turn out to be patents. To sell a 5G iPhone, Apple will need to strike deals with the major holders of 5G patents, including Nokia, Ericsson, Huawei and Qualcomm. Apple executed a licensing deal with Qualcomm, but it has not disclosed whether it has deals in place with the others.Erick Robinson, a patent attorney who had worked in Qualcomm’s licensing ision in Asia, said the patents could give Apple better leverage in licensing talks.“I don’t think Intel has quite the portfolio that Qualcomm has, but they certainly have a large enough one to impact the valuations when it comes to a cross-licensing deal,” he said. “It’ll save (Apple) a huge chunk of change in cross-licence deals.”Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Another flame flew out of the top of the rocket, as can be seen on the video.The rocket itself appeared to survive without problems, but it is just the latest in a run of issues. It came a week after the Starhopper craft flew a fireball out of its bottom during another test.It was the first time that SpaceX has allowed one of the tests to be streamed. Previous attempts have happened in private – with spectacular descriptions of the launches leaking out after.Created with Sketch.Best NASA pictures of the month - June 2019 Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A coronal mass ejection as seen by the Chandra Observatory.

Company results usually come out at 7am, but by 8am on Friday, when the stock market opened, the results were still missing, all planned calls with the media and analysts were cancelled and a presentation to investors at the retailer’s London head office was scrapped.A spokesman for Sports Direct said: “Unfortunately we are still finalising preliminary results. We anticipate that our annual results will still be released today, with a presentation to follow.”The company then issued updates at midday and 2pm, each time saying it was still finalising the report. The latest update is due at 4pm.\u0026nbspSports Direct shares seesawed during the day, falling in response to every update from the company.

In December, Sports Direct said the department store made a loss of £31.6m since it was acquired in August.When the company announced the first delay, it cited the complexities of integrating House of Fraser and uncertainty about the business’s future performance as part of the reason.“It not only raises questions about the haphazard way in which the investor relations and finance teams are run, but also could suggest a material problem with the numbers.”Additional reporting by PAOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In a remake that could have felt indulgent in the hands of people less skilled, she more than justifies its existence.”“Late Night is a caustic satirical comedy that turns into an unlikely tearjerker. It’s by turns snide and uplifting, and often very funny too. Its writerproducerstar Mindy Kaling makes vicious observations about the inanity, narcissism and corruption of the mainstream US media at the same time as she celebrates the professionalism of many of those who work within it.“Olivia Wilde is a visually inventive director, who keeps the tempo here so brisk that we hardly notice how glib the storytelling sometimes becomes. We can tell exactly how the film will end, but it still feels original both in its screwball energy and in the deft way it continually reverses stereotypes and gender clichés.” “Macabre and fraught though The Favourite gets, this isn’t so much a film about sex or power as it is about plain mischief. It’s a hilarious, buffoonish pleasure, right down to the sets and costume design, and a breeze to spend 120 minutes with.” Christopher Hooton“Casting Chalamet as Nic was a very clever move. The young actor from Call Me by Your Name and Lady Bird has a natural charm and charisma. He still engages an audience’s curiosity and sympathy even when his behaviour is at its most selfish and erratic.” Geoffrey Macnab626 The House by the Sea“Guédiguian’s storytelling style is deceptive.

This is very much a case of the tears of the clowns.” Geoffrey Macnab“Vice is bravura storytelling. McKay isn’t only taking us through Cheney’s life and career but is giving us a whistle stop tour through US politics from the Nixon administration almost right to the present day.” Geoffrey Macnab“Playing Lee Israel, McCarthy manages something very special: she makes a character who is odd, obnoxious, difficult and alcoholic seem lovable and even heroic.

It deals with racism and homophobia but still has a fairytale, fantasy feel to it. Whatever humiliations Don endures on their road trip, we know no real harm will ever come to him as long as Tony is at his side.” Geoffrey Macnab“The golden age of bonkers horror movies is gloriously evoked by Netflix’s latest feature length presentation. Beginning as a satire of the arts world, Velvet Buzzsaw swiftly and gleefully descends into a savage splatter-fest, smeared in paint, viscera and garishly-bright blood.” Ed Power“Written by Ben Elton and directed by its star Kenneth Branagh, the film plays so fast and loose with the playwright’s final years that they needn’t have bothered fitting Branagh with a prosthetic nose – accuracy is clearly not the priority here.” Alexandra PollardThe Lego Movie 2: The Second Part is the doomed progeny of a celebrated genius – brilliant but slightly stunted by the knowledge they will never live up to their predecessor.” Clarisse Loughrey“Nicolas Pesce’s sleek and stylish horror comedy is repulsive and funny by turns.

Labaki elicits an astonishing performance from her young lead. He’s an irrepressible figure with such an inbuilt sense of moral decency the film seems upbeat and optimistic, even at its darkest moments.” Geoffrey MacnabRalph Fiennes combines thriller elements with poetic flashbacks to ballet legend Rudolf Nureyev’s childhood and keeps a tight focus on the dancer. When he is most at risk, Nureyev makes decisions with his artistic future more in mind than his personal safety. As Fiennes reminds us again and again in what is his best film yet as a director, the \u0027white crow\u0027 will do anything to put himself in the limelight, the one place he is convinced he belongs.Border reverses the perspective taken by most other horror films. In more conventional genre fare, Tina and Vore would be portrayed as malevolent outsiders, but in the world conjured up by director Ali Abbasi, the humans are the monsters. Tina is the innocent – a visionary who hardly understands her own powers but who can sense human venality and corruption wherever it appears.1926 Fighting with My FamilyCertain scenes feel very trite and predictable but the film gets you in a choke hold early on and won’t let you go. It is far more gripping than its subject matter might suggest. Who ever would believe a story about a wrestling family from Norwich could have quite such heart and resonance?Doppelgangers abound in Jordan Peele’s weird, creepy and ingenious new horror film. As in his Oscar-winning 2017 feature Get Out, Peele leavens matters with ironic humour but the joking becomes increasingly uncomfortable once the main characters come face to face with dark shadows of themselves which wish them extreme harm.The Avengers cycle comes to a rich and very satisfying conclusion with Endgame, surely the most complex and emotional superhero movie in Marvel history. At 181 minutes, this is a veritable epic, but with so many characters and plot strands, it fully warrants its lengthy running time.It’s a rare and precious feeling when a film completely dismantles you. Eighth Grade – the directorial debut of US comedian Bo Burnham – breaks down every delusion we have about ourselves and burrows deep into those parts we’ve made such an effort to lock away. You may cry. You may shudder as every awkward social interaction that’s kept you up at night replays in your head all at once. You may feel the sharp pain associated with those moments when you feel completely isolated from the world. Burnham may have crafted a simple story about the most ordinary of teenage girls, but it speaks with the emotions of a true cinematic epic.Natalie Portman gives her fiercest, most memorable performance since Black Swan in Brady Corbet’s enjoyably subversive satire about a troubled pop star whose loss of innocence mirrors the fall from grace of the US itself. Portman’s character, Celeste, is certainly one of the most objectionable figures she has played: a pampered, hard-drinking drug-taking “floozy” whose appearance and high-handed behaviour rekindle memories of Liz Taylor and Joan Crawford at their monstrous worst.Robert Pattinson gives one of his most striking performances as Monte, the death-row criminal in outer space, tricked into making a voyage described at one stage as a “class-one suicide ride”. The former Twilight star makes his shaven-headed, gaunt-faced character seem hyper naturally sensitive and feral at the same time.Amazing Grace is as uplifting a film as you will see all year. It’s a concert movie filmed over two nights and featuring Aretha Franklin, the “first lady of soul”, performing gospel standards in a church in Los Angeles in 1972, with a huge backing choir and an enthusiastic congregation.Disney’s live-action remake of its 1992 animated feature is a rip-roaring, old-fashioned matinee-style spectacle that turns out far better than we had any right to expect.“Gloria Bell is somewhat exhausting – both unbearably intimate and at a constant remove – but it is endlessly pulled back into focus by Moore, who has a firm understanding of the delicate balance between contentment and yearning, joy and pain, recklessness and spontaneity.

Portman’s character, Celeste, is certainly one of the most objectionable figures she has played: a pampered, hard-drinking drug-taking “floozy” whose appearance and high-handed behaviour rekindle memories of Liz Taylor and Joan Crawford at their monstrous worst.Robert Pattinson gives one of his most striking performances as Monte, the death-row criminal in outer space, tricked into making a voyage described at one stage as a “class-one suicide ride”. The former Twilight star makes his shaven-headed, gaunt-faced character seem hyper naturally sensitive and feral at the same time.Amazing Grace is as uplifting a film as you will see all year. It’s a concert movie filmed over two nights and featuring Aretha Franklin, the “first lady of soul”, performing gospel standards in a church in Los Angeles in 1972, with a huge backing choir and an enthusiastic congregation.Disney’s live-action remake of its 1992 animated feature is a rip-roaring, old-fashioned matinee-style spectacle that turns out far better than we had any right to expect.Rocky\u0026nbspproducer Irwin Winkler told\u0026nbspVariety\u0026nbspthe team are “very anxious” to make the film, and that negotiations are currently underway with Stallone.The most recent movie in the franchise,\u0026nbspRocky Balboa, came out in 2006.Two spin-off films,\u0026nbspCreed\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspCreed II, were released in 2015 and 2018.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Standing up for our community and advocating for ourselves was powerful then and it is powerful now.’‘I think what we can learn from the uprising is everything we’ve learned after it: until the most marginalised among us are free, none of us are free.’‘Resist. That’s what the people at the Stonewall Inn did that fateful night in 1969. They resisted arrest and the status quo because they knew that their right to love and exist was equal to their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts.’‘Growing up I just did not see myself reflected within the history books. But when I found out that it was Marsh P Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, two transgender women of colour, who kicked off the Stonewall riots which lead to the gay rights movement... If filled me with pride.’‘I think perhaps the most glorious fact of the Stonewall riots is that it was the queens, the camp, glitzy queens who saw off the police that night in Greenwich Village. Years of mockery in the streets, being jostled, spat at, arrested and pushed off the sidewalk had toughened them up.’‘Trans women of colour have always stood at the forefront of this movement. Some try to erase the legacies but it’s still apparent in today’s climate that trans women are as bold as ever.’‘I am eternally grateful to those who fought for the recognition of gay identity at a time when society saw it only in crude sexual terms. Stonewall was about the freedom to love without fear.’850 Ruth Hunt, CEO of Stonewall‘We named ourselves after this historic moment and we continue to honour those involved by naming the meeting rooms in our London office after some of the leaders, including a lesbian woman of colour called Storme DeLarverie and two trans women of colour, Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P Johnson.’950 Rikki Beadle-Blair, creator and performer‘I put my heart and soul into the script for Stonewall. And they’re all there: the butches, the fems, the blacks and hiics and whites. The middle-class activists. The street queens. The homeless queer kids. And they are still here, with us in every battle we still have to fight.’‘It laid the foundation for all the campaigns for LGBT+ equality that followed: against Section 28, for an equal age of consent, for equal access to services, for equal marriage, for justice around the world in the face of hostility and violence and bigotry.’‘The Stonewall riots were the spark that galvanised the LGBT+ community to organise in support for our rights. From homosexuality being a criminal offence, to a law requiring a person to be wearing at least three items of “gender appropriate” clothing, 1969 was a dangerous time to be queer.’1250 Shon Faye, writer and comedian‘While important, I wish 28 June 1969 wasn’t held up as the single moment where LGBT+ history starts, particularly in Britain, where LGBT+ people’s political emergence has its own fascinating history.’‘Since Stonewall, the LGBT+ movement has gone global liberating hundreds of millions of people though hundreds of millions more live in the 68 countries that still outlaw same-sex relations. The Stonewall revolution is not yet over.’1450 Tamal Ray, baker and doctor‘Would I have had the bravery and the fury, to do what did they did that night? Maybe. Maybe not. But I’m here today. And having grown up under the bullshit of section 28 I’m so aware of how lucky I am to have the rights and protections I do.’‘In the midst of a growing homophobic and transphobic backlash against victories won by LGBT+ people, we need to re-invigorate a radical queer movement with demands ranging from reforming the Gender Recognition Act to reversing cuts to LGBT+ services, to properly funding mental health.’‘Those rights and that acceptance, which have been hard-won over the last 50 years, are still fragile. LGBT+ people are still subject to hate crimes. Bosses can still be unsure over points of employment law.  Prejudice persists. The fight continues.’1750 Shahmir Sanni, whistleblower and digital strategist‘In the UK, Stonewall collaborating with UKBlackPride and LGBT+ activists reaching out to marginalised communities with a significant focus on BAME sexual health is a giant leap forward for all of us.’1850 Travis Alabanza, performer and activist‘It reminds us that our change and progress will never be made in just books, or just on our screens, or just in theory - but always in practice, on the streets, together.’‘The stories of Marsha P Johnson, Sylvia Rivera, and others have been carried though time by some of our most marginalised communities, beautifully and with all the reverence they deserve.’2050 Michael Cashman, politician, actor and co-founder of Stonewall‘For me it signifies the moment of fighting back when the straw finally breaks the camel‘s back. That happened here in the United Kingdom when the Thatcher government introduced Section 28 in the middle of the Aids and HIV crisis being faced by the gay community.’‘It is a legacy of solidarity across ersity and difference. It is a legacy of how a single act and a moment can have ripple effects for generations to come.’‘I was born in the year of the Stonewall riots and through my lifetime so much has changed. Its a time to thank and celebrate the working-class queer people of colour, the heroic trans people, the drag queens, the fem guys, the butch dykes who fought for their rights to be who they are.’‘Until we have queer history taught properly within our schools, and until media organisations report on our lives with care, I hope that we can come together as a community and share our knowledge, so that our heroes are never forgotten.’‘Trans people, especially trans women of colour, need you to fight for them they way they fought for your rights 50 years ago.’2550 Lea DeLaria, actor and comedian‘That riot, what I saw, my people fighting back, is the reason I have always been out and proud.’‘Now, more than ever, we must stand firm as the tide of tolerance turns against us in many places, in an effort to undo the hard-won victories of the last few decades.’‘We need that spirit of solidarity now more than ever, especially for trans people and queer people of colour - especially seeing what’s happening in places like Chechnya and Brunei.’2850 Phillip Picardi , journalist and editor-in-chief of OUT magazine‘This year, celebration may be a part of Pride – but what we really need is the rebirth of a movement, led by the very folks who have consistently been left behind.’‘On that date in New York, lesbians, gay men, trans people (although they wouldn’t have used that term) and all manner of queer people came together as a unified community and said no to state-sanctioned police brutality.’‘A global rise in extremism and nationalism makes our hard-fought victories vulnerable to attacks and setbacks. It serves to push back even harder and negate the strides we have already made.’3150 Jide Macaulay, pastor and activist‘As a black African British gay Christian living with HIV, it’s a reminder of the continuous fight for inclusion, liberation and ersity, to be respected for who I am and who I love.’Pride in LondonYouTube‘Will those corporations be aligned with us once the parade inevitably turns back to a protest?’‘Stonewall was the founding legend that we all learn from and we must stand tall as one community and one voice so we can pave the way for the new generations.’‘Trump and other emerging nationalists worldwide tend to hold a dim view of gay people. So we must our fight back and fight less amongst ourselves on more minor issues.’‘News that there is to be a straight pride parade made me feel like rioting like it’s June 28 1969 all over again. But straight people don’t need Pride because they weren’t born into a culture that shames their very existence.’‘As a bisexual black woman, I owe many of the freedoms I enjoy today to those who stood up to injustice during the Stonewall riots in 1969.’3750 Jake Graf, actor and writer‘When I transitioned I wanted to understand more about our specific transgender history and felt great pride upon learning that the Stonewall riots happened as a result of courageous and outspoken trans women, mostly of colour.’3850 Lisa Power, co-founder of Stonewall‘We named Stonewall here in the UK so that, no matter how “respectable” we became, we never forgot that we started with a riot.’3950 Matthew Todd, author and journalist‘When a lesbian, we think Stormé DeLarverie, a woman of colour, was being arrested, she yelled to the crowd, “Why don’t you guys do something?” Her brothers and sisters – white, black, gay, bi, lesbian, trans, butch, femme – did do something and came to her aid. That’s incredibly inspiring to me.’‘The pervasiveness of the glossy rainbow flag during Pride can lull us into a sense of inaction. But as we\u0027ve seen over the past month of protests, attacks and media, violence and violations against gay and trans people has not gone away.’4150 Joseph Galliano, CEO and co-founder of the Queer Britain Museum‘Who threw the first punch is not the most important question, it’s what activists did with that pent up anger and frustration, over the long haul that made all the difference to so many lives.’‘It\u0027s important to remember the black and brown trans and queer people who led the riots on those six nights, and how our community is still fighting many of those same battles.’4350 Glynn Fussel, performer and creator‘I\u0027m more concerned about my brothers and sisters in other countries who don\u0027t have the rights that we have. Every single day we should remember the fights that came before us.’Sink the Pink‘Small towns now celebrate their LGBT citizens and the police are no longer hostile. That is progress of which we should all be proud.’‘What matters most to me about Stonewall was that it was one protest of many, one moment in time across decades of rebellion, building community, making our mark.’4650 Andrew Lumsden, journalist and activist‘The uprising brought us the word “gay”. When it crossed the Atlantic to us in 1970 as the Gay Liberation Front, which I promptly joined, none of us had ever before used the word in the sense of sexual orientation. And I\u0027m glad we did.’‘The stonewall riots were not only a moment in time and history, but a real signal that we are not a community that is to stay quiet and remain silenced.’‘However we should remember that there are so many stories of queer join, pain, struggle and victory out there to be discovered, if we take the time to look for them.’‘While many of us feel safe and accepted, Pride is about remembering that there are still people in the world who don’t. Until that day we need to keep pushing for total equality and acceptance for the whole of the LGBT+ community.’5050 Carrie Lyell, journalist and editor-in-chief of DIVA magazine‘What I know about Stonewall, I had to scrape together myself. So today, as editor of DIVA magazine, I feel I have a duty to keep the spirit and the stories of that night alive so those growing up don\u0027t need to hunt as I did.’‘When I heard about Stonewall, I remember feeling just like the famous line in the movie Network – I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take it any more.

So today, as editor of DIVA magazine, I feel I have a duty to keep the spirit and the stories of that night alive so those growing up don\u0027t need to hunt as I did.’The unnamed 27-year-old was reportedly told by officials his behaviour was “not authentic” in a high-profile asylum case last year.The decision was the second time Austrian authorities had refused an asylum case on the grounds they did not believe the applicant was gay.The treatment of LGBT+ asylum seekers in Britain has also come under the spotlight\u0026nbspamid\u0026nbspreports of vulnerable\u0026nbspapplicants struggling to provide adequate proof of their sexuality.The proportion of asylum claims from members of the LGBT+ community that have been rejected by the Home Office has surged in recent years, government data released last year showed.In total, 78 per cent of asylum claims that included a reference to sexual orientation were refused last year 1,464 people – up from 964 rejected claims in 2015.This is what LGBTQI+ people go through to gain asylum in the UKDr Tschalaer’s study found people who were more open about their sexuality and gender identity in their country of origin as well as the country of arrival were much more likely to be granted asylum, in part because they were more likely to receive support for the preparation of their asylum interview.Her research suggested\u0026nbspthose who felt unable to be open about their sexuality prior to leaving their home country were at a disadvantage when applying for asylum.LGBTQI+ asylum seekers who felt forced to hide their sexuality andor gender identity, and who felt uncomfortable talking about it were usually rejected, as were those who were married or had children in their countries of origin,” she said.“This was either because they were not recognised or believed as being LGBTQI+, or because they were told to hide in their country of origin since they had not come out yet.”anti-LGBT+ countries in Europe, according to ILGA-EuropeLeila Zadeh, director of the UK Lesbian \u0026amp Gay Immigration Group (UKLGIG), urged European governments to stop basing decisions on whether to grant asylum to LGBTQI+ people based on a person’s ability to articulate a coming out story’ in line with Western stereotypes”.She told The Independent: UKLGIG research has similarly found that the Home Office sometimes refuses refugee status to LGBTQI+ people who find it hard to speak about their sexual orientation.\u0026nbspThey told one person who they refused that their story was \u0027wholly lacking in compelling detail or any emotive terminology\u0027.\u0026nbspThis fails to recognise that in many parts of the world it is taboo to talk about emotions and relationships. People who do not conform to a society\u0027s gender norms may never have spoken about their sexuality or gender identity at all.

Next time, send an emailOn Saturday, Mr Arnold said Mr O’Mara had asked him to stay on until a new MP takes the Sheffield Hallam seat.Mr Arnold said: “From 3 September, he’ll be resigning, triggering a by-election.”He added: “He’s going, there will be a by-election and a new MP before the end of the year.”Mr O’Mara’s announcement that he will resign as MP comes after allegations that he sexually harassed a former employee.However Mr Arnold said he had already made the decision to resign.Mr O’Mara took the Sheffield Hallam seat for Labour from former deputy prime minister and former Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg in 2017.He had the whip withdrawn after apparently sexist and homophobic comments emerged, which he had posted on social media years earlier, but was readmitted to the party after receiving a formal warning.Mr O’Mara resigned from Labour in 2018, saying he had been “made unfairly to feel like a criminal”, and now sits as an independent.The Independent has approached Mr O’Mara for comment.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The overall decline marks the longest period of falling sales since 2011.“Despite the recent pick-up we’ve seen in households’ real earnings, the sun is clearly not shining on the British high street,” said Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the CBI, which represents British businesses.Strong growth in grocers’ sales was outweighed by steep falls at department stores, clothing retailers and other shops.Another measure, which strips out seasonal variations in sales, also pointed to weakness: a balance of -20 per cent of retailers said sales were good for the time of year.\u0026nbspCompared with recent lows, firms expect\u0026nbspa slight pick-up in their fortunes in August, predicting sales will be broadly flat on a year ago.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson waves as he enters 10 Downing Street following his appointment as Prime Minster by the Queen.

He pointed out that the sharp fall in sales recorded in the June survey was at odds with a healthy rise in sales subsequently reported by government statisticians.However, the factors that have supported consumer spending this year may be starting to fade, he said. He pointed to a recent slowdown in employment growth and evidence from surveys that pay rises are running out of steam.In addition, with UK consumers saving a very low share of their income, they may “at the very least” want to stop dipping into their savings, especially given the uncertainty around Brexit, he said.“Meanwhile, lenders have cut back on the availability of unsecured consumer credit,” he added.The CBI survey was conducted between 27 June and 16 July.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

What they want us to do is deliver on their mandate, come out of the EU on October .In recent weeks there had been speculation that the new Conservative leader could take the country to the polls in a bid to consolidate his power base.If a snap election is called, Boris will battle it out to retain his title as PM - it would be a chance for him to understand how confident the British public are in his skills, as his current position as PM was voted for by members of the conservative party.A  General Election could see some big changes to the Conservative party, as it looks like Tories may have to accept the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, and back that in Boris campaign.Johnson would run against Jeremy Corbyn, who lost out to Theresa May in  with  per cent of the UKs vote.However, voices from within and outside the Labour party are allegedly urging Corbyn to quit as Labour experiences record slumps in polls in the wake of several anti-antisemitism scandals.A number of Labour MPs have been rumoured to be gunning to take over from Corbyn in Labours leadership, most notably Londons Mayor Sadiq Khan.Jo Swinson, who took over Lib Dem leadership this month would also run - Lib Dems currently stand on  per cent in the polls, their strongest result yet.The Scottish National Party , the Democratic Unionist Party , Sinn Fein, Plaid Cymru and Green are also very likely to run.Amid the Brexit drama, its likely that Farages Brexit party could be contenders after Nigel Farage questioned Boris ability to deliver Brexit.The Independent Group for Change, formerly Change UK and fronted by Heidi Allen would likely stand the  MPs they have but risk losing their seatsthey do.General Elections have to be held at least every five years in the UK.Previously elections could be called simply by the Prime Minister going to the Queen at any point within five years of the last one.But after the Fixed Term Parliament Act was passed in  the five-year gap was enshrined in law.The act states that General Elections are to be held on the first Thursday in May every five years.However, it has two provisos for the polls opening early.Firstly: A motion of no confidence passed in Her Majesty’s Government by a simple majority and  days elapses without the House passing a confidence motion in any new Government formed.And Secondly: A motion for a General Election is agreed by two thirds of the total number of seats in the Commons including vacant seats .The next General Election in the United Kingdom is scheduled to be held on May , , under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act .The date of the last General Election was June , , which saw the Conservatives lose their majority but remain in Government after they struck a deal with the DUP.The next General Election is scheduled for  - provided Boris Johnson doesnt call a snap election.A snap election could be calledthere is a Remainer revolt against a No Deal Brexit.Rivals of Boris Johnson believe that the frontrunner for No is gearing up for a General Election later this year.Britain isnt due a national election until .Theresa May called a shock snap election in  to try and strengthen the Conservatives hold on Parliament backfired when her majority was slashed by  seats.If Boris becomes PM next month, he could call a General Election for early September."},{"url":null,"title":"uk general election what bookies oods latest","story":"Theresa May said she would step down from her post on June  after a tearful resignation announcement, but is a general election now on the cards Boris Johnson, elected yesterday by Conservative party members as Britains new Tory leader and PM, could trigger a general election.Coral have narrowed their odds on a general election in  from   last week to  .Johnson came out on top after beating Jeremy Hunt in a gruelling contest.Micheal Gove, Sajid Javid and Rory Stewart were knocked out of the race.The entire race for Conservative Party leadership was centred around Brexit - Boris says that he will try to secure a better Brexit deal, but promises thatthis isnt possible he will crash out without one.His support for a no-deal Brexit has sent at least five MPs so far running.Boris may want to trigger a general election before Brexits  day time limit is up in order to secure a bigger parliamentary majority to get his deal through Parliament.Johnsons staunch leave stance - as opposed to Theresa Mays dithering over Brexit - could see him win votes from members of other parties gunning to leave.Despite it widely being parroted that a general election this year is inevitable, Boris has said he is against the idea of a snap election.However,enough MPs are against Boris no-deal Brexit then they could trigger a vote of no confidence in him, andnothing is resolved, after  days a snap general election would be triggered.If Boris did change his mind and decide to trigger a general election then he would need the support of two thirds of MPs in the Commons, which may not be possible.With rumours of a General Election, bookies are offering odds on when the next one will take place.Below are the latest election odds given by bookmaker Coral as of July  :Boris could try and call a snap election at any time. He would have to pass a vote of MPs in the Commons first, however, thanks to the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act.Elections in this country take place on a Thursday.By law, Parliament is dissolved  working days before a General election."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy hunt cabinet brexit","story":"He is also no longer the Foreign Secretary. So what is he up to now  Heres what we know.The son of a Royal Navy officer, Jeremy Hunt was born on November , .Jeremy Richard Streynsham Hunt studied PPE – Philosophy, Politics and Economics – at Magdalen College, Oxford where he was the President of the Oxford University Conservative Association.Hunt founded the company known as Hotcourses in the s along with his childhood friend Mike Elms.He stood down as a company director in  but still retained  per cent of the shares which netted him more than £million when the company was sold in January .He first became an MP in , representing South West Surrey and later had a spell in the Shadow Cabinet, initially for disabled people and later as the Shadow Culture Secretary.Under David Cameron’s administration he served as the Culture Secretary and the Minister for the Olympics from  to .Hunt was promoted to Health Secretary in , a position he held until , making him the person to have held the job the longest in British political history.After Johnson resigned as Foreign Secretary over the Chequers Agreement, Hunt was given the post by the Prime Minister Theresa May.He met his we, Lucia Guo, in  and the couple married in July the following year. They have a son and two daughters - Eleanor, Anna and Jack.The former management consultant is one of the richest members of the Cabinet.His net worth was estimated to be around £million, following the sale of his firm Hotcourses in .The firm releases information about educational training courses.He has previously said he will use his windfall to campaign for causes I believe in, once he leaves politics.On Twitter, Hunt said Boris Johnson offered him another in the Cabinet, but he turned it down.He said he willto the backbenches and support Johnson as PM.Hunt explained he was taking a step back so he be a good dad to his three children as he has been in Cabinet since all three have been alive.Hunt will remain the MP South West Surrey.He said:I would have been honoured to carry on my work at the FCO but understand the need for a new PM to choose his team. BJ kindly offered me another role but after  yrs in Cabinet  over  cab mtgs now is the time to backbenches from where PM will have my full support.Ive been a cabinet minister for every hour my  gorgeous children have been alive. So whilst it may seem strange for someone who just tried to become PMI have decided now is the time for the biggest challenge of all - to be a GOOD DAD!It has been a huge honour  be responsible  the finest diplomatic service in the world   see the courage  wisdom of our diplomats  intelligence services. Thanks  guiding me with such patience  professionalism! Proud to have stood up alongside you for British values.Also most importantly heartfelt thanks to the   of Conservative Party members who supported me. Despite being the outsider, the #HastobeHunt campaign was spirited  smart . I was truly humbled with the confidence placed in me by so many people.The Tory leadership frontrunner sparked controversy when he announced during an interview with Sky that he believed the abortion limit should be halved.This would be from the current  weeks, down to . He said his stance on abortion was a “matter of conscience”. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In other words, both the No Deal preparation and the proposed deal must be realistic.This is where his key Brexit lieutenants Dominic Cummings and David Frost come in.They might be backroom appointments but they are as —not more — important to the success of Boris’s premiership as the Cabinet appointments he has made.Cummings is a unique figure in Westminster. He is interested in getting things done with little regard to what people think of him and the political niceties.It is thanks to Benedict Cumberbatch that Cummings has attracted something close to celebrity status in political circles. Cumberbatch played Cummings in the TV drama Brexit: The Uncivil War.He captured brilliantly Cummings’ drive and determination to win as the campaign chief for Vote Leave, and the fact he doesn’t care whose ego he ruffles in the process.In his new job, Cummings’ determination is already clear.Yesterday he was meant to be on the operating table under general anaesthetic.But once the offer came from Boris, he cancelled the operation. I am told he won’t have it done now until after October , Boris’s deadline for getting Brexit done.Cummings came in because the chance of getting the Vote Leave team back together to deliver Brexit after three years of drt simply had to be taken. The big challenge for this team is to get the UK ready for a No Deal Brexit.Cummings is well suited to his task. He knows how Whitehall works and how to succeed despite intense opposition he drove through Michael Gove’s Free Schools, which have proved hugely successful, against the objections of the educational establishment.Strikingly, in Boris’s new Government it is now Gove who is in charge of the No Deal planning.Getting the logistics and the necessary contingency plans sorted is one aspect of No Deal planning, and one that was shamefully neglected under Mrs May. But there also needs to be a political strategy for it.Many in the EU are convinced — thanks to the antics of Dominic Grieve, Philip Hammond and co — that Parliament will block No Deal.Or thatthe UK did leave without a deal on Halloween, it would come crawling back by Christmas.So they reckon there is no need to compromise as No Deal either won’t happen or will be only a temporary affair.The best way to deal with both the Parliamentary opposition to No Deal and the belief that the UK would come crawling back is for Boris to take a lead in the polls.If it was clear that a general election would lead to a majority for Boris, then Parliament would be less likely to throw obstacles in his way.That’s why Boris, in his Downing Street speech, tried to address the issues that cost the Tories their majority in : Social care, schools funding and police cuts.If the EU thought that Boris could do No Deal, and could politically sustain it, then it would have to decide whether it was prepared to compromise to avoid No Deal.The Irish Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, would have to decide whether it is worth sticking with a backstop that is going to cause the very thing it was meant to avoid, a hard border on the island of Ireland.Varadkar would also have to consider whether he really wants to go through with No Deal when it would do more damage to the Irish economy than the UK’s. This is where David Frost comes in.No, not the late, great TV personality but the former Foreign Office diplomat who is going to be Boris’s point man for negotiations with the EU.Frost knows his way round the chancelleries of Europe, he is a former Foreign Office Europe Director and he also knows what Boris wants on Brexit.He was his special adviser when Boris was Foreign Secretary and was there when Boris decided to quit over Mrs May’s Chequers plan.His role is to craft a Brexit agreement that delivers what Boris thinks the UK needs AND one that has a chance of being accepted by the EUthe alternative is No Deal. This isn’t going to be easy, and it isn’t going to be done quickly.Those involved admit thatthe EU is going to blink, it will not be until the October EU Council at the earliest, which is just two weeks away from the October  deadline. As one of those working in the new No puts it: “Fasten your seatbelts, it’s going to be a bumpy ride.”But after years in which the EU thought they had the measure of the British Prime Minister, we now have a team who might just have what it takes to pull Brexit back from the brink. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There, they can enrol in a course on gender studies and emerge in three years with a degree which will not help them one bit to get a decent job.And as a consequence they will be at least £, in debt. But they’ll have a piece of paper which will tell possible employers: “Look — I’ve been a total mug for three years. Gizza job!”The unemployment rate for students at Britain’s worst universities, such as East London and London South Bank, is around about double the national rate for young people.In other words, going to university worsened their chances of getting a job.That’s not what they were led to believe, is it. They were told a university degree would open doors for them. Not slam the doors shut in their spotty faces. And leave them with a whopping loan to pay off.Our young people have been conned for far too long.We have a new Prime Minister now. And I think it would be a good ideahe took a very close look at higher education. OK, he’s got Brexit to sort out first, fine. But by November , this should be his priority.We are misleading our young people. Far too many -year-olds go to university and end up mired in debt, with rotten degrees in stupid subjects. While all students have to scrimp and save to get through their three years.Here’s what I would doI were Education Secretary.End all tuition fees right now. Make university education absolutely free, and make sure those who go get decent living grants.How do we pay for that  Easy. Cut the number of people going to university by  per cent. Not everyone is academically minded. University should be only for those who are.Back when I went to uni only ten per cent of my peer group got in.But for the rest there were apprenticeships. Learning in the workplace. And those sorts of options should be considered not inferior to university, but absolutely equal. And the benefits stressed to the kids.Three years after leaving school a university kid will be earning nothing. If you’ve been on an apprenticeship for three years you’ll be earning a decent whack.We have over-stressed the importance and attraction of a college education to our young people, given them unrealistic expectations and made them pay through the nose for it. And at the same time we’ve devalued education by doing this.So there’s the challenge, Boris. Get on to the private sector and get some more apprenticeships up and running.And close down the awful former polytechnics charging a king’s ransom for a crap degree.ONE of the best things about BoJo becoming Prime Minister is that the perpetually screeching Yasmin Alibhai-Brown has vowed to leave the country.Brown loathes the white English working class.So it was always a mystery to me why she stayed in the country. Seeing as there are quite a lot of white, English, working-class people.Anyway, she vowed to get the hell outJohnson became PM.Trouble is, people say stuff like this but rarely act on it.I suggest we set up a crowdfunding page for her plane ticket and maybe throw in some extra money for en-route snacks and stuff.Off you go to Heathrow, Yazza.I MADE a list a few weeks ago about the  things I most dislike in the world.At No was Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals.At No was Taylor Swt.And No was cats .So take a guess as to what new film I’m not going to be watching any time soon It’s my nightmare, all wrapped up in two hours.CARL BEECH made a series of outrageous claims of sexual abuse, torture and murder by members of the old Conservative establishment.This serial liar and fantasist will soon be sentenced for his crimes.The reason the police believed this madman is because they have been told they must. They are no longer allowed to employ common sense.In order to be politically correct they have had to shed all semblance of judgment.THE job of a bookshop, you would have thought, is to sell books.Trouble is, they are useless at it. They are politically biased and cater solely to a tiny minority of gibbering liberals.I’ve got a book out at the moment, called The Great Betrayal – The True Story Of Brexit. I’ve had complaints from people who want to read it that they can’t find it in bookshops.The bookshop staff say they thought there wouldn’t be any interest in it. But it was the No best-seller in the country and was No on Amazon worldwide. It’s pure political bias.If you want the book – go on Amazon.TOP prize in the “Most Rational and Measured Response to Boris Johnson Becoming Prime Minister” goes to – of course – .For this headline: “The Clown Is Crowned As The Country Burns In Hell.”Followed by , words of hysterical drivel.Brilliant. The Left really don’t like it when they don’t get their own way.Anyway, this is but the first example of BDS – Boris Derangement Syndrome. Don’t worry. Lots more of it to come.MAGIC grandpa has a cunning plan!The Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn announced to the Press that he was going to “surprise Boris Johnson” by calling a vote of no confidence.Here’s a tip, you Jew-bothering, bearded c**kwomble.If you want something to be a surprise for someone, don’t tell every newspaper in the country.THE Islamist crackpots in Iran have hijacked two of our oil tankers. Causing a pretty grave crisis.But why isn’t the Royal Navy escorting British ships through the Strait of Hormuz, when we know the danger  Andthey’re not ready yet to do that, why did we impound an Iranian tanker three weeks ago, knowing there would be reprisals We have been naive and underprepared. I’m not sure anyone has noticed yet.Anyway, she immediately demonstrated her full-blooded support for democracy.She said evenpeople voted leave in a second referendum, she’d still ignore it.Swimsuit only likes democracy when people vote the way she wants. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

people who want to book their holidays through them.But as well as the fun, there has also been a number of disturbing sex attacks over the years.A woman from Blackburn was left facing a permanent disability after being ruthlessly beaten and raped as she waited for a friend outside a nightclub.She was found partly clothed, bruised and battered in a field after being sexually assaulted and beaten with a sharp wooden implement.The attack came as the resort started to gain popularity among young Brits.In  British soldier, Sam Trussler,  was jailed for four years for raping a British university student in Ayia Napa.Last year, an Irish holidaymaker was allegedly duped into following a man into a dark alley where he was then beaten up and gang raped.The -year-old claimed he had been enjoying a night out in the resort when he was lured by his attacker by the promise of buying tickets for a late bar.It’s not only young Brits involved in sex crimes in Ayia Napa.In , Patrik Isson, , was jailed in  for seven years raping a fellow Swedish tourist.The Foreign Office urges women to be vigilant and warns of the possible use of “the possible use of ‘date rape’ and other drugs including

his back in the attack.Another victim of violence in the town was soldier David Collins, who was stabbed to death at a nightclub in the early hours.The -year-old, from nd Battalion the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, had been due to fly to Afghanistan the day after he was killed.Such is the town’s reputation that the army put it out of bounds for soldiers.The move came after nine British soldiers were arrested and two others ended up in hospital after a bar-room brawl.The two locals were seriously injured when up to  soldiers burst into a bar in the early hours and began throwing bottles and smashing tables and chairs.Last year a holidaymaker from the UK was left critically ill with swelling in the brain after being beaten up by a gang of fellow Brits in Ayia Napa.The -year-old victim is said to have been attacked by up to a dozen British tourists in the early hours of the morning.Ayia Napa has also been linked to organised crime.Police sergeant Elias Hadjiefthimiou, , and his we

It’s a very normal British thing to say ‘Good Morning’ and pat a dog.“The Queen always chats to neighbours and even has tea with people on the estate as she’s very friendly with them. The ‘not petting the dog’ is particularly strange.“Maybe Harry doesn’t want people approaching them and using their dogs as an excuse to talk.

Knight, now , told nobody of his whereabouts when he retreated to remote woodland - claiming he had no friends and had zero interest in being part of society. Adventurous Knight, nicknamed the North Pole hermit, started his nomad le in  - turning his back on everything he had known in le. Initially heading down the East Coast of America, Knight steered North towards the state of Maine. He recalls listening to the radio remembering Ronald Reagan was President at the time and the Chernobyl nuclear disaster had recently shocked the world - this was the last contact he would have with outside world. After reaching Maine, his car slowly began to run out of fuel, so he drove until he couldn’t get any further.    Knight then casually tossed his car keys into the centre console, having no idea of what to expect as he literally waked into the unknown - the North Pond area of Maineaposs Belgrade Lakes. While some may choose the hermit lestyle for religious reasons, in the name of science or for a deeper self-understanding - Knightaposs only goal was to get lost in the woods forever. Food was sparse, with Knightaposs first meal reportedly being a road-killed partridge which he ate raw. But when the struggle to find meals became tougher, Knight began to camp in unoccupied cabins and steal food from gardens. He committed a thousand break-ins before getting caught. During his time in the wild, Knight lived in a make-sht camp created from a piece of tarpaulin stretched between trees.  Despite being just a few minutes walk from one of the hundreds of summer cabins in the area, Knight remained completely hidden for decades. Knight believed that being isolated was more of a communion and was happy to be free from the world. After  years, Knight was arrested and charged with burglary and theft. Author Mike Finkel- who wrote a book on Knight called The Stranger in the Woods: The Extraordinary Story of the Last True Hermit - visited Knight in prison to discuss his extraordinary time living in the wild.

The bunker was constructed during the Cold War in the s in response to the escalating tensions between the USA and Soviet Russia. Secret government documents released by the National Archives back in  revealed contingency plans in the event of a nuclear attack which included scrambling the Prime Minister to the bunker. There were  of the clandestine bunkers hidden around the country from which Britain’s emergency government would operate. Now pictures have emerged of this site, built on two storeys in Ullenwood, Gloucestershire. Gloucestershire Live says the subterranean complex covers an area of some  square metres and is encased in reinforced concrete walls, two-feet thick.    Situated at its heart is the map room with an observation balcony from which the dreaded in-coming Russian bombers would have been logged and anti-aircraft defences co-ordinated. Designed to be self-sufficient in the event of an attack, the bunker was hermetically sealed to prevent radiation poisoning and had its own water supply, generator, more than three dozen phone lines and ample storage space for provisions. By the end of the s, Ullenwood had become the headquarters for the Civil Defence Corps in Gloucestershire.    In , at the peak of the Cold War and only a year after the Cuban Missile Crisis brought the world to the brink of oblivion, the War Office sold the stronghold to Gloucestershire County Council as an emergency centre. During the mid-s the bunker was used for training purposes by Gloucestershire Fire and Rescue Service. Various uses were mooted for the bunker, one of which suggested that it could be used to house the county’s archives. But the council decided it wasn’t financially feasible and put the bunker and its . hectare site up for auction in  where it failed to make the reserve of £,.  The following year the property was bought by a local businessman who has since built a detached house in the grounds, leaving undisturbed the retired bunker that in the worst case scenario could have been the last home to the UK government. The now not-so-secret bunker can be found in rural countryside near small industrial buildings. But these buildings themselves are relics of the Second World War when the US army used the site as a military hospital. Between July  and September  up to , American servicemen could be accommodated at the hospital camp.

A spokesman for Buckingham Palace said: The Duke and Duchess had no knowledge of this briefing and no involvement in the concept or the content.  This was a well-intentioned briefing to help a small local community know how to welcome two new residents and help them with any potential encounter. There was no handout or letter.

Many were a tad nervous that it wouldnapost quite live up to the incredible display put on by Beijing four years earlier, but itaposs safe to say we werenapost disappointed. One of the highlights from the evening was the Queenaposs surprise appearance in a James Bond spoof, which saw  heading to Buckingham Palace to collect her for the celebrations. The Monarch is sitting at her writing desk and greets him with a simple Hello Mr Bond before she gets up and they walk through the palaceaposs corridors together. They then take a helicopter ride over to the Olympic Park where aposThe Queenapos does a parachute jump onto the ground below. A few moments later she walks out into the stadium to take her seat with Prince Philip, to the huge cheers of the thousands of spectators.    On a tour of the Olympic Park the following day Her Majesty told the then London Mayor Boris Johnson: ­“It all seemed to go very well last night. But I didn’t see my bit.” Boris told her: “You were ­brilliant Ma’am,” and she responded: “It was a bit of a laugh.”Buckingham Palace said she was ­“delighted” to be in the show, which she called “exceptional”. The Mirror revealed at the time that the Queen performed her part in one take and her own corgis Monty, ­Willow and Holly were used in the film. After Slumdog Millionaire director Danny came up with the Bond sequence idea, Locog chairman Lord Coe made a formal approach to Buckingham Palace – and Her Majesty loved the idea.    “It was not a case of having to persuade the Queen to take part,” an official said. “Her Majesty said ‘yes’ to it straight away. She thought it was such brilliant fun. And when the idea for the format was explained to her she was happy with that, too. When we came to filming it the Queen was a natural. Did it take long  No. Let’s just say we only had to film it once. “And yes they were the Queen’s corgis. We had others on stand-byit was required but we never needed to use them.” A senior royal aide added: “The Queen was very impressed by the opening ceremony. She said it went rather well, which it most certainly did. It is typical of the Queen to be understated but make no mistake she was very impressed. It was breathtaking.”    Danny yesterday praised the Queen’s acting skills and she was “very helpful and very sharp”. “You don’t have to tell her something twice,” he said. “She picks it up straight away, about ­cameras and ­angles. “And she was very gracious in giving us access really, and that’s what we wanted, that feeling to be throughout the whole ceremony. She is a good actor, she is good at it. Her and Danielgot on very well, her and James Bond got on very well so that was all tickety-boo, and the corgis were fine.” Her Majesty has never acted before but Prince Charles made a cameo appearance in an episode of Coronation Street and the ­Duchess of ­Cornwall has been on The Archers. In the film – watched by thousands of guests at the stadium and billions of TV viewers around the world – Bond calls on her at ­Buckingham Palace then they fly by helicopter through London to the Olympic site in Stratford. As the sequence finished a helicopter hovered above the stadium and two people dressed as the Queen and Bond jumped out and ­parachuted towards the stadium before landing outside.    The parachute jump was performed by ­stuntman and base jumper Gary Connery and Mark Sutton, a former officer in the Royal Gurkha Rles. Gary, who played the Queen, said of the experience: “It will hang in my memory until I become senile and can’t remember it any more. “What an occasion, what a thing to be involved in, absolutely stunning.” The Queen, who chose her outfit for the filming, was played by Miss Marple actress Julia ­McKenzie for the scene where she boards the helicopter. During TV coverage of the opening ceremony she was seen looking pensive before her brief speech to signy the start of the Games.

Up and down the land homes on estates once built to house the countryaposs post-war population have been turned into luxury holiday lets for affordable prices.Last weekreported on the phenomenon of people travelling to the UK from overseas and staying in former council houses. With the fearsome property market also squeezing the hotel sector, tourists are venturing further and further out of city centres to find somewhere affordable to stay. More often than not this means bedding down in an Airbnb, which had , active listings in the UK as of . Although the bulk of these are in privately owned properties always intended for the private market, a fair chunk are based in homes built and formerly rented out for reduced rent by local councils. While Margaret Thatcheraposs right-to-buy policy and the failure of successive governments to build replacement council houses might have seen the countryaposs stock tumble - from % of all houses socially owned in  compared to around % today - it has helped the private holiday let market flourish. Many such properties are situated on estates once considered no go areas including one aposcharming and chic apartmentapos on Quinney Crescent in Manchesteraposs notorious Moss Side.    For the low price of £ a night guests will be treated to two double bedrooms, one bathroom, free parking, wi and access to locations made famous by the Gunchester of the s. What was once a street at the centre of an epidemic of kne and gun crime is now an affordable place to stay not far from Manchesteraposs famous city centre. In a glowing review one guest wrote: Hosts communicated well, lovely space in a good location and good amenities nearby. Would highly recommend for a short or longer trip - any queries were resolved quickly.    One of the countryaposs best known and its outright biggest housing estate is Becontree in Dagenham, to the east of London. Stretching  square miles, Becontree was built in the interwar period as what was then the largest housing estate in the world, with , people living in , homes. Come move-in day the first tenants, who were mostly financially stable working-class families, marvelled at having indoor toilets and a private garden. Things were not completely hitch free however. The estates reservoir fed plumbing regularly froze the toilets and unkempt private hedges grew into out of control jungles. Imperfect as it may have been, it served as the heart of Britainaposs once extensive social housing system.  Today holiday makers can get a taste of le on the famous estate by staying in a spacious cosy double room roughly  miles from the capitalaposs centre. Key features include a laptop-friendly workspace, a dryer and a kitchen, all for just £ a night.    The third biggest estate in the UK is Gipton, a sea of houses built over a long retired mine to the east of Leeds. The estate came into being through the work of vicar Charles Jenkinson, who was determined to elevate his parishioners out of the squalid living conditions that characterised the area. When the Labour Party won municipal elections in  he convinced them to set up a housing committee with him as chair and set about laying the foundations. While it has had its fair share of challenges and high-profile crimes - including the rape and murder of two-year-old Casey Leigh Mullen by her uncle Michael Mullen back in  - Gipton is now a destination for travellers coming to the UK.  For £ a night vacationers can stay in a two bedroom house capable of holding six guests. Rooms are luxurious and perfectly located close to Leeds City, the Airbnb blurb reads. Beech House is fully furnished with bed linen and towels also provided. The House has ample natural light, flat – screen television and free high speed Wi. If the housing estates of Leeds and Manchester are starting to shed their rough reputations, then De Beauvoir Town in Hackney is well on the way to full gentricaiton. First formed in the middle s and serviced by a church paid for by Richard Benyon - whose heir of the same name is now the MP for Newbury and richest member of the House of Commons - the well to do area became populated by factories and multi-occupational properties come the th century. A third of the estate was demolished and high rise flats built in its place by Hackney Council during the s . Today the area is sought after for its views of Regentaposs Canal and easy commute to Brick Lane and Shoreditch Highstreet.

Before their trip to Ibiza, Callum and Ross had only known each other for a few months, but the trip has brought them closer. He said: “We only got to know each other around New Years January time, since then we had been shooting together and hanging out. The trip has definitely created a bond between us though.” After heading back to the room for an hour’s sleep, they went back to the airport again for an am flight, spending a mad  hours in on the Spanish island. Ross ended up going back to Ibiza a week later on June  for his  birthday, so he originally didn’t tell his family about the spontaneous trip.

Asked  direct questions by Jeremy Corbyn, he failed to answer a single one. Instead he showed contempt for the Com­mons and the public by showboating when he should have been serious and blustering when he should have been straightforward. It is hardly surprising he is running from scrutiny when he has such a cavalier approach. He is recklessly driving us towards a no-deal Brexit without any care for the consequences. If we crash out it will put firms and farmers out of business, threaten medical supplies and force food bills to rise. Those who will suffer will not be the PM and his privileged friends but the towns and communities which can least afford it. What became clear yesterday is that Johnson is interested only in his own survival. His Brexit strategy has nothing to do with what is best for the country and everything to do with heading off Nigel Farage.  Hot and hotter Few on holiday will complain about yesterday’s record temperatures. The heatwave is also great news for our seaside resorts.

It will also keep business rates at a sensible level, at no loss to the council. This will benefit Reform Street and the city centre.”The application by West One, based in the city’s Blinshall Street, is the first by any party to bring the amusement arcade back into use.But the plan comes hot on the heels of a blip in confidence among business owners on Reform Street, who spoken of its “second album syndrome” following a resurgence in food outlets that began with Project Pizza in .The eatery, initially hailed as the shape of things to come, closed without warning last month and the unit is now advertised for let.Proprietors such as Akky Hayat – who runs German Doner Kebab and Fatburger – say punitive business rates are discouraging others from opening shops on the street.Mr Chadwick has not been discouraged. He added: “Footfall is rising and there are positive steps in the regeneration of the area.“The demise of Project Pizza is a minor setback to a street that is on the up.”However, it is hard to ignore the units once home to Victoria Wine, TSB and Swinton Insurance, which have remained conspicuously empty long after they have closed."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/06/5d077b2511d578.29027818-e1560779961602.jpg ","title":"a look back at some of dundee uniteds most famous foes including messi and gazza","story":"Dundee United’s final friendly of the summer comes on Saturday when preparations for the build-up to the Championship season are completed with a -mile trip south to face Shrewsbury Town.The game will be a valuable exercise for boss Robbie Neilson as he makes sure his players have had enough game time to be ready for the opener against Inverness on Saturday week.In terms of prestige, there’s no denying the English League One opposition fall into the “modest” category.There was a time, though, when the Tangerines were in the habit of hosting top opposition at this time of year.It led to some great occasions – and great victories – at Tannadice. Today the Tele looks back at some of those memorable days.DUNDEE UTD  SPURS Tuesday, August , Att: ,A Spurs side that boasted the likes of Argentine World Cup winners Ossie Ardiles and Ricky Villa, England’s Glenn Hoddle and the new strike partnership of Steve Archibald and Garth Crooks, were blown away by a United side that would reach the peak of its powers over the next few seasons.The Londoners started well and led through a Crooks goal as early as the th minute but, by the break, Billy Kirwood had levelled.After the interval, Jim McLean’s men stepped up a gear and goals from Graeme Payne, Derek Addison and Paul Sturrock gave them a handsome victory over a team that, within a year, would win a classic FA Cup Final against Manchester City.DUNDEE UTD  ASTON VILLA Sunday, August , Att: ,A year before that superb display against Spurs, United entertained Aston Villa, with striker Paul Sturrock once again to the fore.With United dominating from start to finish, “Luggy” bagged a hat-trick to send Ron Saunders’ outfit heading back south with their tails between their legs.If not too much was made about the victory, it was a sign the Tangerines were on the verge of big things and, within months, McLean’s team would secure the club’s first major honour in the shape of the League Cup.It’s also worth remembering, in just two years, Villa would be champions of England and, a year later, more than half the team that ran out at Tannadice would start their winning European Cup Final against Bayern Munich.DUNDEE UTD  EVERTON Tuesday, July , Att: ,.This game was a testimonial for long-serving Maurice Malpas, with his influential former coach Walter Smith bringing Everton to mark the occasion.If the English Premier League giants were already a sizeable draw, their signing of Paul Gascoigne, who would make his debut, brought extra attention that saw news as well as football media heading for Tannadice, although tragic events in Paris as a Concorde crashed, meant, ultimately, actual coverage of it was limited.As was often the case with Gazza, trouble was not far away. He had a first-half flare-up with Joachim Fernandez that saw the home trialist take such exception that boss Paul Sturrock took him off before he was sent off.Malpas’ big night was marked with a win, David Weir giving the visitors the lead before two goals in three second-half minutes from Steven Thompson and Alex Mathie turned things round.DUNDEE UNITED  BARCELONA Saturday, July , Att: ,For the second year running, the Catalan giants had used United’s St Andrews University training base for the first week of their pre-season build-up and that meant fans were treated to a second summer friendly in a row against them at Tannadice.A year earlier, minus Lionel Messi because he was still on holiday, Ronaldinho and Thierry Henry were the stars as a last-gasp goal by the French great gave them victory.With Messi starting, the  friendly saw the Spaniards really turn up as they blasted five past the Tangerines .For once, though, such a reversal was surely acceptable, such was the quality of the opposition and just the sight of one of the world’s greatest players in action meant everyone went home happy.

There was nothing, not my arms or my foot.“I think he expected me to sweep with my right foot, but I didn’t.“I watched the penalty incident back and it was not a penalty.“I was so surprised when the referee blew the whistle as I thought surely he is going to give him a yellow for a e.“When he pointed at the penalty spot, I was so surprised.“We could have got a win. After that penalty we still dominated the game.“Overall, with the away goal and - – we will take that.”The contentious penalty, which was converted by Giorgi Koripadze, came towards the end of the first half.It was the second blow in Georgia as defender Ash Taylor limped off after just  minutes with a hamstring injury.But Ojo was always confident the Dons would fly out of Tbilisi with control of the tie. Striker Sam Cosgrove netted a penalty in the second half, awarded for hand ball.Aberdeen face Chikhura in theleg at Pittodrie on Thursday, and up for grabs is a clash against HNK Rijeka of Croatia in the third qualying round.Ojo said: “In a game you know things like thatcan happen.“I just thought that because it wasn’t a penalty we would go and correct it.“We were dominating the game and I knew we were going to get off the pitch with a good result.”Ojo was pitched straight in from the start for his debut, having signed from Scunthorpe in a £, deal.Aberdeen beat Premiership rivals Hibs to the signature of the former PSV Eindhoven midfielder.Ojo held talks with Hibs boss Paul Heckingbottom just days before travelling up to the Granite City for discussions with Dons boss Derek McInnes.Ultimately McInnes’ sales pitch convinced the former Belgian Under- international to commit to the Dons on a three-year contract.Ojo missed the first qualying round defeat of RoPS Rovaniemi of Finland because he was signed after the UEFA deadline to register players. He was delighted to get a full  minutes of action.Ojo said: “I was happy to play and initially the plan was I would play  minutes, but I got  in. I managed to get in that extra time and we also got a decent result.”Ojo experienced European action during his time at Dutch side PSV. The midfielder admits playing at that level was a factor in signing for the Dons.He said: “I have played in Europe before and it is something I wanted to do again.“So it was a big factor in signing for Aberdeen.”Former Beerschot, Royal Antwerp, FC Dordrecht and Willem II player Ojo operated in midfield alongside Lewis Ferguson and fellow summer signing Craig Bryson for most of the game. Scotland international Bryson was named on the bench having recovered from an ankle ligament injury sustained at his former club Derby County at the end of last season.He made his debut earlier than anticipated when Taylor was taken off.Ojo said: “I am looking forward to playing with them .“This was our first game together and it is just a case of getting to know one another.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.44350204-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.44350204-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.44350204-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.44350204-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"council seeking feedback","story":"A north-east local authority is seeking feedback from council tenants as part of a policy review.Aberdeenshire Council is looking for views from council tenants as well as people on the waiting list on the policy that guides how properties are allocated.The policy is being updated to take account of changes introduced by the HousingAct  and a move towards reducing timescales for rehousing tenants.The council currently has around , properties for rent and plans to invest more than £ million in the delivery of affordable housing over the next five years as part of its Strategic Housing Investment Plan.The plan could see more than , additional homes built across the area, with close to , of those proposed for social rent.Open until August , the survey can be found at bit.ly AlloPol"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 7 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsIt is disappointing that Michael Matheson was unable to attend his second A task force meeting in a row.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"improving attitudes to health","story":"Barabel McKayUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsLast year we were studying the Argyll and Bute Health and Social Care Partnership#Transforming Together#   document, which presented a vision of combining our will and skills to create a healthy future for the citizens of Argyll.The promises in that did not translate into reality.Now, a  beautully constructed and presented Living Well document is available.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

He turned Duncan MacKinnon inside-out before flicking an inch-perfect ball to Fraser Watt on the left of the D and he slammed the ball high into the middle of the goal from  yards to make it -.Lochaber had their first shot on goal on six minutes when Ben Delaney found space on the left but his strike went wide of the left-hand post.Inveraray were showing good movement up front and they increased their advantage on nine minutes. The goal came from a corner and Garry MacPherson caught the Lochaber defence napping as he played the ball low from a wide area towards the front post where full centre Lewis MacNicol waltzed into the box and his first-time shot beat the helpless Callum MacDonald to make it -.Lochaber keeper MacDonald pulled off a great save on  minutes as he blocked Garry MacPherson’s fine drive from the left with his chest before clearing the ball to safety.Lochaber’s Ben Delaney and Stuart Callison tested Inveraray keeper Scott MacLachlan but it was the Winterton side who would add a third goal on  minutes. Again the goal came from Lewis MacNicol winning possession, this time deep in Lochaber territory, and he found the ever-alert Garry MacPherson whose defence-splitting pass picked out Fraser Watt running in unmarked through the heart of the Lochaber defence and he slotted the ball low past the keeper from close range.Lochaber were now up against it but, on  minutes, Conor Sweeney took a corner from the right, sending the ball into the danger-area. Stuart Callison found space to slam the ball goalwards and although Scott MacLachlan saved with his feet, he was unable to get the ball away and Ben Delaney was quick to react as he poked the ball over the line to make it - at the interval and give Lochaber hope.Lochaber started the second period with intent and Scott MacLachlan pulled off a great save to thwart Stuart Callison on  minutes.However, Lochaber’s never-say-die attitude got them right back into the match with just  minutes remaining. Lachlan Campbell played the ball across from the right and it came perfectly to the on-running Findlay MacDonald and his  yard shot from the left flew past the keeper to make it -, setting up a tense finishLochaber had a great chance to snatch a point on  minutes when referee John Angus Gillies awarded them a spot-hit, penalising keeper MacLachlan for a “kick” inside the D. Ben Delaney’s well-struck effort went straight down the middle and MacLachlan redeemed himself, saving superbly with his stick before clearing the ball for a corner.Inveraray saw out the rest of the game to claim two valuable points in what was a cleanly fought contest with no cards shown.The win sets Inveraray up for another crucial relegation battle this time at Kilmallie this coming Saturday.Caberfeidh  Kyles Athletic Kyles Athletic came from behind to beat Caberfeidh - in their pm throw up at Castle Leod.Caberfeidh have been on a bit of a scoring spree of late and they took the lead in the opening minute through Craig Morrison.It didn’t take Kyles long to level with Ross MacRae netting on  minutes and Colin MacDonald’s effort on  minutes meant they went into the break - ahead.Ross MacRae got his second on  minutes with Colin MacDonald doing like-wise with just  minutes remaining.Mowi South Division Inveraray  Kyles Athletic The Inveraray seconds and the Kyles Athletic seconds met in a match originally rearranged Thursday  July which was then put back  hours.Kane Kirkhope was playing in a more advanced role for Inveraray and he scored a well-taken goal in eight minutes after some impressive forward play.John MacKenzie was working hard in the middle of the park and he set up Inveraray’s second goal on  minutes. MacKenzie found Campbell Watt who let go a  yard strike which gave the Kyles keeper no chance.Inveraray sealed both points when Campbell Watt continued his good scoring run with his second goal of the game with  minutes remaining."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes the limit for dancer jessica","story":"Janet WestUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWith Highland Games season in full fling, one talented Ardrishaig dancer scooped three first places in three dferent events last week.Eight year old Jessica McCrae, a pupil at Ardrishaig Primary, was crowned winner in the beginners section at Rosneath, Inveraray and Taynuilt Highland Games.

Guard this Standard securely and bear yourself well that you may long retain the trust of your fellow townspeople.\"Standard Bearerrsquos Lass Caitlin Urquhart, was then called upon to invest Ronan with his sash and buss his colours.After cheers that raised the roof off the historical hall, Caitlin was presented with her Cleikum Brooch.Addressing the audience, the newly installed Standard Bearer said: \"It is a great honour for me to be chosen as Standard Bearer of my native town, which at this time celebrates the traditions associated with its history. To our Dux Boy, Aaron, who tonight keeps alive the memory of our Patron Saint, St. Ronan, I tender my congratulations and best wishes for a successful year in office.\"As Standard Bearer for , it will be my earnest endeavour to honour the memory of the founders of St. Ronanrsquos Border Games by carrying the Blue Banner of St. Ronanrsquos for the ensuing year.

sector watchdog, over concerns regarding the purchase of the former Lowood Estate at Tweedbank.Including legal fees and taxes, Scottish Borders Council has spent nearly pound million on purchasing land to the south of the River Tweed with a view to building hundreds of houses and an industrial estate there.The council estimates that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, the SNPrsquos Christine Grahame, who represents Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale at Holyrood, has referred the council to Audit Scotland, which acts as an independent regulator for public sector accounts.Ms Grahame highlights a number of concerns regarding the purchase, including the use of tax havens to purchase the land and the fact that the council paid pound.m for the land, which is more than the UK Governmentrsquos district valuer said the land was worth.Despite this, Scottish Borders Council and its  elected members refuse to tell the Borders general public how much more the council paid for the land, and the authority has rejected freedom of information requests for the valuation figure.The pound.m of taxpayersrsquo money used to pay for the purchase ended up in two Cayman Islands accounts, where businesses do not pay transaction tax.Landowner Alexander Hamilton, who sold the estate to the council, was paid via Lowood Estates Ltd and Genesis Trust  Corporate Services Ltd, both of which are based in the British overseas territory.On the other hand, Borders taxpayers face paying a pound, land and buildings transaction tax, as well as a pound, VAT bill, which along with other fees and charges brings the cost of the purchase up to nearly poundm.Scottish Borders Council also confirmed that the cost of temporary borrowing for the purchase sits at pound,, assuming the loan is paid off over a ten year period.Ms Grahame states: ldquoThere is a very big stushie about the purchase by Scottish Borders Council of Lowood estate, partly because the purchase price appears to have been above valuation.ldquoAdditionally, the Tory-led local authority has paid out to landowner Alexander Hamilton via Lowood Estates and Genesis Trust and Corporate Services, based in the Cayman Islands.ldquoSo the purchase price of pound.m for the  acres of land was not subject to transaction tax.ldquoThis means that Borders taxpayers will be forking out pound, in land and buildings transaction tax, plus a pound, VAT bill, which with other fees brings the bill to some poundm.ldquoThere are also challenges to the housing development planswhich are seemingly light on necessary detail, raising serious questions about this Tory councilrsquos grasp of economic reality.ldquoNever mind, pupils may be able to follow this saga on their pound.m iPads.Ms Grahame also highlights a report from Edinburgh-based property consultants Ryden, which the council commissioned, and a report from Chicago-based property consultants James Lang LaSalle, which was commissioned by Middlemede Properties.Middlemede Properties is an Isle-of-Man registered company which owns the salmon fishing along the bank of the Tweed at Lowood.Ms Grahame continues in her column: ldquoIn the meantime, I have read through reams of material, including both the Ryden report on the purchase and a report by JLL.ldquoMy concerns have, as a result, increased, so I have now reported Scottish Borders Council to the Accounts Commission and as it refuses to publish the district valuerrsquos reporthave asked the assessorrsquos office for sight of that.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: ldquoElected members considered the Ryden report in full, along with a series of other information, in May  and had access to all this information and more ahead of making the final decision to proceed with the purchase of Lowood Estate in December .ldquoThe acquisition of the site by Scottish Borders Council is part of a long term strategy that will enable appropriate development opportunities to be taken forward by both the private and public sector.ldquoScottish Borders Council remains strongly of the view that the economic viability of the site will best be secured through a joint public and private sector approach and is pursuing that approach as agreed by council last December.ldquoThe consideration of economic viability must not just look at the simple cost of the purchase but also the long-term economic benefits of jobs that will be created during construction phases, through employment as part of its mixed use, and through the provision of homes for both local people and those who wish to relocate to this area."},{"url":null,"title":"clive-storey-s-masquerade-takes-supreme-st-boswells-show","story":"THE Newtown St Boswells and District Farmers Show took place at St Boswells Auction Mart on Saturday.The

We are all engaging more online, but the conversations are getting shorter and colder.ldquoThese conversations would be more positive and productivewe could host them in a social context.ldquoWhatrsquos needed is a lsquoFaceFaceBookrsquo where the digital world is used to increase the physical interaction.They have suggested that a large screen cover the back of the building behind the stage that could act as a cinema screen, a digital backdrop to a theatre show and a space for presentations and gaming competitions.Although it is only in the very early stages of planning, the concept was well received by the community council, with member Ferhan Ashiq saying that he was ldquovery impressed with the bold and innovative idea.The community council has the option to either lease or buy the Town Hall from East Lothian Council, and this decision has not been officially made yet but will be the next step that is taken, discussing a business plan and the terms of the transfer with the local authority.The approach is laid out in the strategy, which states that the community council will ldquoreview the best practice from where and arrange research visits to similar facilities. We then refine our idea, seeking feedback from people in Prestonpans. Then we follow the commercial path of least resistance, working with East Lothian Council and other bodies. We bootstrap the idea ASAP with initial funding needed to install the equipment, secure and manage the premise. Then we use the success of the venue to fundraise for improvements and enhancements to the structure of the building to renovate the interior.Brian Weddell, chair of the community council, said: ldquoI was delighted that the feedback from community council members was  per cent positive.ldquoIt is an exciting and imaginative use of a grossly under-used community asset that could help kickstart the revitalisation of Prestonpans High Street.The Town Hall was identied as one of the six viable properties across the county suitable for a CAT, offering local organisations the chance to lease or buy them."},{"url":null,"title":"preview-3-harbours-festival","story":"Residents and visitors alike can enjoy art galleries, live music events, family afternoons with pebble decorating and ukulele orchestras, open houses, cooking demonstrations and workshops over the course of the festival, which runs from Saturday to next Sunday .The festival, which was started more than  years ago, is going from strength to strength, expanding and becoming more erse, with something for everyone in its programme.For the live music fans out there, there is a chance to see the Tom Fairnie Band play their famous Americana music supported by Paul Brown, then Andy Brown, Dropkick and Fuzzystar for the Indie lovers, Alex Hodgson and Rhys Heaven for the folk fans, and to get an eclectic mix all in one sitting, there are the Live on the Lawn sessions, an afternoon of music in the majestic Cockenzie House and Gardens .To keep the young ones and old ones entertained all at once, this year will see a Harbour Family Afternoon added to the programme.

She was regarded as an lsquoincomerrsquo, however, as she was born at Bolton, a couple of miles away, where she likely spent much of her childhood. When and how she came to Haddington I cannot say, or what her childhood was like, but it seems clear she was poor and for her, le was a struggle.She seems to have found companionship with Elizabeth Golight, who was Haddington born and bred. Perhaps they were neighbours in Haddington. Whatever their circumstances, they drew the attention of others and found themselves in court.This is how they came to the attention of another woman from another century: Ros Parkyn. She sadly died only a few weeks ago, but her le was full of stories and love for people, and she had an especially sharp eye for injustice and empathy for people unfairly treated or judged.Ros was browsing in the John Gray Centre in  and noticed a temporary display of mixed objects and records from their collections. There was a volume of court records laid open for perusal and Ros peered at the entries.The entries hadnrsquot been transcribed but she could just make out that they were accounts of the trials of two women who lived in Haddington in . The th-century handwriting, with its dferent spelling, was very dficult to read in the display case, and so Ros asked the staffit was possible to take the document from the case.A friendly and helpful staff member obliged, then sat down with Ros and assisted her to transcribe the writing. It wasnrsquot easy sometimes they couldnrsquot decipher a word at all, while others seemed to be spelt dferently at dferent times. But gradually, as Ros wrote the words down, she became introduced to Agnes and Elizabeth.There were accounts of others too, but she was particularly taken with the account of these two women, the language used to describe them, and the cruel punishments they suffered.In the account, Agnesrsquos name is spelt in three dferent ways, but was likely Blake or Black.Here is the transcription Ros made:January Agnes Blaik Indweller in Haddington born in the parish of Boulton and Elizabeth Golight, daughter to William Golight, born in this parish being both accused and imprisoned as guilty of lewdness and uncleanliness with many dferent persons. Elizabeth Golight confesses that since Michaelmas last she has been guilty of uncleanliness with several persons and Agnes Blaikie confesses she was formerly convict of uncleanliness and that she was a bad woman ndash But not of late. But acknowledges she lives in a house alone and that there has been dragoons with her in the house. Which being considered by the Magistrates they find Elizabeth Golight is a vicious strumpet and to their certain information Agnes Blaik is a vicious lewd woman. And therefore they ordain both the said Elizabeth Golight and Agnes Blaik be taken to the cross Friday next with the officers and Hangman and there to stand sometime with a paper or sack of theirhellip donating their crime and thereafter be conveyed tohellip with beat of the drum and to be banished forever out of the borough with certicationever they or either one of themto or be seen in this burgh they shall be whipped by the hangman.Signed Andrew Dixon, George Cunningham, Bailies.But it seems the harsh punishment did not prevent them from ing to the town, for Ros came across another two entries:th May Appeared with Janet Golight her mother Elizabeth for repeating acts of lewdness and stealing from Robina Mucklersquos shop. Both found guilty and sent to the House of Correction in Edinburgh to be kept at hard work for  years. Should be whipped by the hangman and burnt on the cheek.th June Agnes Black ed to buy a gown for herself and so was sentenced to be whipped through the town and banished.Ros later sent me her transcriptions, saying: ldquoI love the way Agnes confessed she lsquowas a bad woman ndash but not of latersquo. It rings out over the centuries. And I have a definite dislike for the bailies pronouncing on the lsquovicious strumpetrsquo and the lsquovicious lewd womanrsquo, particularly as there is no mention of any man being named, despite the men being lsquoto their certain informationrsquo!Ros had emailed me the transcription in January  and wrote to me: ldquoI thought it was a tale worth telling and you could weave your magic on it and perhaps find a happy ending.To my regret, I only came across this email last week, as it had somehow remained unopened in my inbox for over two years. I admit to being technically useless on computer matters!But a happy ending  Itrsquos clear both Agnes and Elizabeth had very harsh lives, and on the surface there seems little scope for a truly happy ending.The description of them is misogynistic and full of double standards, as Ros pointed out.So what were these women really like  The writer tries to paint a picture of awful human beings, but the image of poor Agnes secretly creeping back into town, no doubt in a state of desperation, to ldquobuy herself a gown and then being whipped as a punishment gives a dferent story. The punishments for both women are barbaric and utterly unjust.Then I realised that there was a happy ending. That happy ending was in late , when Ros walked into the John Gray Centre and found out about Agnes and Elizabeth. She read the account with human understanding and saw through the prejudice to glimpse at the women themselves and understand just how wrongly they had been treated and judged. And so she spoke up for them and gave them a place in history, while turning the judgment on their accusers.Thatrsquos a happy ending I know Ros would have liked."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-surfer-features-new-advert-carling","story":"The five surfers ndash aged between  and  ndash took on the waves for a national advertising campaign for the beer giant called lsquoMade Localrsquo.Retired roofer Ian McKay, from Whitekirk, was joined by Jason Burnett, Douglas Brown and Dee Ripol, all from Edinburgh, with filming taking place over two days nearly two years ago.

represents North Berwick, said: ldquoThere has been a move within the town to have some sort of commemorative something around the town.ldquoThe proposal at the moment is that there is a new sports pitch being built up at the new housing by the high school.ldquoThere is to be a pavilion there and the proposal is we name it the Pilmar Smith Pavilion and a plaque goes up to that effect.ldquoIt

Smith in November last year.ldquoPilmar had lived in North Berwick for around  years and was as well-known as he was well loved.ldquoOne can only imagine how long it took Pilmar to walk from one end of High Street to the other when you consider that almost every person he passed would stop him for a lsquoquick chatrsquo!ldquoFollowing requests from residents, the community council agreed that something was required to commemorate Pilmar and local elected councillor Jim Goodfellow suggested that the new football pavilion might be the ideal site.ldquoGiven that Pilmar was a lelong fan of Hearts Football Club, where he also served as a director and vice-chairman for more than a decade, this seemed a fitting tribute.ldquoThe community council have since allocated funding to purchase a

and paint one of the Oor Wullie sculptures, I spent a week in April bringing my design to le.ldquoI had some aching muscles and very sore knees after crawling around the larger-than-le sculpture to

The current law around surrogacy is outdated and doesnrsquot reflect modern medical advances or changes in social attitudes. Surrogacy is a particularly sensitive and emotionally demanding process for everyone involved so we welcome anything which simplies or modernises the legislation. A draft report is anticipated, followed by draft legislation by  but their proposals offer a clear indication about the recommended direction of travel, she says.Parental ordersCurrently, the surrogate, and her spouse ndash she has one ndash are the legal parents of the child at birth and their names are noted on the birth certicate. The intended parents must make an application to the court for a parental order to be recognised as the childrsquos parents, with the legal rights and responsibilities this entails. This can take around six months to process which she points out can pose several potential problems. The first is that while the intended parents are socially and psychologically the parents, that doesnrsquot match the legal position, which can cause identity problems. On the flip side, the surrogate doesnrsquot normally view herself as the childrsquos mother, but the law does. Secondly,the child needs medical care during the first six months of their le the intended parents will likely not have any legal standing to take medical decisions about the young child in their care, which is not on any view a good situation for the child.ldquoAt the moment there is a considerable gap between peoplersquos expectations and the law and signicant potential for misunderstandings. This is not a positive environment in which to welcome a child and we are pleased to see this being tackled as part of the review, says Maciver.She explains that the Law Commissionsrsquo lsquonew pathwayrsquo will have several positive outcomes: it will allow intended parents to become the legal parents from birth in some cases remove of the need for a genetic link between the intended parents and the child in some cases establish a new regulator for surrogacy create a register to allow those born of surrogacy arrangements to access information and for international surrogacy arrangements help those who have a child abroad to bring their child back to the UK with less red tape.The new framework, she says will set out proactive measures including ndashintroducing pre-conception safeguards that are built in before the baby is conceived to help to avoid problems later in the process. ldquoThe proposal is that before the child is conceived there must be a written agreement between the surrogate and the parent, an independent assessment of the childrsquos welfare, the intended parents and the surrogate are all bound to take independent legal advice so that they understand the process, they are all medically screened and criminal checks are carried out, she explains.The intended parents and the surrogate are also required to go to implications counselling to help establish the foundation for an appropriate and positive relationship.Which all sounds like an onerous process ndashbut itrsquos one which Maciver believes will actually signicantly enhance the current situation. ldquoItrsquos more proactive and sees the introduction of meaningful safeguards ndashwhich will hopefully reduce the problems that can sometimes arise after the birth of a child and provide clarity for those entering into a surrogacy arrangement exactly whatrsquos expected of them.The overseas optionOwing to the restrictions on commercial surrogacy in the UK and the dficulty in finding willing surrogates some people choose to go to countries where commercial surrogacy is legally possible ndashwhich often leads to further complications when trying to bring the baby back to the UK.Overseas situations, she says, account for approximately half of surrogacies and they will still have to apply for a parental order, which is also getting an overhaul. For example, currently the intended parents have to apply for that within six months of the child being born, which is a relatively narrow window. The proposal is remove that time limit. They are also proposing changes to make it easier and quicker to get a passport or visa to bring the child to live with them in Scotland. Unlike other areas of family law in Scotland, , surrogacy is an area that has seen cultural attitudes change faster than legislation and Maciver believes that the Law Commissionsrsquo proposals are welcome, though not perfect.While commercial surrogacy is banned, reasonable payments are allowed, which leads to grey areas which the proposals donrsquot yet address, for example, what is reasonable and what strays into lsquopaymentrsquo ldquoThe law in this instance is very dficult to apply, says Maciver. If the payment is higher than reasonably anticipated what options does the court have  There has so far been no refusal of a parental order based on the level of payment but itrsquos probably the most contentious area in the consultation. Itrsquos one in which people hold strong opposing views and so the Law Commissions have canvassed opinion about how these limitations should be set and enforced.Single parentsIn the meantime, though she is encouraged by the fact that in January the law was changed following a challenge to the Human Rights Act  meaning that single parents can now apply for a parental order. ldquoThis was the single most urgent issue: previously only married couples, civil partners, cohabitants or people in other enduring relationships could apply.And the future  Maciver says that there are dfering views about the best route forward ndashand of course the proposed changes are still at consultation stage. But she believes that the new pathwayis long overdue and will have very positive effect, improving the way that surrogacy works and better protecting the interests of surrogates, intended parents and ultimately the children involved.Which is a community whose numbers are fast increasing.Jenner Maciver, is head of family law at law firm Gillespie Macandrew, whocombine specialist, practical advice with a responsive, supportive and discrete service.For more information abouthow Gillespie Macandrew can help please visitwww.gillespiemacandrew"},{"url":null,"title":"first-look-haddingtons-newly-refurbished-swimming-pool","story":"Work got under way at the pool and health suite within the townrsquos Aubigny Sports Centre in April and ndash after a delay ndash the pool is due to re-open on Monday.Essential maintenance and interior deacutecor works have been carried out at the sports centre, off Mill Wynd, over several weeks.During the work, the two pools were drained, with a new light, bright ceiling covering the outdated wood cladding.New lighting has also been installed while the locker rooms have also been given a facelt and tiles have been given a thorough clean.The new-look pool was revealed to enjoyleisure members and politicians on Friday afternoon.The facility is one of East Lothianrsquos original sports centres and originally opened its doors as Haddington Swimming Pool in September .The much-loved site consists of a four-lane swimming pool and East Lothianrsquos only dedicated infant pool.Before the temporary closure, the facility welcomed about , bathers to the pool each week for swimming lessons, AquaFit classes, swimming club training, school and public use."},{"url":null,"title":"pictures-musselburgh-festival-kirkin-sashing-2019","story":"Here are some photos from the events.There are a host of events still coming up: the full list of events during the festival is available here."},{"url":null,"title":"county-talent-fore-fringe-sea","story":"County residents are putting on a large number of shows and workshops over the  days.North Berwickrsquos own historian and author Ailsa Fortune, who will be presenting a talk on the Elgin Marbles, said: ldquoIt is encouraging that the Fringe by the Sea organisers include local performers and authors in their programme ndash itrsquos really good for the collective morale of this vibrant community.ldquoTherersquos always a great buzz about the place when the festival is in full swing.ldquoFor me personally, appearing at Fringe by the Sea is an opportunity to share my work on some of the little-known but intriguing East Lothian characters, like Mary Nisbet of Dirleton, whose lives have influenced our national history, and Irsquom hoping the connection with the Elgin Marbles, currently the subject of international debate, will stimulate lots of interest.Ailsarsquos book, Par for the Ladies, looks at the women who shaped the golfing legacy of North Berwick.

and Daniel McCabe, all , to speak to Prestonpans Community Council about their work and the potential involvement of much younger participants.The school was recently successful in achieving its UNICEF Rights Respecting School gold award, which means that it had proved that it incorporates the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child into the school through both teaching and actions.It now aims to take this further and bring this ethos into the surrounding community.The children were given the chance of addressing the meeting, which included ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell and Neil Gilbert, to ask questions and discuss the best ways to engage young people with what is going on in the community and to ensure their input is noted.The children asked about the plans for the site of the former Cockenzie Power Station and whether more activities for young people such as Rainbows and Scouts could be introduced to the areaWhen addressing the councillors and community councillors, Daniel, a house captain from St Gabrielrsquos, said: ldquoItrsquos important for us at this stage to know what our future is going to hold, and to try and make a dference when and where we can.ldquoTo be involved in the community council in some way would be fantastic, as it would give us comfort to know that the community is being taken care of, as well as what decisions were being made that might affect us.It was decided that the community council would send the agenda for each meeting to the school a few days before the meeting took place so that the children could see it and comment on any issues being raised.The community council said in a statement: ldquoWe would like to thank the four fantastic pupils from St Gabrielrsquos Primary School who attended the community council.ldquoIt was so refreshing to have such polite and knowledgeable young people along to one of our meetings to share their opinions and views on our agenda topics and ask the questions they feel most relevant to their lives.ldquoWe look forward to welcoming them along to future meetings and collaborating with them on the issues that affect all of us living in

to gear people up for his show.Were you interested in dinosaurs as a child Not just dinosaurs, but anything prehistoric. My first fossil find was on a beach near where I grew up. I was five years old and was on a day out with mum and dad. We wound the fossilised shell of a belemnite, which was a relative of the squid we see alive today. It was over  million years old and that blew my socks off! It made me start questioning where all these ancient animals went, why we donrsquot have dinosaurs around now and how the planet could be so old. Obviously, I loved dinosaurs too and loved reading about them in all my old books, imagining what it would be like to see a T. rex walking through my garden.Why are so many children obsessed with them So many people are obsessed with dinosaurs, both kids and adults alike. Itrsquos hard to pin down exactly why we love them so much and I think itrsquos for a few dferent reasons. First of all, when we are growing up we love to learn lots of facts about things . . . the speed of fast cars maybe or the size of planets in space. Dinosaurs are the same and we love to learn how fast an Allosaurus could run or discover which was the biggest. I also think they inspire us through being so big, fierce and scary but we feel safe because we know dinosaurs can never hurt us because theyrsquore all extinct You are described as an lsquoevolutionary biologistrsquo ndash what exactly does that entail Irsquom a Professor of Evolutionary Biology at the University of East Anglia. Sounds fancy doesnrsquot it but itrsquos the coolest job in the world. The lsquoBiologyrsquo bit just means I get to study all sorts of le ndash it could be anything that is alive or was ever alive, so anything from a chimpanzee or a Troodon, to a butterfly or monkey puzzle tree. The lsquoEvolutionrsquo bit means I study how these living organisms change and adapt over time. How does a changing marine environment affect sharks or how does predation from birds affect camouflage in lizards  All these changes are down to evolution. I study le and how it changes, and I share that knowledge with as many people as possible. Being a scientist means you get to study cool stuff like this every single day.How many books have you written I have written six books so far. My series lsquoSo You Think You Know About Dinosaursrsquo are pretty cool, evenI do say so myself. I wanted them to be the most up to date dinosaur books in  million years and although I wanted them to be enjoyed by young readers, the content should be the same as that which I teach to university students. I know young readers really want to learn and we donrsquot need to dumb stuff down, but with a few more cartoons, quizzes and examples, I think they can be enjoyed by young and older readers. Each book focuses on just one species and it was so hard to pick just six. Eventually, I chose Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, Stegosaurus, Diplodocus, Velociraptor and Spinosaurus. Therersquos something there for everyone and between them, these dinosaurs really tell the complete story.Herersquos something we all want to know ndash which dinosaur would have been the most dangerous to humans Arrrrrgh, this is such a tough question. Is one T. rex worse than one hundred velociraptors  Even something like a Triceratops could have been deadly. Itrsquos easier to say which dinosaurs would have been safe . . . there wouldnrsquot have been many. Stegosaurus had tail spikes around one metre long, Ankylosaurus had a tail club which could have destroyed a car and Argentinosaurus weighed so much that yoursquod definitely want to be stepped on. And theyrsquore just the herbivores! Imagine what the meat-eaters would have done.And which was the very biggest Ah, this is a question I get asked a lot. There has been huge debate and even some arguments between scientists. Irsquom not going to give it away ndash yoursquoll have to come to my show and find out. Irsquoll give you a clue . . . itrsquos not the one you think it is.What dinosaurs would have roamed around this country many millions of years ago This is a really hard one to answer for each show right now. We had so many prehistoric species that wersquore spoilt for choice now. We had giant sauropods up on the Western Isles in Scotland, early relatives of T. rex in Wales and even the fish-eating Baryonyx on the Isle of Wight. There are also discoveries of marine reptiles such as the dolphin-like ichthyosaurs and super-predator pliosaurs all around our coastlines all the time. The best thing to do is get out there and go have a look or visit your local museum and discover what used to swim, fly, run and plod around near where you live, millions of years ago.Were numbers declining before whatever environmental catastrophe wiped them out about m years ago and would they have become extinct naturally No, they werenrsquot. The Cretaceous period was the third major period of the dinosaurs and they were doing really well. Some of the most well-known dinosaurs were around right about the time when the asteroid struck. It was also the age of the titanosaurs ndash the biggest dinosaurs to ever live. If that asteroid hadnrsquot crashed into the sea just north of Mexico then in all likelihood, things might have been very dferent and you might really have had a Tyrannosaursus in your garden or a Protoceratops in your playground. But remember, the asteroid did not kill all the dinosaurs . . .Have you ever been on expeditions to find dinosaur remains and where are the places most likely to find them I have. My favourite was when I went with Sir David Attenborough to Argentina to film the discovery and excavation of a true dino giant. The great thing about loving dinosaurs and living in the British Isles is that we have so many fossils of dinosaurs and other prehistoric species. There are certain beaches and riversides famous for fossils and you have a very good chance of finding the fossil bones of a prehistoric marine reptile or shark teeth or ammonite shells. You always have to go with an adult and thoroughly plan your trip because fossil hunting can be dangerous but itrsquos so much fun.Do you identy at all with lsquodinosaur expertrsquo characters on film or television There have been some well-known characters on TV who study dinosaurs but usually theyrsquore rubbish. Look at Ross from Friends . . . Irsquom pretty sure he couldnrsquot tell the dference between the head and butt of a Dreadnoughtus. Characters like that donrsquot inspire me. Real scientists are much better and inspire me every day. The men and women who spend their lives digging up fossils and investigating how these animals and plants lived are much cooler than a TV character."},{"url":null,"title":"music-fan-kevin-proves-39-s-popmaster","story":"Kevin OrsquoDonnell stole the show when he appeared on PopMaster on BBC Radio .A score of  out of  was enough to win the quiz on Ken Brucersquos show.Kevin, who runs his own joinery and garden business, told the Courier: ldquoIt was something that I always wanted to do.ldquoI am right into my music and PopMaster is probably the premier music quiz in Britain.The -year-oldrsquos opponent managed a score of , with Kevin declared the winner and receiving the prize of a digital speaker in the shape of an old-style microphone.The prize has taken pride of place in Kevinrsquos West Barns home, with dozens of people getting in touch with him to offer their congratulations since the show was broadcast.He said: ldquoI met Bruce Springsteen in  in Newcastle and I think this is not quite up there with that but it is not far off.The popular radio quiz has been running for a number of years and each contestant is asked  questions based on popular music from the s through to the present day.He said: ldquoI have listened to Ken Bruce for a good  or  years and the last couple of years I have tried to get on the show.ldquoMy kids have always been saying to me to go.ldquoMy son, Conor, is the lead guitarist in The Tesla Coils and we are always discussing and talking about music.The music fan, who spoke to the Courier as he was en route to see American rock legends Kiss perform at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow, played down his achievement and said the questions simply fell in his favour.ldquoYou can get a possible  points thatrsquos the maximum you can score, said Kevin. ldquoThat is based on  questions and it is just general music knowledge.

Unfortunately - for all concerned - fears have been realised.A trans woman, Jessica Yaniv, approached a number of female beauticians to ask for a Brazilian bikini wax, all - perhaps by coincidence - were lone home workers, the majority of whom were immigrant women.Unfortunately, Ms Yaniv was unable to find any beautician willing to carry out the intimate wax because she still retains male genitalia and each of these women only worked on female genitalia.:Are you trans  Next Scottish census to ask questions on gender IDMs Yaniv, a trans rights campaigner, then raised action against  of the women at British Columbiarsquos human rights tribunal, alleging discrimination and seeking damages of several thousanddollars from each.It was too much for several of the women to fight and so they folded their businesses instead, losing their livelihoods.The case cleaves opinion in two: either it is discriminatory of the beauticians to refuse to wax a trans womans genitals regardless of what they look like, or it is discriminatory to force a woman to handle male genitals against her will.The tribunal will make a decision - and that decision may well be to disregard womens boundaries and dignity by finding for Ms Yaniv and asserting that the law believes it is discrimination for women to refuse to touch a penis when that penis belongs to a trans woman.Ms Yaniv has posted deeply troubling comments on social media about young girls, although she claimed at the tribunal her account was hacked. There are those who would say she is vexatious and should be disregarded. Fiona Robertson, the SNPs National Womens and Equalities Convener, says Ms Yaniv is a female predator and that women predators often use their womanliness to gain access to victims.Critics of Ms Robertsons stance would strongly dispute male predatory behaviour being attributed to women.I would not dream of speaking for trans people but Im going to take a stab that the vast majority just want to get on with their lives peaceably and,asked about the Yaniv case, would be of the \"not in my name\" persuasion. Trans people cannot want this sort of legal action either, yet activists and allies have remained silent on the case.However, it cant be ignored and certainly not by a Scotland where there is a bitter ide between trans allies and, for want of a better shorthand, womens allies.Trans woman are women has become a political slogan in support of self ID and of respecting the rights of trans people but to take it to its conclusion is to fundamentally redefine the word \"woman\" and remove the element of sex from the words definition.The argument from some feminists is that the introduction of self ID is the beginning of a creep towards removing womens sex-based rights.Currently \"sex\" is a protected characteristic and so, for example, womens refuges have the right to refuse to house male-bodied people or, indeed, employ male-bodied people.Jo Swinson, the new leader of the Liberal Democrats, has been highly vocal in declaring that trans women are women but less clear in defining exactly what she means. If it is the Liberal Democrats stance that trans women are literally women then it suggests the Liberal Democrats would support the removal of the sex-based exemption.To avoid Yaniv-style legal cases, the Scottish Government must be explicit in how the Equality Act will apply to any new law.But explicit answers to troubling questions are exactly what this public conversation is lacking and no wonder when you have an MP, Mhairi Black, calling women who disagree with self ID \"Jeremy Hunts\", a rhyming slang it takes no genius to work out.The Scottish Government already confuses \"sex\" with \"gender\" in its consultation on self ID. Pro-self ID campaigners have pointed to the reassurance that there will be the protection of up to two years prison term for those who abuse self ID. Butyou cannot define \"woman\", how can you legislate effectively to determine who is or isnt really living as a woman : years of Stonewall: The fight for LGBT rightsIn Canada too, a woman has reported to the human rights tribunal that a womans shelter for recovering addicts made her homeless because she refused to share a twin room with a trans woman.

Rape Crisis also supports men so its no surprise the charity supports trans people - it would be an odd developmentthey did not.Scottish Womens Aid, the umbrella organisation for womens aid groups in Scotland, focuses on policy and research, it does not run refuges and so, while it supports self ID and takes a clear line that domestic abuse affects trans women too, its position is largely academic in that it will not have to deal with the frontline practicalities of balancing rights.Inidual womens aid charities in Scotland have gone on public record to say they have real concerns about self-ID.Wouldnt it be useful, instead of sloganeering and calling women c****, for politicians and charities to give explicit, detailed answers to questions being asked  The only way to allay fears is to tackle them head-on.Women are told their boundaries are not under threat - the Yaniv case contradicts this. They are told there is no conflict when it comes to women-only spaces such as refuges, they are told men will not pose as trans women to gain access to womens spaces - there are multiple cases in Canada of this happening.It will only help the debate to progressquestions raised in Canada are answered in Scotland - for the benefit of everyone."},{"url":null,"title":"sturgeon-shetland-holyrood-byelection","story":"The First Minister will focus on Brexit as she campaigns in Lerwick in the Shetlands alongside SNP candidate Tom Wills.The byelection on August  has been prompted by the departure of former Scottish LibDem leader Tavish Sott, who had held the seat since the start of the Scottish Parliament in .He announced he was stepping down in June to become head of external affairs at Scottish Rugby.Mr Scott won . per cent of the vote in , while the SNP won .%.Ms Sturgeon said: ldquoLike the rest of Scotland - Shetland didnrsquot vote for Brexit, Boris Johnson or for a no-deal Brexit.

Irsquom in the business of finding things. I donrsquot want to notfind things.He said he had decided to take on the challenge at last after recent research and evidence gathered by another group of explorers convinced him that Ms Earhartrsquos plane might be found on the uninhabited Nikumaroro Island.His team will search the land and surrounding sea for proof Ms Earhart and Mr Noonan ended up there. The expedition is being funded by National Geographic television channel andwill be broadcast in October.The searchers will use remotely operated underwater vehicles, one of which can e to ,ft. On land, an archaeological team will investigate a camp site using search dogs and DNA sampling.The belief that Ms Earhart and Mr Noonan crashed on Nikumaroro, formerly known as Gardner Island, is not the only theory. What is certain is they disappeared on July  on the final leg of the trip. Ms Earhart was looking for the tiny Howland Island, north-west of Nikumaroro.Her final transmission was made after  hours of flight from New Guinea.Read more: haunting photographs of the Titanic before it tragically sank on this day in ldquoWe must be on you but cannot see you mdash but gas is running low, she reported to the Itasca, a US Coast Guard ship that was to provide her with bearings on the approach to her destination.She then seemed to disappear without trace and some believe she crashed on land and survived, but the US navy has always considered it more likely the plane crashed at sea.Her disappearance is one of the most tantalising aviation mysteries, fascinating historians and spawning books, movies and theories. Earhart hunters have looked for her on remote islands and sought the wreck of her plane on the ocean floor.A photo unearthed from the US National Archives convinced one researcher she had been taken captive by the Japanese on one of the Marshall Islands as a prisoner of war. Nikumaroro was searched in  but no evidence was found of the Electra.Mr Ballard believes looking for a trail of debris farther out from the island will lead to the site of the wreck.Unlike the search for the Titanic, there is not a huge swath of ocean to comb. Potential debris fields will orientate searchers using a path perpendicular to a found engine, pedal or wing, much like how theTitanicrsquos detritus was a trail of bread crumbs leading to its rusticle-dotted husk.A similar method was used byMr Ballard to find Roman ships after discovering cargo thrown overboardas the vessels sank.

People living with dementia might not remember to drink enough liquids to stay hydrated or wear appropriate clothing for the weather.Prolonged exposure to excessive heat can lead to heat exhaustion, with symptoms including headaches, dizziness, nausea or vomiting, intense thirst, heavy sweating and a fast pulse. It can be le-threateninguntreated.Michelle Supple, director of charity services at Age Scotland said: “While many of us are having fun in the sun, it’s important to remember that warm weather can present health risks, especially for older people.“People with heart or lung conditions, those with reduced mobility or living with dementia can be especially vulnerable when temperatures go up. As we age, it becomes more dficult to regulate our body temperature and this can be exacerbated by some medications.“It’s important to take simple steps to stay cool, including drinking plenty of fluids, limiting strenuous activities, and staying inside during the warmest part of the day. It’s also vital to protect your skin by using sunscreen and covering up with a wide-brimmed hat and loose-fitting clothes.“We would encourage everyone to check on older neighbours, friends and family to make sure they are doing well and seethey need anything. Something as simple as helping open a window or popping to the shops to pick up some sunscreen can make a huge dference to someone’s comfort and well-being.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr Lyon said HIAL is fully prepared for three days of industrial action, which will see six of its airports closed due to strike action by air traffic controllers.Kirkwall Airport will be shut to all traffic next Monday, July .The strikes were called following the rejection of HIAL’s latest offer on July . The offer rejected by Air Traffic Controllerscomprised a retention allowance that would have seen ATCOs benefit from an additional £, over a five-year period.Prospect presented a counter offer that signicantly exceeds the flexibility and affordability of a publicly owned organisation.HIAL says that, throughout this process, it has been committed to resolving this dispute and has submitted a number of proposals that have been rejected outright by the union.Inglis Lyon, HIAL’s Managing Director said: “We deeply regret the inconvenience and upset to hundreds of passengers affected by the strike action.  We wish to find a resolution to this dispute as soon as possible and would urge Prospect to sit down with us once again to find some common ground on which we can arrive at a negotiated settlement.“Our position has been consistent throughout. We can only deliver an affordable settlement within the terms of Public Sector Pay Policy. So far Prospect has continued to ask for a pay increase far in excess of what we are able to afford and that unfortunately remains the situation.“We remain committed to resolving the dispute. Our latest offer of a retention allowance of £, over a five year period remains on the table and will continue to explore potential solutions within our affordability.”“The continued industrial action is having a signicant impact on our passengers, communities and the airlines operating from our airports.

Volunteer cleaners become citizen scientists, as they also record the litter they find along a designated m stretch of every beach that’s cleaned, and it’s this aspect that has helped MCS change policy and behaviours over the last  years.“Now more than ever is the time to turn awareness into action,# says Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland conservation officer. #Everybody is talking about marine litter — you see it on the TV, hear it on the radio and read it in the papers and across social media. We want people to take that awareness and turn it into action by taking part in the biggest beach litter survey and clean up in Scotland! Only by combining awareness with action and data can we make sure that industry and government put in place the urgent measures needed to stop this plastic tide for good.”The p carrier bag charge, a ban on microbeads in wash-off products, consultations on a plastic tax, commitments to depositschemes, a ban on plastic stemmed cotton buds in Scotland and the banning of lantern and balloon releases — have all come about following compelling evidence gathered over decades by volunteers at MCS beach cleans. Cleaning and surveying a beach only takes a couple of hours at most. Each beach has a coordinator, who explains how to fill in a simple data form, and then it’s just a case of grabbing a litter picker and a bin bag and filling it up with rubbish.“Beach litter is a serious environmental problem,” says Lizzie Prior, MCS Beachwatch Officer.“But the solution is in our hands. We want the th Great British Beach Clean weekend to be the biggest ever. The BBC’s Blue Planet II and subsequent programmes have given the UK public a real understanding of the pollution crisis facing our oceans and now people want to make a dference. The more volunteers we have, the better it’ll be for our seas.”To get involved, call   and find out how you can organise your own.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But how can those words be justied Well, the first bit is easy. We have just witnessed the th match in the series and from an Orkney point of view the game and outcome were ‘glorious’. But they haven’t all been like that. Amidst many dazzling encounters there have been some dull, tepid affairs which have failed to raise the pulse rate for supporters of either hue.Ah, but that’s all right. Teams are allowed the odd blip or series of blips, safe in the knowledge that the deep sense of history and tradition built up over a long period of time will cover it. No lasting damage will be done to something so enduring as the annual Milne Cup fixture which is ingrained into the culture of the Northern Isles. It is a game like no other and to play in it represents the pinnacle of most players’ footballing ambitions.So, look at it like this. Despite what those from other sporting disciplines might say, football is the ‘glorious game.’ Orkney versus Shetland is our own ‘glorious game.’ And we have just reached number one hundred. Straightforward really!Now, feel free to open the covers and follow the story . . . so far. Experience the ups and downs, intrigue and controversy of more than a century of inter-county football.

I’m a bit worried about him and want him to get in touch, just to let us know he’s alright.No doubt he’s fine but I wonder how he spends his days. Does he meet-up with other Labour folk, like Neil Findlay, Ian Murray and Monica Lennon for a coffee now and again in a greasy spoon – like the losing team in The Apprentice Maybe they argue over who’s fault the disastourous showing in the European elections was while proclaiming that the Tunnock’s Caramel Wafers are “for the many, not the few”.I certainly haven’t seen Richard in Dobbies scoffing traybakes and buying synthetic red roses lately.Maybe he feels that his time is better spent browsing record shops like Vinyl Villains and Groucho’s in Dundee for rare groove jazz records and stuff by mid-s American garage bands like The Electric Prunes, who he’s fond of. Maybe he’s wandering through the badlands of deepest West Lothian, places like Fauldhoose and Blackburn, where they kept the nuclear weapons during the Cold War, passing on his wisdom like David Carradine in the old television show Kung Fu. “Master I am puzzled - that is the beginning of wisdom,” he might mumble.For unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website here: Richard Leonard: It was a bad result for Labour but it’s not a green light for SNPAnyhoo – we could all do with hearing from him a bit more and I really hope he’s not been hiding out in the museum like a kid skivving school – while trying to get away from all this politics stuff that’s been going on. One things for sure – he’s not laid a glove on the SNP. Not a mark on a Scottish Government who have presided over record drug deaths and hospital waiting times, issues that should be meat and drink for the Labour Party.Now, I’m sure Richard’s a decent guy and I know he inherited a dysal mess after the eight previous incumbents made a pig’s ear of things but he’s looking increasingly like a busted flush.And that’s being kind, given that he showed very little promise to begin with and seems to have been elected to the gig on account of being Corbyn’s mucker.Other leaders like Kezia ‘Kez’ Dugdale ended up looking surly in the jungle, Jim Murphy beacme the patron saint of egg throwers, something he weirdly seemed to enjoy, and Johann ‘Cruyff’ Lamont hardly captured the imagination of the voters. Go back futher to a time Labour mattered, before the monumental gubbing at the hands of the SNP in the  Scottish Parliament election and the quality of leader was marginally better.Granted, Iain Gray always looks like he’s about to askhe can “go and play on the swings” but the likes of Jack McConnell and Wendy Alexander were intellectual heavyweights in comparison to the rum bunch who came after ...So, why does any of this matter Well, at some point you’d like to think that one of the ‘major’ parties in Scotland might be able to challenge Nicola Sturgeon who has now been in office almost as long as Yugoslavia’s Marshall Tito .“Hold on, stop the bus – did you just compare our dear leader to a communist revolutionary turned benign dictator  You can’t do that – throw him down the well.”Anyway, Tito was seen as a unying figure at home and abroad – and my point is the SNP will be in power for decades unless someone gets their finger out and comes up with a viable plan to unseat them.As it stands, Nicola – one word like Madonna – has a job for le, one that should easily take her and her well-thumbed copy of Sunset Song into the err – the Sunset I will say this for Nicola – she has presence. Presence is what’s required with political leaders, especially with regard to opposition leaders in Scotland where the SNP are dominant.Richard Leonard, like the majority of Scottish Labour leaders who went before him, has zero presence to the point of making that Nice Man Willie Rennie seem charismatic.And there’s the rub. Labour no longer do leadership. Perhaps, they see it as a bit crass to have a popular leader in Scotland, one who can hold the SNP to account. A bit Lewis Capaldi that, when they’d much rather stick a poster of The Beta Band on their bedroom walls. We’re not talking populist here, just someone folk can identy would be a start, so they don’t look quizical when you mention their name.“Richard Leonard  Nah mate, never heard of him – has he signed for The Rangers ”First off, the leader should actually want to lead, that helps, with an ability to communicate a close second. Getting the leader right is the most important thing for political parties, they’re the face of the party, the person who sells the policies. They don’t need to know every single chapter of the Labour Party rule book and have sold the most raffle tickets at the miner’s welfare to be leader. Jesus wept.And just saying “for the many, not the few” and banging on about taking the buses into state-ownership ain’t going to cut it. That’s a rubbish slogan anyway, they’d be as well saying “Yes We Can’t”. On a national level, Labour are in trouble and that disconnect with voters is re in Scotland. Announcing you’ve made great strides in tightening up internal procedures for dealing with complaints of an anti-semitic nature is probably not a surefire vote winner.Scotland is crying out for a party that supports the increasing likelihood of independence, but does more than pay lip service to helping the most deprived people in the country.One that would challenge the SNP and expose their shortcomings because, let’s face it, they’re not very good. Take Nicola out the equation and you’re left with a bunch of cooncillors.Scottish Labour should be that party – but it’s not happening and probably never will.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"sun ignites fuel in tanks showing uk can t cope with 38c heat stephen jardine","story":"Boris Johnson hardly mentioned climate change in his first speech as Prime Minister, but the current hot weather is demonstrating that the UK is not designed for temperatures of up to  Celsius, writes Stephen Jardine.Just when you thought that summer was set to elude us this year, suddenly it arrived.This week Edinburgh basked in its hottest day on record as temperatures topped C on Thursday afternoon. Ice cream shops reported record sales and Lidl sold out of £ swimming pools. On the radio every station seemed to be playing Chris Rea’s “On The Beach” or The Beatle’s “Here Comes The Sun”. For a few brief moments, we were at peak summer... and then it all went bad.With the first complaints of it being too hot came more serious concerns. Cambridge recorded the hottest July day ever with temperatures reaching C,just over F. That led the NHS to issue specic advice to the elderly and parents of young babies. For everyone , it was about trying to make the best of it.Commuters faced serious delays as rail services struggled to cope with the high temperatures and line failures dogged the network. In offices without air-conditioning, cheap fans were the only alternative to stay cool.For unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website here: Boris Johnson supporters want no-deal Brexit and less talk of climate change, survey findsBut all of this throws up a serious challenge. How are we going to cope in the years to come  This heatwave doesn’t prove global warming is going to make our planet burn but it does show we are not equipped to deal with a climate that is changing fast.It has never been hotter across northern Europe and extreme weather events are becoming more common so we need to find long and short-term solutions. Environmental protestors disrupted new Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s journey to Buckingham Palace to meet the Queen but it was noticeable that the climate crisis barely featured in his first speech. It should have dominated it. If Brexit is a worry, climate change is a nightmare. It’s tempting to dismiss all this as scaremongering. We remember hot summer days as kids so stick a beer in the fridge, light the BBQ and sit back and relax. However that is to abdicate our responsibility to future generations. Across the world, the last four years have been the hottest ever recorded. Here in the UK, our way of le is just not designed for C-plus.This week police were called to a lido in London when a crowd of  people tried to force their way in to cool down. In Worcestershire, three people were taken to hospital after a blaze at a marina when the heat ignited fuel in tanks. And in London, an eerie clip on social media showed cardboard catching fire in the sunlight and swirling around on the pavement. It was a dystopian image of the shape of things to come.Everyone has a part to play in this. Governments need to deliver carbon reduction targets and that means we need to look at how we live our lives and reduce our inidual impact. Planners need to think about buildings and city spaces that will keep us cool and cut emissions. Transport networks need to be adjusted to cope with the rising mercury. Most importantly, we all need to recognise the challenge. The heatwave is not a jolly story with kids playing in fountains and taps aff on Portobello Beach. Instead, like droughts, wildfires and floods, it is a sign of the climate catastrophe facing us all.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"wanted nurse for remote scottish island with population of 170","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The Isle of Raasay, which has a population of around  people, has not had resident medical cover for a decade, despite a long campaign by islanders to get a community nurse.The island, considered to be one of the most beautul parts of Scotland, is reliant on medics travelling from neighbouring Skye, with one GP surgery held once a week on a Wednesday, and three district nurses working on a rota Monday to Friday.: Historic Burns Monument reopens following major restoration work: Wanted: Teacher for remote Scottish islandFor the past four years, residents have been campaigning to get a nurse who lives on the island, as there is no out-of-hours medical provision.In December , NHS Highlands unsuccessfully tried to recruit a resident nurse.But hopes are high that a new recruitment drive could bring someone looking for a slower pace of le to the island, with a job ad closing next month.Anne Gillies, chair of Raasay Community Council, said: \"A resident nurse on Raasay will be a huge boost to the community.\"It will make an enormous dference, particularly to families with young children and our elderly population.\"Were all very happy at the prospect of having a nursing presence on the island again.\"Kate Earnshaw, district manager for NHS Skye, Lochalsh and Wester Ross, said: \"This is an exciting opportunity for a suitably qualied and experienced nurse to join the CommunityNursing Team and make a real dference to healthcare provision on Raasay.\"We hope this opening will appeal to candidates looking for a real sht in lestyle.\"Raasay is a wonderful place to live and work and we look forward to attracting lots of applications.\"The Band  post is permanent, can be full-time or part-time, and comes with a salary of £, to £,.He or she would be the first clinician on the scene in the event of an emergency on the island, would be required to provide on-call nursing cover, and would be the main point of contact on the island for the Skye-based GPs and rural medics at the MacKinnon Memorial Hospital in Broadford, on Skye.The role promises \"considerable autonomy\" as Raasays nurse will be responsible for assessing, planning, implementing and reviewing the islands healthcare needs.NHS Highland said it is seeking \"qualied, confident, competent and experienced\" candidates who must be \"adaptable and resourceful, working without a hospital or GP at hand\".Up to date clinical knowledge and skills are required, as is a desire to work in a remote, rural setting.The health board hopes to be able to hire more than one nurse for the island.A spokesman said: \"The post holder would have a lot of iety in their job every day is likely to be dferent as they would be dealing with patients from young children to the elderly.\"In addition to the professional challenges of working predominantly on their own, the remote location could present some challenges to everyday le, such as transport.\"For the community, the presence of resident nurse cover is greatly anticipated and will bring reassurance.\"Raasay is a wonderful place to work and live and to bring up a family.

Other events of similar size # even in less challenging locations than Lewis # have come and gone. But the HebCelt remains, steadfast and loyal in the face of changing fashions and changing economic demands.Without the Celtic element, it#s doubtful it would have been able to survive, but as it is it offers something unique in the Scottish music events calendar # both in the kind of acts on show and the setting, with a floodlit Lews Castle over-looking the main site, giving it an ambience all of its own.With up to  acts on show, performing from early afternoon to late at night, it once again provided a veritable feast of Celtic and traditional music. Now some may quibble that the music of KT Tunstall, the headline act, is not Celtic in nature # more pop-rock maybe # but the LA-based singer-songwriter is most certainly Scottish. And she got married in Skye, so that#s enough.Maybe the biggest testament to this year#s festival is that the internationally-renown performer, with a string of hits and albums to her name, did not steal the show as you might expect.Instead the talk of the tent was on the performances from the likes of Elephant Sessions the country and western outfit of The Shires # always likely to prove a hit at an island event # and west coast favourites Manran and Tide Lines.And, of course, there#s the strange phenomenon that is Peat n Diesel, three unassuming local characters whose tongue-in-cheek lyrics # like #Calum Dan and his Transit van# # have captured a mass following, particularly among the youth. They were first scheduled to play in the small acoustics before the hordes of disappointed followers, who were simply unable to get near, persuaded the festival organisers to give them a last-minute billing on the main stage. It was again a hoot, and maybe it#s true after all that #that#s the way we do it in the Western Isles#.But perhaps the real beauty of the HebCelt is that it is about far more than what happens at the main site. From Wednesday to Saturday the town was alive every night into the small hours of the morning. No doubt bar and hotel staff were exhausted in the aftermath, but rather delighted in the sharp spike in takings.The truth is that, while tourist numbers coming to the island are on the rise, the local economy is not performing great. Jobs are scarce, depopulation of the more rural communities re. So the estimated £ million that the HebCelt generates is more than welcome, as well as providing a brief respite from reality and a sense of something major happening on the doorstep. But just like the visit of old friends tends to be too brief, so there is already a longing for next July."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2465-Raasay.jpg","title":"recruitment drive to restore nursing cover for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe move, which is part of the recommendations outlined bySir Lewis Ritchie in his out of hour health care report for Skye, Lochalsh andSouth West Ross, intends to end a period of four years in which the island hasbeen without an overnight nursing presence.In its advert, NHS Highland states: “Professor Sir LewisRitchie#s Report of May  into out of hours care in Skye, Raasay and SouthWest Ross has enabled a move towards innovative healthcare here when he saw theneed for equity of access to services even where numbers are relatively small…“Raasay offers a rare opportunity to provide cradle to gravepersonal nursing and primary care with continuity while working as part of amutually supportive team.”The chosen applicants will have a “considerable degree ofautonomy” and would liaise with “colleagues and line manager based in NorthSkye and with access to support from GPs in Portree and Rural Practitioners inMacKinnon Memorial Hospital, Broadford when required.”The band six positions at a salary scale of £, # £, per annum are permanent with both full-time and part-time hours available."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LOCHCARRON-GAMES-1-adj.jpg","title":"number 41 in the sun for lochcarron highland","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.Sinclair Patience of Tain and Angus Davren of Conon Bridge excelled at the st edition of the games as they wrote their names into the record books.Angus Davren hit new heights as he cleared . metres to set a new ground record in the high jump.

Following its refurbishment, the church has become a hive of community activity and will welcome former Clannad musician Moya Brennan for a highly anticipated concert on August .The County Donegal performer has just released a new album, Timeless, and will play a number of shows throughout the country in the coming months, but luckily she was able to be booked for the Greater New Lodge Community Festival through a mutual interest with Abundant Grace Pastor Sharon Perry.“I serve on the board of a Christian charity with Moya Brennan and I happened to ask hershe would be available,” Sharon explained.“She wasn’t free the night we were supposed to be having it, so we change the date and she was very willing to come along.“It’s a great opportunity for the local community to see such a well-known performer. I think it’s something that doesn’t come along often so close to home. You might see an advert for one of the concert halls in Belfast for Moya, but to have it on our own doorstep here is brilliant. Moya is a lovely lady with a beautul ministry of music.”As well as providing a fantastic night of entertainment, all proceeds from the concert will go to to Special Olympics Ireland.“We ourselves as a charity try to make ends meet to get the work done that is in our hearts to do,” Sharon stated.“We try to help other charities where we can, so we thought this was an opportunity to help kids with learning disabilities. There are lots of activities there for them to be stimulated through sport.”Looking forward to the gig, Sharon said: “We have Zephaniah Dancers coming as well, who are an Irish dance group based in Portadown. They’ll be the support act. The strange thing is that they’re really excited about coming as well because they have actually choreographed a dance to one of Moya’s songs and had got permission to perform it in dferent places. The fact that the girls are now coming together with Moya is amazing.“There will be a mixture of secular music, Gaelic songs and a few Christian songs in the mix as well.”She continued: “I hope people take the opportunity because the chance doesn’t come along often to see Moya Brennan for £. We know that people will come from where, and we welcome that as well, but we would really love the local community to come along and at £ most people can manage that. We are also making some tickets free of charge through the local family support hubs for families for whom a fiver is a challenge.”Moya Brennan will play at Abundant Grace, - Duncairn Gardens, on Wednesday, August , at pm.For info tickets:t:   e: info@abundantgrace.ie"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"north reacts to new pm boris","story":"POLITICAL representatives have been giving their reaction after Boris Johnston was elected new Prime Minister.After a long-running Conservative leadership contest, Boris Johnson saw off rival Jeremy Hunt and will officially take over from Theresa May today .Sinn Féin Deputy Leader Michelle O’Neill says her party will continue to stand up for the Irish interests in the face of Johnson’s “reckless Brexit agenda”.“Sinn Féin will work to protect our peace process and the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, including the commitment to calling a referendum on Irish unity,” he said.“The British government has responsibilities and commitments under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement and we will hold them to account. “We will continue to stand up for Irish interests, for the majority of citizens in the north who voted on a cross-community basis to remain within the EU. “We will continue to work with the Dublin government and the EU to protect Ireland from the catastrophic impact of the reckless Brexit being pursued by Boris Johnson and the hard Brexiteers.”DUP Leader Arlene Foster congratulated Mr Johnson on his election.“I have spoken with Boris Johnson and congratulated him on becoming leader of the Conservative Party,” she said.“We discussed our shared objectives of strengthening every part of the union, ensuring the  referendum result is implemented and seeing devolution restored in Northern Ireland.“The Confidence and Supply Agreement between the Conservative Party and the Democratic Unionist Party remains.That Agreement included a review between each Parliamentary session.This will take place over the coming weeks and will explore the policy priorities of both parties for the next Parliamentary session.“I also look forward to welcoming Mr Johnson back to Northern Ireland shortly after he becomes Prime Minister.”Alliance Leader Naomi Long said the UK needs a “statesman, not a showman”.“Everyone will have their own opinion on Boris Johnson and his career to date,” she said.However, it is now vital as he takes up the reins as Prime Minister he demonstrates a level of leadership and seriousness which has been lacking to date. At such a critical juncture, we need someone who is detail focused and sensitive to the complexity of the challenges ahead. In short, we need a statesman, not a showman.“Boris Johnson’s road to the Conservative Party leadership has been paved with destructive half-truths, bluster and outright lies, many of which helped precipitate the crisis from which he is now personally benefiting. With an impending no-deal Brexit and the stark choices facing us, we need substantive answers from him to what are incredibly serious and complex questions.“To date he has failed to demonstrate any real understanding of the needs of Northern Ireland, particularly in the context of Brexit and especially in a no deal scenario # needs that require more than merely a can-do attitude to resolve.“The Irish border is a delicate and nuanced issue, with resonance far beyond trading arrangements and with the potential to unpick the fabric of the Good Friday Agreementmishandled. It is also impacting on the ability of parties to restore the political institutions here. He now needs to demonstrate his ability to act with sensitivity and impartiality in his engagements with local parties.“It#s time to cut the bluff, bluster and bombastic rhetoric and start to provide the kind of reassurance business and civic society needs. Whilst I remain sceptical he will do that, I wish him well and will be more than happy to be proved wrong.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"reaching new musical heights at the earagail arts","story":"THE Earagail Arts Festival runs every July and brings a wealth of talent to Donegal’s Wild Atlantic Way.The festival has been running this year from July  and will wrap up its calendar of events for another year on Sunday, July . With Belfast’s love affair with Donegal well established, what was once a well-kept secret among the country’s festival-goers is now well and truly on the radar for Belfast music and arts lovers and this year they have been spoiled for choice.At the weekend the festival moved to Arranmore Island for what was billed as the Mór Music # Arts Trail – two days of music, comedy and the spoken word.Crossing over on the Blue Ferry from Burtonport at lunchtime on Saturday passengers were already getting in the mood for the weekend ahead. It was only later that we realised some of them were the artists whowould grace the stage later in the day.Proceedings soon got under way amid the intimate surroundings of Neily’s pub. This is one of the attractions of the Earagail Arts Festival: organisers bring together some of the most talented musicians and artists from around the country and put them before an audience in an accessible setting. Saturday afternoon did not disappoint, with the talented Oscar Jennings – just turned  that day – who, with a mature acoustic set, belied his tender years. The young singer-songwriter had Neily’s in the palm of his hand. Look out for his distinct voice in the years ahead.Conor Mason – also from Derry – and Leila Jane followed, and again their acts were faultless. Switching from guitar to keyboard, Mason’s voice is melodic and haunting, his love songs touching the soul. Singer-songwriter, -year-old Leila Jane from Donegal, once more exemplied the depth of talent in the Irish music scene with hints of Janis Joplin and Patsy Cline hovering above her blues six string.The night was but a pup and we moved on to Early’s pub. Ahead of us –we could stick the pace – was Eve Belle, Delta Fuse and Accidents in the Workplace. A self-proclaimed “singer of sad bops” Eve Belle took us on a journey through the consequences of le. A woman of immense song-writing talent, she’s another one to check out. The evening was brought to a crescendo withblues rock four-piece Delta Fuse from Derry – boy, there’s some talent in Derry these days – and funkmeisters Accidents in the Workplace from Dundalk.After lunch it all began again on the Sunday with more music, this time at The Crossroads. We arrived just as the highly-rated Josie Duncan was wrapping up. However, we would catch-up with the Scots Gaelic singer back in Early’s later. Also playing at The Crossroads was Thatcher of the Acropolis with their unique blend of electronic rock and Gaelic poetry. After a trad session in Phil Ban’s – which coincided with Shane Lowry’s Open win on the big screen – the island was really rocking now, and it was soon back down to Early’s for the final evening. When Dublin poet Stephen James Smith announced from the stage that he would be reading poetry for the next  minutes, there was some uneasy shuffling in the seats, but we needn’t have worried, he had us laughing and crying in equal measure with his poems and stories. Incidentally, Stephen is playing in the Black Box in Belfast on October . Make sure you go along. I’ll be back.Following Stephen we were treated to the haunting Gaelic sounds of Diane Cannon and Manus Lunny, followed by Clann Mhic Ruairi. Another rousing ending to another Arranmore evening was brought courtesy of the impressive Honeyfeet.You can check out the final weekend of entertainment at the Earagail Arts Festival at eaf.ieWe stayed on Arranmore island at Early’s Bed # Breakfast where you will get a great welcome from Jerry and his we Pat.We travelled to Arranmore Island on the Blue Ferry – https:arranmorefastferry tickets "},{"url":null,"title":"eu exit and border on agenda for new secretary of state julian smith in derry","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They have provided assurances that she will not be disadvantaged as a result of losing out on the experience of acting up nor will she be victimised in any way. The Board has also committed to liaising with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, head of legal services at the Equality Commission, welcomed the result. \"This is a good result all round,\" she said. \"One of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change.\"While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future. \"Its good that this has been resolved productively and amicably.\"Ms McKernan said the case should serve as a reminder to employers of the need to treat staff fairly. \"Were publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part-time working arrangements, even unintentionally,\" she said.The legal expert pointed out that % of female employees work part-time in NI compared to % of male workers.Women make up % of part-time employees here. \"Because of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women,\" Ms McKernan explained. \"Thats why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination.\" Ms McCormick, who will continue teaching at the grammar school, also welcomed the outcome which she believes has led to positive change. \"I love my job and am happy at the school,\" she said. \"So Im pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with in a formal and procedurally correct manner.\""},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

Following myfrom maternity leave, I availed of a temporary reduction in hours, working three days per week instead of five.ldquoSo when a colleague was appointed Temporary Head of English, and I was not considered because I was working part-time, I thought it was unfair to be denied the opportunity to be considered for this temporary promotion and the chance to gain that experience. I understand that the demands of the post would mean working full time, but I wasnrsquot given this option.However, the settlement has not detracted from Ms McCormickrsquos enjoyment of working as a teacher as Assumption Grammar School.She added: ldquoI love my job and am happy at the school, so Irsquom pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with on a formal and procedurally correct manner.In settling the case, Assumption Grammar School said it recognised that it did not give Ms McCormick an opportunity to apply or be considered for the position and disadvantaged her as a part time flexible worker.The schoolrsquos board of governors said it regretted the upset felt by Ms McCormick and looked forward to a continued good working relationship with her.The board of governors confirmed that there will be ldquono disadvantage to her due to the fact that she was unable to avail of the acting up experience, nor will she be victimised in any way.They added that the school would liaise with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, Head of Legal Services at the Equality Commission, said: ldquoThis is a good result all round.ldquoOne of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change. While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future.ldquoItrsquos good that this has been resolved productively and amicably. Wersquore publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part time working arrangements, even unintentionally.Ms McKernan went on to explain that in Northern Ireland % of female employees worked part-time compared to % of male employees and % of part-time employees were women.She added: ldquoBecause of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women and thatrsquos why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch’s French connection  ","story":"ON Saturday the Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Twinning Group will stage a charity fundraising garden party at the home of Hugh and Violet Hawthorne, opposite the Dairy Lake on the old Belfast Road, Ballynahinch.Special guests will include seven visitors from Lamorlaye in northern France, and interestingly, the Lamorlaye Ballynahinch partnership celebrates its st anniversary this year, dating back to .Connections between Ballynahinch and France are not new some actually existed in the heady days of the Seven Years War and the French Revolution. In , as part of an ongoing world war between France and Great Britain, a substantial French force led by Commodore Franccedilois Thurot invaded Co Antrim, and captured Carrickfergus Castle. The French sustained  dead and  wounded.Two of the wounded French officers, Brigadier Flobert and Major Brajelon, were treated with extraordinary kindness while in Ulster. They convalesced in comfort at Moira Castle in Co Down, before being repatriated to France.It is thought that part of their welcome was owing to their membership of the Freemasons ndash Lord Moira being a Mason himself. Around  mdash at the same time he was entertaining the French mdash Moira planned to move his family headquarters to Ballynahinch, and was busy building his new Montalto House there.Thirty years later Lord Moirarsquos son Francis ndash by now a resident at Montalto mdash was rather less friendly towards the French. In December , as a British Major-General, he led a military expedition to the Royalist deacutepartement of La Vendeacutee, with the intention of reversing the French Revolution. In June , he was back on the Continent, in a successful operation against the French in the Low Countries.With the  rebellion now looming, Franciswas warned his own home town was a hotbed of sedition. Nonsense, he famously declared in the Irish House of Lords: ldquoNo town is so loyal as Ballynahinch!. He was wrong there. In fact the military committee of the United Irishmen, meeting in Armstrongrsquos Inn on Ballynahinch Square, was busy plotting a French invasion of Ireland.The rebel planners communicated with French generals via their Co Down emissaries, Alexander Lowry and Bartholomew Teeling.Lowry hailed from Linen Hill in Katesbridge mdash his house is still there mdash and Teeling was from Twinbrook. They were now resident on the continent along with their close associate Wolfe Tone. British military intelligence knew all of these details perfectly well, and Armstrongrsquos Inn was one of the first buildings to be burned down after the Battle of Ballynahinch.On August , , General Jean-Joseph Humbert landed a small French expedition in Killala, Co Mayo, on the west coast of Ireland. This was in direct retaliation for Lord Moirarsquos earlier intervention in La Vendeacutee. Humbertrsquos force was too small and too late, and achieved little. The rising in Ulster had been extinguished two months earlier.As late as Emmetrsquos Rebellion in  there were rebel hopes mdash always disappointed mdashthat a French army would arrive in Co Down.The poem, The Man From God Knows Where, reads:lsquoFor a wheen orsquo days we sat waitinrsquo the word to rise and go at it like men, but no French ships sailed into Cloughey Bay and we heard the black news on a harvest day that the cause was lost again.rsquoHorace Reid will give a -minute slide presentation of these tales on Saturday afternoon. Karen Patterson will provide a fluent French translation for European visitors.

To me, this is a critical part of the continued regeneration of Irish Street.ldquoThe brief aims to encourage developers to come forward to redevelop the area and I wholeheartedly welcome plans to work alongside the local community on the design of the site to maximise not only the Irish Street sitersquos potential, but its historical heritage.Cllr Hanlon said revitalisation schemes in other towns have proved successful and welcomed assurances from the Department of Communities and local council that they will work closely with businesses and provide support to ensure the revitalisation scheme is delivered efficiently and quickly.ldquoThe delays in completion of the public realm scheme have undoubtedly impacted trade on Irish Street and the wider Downpatrick town centre, she said. ldquoConfirmation that revitalisation funding is being made available is a welcome boost.ldquoIt is imperative that businesses feedback to the steering group what they feel will work best from the revitalisation scheme to help them going forward. While the scheme is limited to Irish Street traders, it will no doubt have a positive impact on the wider town centre economy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan is ready for week of Ulster Fleadh fun  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN is set to welcome over , musicians and guests for the  Ulster Fleadh this week.The traditional Irish music festival and follows hot on the heels of Castlewellanrsquos annual agricultural show, which saw , people descend upon the Mourne town.The week long festival of competitions, concerts and ceili dances runs until Sunday and celebrates all thatrsquos good in Irish music, song and dance.Some of the names on the bill include Zoe Conway, Donal Lunny and Martin OrsquoConnor.There will also be theof the Ulster Fleadh parade followed by a firework display and open-air music all weekend with lots of free entertainment.Organisers say the event, worth pound. million to the town last year, marks the fourth consecutive year for Co Down to host the event, following Bangorrsquos back-to-back stints in  and .Last year more than , competitors from across Ulster took part with more expected this year.Newry, Mourne and Down District Council says it is delighted to support the Ulster Fleadh.ldquoThe council believe that as a result of footfall generated through events like this, visitors are more likely toto the area for sightseeing, embracing our offer of food and drink or attending other events, a spokesman said.ldquoThere is a clear economic benefit generated for the district both on the weekend of the event and following it with further repeat visits.Paddy Breen, Fleadh chairman, said: ldquoWe are hoping to go bigger and better this year as it is the th anniversary of our host branch, Newcastle Cohhaltas Ceoltoiri Eireann .Last year we welcomed nearly , visitors to the town over the course of the weekrsquos events.ldquoVisitors to the Ulster Fleadh come from all over Ireland and we attract a iety of visitors of all ages -

He was three weeks in hospital but we are glad we did it.ldquoDespite all of what Matthew has gone through, he is never seen without a smile on his face. He is the most lovable, happy and determined boy.It was during Matthewrsquos recovery in hospital that Louise learnt about Swim Labrsquos water-based physio technique from another mum.She first took him to a programme in Lanzarote in March but has since took him to Swim Lab programme in Fivemiletown last month.

The same stage also saw second-placed Meirion Evans lose six minutes with a puncture.Luckily for Armstrong, his time loss wasnrsquot as severe but it was still painful nonetheless as he ped one minute, placing him at the bottom of the top .The incident only made the Fermanagh man more determined and by the time crews arrived back at service after stage eight, he had set four fastest stage times and clambered his way back up to second overall.While early rally leaders, Jonny Greer and Kirsty Riddick, were forced to retire with mechanical problems, Armstrong had recovered to second position, just six seconds adrt of new leaders Stephen Wright and Liam Moynihan, with Daniel Harper and Chris Campbell third.The chasing crew got the bit between their teeth for the final loop of three stages which saw Armstrong move into the rally lead for the first time after stage nine.Using the power of his Mini WRC to full effect, he consolidated his advantage over the final two tests to win the event by just over  seconds.ldquoWe didnrsquot expect to win at all, Armstrong said at the finish. ldquoItrsquos only my second rally in two years so the aim was to get a bit of seat time in a World Rally car.ldquoItrsquos something that Irsquove never really had a lot of but I try to make up for it by making detailed pace notes which is what stood by us today.ldquoNoel and I worked really well together and the car worked really well too, he added.Stephen Wright and Liam Moynihan had to settle for second overall but in doing so, they claimed maximum McGrady Insurance N.I. Championship points.Wright had led the series after winning the opening round, but he subsequently missed an event, so the result puts him back on target for a  title challenge.In third position, Daniel Harper and Chris Campbell were the best of the Protyre Motorsport UK Asphalt Championship crews.Their Mini WRC never missed a beat as they powered to another podium position, finishing with a reasonable cushion over the rest of the chasing pack.The battle for fourth overall raged right through to the finish with four crews in with a shout of the award. In the end, Melvyn Evans and Aled Davies secured the position from Derek McGarrity and Paddy Robinson, with Steve Wood and Keith Moriarty sixth.Stuart Biggerstaff and Anthony Nestor had also been right in the hunt, but they dropped out of contention with power-steering troubles on stage nine.As for McGarrity, the result gives his NI Championship campaign a welcome boost as he continues to play catch-up after his round one retirement.He was left a little bit disappointed that a wrong tyre choice and a broken anti-roll bar thwarted a potential challenge for outright victory but he is very much among the main contenders for the  championship spoils.The bottom half of the top  also featured the father and son team of Draperstownrsquos Derek and Mark McGeehan.It was navigator Markrsquos second closed road rally, and only his second time reading pace notes, so his father Derek was as proud as punch of his efforts at the finish.Last yearrsquos winner Jonny Greer was left despondent after his retirement.He blitzed the opposition on the opening stage when he went  seconds faster than anyone  and when both Meirion Evans and Jon Armstrong hit trouble on stage four, it looked as though the Carryduff based driver was on course for another win.However, it wasnrsquot to be as one stage later, suspected gearbox troubles forced him and navigator Kirsty Riddick out of the rally.WDIn the battle for two-wheel-drive honours, Damian Toner and Barry McParland put in a scintillating display aboard their Ford Escort MkII.They were never outside the top  and eventually powered home to a seventh-placed finish with a comfortable margin over their two-wheel-drive rivals. Even burning his hand while working on his car failed to dampen Tonerrsquos day.Camillus Bradley and Crawford Henderson claimed second in the category after early second-placed holder Wesley Patterson went out with a broken crown wheel and pinion.Round five of the McGrady Insurance Motorsport UK Northern Ireland Rally Championship will see a switch from tarmac to gravel as crews head to Co Fermanagh in September for the Lakeland Stages Rally.The series is beginning to heat up and a three-way fight for the crown is developing between Derek McGeehan, Derek McGarrity and Stephen Wright.

A minute later, Stuart Martin, who had been heavily watched all afternoon, flashed over a super score and followed it up with another.Not to be outdone Derry star Mullan found the space to register his fourth point of the evening.The introduction of Ciaran Watson, Michael McKey and Padraig Doran saw a fresh approach as the visitors started to claw their way back into this thrilling encounter.In the th minute Conor McCrickard plundered a second goal for his side and when Stuart Martin pointed two minutes later, Down were just a score away from levelling the contest.Richie Mullan gave the home side a four-point advantage with a brilliantly angled free out near the sideline.The outcome of the game turned when McAlornan blocked Mullan shot for goal.Derry only managed to score two more points in the remaining five minutes as an inspired Down side levelled the contest for the first time with a m Costello point.With referee Aidan Ferguson indicating there was to be four minutes of extra time, it was game on. Eoghan Cassidy edged the home side in front with a super effort from out on the left wing, only to see McCrickard level once more from a similar type angled dead ball score.Derry had spurned an opportunity of snatching the game when the Down rearguard pressurised Seaacuten Kelly into shooting wide.Fom the resulting puck-out a tussle for possession saw Niall Fitzsimmons flash the sliotar over the Derry crossbar.When the whistle finally blew five minutes over the , it was Down who had progressed to Semple Stadium.Down: C McAlornan, E Kelly, T Murray, A Dorrian, C Smith, R McCrickard, N McFarlane , N Fitzsimmons , P Savage, J Hanrahan, R Blair , T Prenter , R Costello , C McCrickard , S Martin .

The Conservatives only have a House of Commons majority of one, even with DUP support.Almost two dozen pro European Union MPs on the Tory benches are determined to stop ‘no deal’. If only a handful of them defect, as three did this year to the Change UK Party, Mr Johnson will lose a no confidence vote, which will probably trigger a general election..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Such a contest takes at least four weeks, and so will be hard to squeeze in before October , by when Mr Johnson is committed to leave the EU. Is he really planning to be so radical, or is he already thinking of a Brexit compromise In Northern Ireland earlier this month for the Tory hustings, he met Arlene Foster and tweeted: “If I become PM, under no circumstances will there be a hard border on the island of Ireland, nor will I accept a deal that sees NI taken out of the UK’s customs territory.”This was familiar language. Last September the News Letter asked Downing Street why Theresa May had moved from saying there would be no Irish Sea border to saying that there would be no such customs border. This left open the possibility of a regulatory border . Number  told us Mrs May would not accept”seeing NI carved away from the UK customs territory” but failed to answer our question, and confirmed rather than allayed such fears. Sure enough, the November Withdrawal Agreement had a regulatory border.Was Mr Johnson, who for all his shambolic reputation is a skilled wordsmith, revealing that he too will align NI to EU regulations  If so, his radical government is in fact an English nationalist one, that will take England and Wales completely out of all EU structures, regardless of the consequences for rest of UK.Or perhaps not. The journalist Charles Moore, Mr Johnson’s editor at the Daily , thinks the latter’s unionism is genuine.If that is so, Julian Smith has urgent work to do as secretary of state.Eighteen months ago I wrote about the need for a pro Union culture at the Northern Ireland Office to counter Ireland’s partisan Department of Foreign Affairsand its Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tanaiste Simon Coveney .Ben Lowry: Patent rubbish peddled by the fantasist ‘Nick’ was believed by police, MPs and journalists Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Both James Brokenshire and Karen Bradley were hopelessly incapable of standing up to the DFA.When Dublin delighted republicans by taking the hooded men case to humiliating defeat at the European Court of Human Rights, to get UK treatment of the men designated torture, despite advance signals from the court that Ireland would lose, NIO ministers didn’t even welcome the verdict.When Dublin embarrassed Britain by laying legacy cases before the Council of Europe, including the Pat Finucane murder, which has had millions spent on it and is a key example of the legacy imbalance, NIO ministers were mute.When Simon Coveney said the detention of the dissident Tony Taylor was fuelling community tensions in Londonderry, Karen Bradley said nothing — not even that while she could not discuss any inidual case, she would always as one of her highest priorities try to ensure the protection of le and property from terrorism.When Mr Varadkar and Mr Coveney have given a running commentary on British failures over Brexit, UK ministers have said nothing.When Mr Coveney at his joint press conference with Karen Bradley said “we” decided not to have an outside facilitator, she said nothing.When it was reported that a civil servant got £, damages because portraits of the Queen were displayed at Stormont House, NIO ministers said nothing.When Mrs Bradley said that no British soldiers committed crimes during the Troubles instead of almost none of them did, Mr Coveney joined the chorus of criticism. Try to think of a British minister criticising an Irish one in this fashion.Mr Smith could end the sense of joint London-Dublin stewardship by insisting on strict adherence to the three strands principle in talks, evenunionists do not. He could reinstate the portraits and make clear that any new complaints will be fought to the Supreme Court and,that fails, then the law will be changed.He could show that the UK alone will decide on a facilitator and alone implement oversee direct ruleSinn Fein’s Stormont veto persists.The UK has sovereignty over Northern Ireland and solely funds it — and lavishly so.

In this regard, the Board of EirGrid will be reviewing and considering this call for evidence in detail, assisted by the Executive Team.“It is also important that the organisation speaks with one voice and I would ask that all staff acknowledge this.”Ms Aston was a senior figure at the regulator until five months ago when she was hired by SONI.Referring to Ms Aston’s comment to staff, DUP MLA Paul Frew asked: What does this even mean ” He added that SONI had declined to tell him whether it was “actively encouraging their staff to engage” with the regulator.When Ms Aston was asked why she had made that comment to staff and whether she accepted that they should be free to engage with the regulator as they see fit, she said in a statement:“We note that this is an open consultation and that anyone who wishes to respond in a private capacity, is free to do so.“Meanwhile, our priority is to continue to maintain a secure supply of electricity to homes and businesses across Northern Ireland at the least possible cost to consumers.”IRA leader facing child sex abuse charges ‘vanished’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The TUV leader, Jim Allister, a long-standing critic of Eirgrid’s ownership of the strategically signicant utility, said that for years SONI had “sought to stle internal objection to the fact that its independence has been surrendered to Eirgrid” and “it is typical of the Dublin domination that there is issued from Dublin an edict seeking to gag SONI staff from daring to speak out”.l Morning View, page JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"traffic and travel","story":"....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive any of the following newsletters from Belfast News Letter, via email Daily news, news features and service updates\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". ss+s+  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+]]]]]]]]]]]]]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  Traffic and Travel   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion People Read This News Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion People Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           Traffic and Travel      N.I. mankilled in serious road traffic collisionA man in his s has died after a one vehicle road traffic collision in Northern Ireland on Friday morning.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people.

The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

Of those,  have been empty for more than two years.Landlords will be given incentives to bring long term empty properties into use as the council says they attract crime and anti-social behaviour, drive down values and become ldquodetrimental to the lives of residents.Measures are set out in a draft strategy which the councilrsquos cabinet, on July , agreed to publish for public consultation.While the council wants landlords to accept help to get homes in use, the strategy says theauthority will take actionnecessary.Vale council deputy leader Cllr Lis Burnett told the meeting she was ldquostunned more than  homes in the Vale have been empty for more than two years.ldquoItrsquos absolutely staggering, she said. ldquoA strategy on a way we can tackle it is very welcome. Empty properties are detrimental to the lives of local residents.ldquoThey are often a magnet for crime and continue to blight neighbourhoods. They can also be a risk to emergency services.Some  Vale properties have been empty for more than  years, but most long-term empty properties are vacant for six months to two years. In April , the St Augustinersquos ward in Penarth had the most long-term empty homes, with  empty for more than six months and  for more than two years.Penarthrsquos Plymouth ward had more than  empty for more than six months, and more than  empty for more than two years.The proposed strategy calls on the council to maintain and improve its empty homes data, provide financial incentives to landlords, prioritise empty homes for enforcement action such as enforced sales and compulsory purchase orders, and to raise awareness of the issue of empty homes.The strategy says: ldquoA voluntary way forward to renovation and re-occupation is always the preferred option, and officers make all available endeavours to encourage and persuade such progress.ldquoHowever, in instances where owners cannot be traced or where exhaustive attempts to encourage and promote progress from known owners prove unproductive, orthere is an imminent risk to health and safety, there is little option but to proceed with a statutory solution,The draft empty homes strategy will be put to public consultation after the councilrsquos August recess. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland.

It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations.

The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.
