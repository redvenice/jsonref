Bright-yellow stripes are being applied to the pavement at now-familiar two-metre intervals outside the school’s three sets of gates, and over the next few days, these markers will appear in classrooms, too. In between, dedicated routes will be laid out to take children safely from the school gates to their classroom doors.These plans, orchestrated by Bonneville’s headteacher, Andrea Parker, were being rolled out as the school prepared to reopen its doors to reception, year 1 and year 6 pupils in line with the latest government guidelines. Schools, colleges and nurseries across England welcomed more children and students from 1 June onwards – and headteachers like Parker are busy preparing to embrace a new way of learning.“For every headteacher, keeping children safe is going to be at the top of their priorities”, says Parker, who is also the lead headteacher for Jessop primary and Stockwell primary schools. “We began our preparations by sending out a survey to check the pulse of how teachers and parents were feeling about returning to school. From there, we were able to start modelling what we need to do to support our families, and help them to feel more confident in sending their children back.”Since lockdown, the school has continued to take in around 25 of its 420 pupils each day, split into smaller groups for safety – the children of key workers, those from vulnerable families, or with education, health and care plans in place. “We’ve been open every day during lockdown,” says Parker. “Staff members even volunteered to work through the holidays, which has been fantastic.”Meanwhile, those teachers who have remained at home have been working on providing the online resources parents need for home schooling. “Overnight, we’ve all had to completely change how we work on a day-to-day basis with no training and no transition period, and teachers have been working incredibly hard to achieve that,” she says.At the same time, Parker believes temporary home schooling can’t replace the benefits of schools-based education, especially when it comes to the transitions experienced by those children who will begin returning to school from 1 June.“Reception, year 1 and year 6 are all key milestones,” she says. “Younger children are in the early stages of their education, and we want to be there for them as they develop their reading and friendship groups, and simply learn how to learn.“At the other end of the spectrum, year 6 are about to go to secondary school. It’s a time when they celebrate their SATs and everything they’ve achieved and worked hard for.”The Bonneville school building, which dates back to 1905, is large and welcoming. When I visit, days before reopening, crafted cardboard models of sea animals hang from the ceilings, and children’s work covers every inch of spare space on the walls.With only a fraction of the school’s 420 pupils in attendance – including Parker’s own six-year-old daughter, who is in school as the child of a key worker – the sound of children’s laughter, which usually fills these hallways, can only faintly be heard drifting in from the playground.“Our teachers are very excited and as desperate to see the children as I am,” she says. “They’re anxious, too, but going through our risk assessments with them has helped a lot.“With fewer children coming back to start with, we don’t need everybody to be here, which means those who are very anxious can be asked to come back later on. Hopefully they’ll see how things are working and their confidence will build – some people just need that, much like the parents who need to have a choice.”Home schooling for those children who remain at home will continue to be supported by teachers, but to reassure those who do send their children in, a raft of safety measures has been put in place.At the school gates, parents are required to socially distance from each other (guided by those painted stripes) during staggered drop-offs. “Bubbles” of up to 15 children will be dropped off together, with an allocated “bubble lead” – the class teacher – taking students into the building in shifts.Before entering their classroom, they sanitise their hands before being allocated a desk each for taking lessons, watching pre-recorded assemblies, and eating lunch, which will be delivered at the door. Outside space will be utilised for lessons as much as possible, while playtime and PE will be enjoyed within the children’s inidual groups.“Although younger children will be in smaller groups, it’s not just about the size of each bubble – it’s about dynamics as well,” says Parker. “Children are people with their own personalities and their own way of being, so we have to make sure each one is a manageable group and dynamic.”Extra hygiene measures include specific play and sports equipment allocated to each bubble, regular handwashing, staggered bathroom breaks followed by janitor cleaning, and early closing on Friday afternoons for deep-cleaning sessions. The early Friday closure will also be used to facilitate statutory planning and preparation time for teachers. The school has also drawn up sets of principles that parents, teachers and children will be asked to adhere to.For staff, these include having an awareness of each other – for example, no more than two teachers in the staffroom at a time. For children, the principles include reinforcing the NHS’s Catch it, Bin it, Kill it messaging. For parents, coming to collect children as quickly as possible if they fall ill.Bonneville has also worked to tailor specific solutions to the erse community the school serves. “In terms of the country Lambeth is hugely erse”, says Parker, citing the borough’s significant Caribbean, African and Asian communities, as well as pupils from Spanish-, French- and Portuguese-speaking backgrounds.“We know that the BAME community have surfaced as being prone to having a higher rate of infection”, says Parker, explaining that the school’s risk assessment process is being developed with the heightened vulnerability of BAME students, staff and their wider community in mind.Communicating to children why their schools have changed is a crucial part of helping them adapt to their new regimes, so Parker plans to share a virtual tour of the new school layout with pupils, and plug lessons about the roles of key workers into the curriculum.Parker’s plans have focused on building confidence among children, staff and parents, and communicating with them every step of the way. “It’s about trying to adapt, even though we don’t know how long we’re going to be adapting for,” she says.Check with your Local Authority for the latest news on schools opening in your area.This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

But thanks to safety measures put in place, a branch of David Abrahamovitch’s coffee chain is welcoming back happy customers and staffFor David Abrahamovitch, founder of cult coffee brand Grind, the decision to close his London-based food, coffee and cocktail bars was a painful one – and the decision to reopen one branch as a takeaway outlet on 20 May took even more careful planning.Abrahamovitch’s business journey started in 2011, when he inherited his father’s company. “I was 25 when I sadly lost my dad and inherited the family’s mobile phone business,” he says. “I had to decide what to do next – are we going to continue, are we going to close? I’d spent a lot of time in the shop as a teenager, helping out behind the counter, so it was very sentimental for me. I decided I wanted to keep the building and turn it into some kind of meeting place.”Converting the Old Street premises into a coffee shop, Abrahamovitch set about growing his business based on the cafes he’d visited on his travels. “I’d seen the independent cafe scene in other countries, and back then it just didn’t feel like it had been fully translated to the UK,” he says.“I wanted to recreate that Australian-style flat-white culture, with high-quality coffee beans, the best equipment, and amazing baristas who serve cups of coffee somewhere fun, lively and energetic. And I wanted to mix that with what the coffee chains do so well: good hygiene, mobile ordering and payment options and, most importantly, speedy service. A year later, we added cocktails when we realised our coffee made amazing espresso martinis!”Over the next nine years Abrahamovitch rolled his business out, spreading to 11 locations with 300 members of staff, serving sit-down breakfasts, lunch and dinner alongside coffee and cocktails. Grind also has an online business selling compostable coffee pods in refillable tins.When coronavirus reached the UK, Abrahamovitch’s business was sent into turmoil. “I’ve lived and bled this company for almost 10 years, and built it piece by piece, so finally getting to the point where we have tens of thousands of customers each week, then suddenly having to close was awful,” he says. “I remember the week of lockdown vividly. For a couple of weeks beforehand, we’d already seen sales start to fall away. We monitor sales to the hour, so when things start to drop off, you really notice it.“Then, when Boris Johnson told people they shouldn’t visit restaurants and bars, it was clear to us it was time to close. We shut all our stores, keeping just three open for takeaway to serve the local community for a few more days. When full lockdown was announced, we decided to close completely to protect our staff.”In the weeks since lockdown began, significantly more has been learned about the spread of Covid-19, and on 10 May the government announced certain businesses could reopen, with stringent safety rules in place. Guidance on how bosses can protect their workers, and how staff can safely travel into work, was drawn up. So now, companies such as Grind are taking tentative steps towards getting back to business, and on 20 May, its Greenwich outlet reopened its doors for grab-and-go coffees.Since plans to reopen were made, the safety of both staff and customers has been paramount. Grind works with a food hygiene company that has helped Abrahamovitch stay on top of the new government guidelines on safety and hygiene. “I think we’re all in a testing phase and figuring this out at the moment, but we’ve taken the steps we think are sensible without filling the place with yellow tape,” he says.“Only a couple of people are allowed inside the shop at any one time. Staff wear gloves, and at the tills there are big plastic screens separating them from customers – we haven’t made the wearing of masks mandatory, but they’re available if staff would like to use one.“We also have signs in the windows asking people to observe social distancing, stickers on the floor indicating what a two-metre gap looks like, and a hand sanitising station. It’s slightly odd having these things everywhere, but it seems to be working so far. I think people have got used to that kind of process in the last few weeks.”As well as coffee, the store is selling fresh bread, eggs and avocados, in lieu of breakfast. “We weren’t selling those things before, but we have great suppliers who make amazing bread and send us amazing eggs,” he says. “If we can help them and sell a few more products ourselves too, it makes sense. When you’ve suddenly got a daily bread delivery, it feels like you’re getting the wheels turning again.”Abrahamovitch took the inidual needs of his staff into careful consideration, making decisions based on the government’s advice, along with his own sense of duty to worried workers. On reopening Greenwich Grind, he took the simple step of asking which of his staff would be keen to return to work.“Everyone who wanted to be furloughed has been furloughed,” he says. “We haven’t laid anyone off as a result of this crisis, which helps me sleep better at night. Of those who volunteered to come back to Greenwich Grind, we selected those who live very close to the store, so there’s no need for them to get public transport into work. Lots of our staff walk or cycle in anyway, so if someone wants to come back, and lives close to a store we’re reopening, that’s a good fit.”Abrahamovitch hopes these measures will prove successful, and will lay the foundations for further, tentative reopenings. “We’re certainly expecting to learn a lot from this reopening,” he says. “At a lot of our sites, social distancing isn’t actually the biggest issue – for example, our London Bridge site relies on customers who work in the offices in the area, and the tourists who come to visit Borough Market at the weekend. Until they’re back, it’s going to be hard for us to reopen, but I hope to reopen one or two more branches in the next couple of weeks.”Abrahamovitch’s customers and staff are especially pleased by this step on the way to resuming business. “One of my staff texted me on the first day of reopening and said: ‘I’m so happy to be back and not just sitting in my living room. It’s been amazing.’ So that was pretty nice,” he says. “Our customers are thrilled, too – I was there the day before we opened, checking the safety measures for myself, and people were knocking on the door hoping to get inside early.“For me, as a customer, every time a place reopens I’m really happy. I think: ‘Great, I’ve got somewhere else to go, different people to meet, some different walls to look at.’ It’s definitely the same for our customers. They’re very pleased to have us back.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Born in 1931, Colegate’s first job was as an assistant to the literary agent Anthony Blond. She then became a writer, and for 45 years lived with her husband, Michael Briggs, the chairman of the Bath Preservation Trust, at Midford Castle in Somerset, where they brought up their three children.

That’s not a very interesting answer, but it’s the truth. I did put a lot of emotion into those three books, though. I found myself possessed by the story. I was extraordinarily interested in the history of that time – the period after the war – and with all the ways in which life changed. Perhaps it’s that as time goes on, people seem to get more interested in that period, not less. This is curious. It’s possible that its importance is still sinking in.\u0026nbspWere you rather in love with your hero, Orlando?\u0026nbspA little bit.

Rosen was admitted to hospital in the week of 23 March and spend his first night in intensive care on 29 March, before being placed on a ward.

Under the covers for bed-breaking shakes. Image of war hero biting on a hankie, while best mate plunges live charcoal into the wound to cauterise it.”The next day he wondered whether he was suffering from heavy flu rather than coronavirus. “Have had no chest pains.

Even if carmaking restarts quickly, production for 2020 will surely be the lowest in years. What happens beyond that is an open question, as a result of comments last week from Nissan’s chief operating officer, Ashwani Gupta.“You know we are the number one carmaker in the UK and we want to continue,” he told the BBC. “We are committed.”Two sentences two inaccuracies. First, Nissan made 346,871 cars in the UK in 2019, against Jaguar Land Rover’s 385,197 (although the latter were produced at various locations). The second caveat was rather more important: the carmaker is committed, but only up to a point.“Having said that, if we are not getting the current tariffs, it’s not our intention, but the business will not be sustainable,” Gupta said. “That’s what everybody has to understand.”The exasperation of car executives at still having to deal with Brexit on top of everything else is almost palpable – particularly at Nissan, which has already said it will be shedding 2,800 workers in Barcelona as part of a deep restructuring in favour of the UK plant.Sunderland is one of 35 Nissan plants worldwide, according to industry data company Marklines, even when those operated by its alliance partners, Renault and Mitsubishi, are not included. It has survived one crisis so far a second might be tempting fate.As Adrian Hallmark, chief executive of luxury carmaker Bentley, put it last week after announcing 1,000 job cuts, a no-deal Brexit would add another human-made disaster on top of the virus. Thousands of redundancies at Aston Martin, McLaren, Renault and parts manufacturer ZF are testament to the difficulties facing the entire global car industry. “My message to politicians is this: please don’t push us off a second cliff,” Hallmark told the Financial Times.So where does this leave Sunderland? A symbol of Great British quality or of Britannia’s declining fortunes? The truth is, as in most cases, somewhere in between. Britain’s largest car plant is a genuine exemplar of car-a-minute efficiency, and Nissan does not want to let it go.

I have some sympathy with the person who demanded that scientists should be locked in a room and not let out till they agree the facts.\u0026nbspExcept that this debate is as much about values as facts.One of my colleagues is a philosopher of science. On day one of his course, he sends his students out to “go and get a fact, and bring it back to class”. When they return, he invites them, one by one, to carefully present and defend their fact against critique from fellow students. How was it sourced? How was it measured? Does it stand firm now that it has been plucked from its context?\u0026nbspNo fact ever survives in the form that the student presents it. The lesson is that being rigorous and systematic in producing a fact does not make that fact absolute.Take randomised controlled trials, for example. Surely it’s good science to take a sample of people during a pandemic, randomly allocate half of them to wear cloth face coverings, and look for a statistically significant difference in how many develop the disease?\u0026nbspLet’s unpack the quest for that particular fact. First, let’s design the intervention. As laboratory studies have shown, fabric materials are good at stopping large viral-laden droplets on their way out, but they’re not very good at stopping tiny airborne viral particles on the way in. So the intervention we need to test is something called source control: the effectiveness of my cloth mask in protecting you yours in protecting me.Let’s therefore test, in all members of the general public (population), the impact of cloth face coverings (intervention) compared to no coverings (control) in public places (setting) for preventing infection in other members of the public (outcome).There have never been any such trials. Why not?\u0026nbspBecause such a trial would be impossible. Which people, exactly, would you randomise? Everyone who lives in a particular street? Everyone who catches a particular bus? To be included in a randomised trial, people have to give informed consent and agree to comply with the intervention. If only a small proportion agrees, how many streets or bus-loads or squares-full of people would you need to invite in order to get enough to generate your “fact”?How would you test the hypothesis that my mask protects you? This is problematic because, instead of just following up with one inidual who is already signed up to the study (me), you’d somehow need to identify a fraction of all the people I came into contact with as I went about my life, and test each of them to see if they developed the disease. But none of those other people (random street-dwellers or bus passengers or square-crossers) agreed to be in the trial in the first place. You simply can’t study them like laboratory animals (though someone has done a randomised controlled trial to show that face coverings are highly effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission in hamsters).In order to “do science” on the effectiveness of face coverings in the real world, you would either have to define some kind of closed system to be your sampling frame, say a school or home environment, or compromise and study the effect of mask-wearing on the wearer rather than on other people. And that’s what scientists have done.I’ve reviewed all the published randomised trials on masks and face coverings for the general public in a peer-reviewed scientific paper. The trials consist of studies of mask-wearing in closed systems and of masks to protect the wearer, usually at specific mass events (notably, pilgrimages to the Hajj). Furthermore, all these studies were done some time ago when the prevailing diseases were colds and flu. None looked at prevention of Covid-19.What did these not-terribly-relevant trials show? Masks seemed to provide some protection for the wearer, but effects were small and usually not statistically significant (perhaps because studies were just too small to produce a clear answer). Masks given in the home, for example to protect the parents of a child with flu from catching it themselves, didn’t have much effect – but then they weren’t worn much (for a variety of reasons including “child did not like parent wearing mask”).\u0026nbspThese findings are facts of a sort. I’d love to discuss them with my philosopher colleague’s students. But the bottom line is we have no directly relevant facts from randomised controlled trials of source control in Covid-19. What now? Demand that policy should not change until the much-desired randomised trial exists? Or suck it and see?\u0026nbspHere’s where values come in.Randomised trials were developed to test drugs. As we know from thalidomide, new drugs can cause terrible harm. Scientists arguing for caution in the masking debate are almost all medically trained and view the principle “do no harm” (by which they mean, never give a new drug to any patient before it’s been tested in a randomised trial) as overriding.\u0026nbspIn public health, however, interventions are usually introduced pragmatically and evaluated as before-and-after natural experiments. There are no randomised controlled trials in community settings, for example, of handwashing, social distancing, closing schools, quarantining, closing borders or contact tracing. Public health scientists value natural experiments highly because they view the trade-off between real-world achievability and experimental ideals as worthwhile. Like dozens of other countries, England is about to have a natural experiment of face coverings in public places. Still, the scientists will continue to argue. If transmission rates of Covid-19 fall as predicted, public health experts – and I count myself among them – will say this has produced a “fact” that face coverings are effective source control.\u0026nbspAnd triallists will say that in the absence of a trial (which they will continue to demand), this is not a fact because there’s no robust evidence that the association is causal.\u0026nbspWhether we can agree on “the facts” or not, we’ll hopefully welcome the positive outcomes, as I predict that transmission of Covid-19 will fall and that any harms will be relatively minor and worth the trade-off.•\u0026nbspTrish Greenhalgh is a professor of primary care health sciences at Oxford University"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83411627e558b699049241bbe7b0fecb4ff6090f/3_0_10661_6400/master/10661.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ae53900a308c61596aee31728882596","title":"if we cant rely on its honesty reallly no point to confessional journalism","story":"A less noted victim of the Cummings saga is writing whose virtue is meant to be candourA confession. When I first read Mary Wakefield’s Spectator article “Getting coronavirus does not bring clarity”, I believed every word. As gullible as that sounds, her heartfelt account, with its hints for other simultaneously afflicted parents – “make it your child’s job to take your temperature” – seemed if anything to overshare about domestic life with Dominic Cummings and little Cedd.Did we need, for instance, spasms “that made the muscles lump and twitch in his legs”? We know her husband likes to show off his bottom in Downing Street, but still. Ditto a digression on the real Cummings: “An extremely kind man, whatever people assume to the contrary.”A companion piece by her husband on their weeks variously described as “in lockdown”, “stuck indoors” and “shut in together”, offered further evocative touches. “Everything,” he wrote, in a very serviceable attempt at human, “is covered in a layer of spilt Ribena, honey, peanut butter and playschool glue.”Though the couple’s story hardly lacked, then, for tokens of sincerity, there was the additional detail, for anyone who’d heard rumours about the whereabouts of the prime minister’s chief adviser, that Wakefield, a commissioning editor on the Spectator, is as pious as he is kind. “What’s there to do for the sick now,” she asked, “except pray?”With Boris Johnson in peril, she confided, she knelt and “found to my surprise that my prayers flowed easily, as if carried along in a current of others”.Perhaps that’s why, when the Today programme invited her to read her confessions aloud, some listeners mistook them for a particularly ghastly Thought for the Day. Actually, perhaps it also explains the miracle that is, surely, Wakefield’s professional survival, her reputation only lightly tarnished, to date, by revelations about the London breakout. Although Ipso, the press regulator, has yet to adjudicate, following complaints of inaccuracies, her employer appears content to have published a piece that reads in hindsight less like a confessional column, more a relatable alibi.Prepare, if Wakefield’s confection passes for journalism, for a new press award, sponsored by the Spectator and awarded to the unreliable narrator of the year. Entries expected to feature include sickness columns by the fully recovered, meat cookery by a vegan, marital bliss by the acutely miserable, financial woe as depicted by the affluent. To be fair, at least one of those has already happened.\u0026nbspConfessional journalism, if it weren’t a crafted form of personal disclosure – whether obliquely flattering or therapeutic – would be too tedious, too painful or otherwise unpublishable. You expect to relate, laugh or learn something, not fact-check. But its finest exponents, from Nora Ephron down, have been admired, as much as anything, for honesty. You didn’t read “I feel bad about my neck” suspecting that the American writer had left out an important episode featuring aesthetic surgery. Years of excruciating openness, starting well before online publication added to the deterrents, are what made Liz Jones synonymous with British confessional journalism.If plainly misled, readers would be entitled to react like Oprah Winfrey when she discovered that James Frey’s memoir, A Million Little Pieces, initially hailed as “unflinchingly honest”, was substantially make-believe: “I feel duped.” His publishers offered refunds.Whatever difficulties a reader might have with aspects of the Spectator – from Taki to the Barclay brothers who own the magazine – it can’t be faulted for employee support. Unless, that is, the Wakefield approach typifies the in-house understanding of authenticity. Perhaps Toby Young is really very popular. At any rate, readers expecting some sort of explanation have had to be satisfied, instead, with a terrific piece by Alex Massie on why Cummings had to go.Radio 4’s Today programme (which ministers were reportedly instructed by Cummings to shun) appears similarly to have moved on from broadcasting pro-Cummings propaganda that, even before the Durham revelations, sounded professionally deranged.\u0026nbspWe await, now we know that homily obscured errors of judgment well beyond those for which other officials have resigned, the kind of public BBC rebuke to which Emily Maitlis was recently subjected.As for Wakefield, unlike her husband, she hasn’t – yet – had to invent some farrago explaining why her account overlooked a quarantine-busting return to Downing Street, that invisible mob outside the London house, the 260-mile flight into Durham, two standby (but not train-going) nieces and a virus-ridden trip to hospital, but did include lines that cannot be aligned with his testimony. “Dom couldn’t get out of bed,” she wrote, of a period when he collected her from hospital.If Downing Street refused to comment, on 5, then 10 April, on how Cummings spent his sick leave, Wakefield, on 25 April, made up for it. “Day in, day out for ten days he lay doggo…” Knowing his leg muscles and sticky home as intimately as we do, it seems reasonable to ask if he wouldn’t\u0026nbspsubsequently tell his journalist wife about the journalists\u0026nbspbothering his workplace about their journey.That they embolden inquisitive readers is one reason confessional writers need, as well as talent, great confidence or the thickest of hides. Both, preferably. Introduce a partner and hisher drollsaintly ways and, next thing, people will not just spot a sudden absence but remark, online, that they don’t blame herhim for doing a runner. A columnist will open up about, say, disabling depression and somebody with disabling depression will point out acidly that it never seems to stop them working. So make out, if only by evasion, that your sick family stayed in “London lockdown”, instead of ignoring rules being observed by truly desperate and grieving people, and some busybody is sure to take it upon themselves to look up Kant on the distinction between lying and deception.Was Wakefield wrong to write as she did? Or should readers blame themselves for drawing, from the information available, the wrong conclusions? Hopefully Ipso will soon let us know."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/787d7302822f5b9e27efcb27fa5cf8242ec3b8bc/0_129_3252_1952/master/3252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8483557b0db4fbb009b42f1e0963de53","title":"its been a long 13 years for the mccanns i wish them some peace","story":"Whether or not their daughter’s case is solved, sympathy is the only responseHas the Madeleine McCann case finally been solved? Maybe. Maybe not. Regardless, Madeleine’s parents, Kate and Gerry, have long been owed a heartfelt apology from sectors of the British public and media.Christian Brückner was jailed last year for the rape of a 72-year-old woman in Praia da Luz, Portugal (where Madeleine was abducted), and his other convictions include child sexual abuse and he may be linked to the disappearance of a five-year-old girl in Germany and a six-year-old boy in Portugal.\u0026nbspBut even if Brückner is convicted, it would not make up for the relentless criticism, speculation and abuse the McCanns have suffered for 13 harrowing years.Even today, people rant about how the McCanns shouldn’t have left the then three-year-old Madeleine and her twin siblings alone in an apartment, while they dined with friends (as so many holidaymakers have done). All these years on, do people think this is an original thought or, more pertinently, that the McCanns don’t regret that decision with every fibre of their being? What possible justification, bar sanctimony and gossip, is there for kicking that tender bruise?However, this has been the tone throughout. People declaring they were “positive” that the McCanns murdered their daughter (and disposed of the body, while scrutinised by police and global media?) others deciding the couple were “money-hungry””publicity-grabbers”, which makes no sense. To keep looking for Madeleine, the McCanns needed as much publicity and funding as possible. In the end, they received endless exposure and millions of pounds – considerably more than most cases get. Would you, as a desperate parent, have turned it down?This case has been about a lot of things – our obsessive reappraisal of childhood and ranking of ourselves (and others) as “good”“bad” parents. The rebranding of “true crime” (including child murder) from documentary to family-friendly entertainment. But it’s also been about class. Some thought the McCanns were supported and defended because they were middle class, but it seems equally true that it has been used against them.\u0026nbspHow many times were they denounced as “cold”, “stiff’, “unnatural”? Never mind that both parents had modest backgrounds and worked hard to become medics. Or that they were clearly private and reserved by nature. The script required them to be aloof, uptight, emotionless – every outdated caricature of the middle class – so that indeed was that.I’m not arguing that the McCanns are living saints, because that would just dehumanise them further. I’m also aware that, here I am, a member of the media, discussing this “hot topic” yet again. Still, as it looks as though there could possibly be some kind of closure for the McCanns, it’s time to look at ourselves too. The entire world wants to know what happened to Madeleine McCann, but that’s no excuse for a 13-year grubby, toxic pile-on.Exactly how toothless is the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, when it really matters for British citizens? Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian womanimprisoned in Iran since 2016, is to continue her furlough from prison. However, she has yet to be granted full clemency, which she qualifies for, and which would enable her to return to the UK.Meanwhile, US prisoner Michael White has been released in an apparent prisoner swap, with Donald Trump tweeting: “Thank you to Iran. It shows a deal is possible.” Well, not apparently for three Tory foreign secretaries: Boris Johnson (who made Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s situation worse), Jeremy Hunt and now Raab.There have been reports on the £400m owed by the UK to Iran, relating to an arms deal and how this is probably scuppering efforts to secure Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s release. The government has been implored to settle the debt, to no avail. Raab also refused an application asking him to dispatch the UK ambassador to Iran to see Zaghari-Ratcliffe as a “show of solidarity”. Then there’s the case of Harry Dunn, the 19-year-old who was riding his motorcycle near RAF Croughton, Northamptonshire, when he was knocked over and killed by the wife of a US intelligence officer, who fled to America and refused to return. Last week, the Dunn family spoke about how they’ve been manipulatedand misled, with Raab appearing to put the needs of the US before justice for their son.In both cases, Raab isn’t doing his job properly. He seems to be quite the bully when he wants to be, but submissive and weak… again, when he wants to be. British citizens deserve better than this.The Greek Orthodox church has condemned yoga as “wrong” and “incompatible” with Christianity because of links to Hinduism. Blimey.Personally, I’d say what’s wrong with yoga is that it appears to have been co-opted by the exercise smuggerati, who seem to feel that yoga mats and dramatic whisperings of “Namaste!” make them spiritually superior to other exercisers.\u0026nbspYoga wasn’t always like this. Time was, people seemed able to throw on some jogging bottoms and get on with the cobra or whatever. Arguably, the whole point was that yoga was freeing, in that it required no expensive equipment and its lessons could prove beneficial for a lifetime.For some, it’s still like that. However, yoga has also been overtaken by the same people who charge into every health pursuit and make it competitive, expensive, elitist and therefore deeply irritating.Add, too, the insta-yoga brigade’s tacked-on “spirituality”. Other forms of exercise don’t breed this attitude. People don’t get off crosstrainers and treadmills, saying: “I feel closer to God now.” Frankly, some of us feel closer to death.Ultimately, it seems odd to class yoga as “wrong” in a meaningful religious context. If anything, there are times when this hugely lucrative global industry looks the very opposite of spiritual."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/177f68b8ce498b4d3d4b21afb37bb6961e4a243a/0_54_4280_2567/master/4280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45355f1edc69192c47ac21e46be1a0a0","title":"one man stands between joe biden and the us presidency mark zuckerberg","story":"Donald Trump knows that Facebook can help him win in November, and Zuckerberg has too much to lose by censoring himWatching the violent chaos night after night in the US, I keep thinking of what Benjamin Franklin said to the woman who asked him, as he emerged from the constitutional convention in 1787: “Well, Doctor, what have we got, a republic or a monarchy?” To which he famously replied: “A republic, if you can keep it.” What’s happening on the streets there at the moment suggests that they could be coming close to losing it.When Trump was elected, I was assured by my American friends that the republic’s democratic institutions, conventions and constitution were strong enough to rein in the narcissistic despot. Sure, it might be a rollercoaster ride, they conceded, but the republic would pull through. Well, if my transatlantic email is anything to go by, some of that cheery confidence seems to have evaporated.The thing that keeps my friends going, though, is the fact that Trump, despite his frantic, violent flailings, and despite his apparently rock-solid hold on a third of the electorate, is trailing Joe Biden in the polls. So, the thinking goes, if we all hold our nerve, the nightmare will end on 20 January 2021, when Trump has to hand over power to his victorious opponent.At which point my mind goes back to this time in 2016, when similar sentiments were the conventional wisdom about the chances of Trump defeating Hillary Clinton. And one of the most agonising questions in the aftermath of that election was: how could Nate Silver and co have got it so wrong?The answer is simple: nobody, including opinion pollsters, knew about the Trump campaign’s astonishing mastery of social media, especially Facebook. Trump may not have known much about that at the time – he really only understood Twitter – but Brad Parscale and his team sure knew how to make use of Facebook’s micro-targeting machine. And they did.Spool forward to now. Trump knows that if things continue as they are – with no party conventions or mass rallies and if the election is held in November (a sizable “if” IMHO) – then Biden will win. The only thing that could change that is – you guessed it! – Facebook.This thought is now informing everything he does. In particular, it explains his response to having his tweets labelled by Twitter by issuing a fatuous executive order (EO) threatening changes in Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act. This is the clause that shields social media companies from legal liability for stuff that users post on their platforms. It’s what underpins the business models of Twitter, Facebook and Google, among others.Legally, the executive order is a farce and may be unconstitutional. Most of the media thought it was aimed at Twitter but in fact, as the academic Zeynep Tufekci spotted immediately, its real target was Facebook, which has much more to lose if Section 230 were to be radically amended. And, as a warning shot, it worked a treat. No sooner had news of the EO emerged than who should turn up – on Fox News, Trump’s favourite TV channel – than Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook boss, solemnly intoning his view “that Facebook shouldn’t be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online. Private companies probably shouldn’t be… in the position of doing that.”Evidence that the strategy of ensuring that Facebook was onboard for the Trump ride quickly emerged. When Trump, addressing “those THUGS” demonstrating in Minneapolis, tweeted “When the looting starts, the shooting starts”, Twitter flagged the tweet as violating its policy against “glorifying violence”. Over at Facebook, however, Mark Zuckerberg made a personal decision to leave the equivalent message up on Facebook.What it all comes down to is this: only one man – Mark Zuckerberg – now stands between Joe Biden and the US presidency. If he were to decide (and in these matters his controlling stake in Facebook means he is unchallengeable) that the company’s famed micro-targeting engine were to be off-limits to both Trump and Biden and their various supporting organisations, then Trump’s candidacy would be toast.He won’t do it, of course, for the simple reason that there’s a lot of money to be made from politics in the 150 days between now and the presidential election. And if Trump wins, Zuckerberg will have that – and its grisly aftermath – on what is laughingly called his conscience.

You might also recall that parts of London were destroyed in the Great Fire because they were made largely of wood, after which they were rebuilt in brick and stone. So it will seem a reasonable reaction to the Grenfell disaster that the government banned timber (along with other combustible materials) from the exterior of residential buildings more than 18 metres high.This ban started in 2018, with the promise to review it. Now it is proposing both to continue and extend it so that it covers buildings more than 11 metres high, and uses such as hotels as well as blocks of flats (in England only – Scotland and Wales have slightly different arrangements). Better, you will probably think, to be safe than sorry. But there’s a cost to this caution, which is that it will impede one of the most promising recent innovations in building.There are other advantages. Current techniques mean that timber structures can be made into components away from building sites and then assembled there, which has benefits for quality, precision and speed of construction. It is lighter and easier to transport than its alternatives. It is versatile and can be used to make walls and floors as well as the frames that hold buildings up. Wood is an inherently pleasing material, both visually and acoustically.It makes for building sites that are cleaner, safer, quieter and more pleasant – think of the difference, in terms of the effects on your ears and arms, between drilling into wood and into concrete. Engineered timber requires fewer workers on a building site and, given that construction workers now account for a large number of Covid-19 cases, the benefit is not purely economic. As for the question of fire: if it is thick enough and dense enough, wood burns slowly, because it protects itself from further damage by charring, whereas at high temperatures steel is given to sudden collapse.Britain’s main contribution has been through its architects and engineers. The architectural practice dRMM has been finding creative uses for engineered timber for two decades another, Waugh Thistleton, has used it for multistorey housing in London and an industrial building in Warwickshire. The 2018 ban, however, has cut short these architects’ contributions. A timber-built 11-storey housing tower by dRMM, in the London borough of Newham, has been cancelled. High-performing timber construction will continue to expand, in other words, in many parts of the world, but will be held back in England. Of course no one should be blase about what is a fast-developing technology and continuing testing and research are needed to ensure its safety, but the same is true of many techniques used in modern construction. For all these reasons, a number of organisations and businesses, including the Architects’ Climate Action Network and the Royal Institute of British Architects, have urged the government to reconsider.Part of the problem is that the current ban doesn’t adequately distinguish between the cladding, or outer skin of a building, and its structure. There is almost universal agreement that it is reasonable to ban timber cladding on buildings of more than a few storeys high. But one of the beauties of engineered timber is that it can function as the stuff that does the hard work of holding a building up, as the layer that encloses the interior and as the surface that you look at. While it is possible to conceal a wooden structure beneath another material, this loses much of the simplicity that is one of its advantages.A strange aspect in all of this is that Grenfell Tower was not made of timber, but of reinforced concrete clad in polyethylene and aluminium. While the Grenfell inquiry, which has been delayed by the pandemic, has not reached its conclusions, it is perverse to ban a blameless material while we’re waiting.It is easy to imagine the headlines that a politician would fear if a wooden building were to catch fire in the future. It will take a smidgen of courage for the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, whose department is responsible for building regulations, to make an exception for structural timber. What matters most is its potential for economic and environmental good. He should not be in the business of the pointless prohibition of such a thing.•Rowan Moore is the Observer’s architecture critic"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcf757087a286881ce9399ffc87a0d17965fb370/0_177_3438_2064/master/3438.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae0c11a8b8fdec2bfe352b0260b5a300","title":"who had it hardest in lockdown needless competition","story":"The government needs to introduce a points system, awarding compensation for everything from baby wrangling to noisy neighboursMy four-year-old twins went back to nursery on Monday, so lockdown ostensibly ended for them this week. Thrilling for them and, let’s be honest here, thrilling for me: I take the easing of the pandemic restrictions incredibly seriously, of course, but I’ll admit, there may have been some quiet crowing about my rediscovered freedom, albeit one in which I’m still unable to see my friends or parents. Whole hours when I can work – work! – without being interrupted by someone asking why Snoopy doesn’t talk, or why they aren’t allowed to drink Toilet Duck. The great wide open stretching in front of me is positively giddy-making. Time to rewatch the whole of Parks And Recreation… I mean, write that novel!But this kind of talk does not go down well with two demographics who make up the majority of my friends: people whose kids are not back to school and those who don’t have kids, and so take such crowing as an implied suggestion that lockdown has been a nonstop box set binge for them. Although really, you’d think my friends would know by now that I’m not talking about them: it’s always all about me.The beginning of lockdown already feels more distant than my school days, but I distinctly remember there was a hope – an expectation, even – that we would feel some kind of collective unity during this. We’re all in it together! After all, why else were we doing this, if not to protect one another? But the cracks started to appear pretty quickly. There was anger (justified) at those who fled to their second homes, and a general feeling (less justified) that everyone had to acknowledge what is now known as their “privilege” any time they spoke about how they were finding lockdown. Rare was the text I received in April and May that didn’t include some kind of embarrassed apology for complaining when the sender had a gardenfoodfunctioning lungs. I’m not sure when the memo went out that unless you were on your deathbed you weren’t allowed to find living through a global plague an ordeal, but I haven’t kept up with the daily briefings.I’m a great fan of venting. Unless people feel free to vent, their dusty complaints turn into corrosive resentments. This, I think, lies behind a tendency I increasingly noticed in myself and others this spring, which was not to complain about one’s own lockdown situation, but instead to point to others who have it so much easier. Gardens were the first battleground, with people rightly pointing out that limits on outdoor activity weren’t such a hardship if you have a 20ft garden out back. Then parenthood became a flashpoint, with arguments raging online about whether being locked down with children was as much of an ordeal as parents said, or just a grownup temper tantrum.Dominic Cummings blew all this skywards when he claimed that it was totally reasonable for him and his family to go to Durham, because of his “exceptional circumstances”, which turned out to be being a parent. Suddenly, the whole of Britain, from newspaper letters pages to people on Cummings’ own street, was shouting about their own circumstances – single parenthood, loneliness, looking after toddler triplets while sick with the virus – as the frustrations of the past months burst forth in an outraged gush.Cummings unleashed it, but this frustration had been building the lockdown has been a slog for all. If Cummings had just acknowledged that in the first place when asked about his trip, instead of suggesting his struggle was “exceptional”, he’d have saved himself a lot of bother. Yes, some people have had it easier than others, but engaging in lockdown hardship top trumps is only going to hurt you, as you lie awake at 4am, feeling your anxiety headache morph into a rage. Or so I’ve, er, heard.There is an easy way to resolve this: the government needs to introduce a points system, awarding compensation according to how hard an inidual’s lockdown has been. This will make everyone feel that their own struggle has been acknowledged, which is really what lies at the root of any competition over who had it worst. This is just a rough outline – I haven’t ratified it into law yet – but the system of suffering and reward should work something like this:Being so deathly bored you watched the bloody briefing every day: an adventure holidayEnduring tedious people on Instagram brag about how many online exercise classes they were doing every day: a fabulous new wardrobeYour neighbour spent lockdown learning the drumsdoing daily DIYdigging a basement: a new homeYou have a slipped disc from hunching over your godforsaken laptop all day working from home: a year of massages and a fancy new PCParents of small children and babies: holiday in Durham, one week per child (post-lockdown)Parents of toddler triplets: anything their heart desires.

Try something in a lower keySpraying on perfume makes me feel as ready as cleaning my teeth or brushing my hair. But what constitutes an appropriate fragrance for time spent social distancing or confined to one’s own kitchen table? Without people, traffic, fresh air and nature to cancel out its “noise”, potent perfume can seem suddenly deafening. To wear a big, heady scent in close confines can seem like doing the dishes in a ballgown. I recently find myself making lower-key selections.Loewe is among my favourite fashion houses, which means, if experience has taught me anything, that the fragrance is almost bound not to be my bag. So it has half-proved. Loewe Paula’s Ibiza (2 £70 for 50ml), is a little too warm and sweet for my tastes, but it’s a cracking choice if you lean that way. Perfumes that smell of a tropical beach – hot skin, sea salt, sunscreen, white flowers – are hardly groundbreaking, but there’s something less facile about this one. Deeper, longer-lasting, sparkly rather than sticky, it never goes flat – more mellows into a rich, comforting musk.Another new addition that already feels like family is Sunspel’s Oak Wood (3) (which seems a fortune at £90, but at 100ml, is thrice the size of most perfumes costing the same). One might not expect something so beautiful to come from an underpants and pyjamas company, but in fact this smells exactly on-brand – comfortable, understated and British (the brilliantly talented Lyn Harris was commissioned to create it). It’s gender neutral (almost all good perfume is, however it’s marketed) and is decidedly cologne-like in that it smells unmistakably breezy and clean.But what Harris and Sunspel have achieved here is very often the hardest and most complex feat: simplicity. Just as Sunspel’s signature white cotton T-shirts are ostensibly straightforward but painstakingly produced, Oak Wood is similarly impeccable in its makeup. There are citrusy notes (bergamot and neroli), woods (cedar and sandalwood), some English chamomile and more.

Once it was agreed points per game was the fairest way to tidy up, Hayes and her players came out fractionally on top to secure a third title. Liverpool were relegated and Aston Villa promoted.“The decision to terminate wasn’t easy, but most of us feel it was the right one,” Hayes said. “I know football has restarted in Germany, but we are at a different stage of the pandemic. The decision was not taken flippantly, every effort was made to resume the season, but most of the players had reached a point where they needed a decision to be made.“We can all look forward to next season now, which may still involve stepping into the unknown, but by September we should have a lot more information about best practice from Premier League clubs who have been playing.”Hayes said she enjoyed a low-key celebration at home with her family after Chelsea were awarded the title – “I think I was in bed by 9.30” – but felt that even in compromised circumstances the club’s latest title was among the hardest to win.“It was a brilliant season, not just for us but for the league as a whole,” she said. “There were a lot of very closely contested games because there are so many good teams about now. This has definitely been one of the toughest titles to win in my time here, the overall standard has improved so much.”Manchester City finished second with Arsenal third and Hayes said she had the utmost respect for both clubs as well as empathy for their situations. “Finishing the season in this way is obviously not ideal for anyone, but it was a collective decision based on players’ welfare and I think most people agree with it,” she said.“Arsenal were undoubtedly the best team in the country 12 months ago when they were champions, and Manchester City are always competitive, but that just shows how far we have come over the past year. The team has really kicked on this season, the desire within the squad is unbelievable.“It seems a little strange not to have any sort of presentation or celebration at the end of a successful season. I’m sure we’ll do something when we all get back together, but knowing my players as I do, they will probably insist it should be business as usual. They don’t want to spend time celebrating, they want to keep progressing.”Hayes is not worried about the financial impact of ending early, despite the FA’s refusal to make any extra cash available to the women’s game as has happened in other countries. “The FA has already ringfenced funds for next season and I’m confident the support will be there if we need it,” she said.“The decision to terminate was not just a financial one and I’m sure our game can come back bigger and stronger than this. I am more than conscious of the challenges the women’s game still faces, but enough owners, broadcasters and fans want the best for it, to make sure it continues to grow.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df85bf3d4819fc418651b8263b51661d8373332e/0_133_5460_3275/master/5460.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c35a48f173127e3c63e02a1638c05ad5","title":"paul pogbas marriage of convenience with manchester united may get unlikely spark","story":"New reality caused by pandemic means a move away is unlikely and with the arrival of Bruno Fernandes the future looks much brighter for UnitedLast summer, as Manchester United toured Japan, Paul Pogba was openly talking about seeking “a new challenge somewhere else”. Frustrated at United’s failure to qualify for the Champions League and with the general sense of drift at the club, and in the expectation of a lucrative move, it made sense for him to be considering his future. A year on, it seems increasingly probable he will stay at Old Trafford. If Pogba does stay United will, for the first time since Alex Ferguson left, have a squad that looks vaguely coherent.Nothing in football is certain – particularly where Mino Raiola, Pogba’s agent, is concerned – but the sport’s new economy militates against a move. Pogba’s contract expires next summer but United have the option of triggering an additional year. With advertising and sponsorship down, no immediate prospect of fans returning and a more general sense of uncertainty, it’s difficult to see any club being prepared to pay the sort of fee United would demand or the wages Pogba (and Raiola) would expect, particularly given he has managed five starts in the league this season because of an ankle injury. Even if a super-club does feel an urge to splash out, younger and more appealing talents have emerged to tempt them. Such is the fickle nature of these things.Pogba, now 27, is entering what should theoretically be his peak years and his decision whether to commit to United takes on greater importance. As well as the factors making it harder to leave, there are increasingly powerful reasons to stay. Last season, inconsistent as he was, he remained United’s most penetrative player. His frustration at the way United fell away and missed out on Champions League qualification was understandable. But with the arrival of Bruno Fernandes, the pieces of United’s midfield are finally coalescing.The fundamental problem with Pogba is that he is a box-to-box player in an era that struggles to accommodate them. In a modern midfield he is neither fish nor fowl, his wide array of skills paradoxically making it difficult to know exactly where he should be deployed. There is something of Steven Gerrard or Bryan Robson about him: it feels as though he should be clattering into tackles just outside his own box but also surging forward, scoring a dozen goals a season. As midfields have tended to split into two bands and the game has become increasingly compact, that sort of player doesn’t really exist any more.Sit Pogba deep and he always seems constrained. He is perfectly capable of playing as a defensive midfielder but it always feels a waste, as though the technical ability and pace that make him exceptional aren’t being utilised. Even during the World Cup, when he usually operated alongside N’Golo Kanté at the back of France’s midfield, there was that sense of him playing in a straitjacket.Move him further forward, though, and it can feel that his power and aggression are underused besides which, he always seems more comfortable with the ball in front of him rather than receiving it with his back to goal. It’s not a coincidence that Pogba’s longest sustained run of excellence came under Antonio Conte at Juventus, where he had a hybrid role on the left of a midfield three.Fernandes has been revelatory since his arrival from Sporting in January. It’s not just that he has scored two and set up three in five league games, it’s that he appears to be the tactical key that makes everything else make sense. In those five games Fernandes has played in three different systems: twice as the central creator in a 4-2-3-1, and three times behind a front two, twice in a 3-4-1-2 and once in a 4-3-1-2. There may be some reluctance to field Pogba deep in a 4-2-3-1 (even if he did win the World Cup in that role), but either of the other two formations, or a 4-3-3, would seem to accommodate both him and Fernandes comfortably.Fernandes plays high, Scott McTominay or Nemanja Matic sits and Pogba adjusts his position according to the situation, linking front to back. In a 4-3-1-2, there would be the additional presence of Fred flanking the holder on the other side.It is true that when Pogba was at his best at Juve he was playing in a 3-5-2 and benefited enormously from having Kwadwo Asamoah surging past him at left wing-back and it’s also true that without that presence outside him he hasn’t always looked comfortable on the left side of a 4-3-3 at United. But the balance is better now. A hybrid role has opened up and Luke Shaw and Brandon Williams are attacking left-backs who should be able to offer at least some of the overlapping support Asamoah did.Questions remain about Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s capacities as a manager and whether he really is capable of organising the precise attacking patterns now that have become essential at the very highest level – counterattacking alone is not enough – but the personnel now available to him offers few excuses. There is work to be done, notably at centre-forward and centre-back, and remainders from previous regimes still to be shed, but with Marcus Rashford and Pogba back from injury this squad is finally beginning to resemble something that might result from a plan.United had gone 11 games unbeaten before the suspension of the league. In the sense of breaking a decent run, lockdown came at just the wrong time for them. But in the longer term, it may serve a dual purpose. Not only does the financial uncertainty make it less likely any suitor will spend heavily on Pogba, it also gives Solskjær what is in effect a nine-game mini-season when he can assess his options, persuade players who were having doubts this is a club moving in the right direction and, vitally, qualify for next season’s Champions League. In a very short time, Fernandes has made a lot of the pieces seem as though they fit. Pogba is probably the most important."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b96d18c148a2a893f60e3c6c56f96b2ea8f2b2bb/262_217_4477_2688/master/4477.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c75e19fd4a425d4377604af5b91da0a2","title":"blind date jack ruthie","story":"What were you hoping for?To meet someone new and to lose my Uber Eats virginity.First impressions?At first glance, he looked much more grownup than me.

We’ve never needed nature’s salve more. So, for anyone lucky enough to have a garden, now’s the time to treat your backyard with the same decorative care as your front room. We asked five decorators and designers to share their tricks for creating the ultimate outdoor retreat, from furniture to table settings.“If you do it well, a garden is an escape into another little world,” says Beata Heuman. The Sweden-born interior designer, whose own London plot features a conservatory-style garden house, suggests adding a simple string of filament-bulb lights outdoors. “It’s so atmospheric,” she says. “At night, it really heightens the sense of space.”Heuman treats the garden like a room. “Think about how you want to use it throughout the day,” she says. Consider whether you’ll need to provide shade, or if you want to face the sun. With furniture, Heuman errs on the side of caution. “It can be quite sad looking out on lots of empty chairs in winter,” she says. “But a garden bench looks nice all year round.”Inspired by the wall tattoos at Jean Cocteau’s French Riviera home, Heuman has plans for a terrace mural in her own garden. “It gives depth and a sense of something to discover,” she says. Her holy horticultural grail is the Sicilian poolside in Luca Guadagnino’s 2016 film A Bigger Splash. “People aren’t imaginative about gardens,” she says, “but it’s a great place in which to be creative.” beataheumanFor Atelier Vime founders Anthony Watson and Benoît Rauzy, outdoor living can be organised into a trio of spaces: somewhere to dine, somewhere to read and a place to lie in the sun. The pair have been spending their days on their farm in Brittany, where they’re growing their first crop of wicker, the base material for their creations. “Garden reading is an activity that requires a comfortable chair and a low table for your book, carafe and glass,” says Rauzy. “I’m a big fan of the outdoor bookshelf – ideally somewhere sheltered from the rain.”For outdoor flooring they love scourtin, the circular rugs made out of coconut fibre that were once used as extraction filters in the production of olive oil. Made in La Scourtinerie, a small factory in Provence, the rugs are “so sweet underfoot”, says Rauzy.Watson and Rauzy dine at a round rattan 1960s table topped with tiles by the French ceramicist Roger Capron. They’ll arrange large rattan armchairs and sunbeds together with giant planters and lanterns of their own design. The key to the outdoor idyll is practicality. “Everything has to be easy to live with,” says Rauzy, “so less is definitely more.” ateliervimeenSimplicity is the essence of Nathalie Farman-Farma’s garden style. The textile designer’s terrace on the roof of her London studio draws on the botanical aesthetic of traditional Russian dachas (cottages). “Nothing should compete with nature,” she says of the richly layered tapestry of vegetables, herbs and climbers in terracotta pots. The most important addition is her white wooden café table with foldable chairs. But the style should be dictated by the context, she says. She’ll use vintage scarves, or antique folk textiles as a tablecloth, topped with small Japanese ikebana basket planters. “I love things to feel a little overgrown,” she says of her rooftop’s romantic, yet unfussy look. For guests she’ll pull out cushions and Bessarabian kilims from indoors. “I like the continuity between the outside and in,” she says. “It’s nice to blur the boundaries.”decorsbarbaresMatilda Goad has turned her modest north London plot into a series of little havens. It’s partitioned both by foliage and flowers, and old railway sleepers found on eBay, to build borders, paths and a bench. “It creates a sense of discovery even in a small space, which is exactly what I like to do indoors,” says designer and consultant Goad, who created the space under the guidance of the garden designer Butter WakefieldRather than splurge on furniture, Goad plans to build a concrete- topped dining space. “We so rarely have amazing weather in this country, it makes sense to think about pieces to pull into the garden from your sitting room,” she says. Long wooden benches and little stools work just as well outside as in, especially when teamed with Hungarian linen cushions and Mexican rugs to pull everything together.“Furniture is a great way to change a garden without altering the whole infrastructure,” says Ula Maria, landscape architect and author of Green: Simple Ideas for Outdoor Spaces. “It’s such a basic thing, but if there’s a chair outside, you’re more likely to go out and sit.” The smaller the space, the bigger the impact. “Furniture can be used as sculpture,” says Maria. She likes online second-hand store 1stdibs for quirky finds. The aim is to create harmony. “Keep to a particular style,” she says. “In a contemporary garden with minimal planting, you’d have clean-lined furniture. But in a more romantic, English garden where the plants are whimsical, go for something vintage or classical.”ulamaria"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/439247bb0129ad5e0a11fc333cdc8bb208980243/0_333_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=863b094e3dcfebe5343d9c0b5cebc0fe","title":"gogo penguin gogo penguin review adrenaline rush","story":"At times on this fourth album from the Manchester trio you want to ask: “What’s the rush?” A pell-mell, pedal-to-the-floor approach is, of course, one of the group’s signatures. They may owe a debt to the repetitive minimalism of composers like Philip Glass, but they grew up in the era of techno and drum and bass, and have cannily adapted the rush of electronic music to a traditional acoustic lineup of piano, double bass and drums.Now in\u0026nbsptheir mid-30s, they are on crisp, confident form here, having taken time to refine their approach: every thrum and drone of Nick Blacka’s bass on a track like Atomised is chosen precisely, every swirl of Chris Illingworth’s remarkable piano is more considered than the often breakneck pace suggests. Nonetheless, the dynamic of the tracks is too often similar – go fast, slow down, go even faster – and the record often shines brightest at its least hurried. The three minutes of Embers offers a reflective lyricism, as does the closing Don’t Go, where Blacka’s bass is forefront.In live performance the uptempo pieces will have their audiences rocking, but a more erse and, dare one suggest, conventional approach may lie ahead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb8492c78b0131dd203681cc9848cc1d4ddb9706/53_0_3307_1985/master/3307.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=335413770af566074e26a786b4159653","title":"nazanin zaghari ratcliffe to wait another week for release decision iran","story":"Family has been left hovering between hope and despair, says husband Richard RatcliffeNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian dual citizen who has been detained in Iran since 2016, must wait another week for a decision on whether she will be permanently freed from jail, a move her husband says has left the family “hovering between hope and despair”.Zaghari-Ratcliffe had expected an update on Saturday on the progress of a bid for clemency. She was hoping to be released in time for her daughter Gabriella’s sixth birthday on Thursday but instead has been told to call back next week.It has become an agonising wait for the family, who were hopeful she might be permanently released as part of an amnesty for 3,000 prisoners at the end of Ramadan, which was announced by the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.But two weeks after Eid, her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, said Iranian authorities were “really playing with us at this stage”.“I worried beforehand that Nazanin’s furlough would just become a new phase of her being a bargaining chip, a way of using us to signal to the UK that there are two paths ahead, a way to keep us hovering permanently between hope and despair,” he told the PA news agency.“This is no way to keep testing someone after four years of trauma. There is no halfway house in a hostage situation. We remain exposed – and will be until she is home.”Earlier this year, Ratcliffe urged Boris Johnson to pay a contested £400m debt the UK owes to Iran, which he believes to be hindering his wife’s release, in the form of humanitarian aid.Zaghari-Ratcliffe has served four years of a five-year sentence over allegations of plotting to overthrow the Iranian government. She was released on furlough in March as the coronavirus outbreak tore through the country and started to spread in prisons.Under the conditions of her temporary release, she must wear a tag and stay at her parents’ home in Tehran, where she video calls her husband and daughter in the UK.Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s case contrasts sharply with that of US navy veteran Michael White, who flew home on Thursday after being detained in Iran for two years.Last year, Zaghari-Ratcliffe celebrated her daughter’s birthday with her during visiting hours at the prison, penning an emotional letter that read: “I asked you where you wanted your birthday this year. ‘In prison’, you said, ‘so, Mummy, you can come.’“I know that the road to take us home might still be long.

The revelation will raise more concerns about the government’s commitment to upholding “high environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards”.The note, seen by the Observer and dispatched at the start of last month, gave approval for the US trade talks to go ahead and set out the conditions of engagement. It reveals serious cabinet unrest over the shape of a US deal and appears to suggest UK regulations could be changed to accommodate an agreement. It also makes clear that talks were to be used to “maximise leverage” in trade negotiations with the EU.“Consultation and agreement from relevant colleagues is sought before agreeing to change domestic policy or regulations as part of the negotiations,” it states. “In the context of preserving the integrity of UK domestic law, any decisions taken in sensitive areas … must take into account the potential legal implications for the UK and be agreed by the relevant ministers.”The memo reveals how contentious the US trade talks are regarded as being within the cabinet. Issues were raised by 11 cabinet ministers, including health secretary Matt Hancock, environment secretary George Eustice and Mark Spencer, the chief whip.“Written responses were received from the health secretary, foreign secretary, the chief whip, the business secretary, the environment secretary, the chancellor of the exchequer, the justice secretary, the defence secretary, the culture secretary, the Welsh secretary and the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,” it states. “All other members of the committee were content.”The briefing also states that a cabinet committee would return to the animal welfare issue “in June to settle all outstanding agriculture issues”, suggesting an unresolved split. Meanwhile, it demands that “ministers receive regular progress reports of concurrent EU and US negotiations to help maximise leverage and allow policy tensions to be resolved as they emerge”.A government spokesperson said that it had been “very clear since the outset that we will not compromise on our high environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards”.Campaigners want legal guarantees on those standards to be enshrined in an agriculture bill currently being debated in parliament. The issue has already prompted a Tory rebellion in the Commons.It comes after reports last week that the government was proposing a “dual scheme” that would see higher tariffs on US foods with lower animal welfare standards. It is not clear whether higher tariffs would also be linked to environmental standards.Alistair Carmichael, the Lib Dem Brexit spokesperson, said: “People can now see that promises made by Johnson and Gove were worthless.”Luke Pollard, the shadow environment secretary, said: “It is unacceptable for the government to allow our high food standards to be compromised and our farmers undercut in any future trade deals. Attempts by ministers to use tariffs and tax rates to get around their manifesto commitment on food standards won’t wash.”Nick von Westenholz, director of EU exit and international trade for the National Farmers Union, said: “The government made a manifesto commitment not to compromise on our high environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards in trade negotiations, and this commitment is explicitly stated in the government’s specific objectives for the US negotiations. We would expect UK trade negotiators to be rigorous in upholding these commitments.”A government spokesman said: “We will always stand up for British farming and are determined to use trade negotiations to secure new opportunities for farmers.“Having left the EU, we will get to decide how we set and maintain our own laws, standards and regulations, upholding our food, environmental and animal welfare standards. Our food regulators will continue to provide independent advice to ensure that all food imports into the UK comply with those standards.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5820b6013c3a99d13e23a42d4430f0e78d0da6fd/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0133c2ff775a3c34fa9676bfa6a62d25","title":"the first wave of covid 19 is not over but how may a second look","story":"The pandemic’s future will be decided by human action and several unanswered questions about the nature of the virusRestaurants are opening, parks are full and people are getting back to work: parts of Europe, Asia and much of the Middle East are enjoying the benefits of flattened coronavirus curves. Meanwhile, parts of the US, India and Latin America are still recording thousands of new cases every day.The first wave of the coronavirus is not over. The future shape of the pandemic will be decided both by human action, in the form of social distancing, testing and other traditional methods of disease control, but also several unanswered questions about the nature of the virus itself.Experts say there are several possibilities.One is that the virus breaks out and is suppressed in peaks and troughs, until enough of the population is vaccinated or potentially develops immunity.But that also means the vast majority of populations remain susceptible.If societies reopen before the virus is sufficiently eradicated, it may be that this first wave does not completely go away, says Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University.“In the US, we are lifting lockdowns when there are still increasing numbers of cases in a bunch of states … We may just have peaks and valleys of transmission occurring over and over again as people’s behaviour changes,” she says.The scale of these peaks could be reduced by making changes such as wearing masks, using public transport in a staggered way and avoiding overcrowded social events – which are increasingly being blamed for being “super-spreaders” of the first wave of the coronavirus.If outbreaks grow too large, some governments might choose to reimplement quarantines. “If we’re reopening and we start to see case numbers growing rapidly in a few weeks, we may see rolling lockdowns or shutdowns to try to control the virus in those areas,” Rasmussen says.Most influenza pandemics have historically struck in distinct wave patterns, with a first peak usually followed by a resurgent second wave six months later. But there is no guarantee Sars-CoV-2 will play out in the same way.Social distancing and robust testing – or a lack of it – will be critical in deciding the future of the pandemic. But its shape will also be influenced by factors outside our control.The first is whether we can become immune to the virus, and if so, how long that protection endures for.Sometimes immunity can last for decades. During the 2009 swine flu pandemic, public health authorities were initially confused as to why many older people seemed to be immune. Later, they discovered the virus was structurally similar to one that circulated during the 1918 pandemic. The immune systems of many older people had dealt with a similar virus 92 years ago.Resistance to some earlier discovered coronaviruses has been thought to fade within a year. If immunity to Sars-CoV-2 is not permanent, a report from Harvard epidemiologists says it is likely to enter into regular circulation, coming in annual or biennial waves or sporadic outbursts.The frequency of significant outbreaks may also be influenced by the weather. Most influenzas spread more easily in the winter because the virus is thought to prefer dry air over humidity, and because people in cold environments spend more time indoors and close to each other.Existing coronaviruses also follow seasonal patterns. If this coronavirus behaves in the same way – and there is not yet strong evidence that it does – we could see regular wintertime surges of Covid-19.But with so many people still apparently not immune to the virus, that summer relief may not arrive this year, says James Hay, a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard’s Chan School of Public Health.“The factor that most contributes towards transmission is how many people are still susceptible,” he says. “And with so many still susceptible, that’s going to swamp out any climate effect.”Significant mutations in the virus might also lead to a wave of new infections down the track. So far, scientists say that isn’t a huge concern. “Even though there are different genomes out there that have changes compared to each other … there’s no evidence any of those changes are in spots that are critical for the immune system to recognise,” Rasmussen says.But that doesn’t mean we won’t see a significant mutation later. “We’ve only known about this for six months, so it’s possible different strains could emerge in the future, because it does have a higher mutation rate,” she says. “But right now there’s no evidence that that’s happening.”For countries that are able to implement highly effective interventions such as testing and contact tracing, this first wave of coronavirus cases may be the last they experience, at least for some time.In New Zealand, which has managed to virtually eradicate the virus and installed robust systems to monitor new outbreaks, there may be no significant new outbreaks or future waves at all, says Nick Wilson, a professor of public health at the University of Otago.“New Zealand is about to eliminate this virus,” Wilson says. “Even if there are border control failures, I expect that the contact tracing system is now good enough to control an occasional outbreak. So this country should be able to avoid future waves until a vaccine arrives.”Countries with small populations and isolated geography such as New Zealand and Australia may be able to pull this off. South Korea is another country whose virus detection and suppression systems may be advanced enough to smother any future outbreaks. But it will be extremely difficult for most countries, especially those with large populations and porous borders.There are a minority of epidemiologists who argue the deadliness of the coronavirus has been overstated. One of the most prominent is Sunetra Gupta, a professor of theoretical epidemiology at Oxford University, who says the virus could already be on the way out.She argues that the antibody studies conducted so far have been unreliable, and do not take into account the possibility that many people might already be immune to Covid-19 because of exposure to more benign coronaviruses. Others, including neuroscientist Karl Friston, have also spoken of some populations such as Germany’s having some kind of immunological “dark matter” that has kept fatalities there low compared to Spain, Italy or the UK.This view is an outlier, and most governments have preferred to plan for the worst-case scenario – that millions of people are vulnerable to the virus. But Gupta argues the fact that virus transmission rates have peaked and fallen even in some places that did not institute harsh lockdowns is evidence for her theory.“In almost every context we’ve seen the epidemic grow, turn around and die away – almost like clockwork,” Gupta told the media outlet UnHerd last week.“To me that suggests that much of the driving force here was due to the buildup of immunity,” she says. “I think that’s a more parsimonious explanation than one which requires in every country for lockdown, or various degrees of lockdown, including no lockdown, to have had the same effect.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0390980092baaf94b2df01543de0c7643726dfa4/191_163_3883_2329/master/3883.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa8b935bfe92c60d4f7f5731cf7d9401","title":"campsites england face summer of social distancing open 4 july","story":"Self-catering accommodation and campsites in England are set to reopen on 4 July, but will this be the summer we ‘rediscover’ our countryside or one remembered for ‘Go Home’ signs?On 4 July caravan and campsites and self-catering accommodation are expected to reopen in England, an announcement that has brought sighs of relief from many, and a shudder of fear to some. This may be a welcome chance for many to get away, and for some businesses to finally salvage their summer season, but a significant movement of people could unleash a hostile reception in traditional holiday areas or, worse, a localised outbreak of Covid-19.After more than three months of restrictions, and the best spring weather on record, a stampede may seem inevitable, but will campsite owners want to risk local ire, or even be able to adapt? This could be the summer when the British rediscover the holiday potential of their own country, or the one remembered for “GO HOME” signs and overloaded local hospitals. For those in search of a summer holiday, the question is how best to negotiate this tricky situation?\u0026nbspCamping and caravanning were already hugely popular before the virus: Britons made around 40 million overnight stays in 2019, according to Visit Britain. The economic value of the industry is enormous. The Caravan and Motorhome Club estimates that its members spend £700m a year in and around the 2,500 sites it either operates or certifies. But there are huge potential challenges: camp and caravan sites usually have shared toilet and shower facilities in which hygiene standards can easily slip, and nearby shops and beauty spots can easily get overcrowded.\u0026nbspOliver Muntz of Umberslade campsite near Warwick has noticed concern among would-be holidaymakers. “Bookings for July are quite slow: callers are asking a lot of questions about spacing and cleanliness.”\u0026nbspMuntz says glamping may have an edge, as large tents, yurts and tipis often have en suite facilities. Tom Dixon, co-founder and director of Canopy and Stars, thinks the 600 treehouses, cabins, yurts and wagons on his books are eminently suitable for post-lockdown holidays. “Glamping spaces tend to be remote and rural by nature,” he says. “The vast majority of our places are on their own or at a safe distance from other units.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCanopy and Stars has brought in a commitment to deep clean all accommodation, increasing time between visitors to allow for this. “We’ll also be making sure stocks of cleaning supplies are kept up for guests,” says Dixon, “and reduce risks by, for example, removing frequently touched items like guestbooks.”\u0026nbspIn North Yorkshire, Lia Martinucci had planned to expand her new glamping site, MyHappyPlaceUK near Richmond, with 12 luxurious bell tents dotted around her farmhouse. Her local MP is chancellor Rishi Sunak, to whom she wrote in May asking for help. “We are not hotels,” she says. “There are few social-distancing problems with us, and our local economy desperately needs a good season.”\u0026nbspThe chancellor has yet to reply and, like other campsite owners, Martinucci says bookings are slow. “People are being careful with their money,” she says, “and I don’t blame them.” The threat of a second-wave clampdown and lost deposits is a big dampener.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSelf-catering accommodation providers are being quick to headline more isolated properties: Under the Thatch is even flagging up cottages just inside the English border, a reminder that Wales and Scotland are not included in the 4 July reopening date. “Lots of our properties are down their own lanes with no neighbours at all,” says director Greg Stevenson.\u0026nbspBut what about those “Go Home” signs? Should we be worried about a hostile reception? Martinucci thinks not. “The kind of people we get are careful, and follow all the advice. What we need is clear, appropriate guidelines, then everyone knows what to do and how to stay within the rules.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCumbria Tourism managing director Gill Haigh agrees: “We urgently need government guidance that helps businesses meet national standards, but also reassures visitors and encourages them to book.”Muntz says co-ordination with other local businesses is vital. Umberslade has been busy forming links with local farms, cafes and shops to make following social distancing guidelines possible. “We’ve made a walk up to our local dairy farm, where people will be able to get breakfast packs and other foodstuffs.”He has also been busy planting wildflower meadows and devising a walk through the Umberslade Estate, for which campers will have timed entries. “It’s a good chance to find new ways of operating,” he says.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28a35e2f449b00730f94f8b4e8be45f717609cca/0_210_5544_3326/master/5544.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bddc76aeba9d65c015a3824abbee7303","title":"we need the brits benidorm banks on august tourist surge after covid19","story":"Spanish resort ‘like a ghost town’ as UK’s Covid-19 lockdown keeps its best customers awayThere’ll be no craic at the Shamrock tonight, says Lisa Griffin, who has run the Irish pub in Benidorm for 25 years.Griffin’s 15 staff, who include a four-piece band, are on furlough and no one knows what will happen when the Spanish government’s scheme comes to an end on 30 June.“Until the tourists come back, hotels open, flights are at capacity and quarantine is lifted in the UK, it won’t be worth our while reopening,” she says. “It’s what happens in Britain that really affects Benidorm, because it’s mainly them who visit.”Griffin opened the Shamrock on 6 March in readiness for St Patrick’s Day, the pub’s busiest week of the year, but had to close three days before the 17th because of the lockdown.“I’m hoping the winter season will be better than normal,” she said.Griffin is one of many who is dismayed at what she sees as the UK’s erratic response to the pandemic.“Now we’re down to zero deaths in Spain but the UK hasn’t behaved well in the lockdown,” said Michelle Baker, who edits the local Round Town Times paper and runs the Benidormforever site. “We had four hours to shut down and we knew that if we got the virus in Benidorm it would be all over the tabloids and no one would want to come back here.”Although around half of Benidorm’s visitors are Spanish, Baker, who has lived there for 37 years, says it’s the British who spend the most money.“Spaniards will nurse a café con leche for three hours,” she said. “The bottom line is Benidorm needs the Brits.”A number of bars have already closed permanently because they can’t afford the rent and many more are likely to go out of business over the summer, according to Karen Maling Cowles, president of the Benidorm British Businesses Association.“We want business to pick up but we don’t want another spike in the virus – it’s a question of life before business,” she said, adding that British businesses need to do more to attract Spanish tourists, such as putting their menus in Spanish as well as English.The Spanish government is keen to reactivate tourism, a vital element of the nation’s economy, although no one expects anything like the 82 million people who visited last year. It plans to reopen its borders with France and Portugal no later than 1 July and create selective air corridors to the Canary and Balearic islandsHowever, these corridors will only be opened with countries or regions that appear to have the virus under control and at present Britain is unlikely to be one of them.Another factor is the UK’s current policy of imposing a two-week quarantine on anyone arriving from another country. In effect, people going on a one-week holiday would have to take three weeks off work.Antonio Pérez, the mayor, says he’s optimistic but realistic. “I think Benidorm will be full in August, not full like it was, because of social distancing, but full in so far as circumstances allow,” he said.In the meantime, Benidorm’s towering hotels and apartment blocks are empty. It’s like a ghost town, said Baker. “You keep seeing the same people over and over, like extras in a low-budget movie, because once you strip out the tourists there are very few people here.”The sudden disappearance of tourists has prompted many popular destinations to rethink how and to whom they market themselves. “It’s a good time for us all to think outside the box and perhaps aim our businesses at a different type of market and not depend on low-cost tourism,” said Cowles.So is it time for a Benidorm makeover?“The town hall would say yes because they’ve battled for decades against what they see as Benidorm’s negative image,” said Baker. “However, Benidorm’s bread and butter is the Brits and the Brits love, love, love Benidorm just the way it is.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5aabdd2456c795d423bdd93adc19c600e70e3445/0_54_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb8778fe887c7b76546603a17bcdb198","title":"what we do in the shadows bbc two","story":"As the fang-tastic houseshare sitcom enters its second season, its creator and stars discuss death, sex and petty grudgesWhen you’re cooped up at home all day, cohabiting with people who may not have complementary personalities, it’s important to keep the lines of communication open. Regular house meetings can address such simmering resentments as blood stains on the sofa, half-drunk orgy guests left cluttering up the hall or, as in the new series of sitcom What We Do in the Shadows, when “the house reeks of decaying flesh and there are dead birds everywhere”.These are agenda items brought up by Nandor the Relentless, a 758-year-old vampire, former soldier of the Ottoman empire and the pernickety, self-appointed leader of this houseshare in a decaying New York mansion. Nandor (Kayvan Novak) lives with his long-suffering human “familiar” Guillermo (Harvey Guillén), aristocratic English bloodsucker Laszlo (Matt Berry), Laszlo’s fun-loving vamp wife Nadja (Natasia Demetriou) and Colin Robinson (Mark Proksch), an “energy vampire” who gains sustenance from boring his victims half to death. Now on its second series, What We Do in the Shadows is full of useful lifestyle hacks for lockdown, as Demetriou, speaking from her London home, appreciates: “What have I learned? That patience is a virtue and even if you think something’s gonna last for ever, just … I don’t know … kill people? And then it’ll go quicker?”Of course, the genius of a sitcom about vampires goes much deeper than its accidental relevance to the moment we’re in. The idea to capture the “real” lives of monsters previously glamorised by such pop culture phenomena as the Twilight franchise began 9,000 miles away from New York in New Zealand, as a short film made by sometime collaborators Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi.The initial inspiration, says Clement, was humanity’s bottomless capacity for petty grudges. “I think, probably, most people have things that happened in their childhood that they still get angry about,” he says. “What if this was stretched out over hundreds of years?”This grew into the 2014 cult comedy film, also called What We Do in the Shadows, about an undead, all-male flat-share in suburban Wellington. And when that was a success, Waititi and Clement began fielding phone calls from US TV network execs interested in taking it further. This wasn’t entirely surprising to Clement, who has long understood the sitcom potential of characters who, fundamentally, never change.“We pitched the show as ‘Immigrants in Time’. So, they’re foreigners, not only from a different country but from a different time, and their house is like the time machine that doesn’t change as the world changes around them.” Its Kiwi roots aside, What We Do in the Shadows uses a mockumentary style associated with such quintessential US sitcoms as Parks and Recreation and Modern Family. Juxtaposing their mundane suburban settings – the shopping mall, the car park, even a local city council meeting – with the fantastical lore of the vampire is what keeps things fresh. In season two, for instance, the housemates attend their neighbour’s Super Bowl party (a mix-up based on the vampire’s traditional respect for fellow nocturnal creature, the “superb owl”). Once there, Nadja finds herself chatting in the kitchen with the other wives (“You love wine!”) and dismayed at the human institution of matrimony (“How did you all end up married to such boiled potatoes?”).Another integral element of the show that’s switching up for season two is Nandor’s friendship – if you can call it that— with Guillermo. As a traditional familiar, Guillermo does his master’s bidding, in the hopes that he’ll be granted the immortal life of a vampire. But after a decade of loyal service he’s still waiting.“Yes, he bullies Guillermo and he manipulates him because, y’know, who else is he gonna do that to?” explains Novak, dipping in and out of Nandor’s fey accent for maximum effect. “No one listens to a fucking word he’s saying.” This power dynamic has shifted at the start of season two, however, following Guillermo’s discovery that he’s descended from legendary vampire hunter Van Helsing, which he opts to keep secret. Some fans have also detected an unspoken longing between them, reminiscent of The Fast Show’s Ted and Ralph. “I’ve seen a lot of homoerotic artwork,” says Novak proudly. “It’s all over the internet.”The show’s gothic vampire lair was a sight to behold in the first series, but this season an even more impressive feat has been managed. After season one’s exterior mansion location was sold by its owners for use as a women’s shelter, it had to be recreated from scratch on a Toronto soundstage. “There’s just so much detail to stare at,” says an awed Demetriou. “I hope this show is never over, but when we do get shut down, they should hire some more security guards on set, because I’m gonna be taking a lot of stuff.”The show’s interior design, with its velvet curtains and antique fireplaces, isn’t the only mark of its creators’ discernment. Clement was a big Toast of London fan prior to casting its creator-star Matt Berry as Laszlo, and the inidual comic sensibilities of each of the three British cast members have been subtly but perceptibly woven in. As an example, Demetriou sometimes tweaks Nadja’s pronunciation or adds in grammatical errors, inspired by her own Greek-Cypriot father. (It’s a style that will be familiar to fans of Stath Lets Flats, the show created by her brother Jamie, in which she also appears.) Since the cast are themselves Europeans trying to make their way in the New World, they might have additional insights into the vampire experience, but there’s no real culture shock when it comes to humour, says Demetriou. “The only thing that gets lost is reference points. Like, when I’m talking about Bobby Davro non-stop, no one knows who I’m talking about.” If there’s any kind of nationally themed mood on set, it’s a New Zealander one, says Novak: “Jemaine is there all the time, giving the good suggestions. He’s very laid-back, but he’s super-passionate about what he does and he sets the vibe.” The resulting show is set apart by a specific sort of silliness that’s both supernatural and earthy, never demurring from a toilet humour gag when one presents itself, but also incorporating ambitious visual effects. At a time when most celebrated sitcoms are either emotional dramedies or scathing satires, it’s nice to have a reliable source of what Demetriou calls “just a proper, proper comedy”. As befits a show about centuries-old vampires, What We Do in the Shadows is gloriously out of step with the times.What We Do in the Shadows begins Thursday 11 June, 10pm, BBC Two"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04f4f4a2acfa04583bab656f71ff2cda85f739f1/343_68_5505_3305/master/5505.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=b52ece2d835d9d42afcc74415463f383","title":"golden gate bridge san francisco sings","story":"Strange sound coming from bridge explained by new bicycle-path railings that make ‘music’ as wind passes throughSan Francisco’s famous Golden Gate Bridge has started “singing” following recent changes to bicycle-path railings that appear to make music as the wind blows through them, residents have reported.The eerie sound has prompted perplexed, cheeky, and even desperate reactions from locals.\u0026nbsp“Can someone explain me why is this eerie sound has been going on for an hour in #SanFrancisco #presidio #sound #eerie #whatisthis #2020SoFar #2020BingoCard,” one Twitter user wrote Friday afternoon.\u0026nbspCity officials offered an explanation for the sound, which can seemingly be heard several miles away.Paolo Cosulich-Schwartz, a\u0026nbspGolden Gate Bridge, Highway \u0026amp Transportation\u0026nbspDistrict spokesperson, said the sounds stemmed from\u0026nbsplong-planned wind retrofitting.“The new musical tones coming from the bridge are a known and inevitable phenomenon that stem from our wind retrofit project during very high winds.

You imagined it would involve the usual British excesses of lager and sunshine. In fact, in the past week its primary expression has been a coming together of mostly young people in our cities under the banner of Black Lives Matter.On Saturday, in by far the largest of the week’s demonstrations in London, many thousands crammed shoulder to shoulder in Parliament Square in the blustery rain and edged their way forwards toward St James’s Park. On Friday, police and government ministers had warned that such a crowd was not only unlawful but certainly dangerous with the virus still being transmitted from person to person. In the midst of that crowd – an unnatural human feeling in itself for all those who have been in isolation – it was impossible not to feel that those warnings should have been heeded far more closely. But for the vast majority of those that came, the risk had seemed worth it. Some of the banners in Parliament Square made their argument succinctly: “Racism has always been a pandemic.”As well as looking like the premature end of a shutdown spring in the capital, the protest also felt very much like the beginning of something not a one-off outpouring of rage against the brutal killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis 12 days ago, but a sustainable expression of the need for change.There was an urgency about that demand, as well as a weariness. Innumerable wounds have been opened by the graphic video of Floyd’s death, stretching back in British memories over generations – the protesters’ banners were a roll call of past and current injustice. Actor John Boyega’s heartfelt speech to the demonstrators on Wednesday made those links explicit: “We are a physical representation of our support for\u0026nbspGeorge Floyd … We are a physical representation of our support for Stephen Lawrence.” His words were carried on many of the cardboard signs held aloft: “Now is the time. I ain’t waiting.”That sentiment, which has spread through cities across the world, was never likely to be postponed by demands for physical distancing. The loose network of Black Lives Matter activists who have coordinated last week’s protests across the UK did their best to mitigate the risks in the crowd. They came equipped here with stocks of free masks and sanitiser. Imarn Ayton, 29, one of those coordinators, kicked off proceedings through a loudhailer: “We are not here for violence. If you commit violence today you are not for the cause. I don’t want to see no alcohol. I don’t want to see no weed. This is not a carnival. And keep your distance. You don’t need me to say that coronavirus is killing black people.”For many hours her hopes for a peaceful protest were realised, but\u0026nbspin late afternoon there were clashes between protesters and police and one officer appeared to be knocked off their horse, which then bolted – sending crowds of people scattering.\u0026nbspWhen I spoke to Ayton, 29, she said they had expected 20,000 to come. The eventual number appeared several times greater. What was not in doubt was that last week had marked a new phase of momentum in a long campaign. “I’ve always been involved,” she said of a movement that has its genesis in the protest against the decision not to prosecute the killer of Trayvon Martin in 2013. “To be honest anyone who is black and passionate is involved. But it feels like a different moment. The death of George Floyd and the protest has inspired many more people to speak up, black, white, everyone. The difference we are seeing is people are no longer prepared to be ignorant they want to educate themselves.”A lot of the people I spoke to suggested that this was their first march. They acknowledged the risks of the crowd, but felt they had no real choice. A young black woman from north London, who didn’t wish to give her name was holding a sign saying “Your silence is violence” and sitting at the foot of Gandhi’s statue. “The facts haven’t changed,” she said, “but the difference is more people are listening. I see it on social media, everyone that I know has been posting about this. And if you are young and you are not speaking up now, then it definitely says who you are. They don’t have to be here physically because we are in the middle of a pandemic, but if they are not here mentally and in spirit, well fuck ’em.”Terence Niemi, 28, from Colchester was also a first-time protester. “I felt like I should be here, there was no real choice this time. But it shouldn’t take losing another person’s life for us to form together. Hopefully in future we can make these kind of movements without this situation going down.”Da Vinci, a DJ from Brixton, said: “Asking people ‘stop oppressing us’ doesn’t really make much sense to me. But when you see people coming out together all around the world hopefully we can unite around that and find something positive out of it.”Fatima Abdulrahman had been on two previous protests last week. “You only have to look at the images on the internet to know why people are enraged,” she said. “There is a lot of anger people are not OK with how things are and there is a lot of pain to process.” She suggested the grimness of the last few weeks has also motivated that change isolation itself has sharpened the issues. “People have been at home, often alone for several months hearing about people dying, and a disproportionate number of them have been black people. And a disproportionate amount of black people have been suffering economically. That is another reason why we are here.”The summer looks likely to pitch those demands for social justice squarely against public health. The first test of that clash will be on Sunday afternoon when marchers have been invited to reassemble outside the US embassy in Vauxhall."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6121bf01e9e4b8c071a3ad5720c78a16fdd86702/0_840_3038_1823/master/3038.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=783afb161648e0b0b8cee363d47c52a7","title":"england could suspend sunday trading laws in push to boost economy","story":"Critics say government plan would hurt small traders and efforts to keep staff safeSunday trading laws could be suspended for a year in a move the government hopes will stimulate the economy.As concerns grow about mass unemployment unseen since the 1980s, Downing Street is under pressure to secure jobs and boost business as Britain emerges from lockdown.Boris Johnson, his chief adviser Dominic Cummings, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the business secretary, Alok Sharma, are said to support the measure, the Times reported on Saturday.Sunday trading laws were introduced under the Sunday Trading Act 1994, which limits shops with retail space over 280 square metres to a maximum of six hours of trading.\u0026nbspNew legislation would enable larger supermarkets to open for more than six hours on Sundays, a plan the chief whip, Mark Spencer, believes Labour and more traditionally minded Conservative MPs would oppose.Joe Dromey, a Labour and Co-operative party councillor in Lewisham, south London, tweeted:Paddy Lillis, the general secretary at Usdaw, the UK’s fifth biggest trade union, with more than 400,000 members, criticised the plan. “While we appreciate the desire to help the retail sector, this attempt to undo a long-held and respected compromise on Sunday trading is misguided,” he said.“The last thing the retail industry needs is longer trading hours: there is no economic case for this and it will put extra pressure on the retail workers who have worked so hard throughout this crisis.“Retailers have mixed views over the benefits of opening longer on Sundays and we have repeatedly demonstrated that it would be bad for business. Opening for longer will increase overheads but not necessarily take any more cash through the tills. The fact is that customers will not have more to spend just because the shops are open for longer.”Lillis said deregulating trading hours would put more pressure on shop staff to work longer and cause problems with finding childcare in an already stressful situation.“We urge the government to reject extending trading hours and to focus on supporting the retail sector by levelling the playing field on taxation and helping councils turn their town centres into lively and dynamic community hubs,” he said.David Cameron’s attempt to abolish Sunday trading laws in 2016 failed after 27 Tory MPs rebelled.Some supermarkets that have local convenience stores unaffected by Sunday trading laws are opposed to reform but others, including Asda and Morrisons, are said to be in favour.James Lowman, the chief executive of the Association of Convenience Stores, said longer Sunday trading could hurt small shops and undermine efforts to keep staff safe during the pandemic.“The majority of the public are in favour of the existing Sunday trading regulations, which strike the right balance between the needs of shop workers, consumers, high streets, small shops and supermarkets,” he said.“Changing the current laws would serve only to displace trade from the local shops that have been keeping communities going during this pandemic. If anything, local shops and other retailers have been reducing the number of opening hours in their business to keep their staff safe whilst restocking and cleaning stores, and we expect non-essential retailers to operate with limited hours when they reopen later this month.“There are many measures that have been recommended through high street reviews and task forces in recent years that could support the recovery of high street businesses, but at no point has a change to Sunday trading regulations been considered and with good reason. To upset the balance that has been struck on opening hours on Sundays would put small shops at risk, with increased costs but no guaranteed benefits for their larger counterparts.”Rayhan Haque, the founder of the\u0026nbspLondon Good Work Commission, which was established by London Plus, the\u0026nbsphub body for the capital’s 120,000 voluntary organisations, said: “Any plans to suspend Sunday trading laws is a bad idea. Sundays give independent shops and smaller retailers, who have been hit the hardest from the economic meltdown, a rare chance to compete with big corporate supermarkets. This also normalises a seven-day working culture, exactly the opposite of the better work-life balance people want post Covid-19.”The neoliberal platform 1828 said: “With this act in place, even if shops had the ability to open for longer on a Sunday, workers would still have the right to finish early or not work at all.\u0026nbspAbolishing Sunday trading laws merely allows those who want to work more hours the ability to do so. It would, therefore, encourage job creation for those who need it and the subsequent economic benefits that come with this.”Downing Street’s plans to revive the economy include streamlining licensing laws so that cafes and restaurants can serve food outside, doing away with the present 28-day minimum statutory consultation period and encouraging councils to pedestrianise streets to accommodate new outdoor markets."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0e6997117d3b5cf073dbd5804a217e9ce3cf52d/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd15407ec31a963c05c0b6f5d2ac5797","title":"french health ban keeps allied d day veterans away","story":"Normandy locals mourn the absence of the Allied soldiers forced to stay at home for the first time in 76 yearsIn Ranville cemetery, a lone piper playing Amazing Grace walked solemnly between the graves as the early morning sun reflected off the rows of white headstones.Every 6 June for the last 75 years, the soldiers who made it off the Normandy beaches in 1944 have returned to remember comrades who did not. Every\u0026nbspyear, the pilgrimage became a different kind of battle but still they came, in fewer numbers but just as determined to overcome the odds as they were when they landed to liberate France.This year, however, the veterans are absent, defeated not by age or infirmity, nor walking sticks\u0026nbspor wheelchairs, but by the coronavirus.France ended its strict two-month Covid-19 lockdown almost a month ago, but ongoing health regulations ban gatherings of more than 10 people, meaning the usual\u0026nbspD-day commemorations were cancelled.“It’s so quiet without the veterans.\u0026nbspNormally the cemetery is packed with visitors,” the piper, Frenchman Jérôme Levannier, said. “It’s terrible they cannot be here.”For locals along the 50-mile stretch of northern French coastline, where 150,000 troops swarmed ashore as part of Operation Overlord leaving 10,000 casualties including 2,500 dead, the\u0026nbsp76th D-day anniversary was a glimpse of a future bereft of living heroes.“It’s very strange to come here and find no veterans,” said Oly, 50, a former soldier who served in Iraq. Now a gendarme\u0026nbspin Lille, he comes to mark D-day every year. “It’s like they have all disappeared, as have the soldiers from the 1914-18 war.”\u0026nbspHe added: “It’s not idolatry or nostalgia but our duty not to forget.”Normally, the Normandy D-day villages would be a riot of French and Allied national flags and the roads jammed with re-enactors in jeeps, motorcycles with sidecars and vintage military vehicles.\u0026nbspThis year, the bunting, like the veterans, is absent and the\u0026nbsproads almost deserted.Under a full moon on Friday evening, a handful of people gathered at Pegasus Bridge where,\u0026nbspat exactly 00.16 on 6 June 1944,\u0026nbspthree gliders carrying members of\u0026nbspD Company, 2nd (Airborne) Battalion,\u0026nbspOxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, led by\u0026nbspMajor\u0026nbspJohn Howard, landed in a small field. (Their arrival was so bumpy, Howard hit his head and thought he had gone blind until one of his men pointed out his tin helmet was wedged over his eyes.)Clémentine Le Marrec, 30, recently elected mayor of Bénouville, headed a small group that paid tribute to Howard and his men.\u0026nbsp“It’s 10 people maximum. That’s the rule,” one official informed a few onlookers.“It’s sad for us this year. Normally there are lots of our British friends here. It’s hard for us that they cannot be with us,” Le Marrec said afterwards.“But it has made us realise we\u0026nbspwill\u0026nbsphave to find another way to remember them when they have all gone.”At a moving ceremony at the Arromanches site of Gold Beach, on Saturday afternoon, officials paid tribute to the British and Dutch troops who landed there.\u0026nbspFrédéric Sommier, director of the town’s D-day museum, told the crowd who gathered: “It is the first time since 1945 that we have gathered to commemorate without the principal actors... the men and women who lost their lives so that we could have back our freedom.”British-born Adrian Cox, a local councillor in Arromanches where he runs a bed and breakfast, says the disappearance of the veterans – now in their 90s – is something the Normandy coastline\u0026nbspwill\u0026nbsphave to accept.“In a few years there\u0026nbspwill\u0026nbspbe no veterans returning and so it\u0026nbspwill\u0026nbspbe about remembering them... If we want to keep the story of D-Day alive and people interested, we have to find a way to do it without the veterans,” Cox said.In the absence of the old soldiers and their families, Steven Oldrid, a British expat who has lived in Normandy for more than 20 years, was a man on a mission to honour the dead, laying wreaths and crosses around Sword Beach, one of five Allied landing sites.At Ranville cemetery, Oldrid placed a cross at the headstone of Jack Barringer, 29, who drowned when his landing craft sank. At Bénouville cemetery he read out the names of 23 men who died on behalf of their comrades and families during D-day.“I’m more than happy to do this. The veterans have suffered a lot during this two-month lockdown and we have lost a couple of them recently. We are losing more and more so every year really does count,” Oldrid said, turning away as his eyes filled with tears.“We have to keep remembering these men. They were true heroes”.With the planned international ceremony cancelled, it was left to representatives from nine countries – including the British and American ambassadors to France – to lay wreaths\u0026nbspat Vierville-sur-Mer\u0026nbspnear the American landing sector at Omaha Beach.There was the traditional commemorative service for British fallen at Bayeaux\u0026nbspcathedral but, as with all this year’s events, the order was to keep it swift, short and at a “social distance” of 1 metre.At midday, in the British cemetery at\u0026nbspBayeux, the UK’s ambassador to France Ed Llewellyn led a simple wreath-laying commemoration.“It’s a very simple ceremony but we hope the veterans who were not able to be here today\u0026nbspwill\u0026nbspsee that we were here to commemorate their comrades who were left behind. It’s a great honour to be here to pay tribute on behalf of our country and the veterans,” Llewellyn said afterwards.There was just one Allied soldier on the D-day beaches this year: Charles Norman Shay, a native American, 95, who was drafted into the US military aged 19. Shay, who now lives in Normandy, was a combat medic on Omaha Beach on D-day treating – and saving – many of the wounded.“It’s 76 years from what happened here… so many young men were lost. We all hoped it would never happen again, but we can never be sure. It’s important to send, to reinforce and renew this message of peace.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8594468a71052a41e7a36fb6c1ffccd55d77ac4/0_176_5285_3171/master/5285.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0fe926b6907369810a17caa0de6374d5","title":"global report indias covid 19 case total surpasses italy","story":"Indian health ministry reports 9,887 new cases China confirms three new cases Russia’s death toll continues to riseIndia\u0026nbsphas overtaken\u0026nbspItaly\u0026nbspas the sixth worst-affected country, after another biggest single-day rise in confirmed Covid-19 infections.India’s health ministry reported 9,887 new cases on Saturday, bringing the official total to 236,657. The country has fewer confirmed cases than only the\u0026nbspUS,\u0026nbspBrazil,\u0026nbspRussia,\u0026nbspBritain\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspSpain.India’s official death toll of 6,642 is relatively low compared with the other countries, but experts say the country is still nowhere near its peak and doctors fear what will happen once the imminent monsoon season begins.Despite there being no sign the infection curve flattening, the country will begin opening up on Monday after more than two months of the world’s largest lockdown, which has involved 1.3 billion people. Shopping malls and places of worship will open their doors, but no large gatherings, distributions of food offerings, sprinkling of holy water or touching of idols and holy books will be allowed.Almost half of the country’s known cases have been traced to the four densely populated cities of Delhi, Chennai, Ahmedabad and Mumbai, where hospitals have already run out of beds and patients sleep on floors and share oxygen tanks. As the millions of migrant workers who spent weeks trapped in the cities return home, however, they are spreading the virus to remote rural areas that often have no medical facilities to speak of.The World Health Organization (WHO) noted on Friday that India’s lockdown had helped it dampen transmission of the disease but said there was a risk cases would rise again as people returned to their ordinary lives.“As India and other large countries open up and people begin to move, there is always a risk of the disease bouncing back up,” Dr Mike Ryan, the head of WHO’s emergencies programme, told a news conference in Geneva.Latin America remains a coronavirus hotspot, and the situation deteriorated in Mexico, where the health ministry reported an additional 4,346 cases and 625 new deaths. That brought the country’s confirmed total to 110,026 cases and 13,170 deaths.Despite the rising infection rate, Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López, continued to insist his strategy had been effective. He dismissed media reports about the escalating death toll, which is second only to Brazil’s in the region, as alarmist and irresponsible.The death toll also continued to rise in Russia, where 197 people died in the past 24 hours. The country’s official death toll is 5,725. There were also 8,855 new cases, according to officials. This pushed the total number of recorded infections to 458,689.The number of confirmed coronavirus cases increased in Germany by 407 to 183,678. China\u0026nbsprecorded three new confirmed cases, down from five the day before. All were imported from abroad, according to the National Health Commission (NHC). The total number of infections in China, where the virus first emerged late last year, stands at 83,030.The G20 pledged on Saturday to provide more than $21bn (£17bn) to fight the coronavirus. The group called on all countries, NGOs, philanthropies and the private sector in April to help close a financing gap estimated at more than $8bn to combat the pandemic.The group said in a statement: “The G20, with invited countries, has coordinated the global efforts to support the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. To date, G20 members and invited countries have pledged over $21bn to support funding in global health.“The pledges will be directed towards diagnostics, vaccines, therapeutics and research and development.”The airline industry continues to reel from the effects of the pandemic. United Airlines became to latest airline to announce cuts with the closure of cabin crew bases in Hong Kong, Tokyo and Frankfurt.New Zealand is on course to declare itself free of Covid-19 by next week. It would be the first country among the OECD group of wealthy countries, and the first that has recorded more than 100 cases, to do so.Hailed for its successful containment of the virus, New Zealand has recorded only 22 coronavirus deaths. The last person known to have contracted the virus domestically left quarantine on 18 May. Scientists said they would be able to declare the domestic elimination of the virus after 28 days of no known cases, which will be on 15 June.Elsewhere around the world:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fca47d3d664880404a351e960369b062362b3e1/0_390_5917_3551/master/5917.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3690ed8642b91d76d8a47a8d4ce7c125","title":"limited re opening of uk places of worship planned for 15 june","story":"Weddings and group worship not yet allowed but praying will be, subject to distancing rulesChurches and other places of worship are set to open for private prayer from 15 June, the government has announced.Iniduals are expected to be able to “reflect and pray” while adhering to physical distancing rules – but worship groups, weddings and other services will still not be permitted.Downing Street said the changes would only be made if the government’s five tests for easing lockdown are met.Places of worship come under step three of the government’s road map to lift restrictions, and are not due to fully reopen until at least 4 July.Ministers had been warned that worshippers felt “disappointment and hurt” at not being able to visit places of worship despite some shops being reopened.A government taskforce with faith leaders was launched last month to develop a plan to enable the phased and safe reopening of religious buildings.The Church of England closed all its buildings on 24 March, meaning funerals could only take place at crematoriums or the graveside. Clergy were encouraged to live-stream worship from their own homes.The communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, said: “Ensuring places of worship can open again, beginning with private prayer by iniduals has been my priority. Their contribution to the common good of our country is clear, as places of solace, comfort, stability and dignity. And the need for them is all the greater as we weather the uncertainties of the pandemic.“I’m pleased the prime minister has announced that this is expected to happen from 15 June.

Compared with Britain, no other European government in YouGov’s Covid-19 perception tracker has seen public trust plunge by 30 points.As the coronavirus crisis gathered pace in Europe three months ago, the personal approval ratings of the continent’s leaders, including Boris Johnson, surged under the common effect in times of crisis familiar to political scientists as “rally round the flag”.As much of continental Europe endured strict lockdowns from mid-March onwards, YouGov’s rolling perception poll – which monitors the percentage of people who think their government is handling the crisis “very” or “somewhat” well – showed parallel levels of public satisfaction.Germany, which alongside a relatively relaxed six-week shutdown instituted a track and trace system that was highly effective in halting its outbreak, has recorded just under 185,000 cases and fewer than 9,000 fatalities, corresponding to a death toll per million inhabitants of 104.Frederiksen has emerged equally strongly from the crisis in Denmark. The prime minister acted fast, closing the Scandinavian country’s borders as early as 13 March and following up a few days later by shutting all kindergartens, schools and universities and banning gatherings of more than 10 people.In France, one of the Europe’s harder-hit countries with a per-million death toll of 433, Macron and his government – which has coped, on balance, reasonably well, and better than many comparable countries – have been the target of heavy criticism over an early shortage of face masks and a long delay in beginning widespread testing.Without a longstanding, grassroots power base, however, Macron remains vulnerable to a strong challenge in the 2022 presidential elections. According to French media, his entourage are worried not so much by the far-right Marine Le Pen but a populist outsider such as the comedian Jean-Marie Bigard or TV presenter Cyril Hanouna."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99578cdce644a5edaea80b5a4f2b4de5e01c1997/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7679072144d6f98690234b2c33acd46e","title":"prime minister told to dump rhetoric and plan for new covid wave","story":"Medical chiefs call for a public health campaign as faith in government strategy slumpsSenior figures from across the NHS have issued an urgent plea for a comprehensive plan to tackle a second wave of coronavirus infections, as Boris Johnson continues to lose public confidence in his handling of the pandemic.Amid persistent fears among scientists that the virus remains too prevalent to ease the lockdown further, the prime minister has been urged to ditch “cheap political rhetoric” that risks eroding the public’s adherence to lockdown measures in the months ahead.Health chiefs say there should be no further easing before a comprehensive test and trace system has been proved to work, as NHS figures accuse the government of lacking a strategy and dodging an “honest and open” debate about Britain’s plight. They also warned of a “dramatic” drop in capacity at NHS hospitals.The Observer spoke to organisations including the Royal College of GPs, the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, the Royal College of Anaesthetists, the NHS Confederation and NHS Providers on how ministers should plan for a potential second wave. They called for:• An “aggressive public health campaign” to boost flu immunisation to stop the NHS having to deal with flu as well as Covid-19 outbreaks this winter.• The retraining of more hospital staff so that they could be a “reserve” force, redeployed in the event of a second peak.• The retaining of private hospital space to help deal with the NHS backlog.• A comprehensive plan to protect care homes from a second peak in Covid-19 infections.There were also demands for more open communication about the risks ahead and the strategy being adopted, following Johnson’s much-criticised claim that the UK would have a “world-beating” test and trace system by the start of June.Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said: “The real concern is that we don’t have that same degree of trust, because we’re not having the kind of honest and open debates that we need. We seem to be resorting to kind of fairly cheap political rhetoric about stuff being world class, when it clearly isn’t.”Professor Martin Marshall, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said: “I think the criticism that we can’t see a strategy is a legitimate criticism … We need a strategy for test and trace, for PPE, for the use of technology, for maintaining Covid services and opening up non-Covid services.”A further 204 deaths from Covid-19 in the UK have been announced, bringing the total to 40,465.The growing anxiety about the dangers of a second wave of illness comes as anti-racism protesters defied safety warnings by gathering in their thousands across the UK to demonstrate against the death of George Floyd in America. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, and Priti Patel, the home secretary, had urged people to avoid mass gatherings. Scientists warned yesterday that the anti-racism protests posed a serious public health risk. “Any mass gathering risks significant numbers of further cases,” said Keith Neal, Nottingham University’s emeritus professor of the epidemiology of infectious diseases. “There is clear evidence that banning mass gatherings was one of the most effective and important parts of the lockdowns across European countries.”Calls are growing for a rapid public inquiry into the Covid-19 crisis to be launched as soon as this summer. Una O’Brien, the former permanent secretary at the Department for Health, wrote in a blog: “What better time than this summer, as the first serious phase of the pandemic recedes, for the UK government to … launch an impartial, independent and comprehensive inquiry here?”A Department of Health spokesperson said: “We will continue to be guided by the latest scientific advice – including from world-renowned epidemiologists – and give the NHS whatever it needs, as we have done throughout this unprecedented pandemic.“Thanks to the hard work and dedication of NHS staff, hospitals have not been overwhelmed and intensive care capacity continues to meet the needs of patients. Our new NHS Test and Trace service is also up and running and anyone in this country with symptoms can book a test, with the majority getting their results back within a day.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7033e62d1c77fcae4086ad4ffe2ab81357a0719c/13_0_2103_1262/master/2103.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9813f3d385be8320a1122028212e0fc2","title":"zoos may not survive as ministers insist that visitor ban must stay","story":"While lockdown is eased for shops and beaches, animal attractions are being forced to ask for public help to stay afloatLooking out across 130 empty acres of Chester zoo, Jamie Christon, the zoo’s chief operating officer, is furious. In a conference call last weekend with government officials, zoo bosses were told that while non-essential shops can reopen on 15 June, zoo gates were to remain closed “indefinitely”. This was despite the fact that Christon and other zoo chiefs across the UK insist they are able to make their attractions far more “Covid-secure” than Primark or Durdle Door in Dorset, where beachgoers were seen crowded together last weekend.“While we see pictures of public beaches, parks and UK beauty spots busy with people, our zoo – a huge outdoor space, with 16km of pathways, and measures in place to ensure a safe environment for guests – sits empty,” he said.“Just up the road from us in Warrington, Ikea reopened this week, an indoor space where social distancing will be much more difficult than outdoors.”In London, Dominic Jermey is also in despair. As director general of the Zoological Society of London, he cannot reopen either London zoo or Whipsnade safari park, despite having\u0026nbsp“redesigned the whole experience at our\u0026nbspzoos\u0026nbspto make them Covid-secure”.He said he couldn’t understand the government’s rationale. “Our\u0026nbspzoos\u0026nbspshould be part of the solution to Covid, providing Covid-secure outdoor experiences where a population emerging from lockdown can visit with confidence,” he says. “Instead, the longer we stay closed, the less likely we are to survive the lockdown.”\u0026nbspIn Scotland, where the devolved government has been more cautious in easing lockdown restrictions, zoo bosses face a similar situation.The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland said it will be ready to reopen Edinburgh zoo and the Highland wildlife park by the end of June, but has warned that being closed over the summer months could be “financially disastrous”.A wide range of safety measures is being put in place by the wildlife conservation charity, which has had to borrow £5m due to the coronavirus pandemic and the closure of both parks.In Colwyn Bay, the Welsh Mountain zoo, Wales’ national zoo, has also been “haemorrhaging” funds, according to Jen Jesse, director of operations and administration.She said the zoo would have made at least £500,000 in the past two months, and that even with closed doors and 17 staff furloughed, a zoo is a very expensive endeavour.“While we have cut expenditure, we cannot furlough our dedicated keepers. You cannot, basically, ‘switch off’ a zoo,” she said.The\u0026nbspgovernment says it is working to understand how and when zoos and aquariums can safely reopen and says it provided a £14m support fund for English zoos but big zoos –\u0026nbspincluding Chester and London – complain they were exempt.A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\u0026nbsp said: “We understand the challenges faced by zoos and aquariums but it’s vital that we do not move too quickly in reopening to ensure public health is protected.”"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Faster cuts in methane and nitrous oxide from farming needed \u0026ndash Stop Climate ChaosOn-farm measures are key to reducing emissions - environmental watchdogUnthinkable: Is nature\u0026rsquos mother god sending us a message with Covid-19?"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winterA new report shows no let-up in the loss of wildlife in Northern IrelandCorncrakes get major EU funding despite being of \u0026lsquoleast concern\u0026rsquo on Red List criteria"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4264786.1590664226!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the irish farmers peering into cow pats for precious dung beetles","story":"When Eye on Nature was launched on this page in 1988, queries about beetles came by post, often with little drawings on the letters. Today, on sunny lockdown days, a prowl in the garden with a phone camera has yielded yet more coleoptera, slowly locomotory or paused in thought.Colourful shield bugs and ladybirds on summer leaves, longhorns perched on roses, ing beetles gliding through garden ponds, maybugs thumping on to garden tables... all have brought endless queries for a name.At the same time – and this may, perhaps, surprise you – some 40 Irish farmers have been roaming their cattle pastures, kicking apart the drier cow pats and peering into their depths. Retrieving small black beetles from their sticky weave, or floating them in a bucket of water, they have brought them home and put them in the freezer to send, in due course, to Bruce Thompson.Young, married, with two children, Thompson works with his father running a dairy farm with 230 cows on the slopes of the Slieve Blooms in Co Laois. Most farmers of that size, concerned about the cows’ internal parasites, inject or pour on costly quantities of a “worming” drug, notably ivermectin.This does, indeed, kill cattle parasites, but also emerges unchanged in their dung, with lethal impact on the larvae of dung beetles. There are parts of the insect community that can make cow pats disappear into the soil, sometimes in days, their nutrients recycled for plants to grow.Googling dung beetles brings up fascinating photographs of inidual beetles rolling balls of dung uphill with their hind legs. Many tropical species do, indeed, pose for pictures in this manner. Ireland’s largest dung beetle (the dor beetle in my drawing) is content to dig a vertical burrow beside the cow pat and lay eggs at the bottom, together with pellets of dung for the larvae to recycle as food.Most of the decomposition, however, is done by tiny dung beetles a few millimetres long, These are mainly the Aphodius family, which lay their eggs beneath the dung’s surface. A study by scientists at Teagasc and UCC found that, in cow pats with a tiny trace of the anthelmintic drug ivermectin, the toll on the development of beetle larvae was substantial.Bruce Thompson had a keen interest in soils and their wildlife and was equipped with his own microscope. He decided ,with his father, to minimise dosing with “mectins” to give young stock a chance of developing their own immunity to parasites. With a more diagnostic approach, the dosing was phased out for the adult cows and they have had none of the drug since 2017.A chance conversation with a UK entomologist fired Thompson’s interest in further study. With more encouragement from Aidan O’Hanlon, entomologist at the Natural History Museum, he sought a research scholarship from the Irish Nuffield Foundation.It took him to Australia and New Zealand, where the introduction of alien dung beetles has been helping to rescue cattle farming from pastures polluted with undecomposed manure.Australia’s native dung beetles evolved with the droppings of kangaroos and wallabies, not cattle. The government has subsidised the establishment of colonies of dung beetles from Hawaii, Africa and Europe. In New Zealand, packages of beetles are offered commercially to set against the costs of riverbank fencing and planting to curb the run-off from dung.The case for conserving coprophagous coleoptera has been strengthened even further by a large-scale field trial in southwest England. Researchers at the University of Bristol set out some 250 1-kilo cow pats of parasite-infected dung. Those exposed to Aphodius beetles left lower numbers of parasites in grass around the pats. Such findings, reported in the Journal of Applied Ecology in August 2017, demonstrated to Thompson that the beetles were helping him to lower the need for ivermectin.It encouraged him to launch “Operation Defecation”, meant to build a baseline of the types and prevalence of dung beetles on farms with different practices of “worming”. Dissolving chunks of dung in a bucket of water can bring a dozen different species of beetles floating to the surface.Thompson’s recruitment of farming volunteers has been helped by his involvement in local farming groups and an appeal on Twitter headed “All good things come in poos!” (@Friesian_man).His “citizen science” sampling is undertaken in the hope that intensive farming can be partnered with respect for the natural ecosystems of the soil. For Teagasc’s researchers, the quest is for evidence “that informs satisfactory trade-offs between conservation targets, animal welfare and livestock production”.In the meantime, perhaps, as the Bristol research paper concludes: “Livestock management practices should focus on reducing reliance on anthelmintics to minimise damage to natural dung beetle populations.”"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

We’ve installed public toilets at the top of Grafton Street this morning and others are going into place over the weekend. Those are the public toilet facilities that will be in place by Monday,” Mr Kenny said.The council has also put a number of health and safety measures in place, such as placing decals and stickers on the ground on Grafton Street and Henry Street to mark out where people should queue so they can abide by social distancing.Shoppers can expect queues to enter stores, changing rooms being shut and staff wearing personal protective equipment.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4272108.1591387629!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ministers happy to be part of plan to lift restrictions","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar, Minister for Health Simon Harris and chief medical officer Tony Holohan brief the media at Government Buildings. Photograph: Leon FarrellPhotocall IrelandAcross two Cabinet meetings on Thursday and Friday, Ministers discussed and then gave the green light to an unexpectedly dramatic acceleration of the lifting of the coronavirus restrictions.Some around Government had wondered why the Taoiseach had convened a meeting in Dublin Castle on Thursday night, the first time the full Cabinet had met face-to-face since the restrictions were introduced in March.At the meeting, Leo Varadkar and Minister for Health Simon Harris asked the Ministers for their views on what should be accelerated, and a discussion followed.Those present say that having everyone in a room face to face allowed for a more free-flowing debate than has been the norm during recent meetings held via video link.Minister for Rural Affairs Michael Ring, one of the most vociferous in arguing that the lifting of the lockdown could be accelerated, argued that the limit on travel should be abolished completely rather than expanded from 5km to 20km from Monday.The Cabinet decided that people should be allowed to travel either 20km from their homes or anywhere else within their county. It was one of two occasions where the Ministers deviated from the advice of the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) the other being the decision to allow shopping centres to reopen from June 15th.Minister for Business Heather Humphreys, whose public profile and stock across Government has risen during the crisis, argued that retailers in shopping centres should not be at a disadvantage to those on the high street, whose reopening had been agreed by NPHET.Recent weeks had seen arguments within Government, and outside, about how much Ministers should adhere to the advice of NPHET and chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan.The discussion and decisions across the two Cabinet meetings this week gave Ministers buy-in, and a sense of ownership, to what was ultimately announced.But if there was pressure applied to NPHET and Dr Holohan to accelerate the lifting of the lockdown, it is likely to have happened behind the scenes.Medical adviceVaradkar and Harris insist that the politicians have worked alongside their medical advisers throughout this process and, at the post-Cabinet press conference on Friday, the Taoiseach acknowledged that there was a back and forth between Government and NPHET on the way forward.He pointedly told the Dáil on Thursday that he had asked Dr Holohan and NPHET to examine if some elements of the lockdown exit plan could be accelerated – measures moved from phase three to two and phase four to three, for example.Dr Holohan had told NPHET he had been thinking about how to merge the final phases together, and Government sources pointed out that the decision to cut the original plan down from five stages to four came from NPHET itself.Sources said NPHET discussions this week included claims that a decision not to bring forward more phases could be regretted if a further lockdown had to be imposed in the event of a second Covid-19 wave.After the acceleration was announced, those who argued that the Cabinet should take more control away from NPHET were satisfied. Those who said NPHET and Government Buildings moved in line with each other pointed to a correlation between Dr Holohan’s letter to Harris recommending to proceed to the next phase on Monday and the final Cabinet announcement.Those who had argued that the plan should be speeded up to lift the economy, boost domestic tourism and reduce the number of people out of work believed it was their stance that had won out.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Large crowd gathers shortly after legislature outlaws insults to China\u0026rsquos national anthemTrump administration has presented China with \u0026lsquoopportunities\u0026rsquo on the world stageStorm made landfall further south than expected giving some respite to metropolis ravaged by coronavirusDeath at Wuhan\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquowhistleblower hospital\u0026rsquo prompts wave of anger at hospital authoritiesSchools in deprived areas reported girls using newspapers and rags in attempt to manage periodAnnual vigil to mark Tiananmen Square massacre cancelled but activists still plan to rallyOfficials and media say US criticism of Hong Kong policing illustrates double standardsExperts fear country\u0026rsquos caseload could reach 1m in several weeks if virus is not curbedBejing approved decision to create laws for Hong Kong to curb sedition, secession, terrorismMove paves way for anti-sedition laws which rights advocates say will threaten city\u0026rsquos freedomsAt least 69 cases this week linked to cluster of infections at logistics facilityThousands take to streets to oppose Beijing-backed laws curtailing city\u0026rsquos freedomsMove to impose security law illustrates Beijing\u0026rsquos increasing tendency to flex its muscleProtesters get ready for more demonstrations against proposed Beijing lawsCommissioner in territory says contentious new security law aimed at \u0026lsquotroublemakers\u0026rsquoPM has made most of her communication skills and the country\u0026rsquos political cultureCian English (19), from Carlow, died following fall from Gold Coast apartmentChina proposes path to imposing rules used against dissidents on the mainlandPolice fire tear gas in popular shopping district as protesters take to the streets\u0026lsquoThere is a political virus spreading in United States,\u0026rsquo says China\u0026rsquos foreign ministerStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4272018.1591378999!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"barnier insists pragmatic workarounds are possible for trade in the north","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichel Barnier holds the Official Journal of the European Union C34 during a press conference on Friday in Brussels regarding the fourth round of Brexit negotiations. Photograph:  Daina Le Lardic PoolGetty ImagesBusinesses in Northern Ireland should be able to use workarounds and exemptions to make checks on goods on the Irish Sea border less onerous, chief European Union negotiator Michel Barnier has said.He was responding to an opinion column in The  in which contributor Newton Emerson expressed concerns that the EU was cynically taking a “maximalist” position on checks in order to use the North as a “bargaining chip”.Mr Barnier emphasised that the special arrangements for the North – under which it will apply EU customs rules so that checks take place in ports and airports there rather than on the land border with the Republic – had been jointly drawn up and agreed with the British government, and that there was room for pragmatism within them.“Regarding Mr Emerson’s concerns ... I would say that we can take into account those concerns within the framework as it’s currently written, because it’s written in a very precise way,” Mr Barnier told reporters after the latest round of EU-UK talks concluded.Imported“Simplified declarations can be used for large economic operators, supermarkets being one of them,” he said.For goods that are imported into the North from Britain or elsewhere outside the EU, exemptions on tariffs are possible if it can be proved that the produce will not enter the single market.“This is something we are discussing with the United Kingdom as we speak,” Mr Barnier said. “We’re ready to work with the UK further on all aspects of what the EU customs code can offer in order to facilitate trade and do everything we can do that end. But for that we need genuine commitment also from the UK side also on a number of technical issues which I have to say isn’t always forthcoming.”Special arrangementsA joint EU-UK committee is currently overseeing the implementation of the special arrangements for the North agreed as part of Britain’s withdrawal from the EU.\u0026nbspOfficials have said that plans for additional infrastructure to enforce checks need to be agreed swiftly in order to be ready for when the new arrangements come into force at the end of the year.Mr Barnier insisted he was keen to find a compromise. “I’m not dogmatic. Sometimes there is a bit of spin amongst UK politicians saying I’m some kind of dogmatic person and representing a technocratic commission, but I’m a pragmatic man,” he said.“I’m sure if we don’t get bogged down in ideological debate with pragmatism we can pull this off.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"British-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsGiven lack of other options, authorities used restrictions as main tool to fight pandemicFormer cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationRival Gantz to take over as prime minister of Israeli unity government after 18 monthsAshraf Ghani to lead country as rival Abdullah Abdullah oversees Taliban peace process, sources sayCeremony will end political deadlock that has dragged on for more than 500 daysArab and foreign jihadis ambush military convoys and assassinate officials as Baghdad and Damascus try to contain coronavirusThree men captured west of Caracas are the latest \u0026lsquoterrorists\u0026rsquo arrestedAt least 24 killed by suicide bomber in separate attack in Afghanistan on TuesdayStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4271818.1591367972!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit uk says sides need face to face talks to make progress","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t British Brexit negotiator David Frost: “Any such deal must of course accommodate the reality of the UK’s well-established position on the so-called ‘level playing field’, on fisheries, and the other difficult issues.” Photograph:  Kenzo TribouillardAFP via Getty ImagesBritain’s chief negotiator David Frost described progress in the Brexit talks as “limited”, adding that the two sides were close to the limits of what could be achieved without face-to-face talks.Speaking after the latest round of talks ended on Friday, he said the talks must intensify and accelerate but appeared to abandon Britain’s threat to leave the talks if the shape of a deal was not in sight by the end of June.“We need to conclude this negotiation in good time to enable people and businesses to have certainty about the trading terms that will follow the end of the transition period at the end of this year, and, if necessary, to allow ratification of any agreements reached,” he said.“For our part we are willing to work hard to see whether at least the outline of a balanced agreement, covering all issues, can be reached soon. Any such deal must of course accommodate the reality of the UK’s well-established position on the so-called ‘level playing field’, on fisheries, and the other difficult issues.”In its negotiating mandate last February, the British government said that if not enough progress was made in the talks by June it would “need to decide whether the UK’s attention should move away from negotiations and focus solely on continuing domestic preparations to exit the transition period in an orderly fashion”.A senior British negotiating official said on Friday that coronavirus had delayed progress and it was time for talks to move to a different format with a smaller group of negotiators. The official rejected Michel Barnier’s accusation that Britain was disregarding the political declaration Boris Johnson agreed with the EU last October alongside the withdrawal agreement.“We are committed to the political declaration. We see it, as it describes itself, as a document that sets out the parameters. It isn’t in itself a treaty,” the official said.The source said that Britain’s offer to accept tariffs on some products rather than agree to level playing field commitments on fair competition fell on “stony ground” in Brussels.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus.

A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates.

As a the company’s UK marketing manager in 1996, he led the £200 million campaign to rebrand the fizzy drink and take on the might of Coca-Cola. One of his stunts involved painting Concorde in the new Pepsi colours.Davie has said that the “challenger” mentality he took on during the Pepsi vs Coke wars has been helpful ever since - now more than ever, as US media giants dwarf the BBC.Although regarded as a safe pair of hands at the corporation, with a deep understanding of its values, he is certainly not afraid of a challenge. His hobby is marathon running, and not just the common or garden kind: Davie runs ultra-marathons, including the gruelling Marathon des Sables and a race at the North Pole.The son of a wine and spirits salesman and a teacher, Davie grew up in Croydon, south London - he is a Crystal Palace fan - and won a scholarship to the private Whitgift School before studying at Selwyn College, Cambridge.He worked first at Procter \u0026amp Gamble, then PepsiCo, and joined the BBC as head of marketing in 2005. His appointment as head of audio and music in 2008 surprised many - a man with no programme-making experience being put in charge of the BBC’s radio output - but he proved himself capable.While there, he proposed closing 6 Music, prompting fans to launch a campaign. The station was saved, and there are some who believe it was a clever stunt designed to prove the BBC’s value to audiences.He had the confidence to apply for the top job in 2012, aged 45, but it went to George Entwistle. A few months later, Davie was watching Skyfall with his wife and three sons at a Reading cinema when he got the call from the BBC chairman, Chris Patten, to say Entwistle had resigned over the Jimmy Savile scandal following an on-air savaging by the Today programme’s John Humphrys.Davie was asked to step in as caretaker. “It was a crisis that needed handling,” he said. He was criticised for appearing on television without a tie, but other than that was praised for steering the corporation through the next five months until Lord Hall’s appointment.Colleagues speak of his decisive leadership, and describe him as a driven but personable character. In an interview for the Royal Television Society, Davie said he had “quite a lot of commercial DNA” but stressed that his love for the BBC and public service broadcasting goes back a long way: “My base wiring is Blue Peter, suburban Britain.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"30 private schools preparing close due covid 19","story":"As many as 30 British private schools are preparing to close due to the coronavirus pandemic, The Sunday  has learned, with parents struggling to pay fees contributing to their collapse.Most schools “haven’t got deep pockets” and the current crisis has pushed dozens of institutions over the edge, according to Neil Roskilly, chief executive of the Independent Schools Association.Nine private schools have already formally announced that they intend to shut down, but Mr Roskilly said that there are around 30 overall which are in a similar position. “It is very worrying for the pupils and their families,” he said. “Some will resurrect themselves. Sometimes they go into administration then they will be bought up and reopened under different leadership.”Mr Roskilly explained that the impact of parents being unable to pay fees will be a “significant” blow to schools’ finances.This week the Minster School in York, a preparatory school which provides choristers for the city\u0027s cathedral and can trace its origins back to the seventh century, announced that it will close due to a cash shortfall caused by the Covid-19 crisis.Boris Johnson’s former prep school, Ashdown House Preparatory School in Sussex , also informed parents that it will shut down after 180 years due to the “harsh reality” of coronavirus which has prompted a sharp fall in demand for places.  Of the schools which have so far announced their closure, half are preparatory schools and so far three have specifically cited parents’ inability to continue paying fees as a factor in their decision to shut down.York Minster’s Dean, the Right Rev Dr Jonathan Frost, said that the Chapter of York was no longer able to keep up its investment in the school adding that in recent months “a number of families indicated they would be unable to keep their children at the Minster School.”Moreton Hall, a prep school in Suffolk which charges £24,000-a-year for boarders, explained its reasons for closure included the fact that many parents “now find themselves in difficult financial straits” as well as loss of income from summer camps and demand for overseas boarding drying up. Bramdean School in Exeter, another school to have closed in recent months told parents that it would be unable to “weather this storm”, adding that they had been receiving “daily requests” for fee remissions. Stephen Spriggs, managing director at William Clarence Education which assists some of the country’s leading public schools with recruitment, said that families falling into financial difficulties and pulling their children out is a real concern.“Preparatory schools have a lower head count which then means if they have a drop off in pupil numbers they lose out more because of the fees,” he said.“The biggest problem for schools is looking forward into next year. What kind of boarding offer can they really offer? If the international students don’t turn up in September and British families pull their children out, you can’t make the same forecasts.”Julie Robinson, chief executive of the Independent Schools Council, said it is “terribly sad” to hear of school closures as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. “It is impossible to predict with accuracy the full impact this pandemic will have,” she said. “Of course it is already affecting independent schools like all small businesses and also the livelihoods of fee-paying parents.”Ms Robinson said that independent schools are “highly adaptable to a change in the market”, adding that their switch to online learning which has been well received by parents and pupils.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"lockdown rat boom bigger bolder ever","story":"At the beginning of The Plague, the 1947-dystopian novel by Albert Camus, the first sign that an epidemic has gripped the fictional town of Oran is the rats, which appear without warning in their midst.During the coronavirus lockdown, a similar phenomenon is being witnessed across Britain, with one crucial exception. For while the rats of Oran emerged from the sewers to die on the streets in their thousands, during the Covid pandemic they appear to be thriving.According to the British Pest Control Association (BPCA), more than half of pest control professionals have reported an increase in rat activity since lockdown began at the end of March. With restaurants closed, many rat populations have been forced to abandon their city centre burrows and expand into our homes and gardens in pursuit of food. In recent weeks, rats have been reported burrowing into cellars, clambering up drain pipes and colonising compost bins. Rat wars have been reported as separate colonies attempt to muscle in on rival turf. In some instances they have also started eating each other.A few weeks ago, rat catcher Martin Kirkbride was called to one such infestation in an insalubrious corner of Openshaw, Manchester. A tenant living in an upstairs flat had reported suddenly seeing so many rats that they were scuttling over his feet when he opened the front door.Kirkbride, a 56-year-old former social worker who is one of the only rat catchers in Britain to still operate using ratting dogs (in his case a pair of Manchester terriers), has in recent weeks received an upsurge in calls, with several coming in each day. He visited the scene and discovered the rats had moved into an abandoned Honda Jazz and established a colony in its engine bay.He watched as dozens of them scuttled out from the car and down a nearby alleyway, where a Chinese takeaway had left food festering in an industrial bin. “These were normal 12-inch rats but there are certainly some bigger ones knocking around,” he tells me, as we meet (socially distanced) by the entrance to the alley. “People have posted pictures on Facebook of ones they’ve seen that are 18-inches or more.”As he speaks his terriers, Drake and Izzy, whinny at their leads, itching to get ratting. Drake, in particular, is interested in a nearby drain which he sniffs and yelps at. The rat-infested car has now been towed away, so it’s presumed that the colony has shifted here. “The thing about Drake’s nose is he is never wrong,” Kirkbride adds.Live-baited and poisoned traps laid, we move on to the next location, a business park near Old Trafford. Here, in a car park next to a sandwich shop and a nursery, the bodies of two large grey rats - each around 14 inches long from top to tail - lie prostrate. Kirkbride laced their burrow with poison a few days previously, and has been called to retrieve the corpses. As he picks one up with a stick, Drake snatches it in his jaws. “He has started eating them,” he explains, once he retrieves the rodent from his grip, “which is not ideal.”While he uses poison, Kirkbride says there is growing evidence of rat immunity and he is concerned about so-called ‘secondary poisoning’ when animals such as owls eat the toxic bodies and themselves fall ill. He prefers to hunt with the dogs, as they are more effective ratters. The hounds work as a team, one sniffing the rat out of its burrow and the other waiting to pounce. Manchester terriers have evolved brown spots near their eyes to confuse rats trying to bite them and have a strange habit - which I see several times as they sniff around burrows - of jumping back. Martin explains this is a defence mechanism, because a rat always strikes first.Kirkbride is a keen student of his quarry and has read numerous tales of the old rat catchers. The most prominent among them is the Victorian ratter ‘Black Jack’ who worked by royal appointment to the Queen and operated using teams of terriers and ferrets. Black Jack gained near celebrity status in London and wore a costume of white leather trousers, a green jacket and a rat-shaped belt buckle.The rodents were a scourge of the industrial revolution, as overcrowded populations crammed into unsanitary urban housing. But if anything, Kirkbride says, the rat population in Britain’s cities is larger now. It’s just that we don’t tend to see them, as they live in the sewers and feed overnight on the calorific fast food we dump. “They live with us and are here because of us,” he explains. “The more people there are, the more food there is for the rats.”The story of the rat in Britain is similar to that of the squirrel. Our traditional black rat, upon whose fur teemed the fleas blamed for spreading the bubonic plague, have since the 18th century been pushed to the very margins by an invasive larger species called the Norway rat. Any estimate of population size is, experts say, a total guess - although they are prodigious breeders. Female rats have the ability to fall pregnant immediately after giving birth and are capable of producing around seven litters (each with an average of eight pups) a year.  In order to conceive, they mate up to 500 times with competing males in a matter of hours.Professor Steven Belmain is an expert in rodent behaviour at the Natural Resources Institute in Greenwich. He, too, has been on the receiving end of numerous phone calls from worried members of the public experiencing rat infestations during lockdown.He blames the shortage of discarded food in city centres, and says rats can move up to around 1km away from their burrows when seeking new feeding sites. Hunger, he says, also makes them bolder, hence why more are being sighted in the daylight. It would also explain why the rats are being more aggressive towards one another. “They are quite territorial, so will defend their patches as much as they can,” he says.While rats are in no way related to Covid-19, Belmain says that the spread of rodents is a health concern to humans, as they can harbour numerous zoonotic diseases (including Weil’s disease in their urine).As lockdown eases, and our hospitality industry resumes, he estimates most of the rats will simply return to their old burrows. But there is a concern that some colonies may continue to expand, seeing as they’ve already moved in. “What is happening is they are moving into residential areas and finding food sources there, so deciding to make it home,” says Belmain. “Some people are telling me they are having real problems.”One of those to discover they have new neighbours is the ’s deputy obituaries editor Chris Maume. A few days ago, he started noticing a strange “clanking sound” from the cellar of his East Dulwich home and after going down to investigate discovered a huge rodent the size of a small cat. “Even in the poor light it was absolutely massive and the biggest rat I’ve ever seen,” he says.He has taken matters into his own hands and laid a trap baited with cheese. Should that fail to entice the enemy in his midst, he is planning on switching to peanut butter.Normally, he adds, he is content to live and let live. But these are not normal times - and particularly not when your intruder is large enough to run in the 2.30 at Kempton.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"lost track virus abandoning testing data must guide next steps","story":"Eleven weeks have passed since the UK suspended much of our normal activity to contain the COVID19 pandemic. It was necessary to apply such broad and sudden measures because firstly, pressing the emergency stop button rather than veer out of control is a sensible move, and secondly it buys time which can be used wisely to work out a more finely-tuned response in order to get going again.But such a response requires, crucially, information to allow finer judgements to be prudently made on how we proceed now.One of the disastrous consequences of stopping testing and tracing in the community early in the pandemic is that we switched off the light on being able to see in detail the course of the infection in this country. When the vast majority of tests– and therefore information – was confined to those so sick that they had to be admitted to hospital as in-patients, and contact tracing was abandoned, we lost sight of how the virus was spreading in the rest of society. How many people were contracting COVID without requiring hospitalisation? What was their experience of the severity and length of their symptoms? How many had COVID but suffered no symptoms at all? How old were they? Where did they live in the country? In what kinds of households? Where did they work? Who did they contract it from? In what kind of setting?From this information – for which widespread testing was a prerequisite – we could have built a detailed picture of how COVID is transmitted in practice and understood much better what measures can be taken safely to release us from what the Prime Minister described to me at the Liaison Committee as “captivity”.Late in the day, some of that data is now coming through. Matt Hancock’s 100,000 a day target has allowed testing in the community to resume. The Office of National Statistics finally on 17th April began a programme of testing a random sample of people across the country. And we hope eventually to get some useful information from the contact tracers who started work 10 days ago.This detailed information is crucial for decision-making and should be disclosed as soon as it is available.  The daily press conferences and their presentation of overall positive tests and deaths from COVID, and an R number that is an average that hides much relevant variation in different settings, are no substitute for letting the public into a more detailed understanding of what is happening.There are many important questions on which data must help answer. Questions such as whether there is an appreciable benefit in quarantining passengers from places with much less risk of COVID infection than the UK whether we should all need to stay 2 metres apart irrespective of whether we are outdoors or in an enclosed space, or whether we are wearing a mask or not whether universities and colleges can safely resume their vital work and prevent a lifelong blight on a generation of young people.These are questions – and many more besides – to which the answers could be known now if only we had supplied ourselves with the information to answer them. From now on that must change and we must recognise that the cost and effort of collecting information is trivial in comparison to the consequences of not having it – needing to subject ourselves to blunt, rather than acutely targeted, measures.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"travel updates thermal testing empty rollercoasters florida","story":"Kefalonia, Greece, is poised for the return of touristsWhen can we go on holiday again?Can I take a UK holiday yet?Will holidays be cheaper after coronavirus?For when should I reschedule my holidayGreece is opening up to tourists again after relaxing some of the stringent restrictions that have kept hotels, clubs and bars closed since March.Between June 6 and June 15 the country will roll out phase six of its plan to ease lockdown measures, beginning by allowing restaurants and hotels to open up their indoor dining areas to clients as long as they respecting strict social distancing measures – face masks for employees will be mandatory and businesses have been strongly advised to fit Plexiglass screens in reception areas and in front of cash registers.On June 8, Greece will open most of its entertainment facilities, including casinos, internet cafés, nightclubs and live music venues, with capacity reduced to 60 per cent and strict social distancing measures in place.The final stage of phase six will see the country’s seasonal hotels opening their doors on June 15, although access to spas, saunas, outdoor pools and other public areas will be strictly regulated.International flights will only operate out of the country’s main airport, Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport in the capital Athens, until June 15, when Thessaloniki Airport in northern Greece will also resume operations.

Existing Eden Project Members and new visitors can also book places.The Eden Project, Cornwall, has welcomed a small number of visitorsThe two-metre social distancing rule is a threat to UK hospitality and the nation\u0027s domestic tourism and should be halved, trade groups have warned the Government. The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) and UK Hospitality fear that many venues such as pubs and restaurants will not be able to make enough money if the rule, which restricts customer numbers, stays in place.BBPA chief executive Emma McClarkin said: It must be recognised that no two pubs are the same and for many, ensuring a distance of two metres will be impossible, keeping them closed for much longer. Actioning advice from the World Health Organisation (WHO) for example to use one metre for social distancing from July would enable many more pubs to viably reopen and serve their communities again.UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: At two metres you are receiving 30 per cent of your normal revenues, at one metre it gets up to 70 per cent - so it is the difference between success and failure for many of those businesses. They will need support if two-metre social distancing is in place.If that is what the science says and if that is what our public health needs, that is what we will maintain. We just need to have the additional Government support to make that workable.Reopening of venues is expected to begin from July 4 in England and the Government is soon expected to publish its guidelines on how pubs, restaurants and hotels can begin to welcome customers again.It will likely not have escaped your attention that the Government plans to introduce its 14-day quarantine rule for international arrivals on Monday. As airports and airlines prepare to implement the rules, some have anticipated chaos on the first day of the measure.

Its flag carrier LOT has resumed domestic flights between Warsaw, Gdansk, Krakow and Wroclaw, but will not fly elsewhere for at least 10 days. On Friday afternoon, the EU said it wanted to reopen its borders to external travellers in July.  The bloc shut to non-essential travel from the Americas, Asia and elsewhere to slow the spread of Covid-19. The travel ban is due to expire on June 15, but Ylva Johansson, the EU\u0027s home affairs commissioner, said there was a strong preference to extend it.  That means that internal border controls are lifted by the end of June... we should consider the gradual lifting restrictions on non-essential travel to the EU early July, Johansson said. Sri Lanka has said it will reopen to international tourists from August 1. The country, which has seen fewer than 2,000 cases of coronavirus, said a negative test would be required from holidaymakers before boarding a flight to the island. Visitors will then be tested again on arrival, free of charge, again five days later, and again for travellers staying more than 10 days. Anyone who tests positive will be required to quarantine for up to 21 days. Tourism is key to Sri Lanka\u0026#39s economyGeorge Floyd protests: Biggest day of demonstrations in cities across the US Coronavirus latest news: Concerns that adherence to lockdown rules is slippingSurfer killed in shark attack off Australia\u0026#39s east coastPolice across US ordered to soften their tactics to quell \u0026#39peaceful\u0026#39 marchesUS riots: why are there protests over the death of George Floyd?Police reviewing unsolved child murders looking for links to prime suspect in Madeleine McCann caseTens of thousands take to the streets in Washington DC to demand justice for George FloydAntibody injection to save vulnerable patients could be ready next yearSir Keir Starmer demands quarantine \u0026#39exit strategy\u0026#39 but Labour will not oppose new 14-day rulesBritish authorities failed to identify Madeleine McCann suspect, says senior Portuguese officerBoris Johnson speeds up hospital building to aid economySaliva tests could help meet Boris Johnson\u0026#39s 24-hour target Comment: Our freedom is under threat from an American-exported culture warMcCann suspect\u0026#39s adoptive parents \u0026#39sent him to home for troubled teenagers\u0026#39Barnier accused of acting like \u0026#39referee\u0026#39 rather than a \u0026#39player on the pitch\u0026#39McCanns may renew legal battle with Portuguese police chiefPlain clothed police officers to be deployed on bicycles to catch speeding driversDiary of a coronavirus contact tracer: \u0026#39My enthusiasm is evaporating rapidly\u0026#39 European workers can avoid 14 days in quarantine under \u0026#39unfair\u0026#39 Home Office rules, IAG lawyers sayContact tracers force hospital to closeBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/06/06/13/avengers-endgame-women-superheros-scene.jpg","title":"avengers all female reboot captain marvel cinematic universe she hulk disney plus","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.It\u0027s not who you\u0027re expectingMarvel fans are hoping that rumours of an all-female Avengers reboot are true, with a new report suggesting that the identity of the ensemble’s leader could be somebody quite unexpected.With the Avengers series seemingly wrapped up for the time being following the release of 2019 blockbuster Endgame, there is much speculation as to what the studio’s next ensemble movie might be.As interest surrounding the addition of characters from X-Men and Fantastic Four intensifies, thanks to comments made by studio president Kevin Feige at Comic-Con in July 2019, a new rumour is suggesting that the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s women characters could unite for a new mash-up project.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhile most people are assuming that this team would be led by Brie Larson’s Captain Marvel, it seems they could be led by another character altogether – somebody we’re years away from meeting.According to We Got This Covered, the leader could be She-Hulk, who will be introduced in her very own Disney+ television show that’s expected to also feature Mark Ruffalo’s Bruce Banner.How to watch every Marvel film and TV show in chronological orderEvery Avengers character ranked from worst to bestThe character, created by Stan Lee and John Buscema in 1980, is Banner’s cousin Jennifer Waters.

But for many black runners in America, this is not the case. Kurt Streeter provides six accounts of what it is really like to be a black runnerOur jog is just beginning when my young son asks the question. “Dad, today can we go through my favourite neighbourhood?” During the pandemic, we’ve made a habit of running together in the early evening. We course down the middle of calm streets, exhausting ourselves as best we can. It’s become our way to bond.But now my jaw clenches. The neighbourhood that has become his favourite route? I have to think fast. What should I say to him about how that place makes me feel? How would I ever tell him about the killing of a black jogger in a corner of the country far from ours. When will be the right time to explain to a nine-year-old the wariness that comes every time I lace my clunky green sneakers and pad through the streets in our almost entirely white Seattle community?I’m not a great runner I’m a 6ft-2, 220-pound plodder who tends to wilt at mile four. But I get out there as much as I can, to ease the stress and to feel free.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAnd there lies the complication. Like many black runners, the very act of doing one of the things we love most in life comes with searing existential stress and constraint. I’ve been putting in hard, slogging miles since 2005, as I processed the fact my father was dying. Out there on city streets, visible and vulnerable, I have never jogged without the spectre of race. The way I look shadows my every stride.Sometimes it’s in the forefront of my mind – gutting, angry, mournful – as in the days after Ahmaud Arbery was chased and fatally shot. Sometimes it’s in the far corners, background noise, but still inescapable. I run to feel joy. To sense my 53-year-old legs churning and the wind pushing across my face, to think about stories I’m writing, to ponder ways to be a better husband and father. But I do all of this with a measure of vigilance.On my runs – which, pandemic aside, are usually solo – my mind hums with questions. Would it be better if I lived somewhere else? Why is the truck behind me on this street going so slowly? If I need to get away, which way would I sprint? If I need to turn and fight, would I kick, tackle or punch? Why did that officer circle back around and pass me twice?I live a 15-minute drive from downtown, amid blocks of tidy homes, old and new. On my sweat-soaked outings I’ll see a unique porch, a curving roof, a well-preserved Tudor. My father was an architect, so it’s in my bones to be curious about the way houses are designed. That only sparks more questions: Should I stop? If I do, how close should I get? How long should I linger? What will the neighbours think?Then there’s my iPhone. To some, snapping off a few frames with a cellphone camera makes me look like a prowler. Cellphones can also be mistaken for guns. Not a chance I’m pulling it out.A few years ago, on a run about 10 minutes from my house, I stopped briefly in the middle of a street to tell a white homeowner how much I admired the minimalist fence that led up her stairs. She was in her yard. I was 20 feet away, sure to smile, and to not move any closer. I immediately saw worry in her eyes. She backed up a few steps. Someone bolted out from her front door, sceptical and scowling, as if I were an attacker.I turned back to pounding the pavement, imagining what the reaction would have been if I were blue-eyed and blonde.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“This is my neighbourhood just as much as it is theirs,” I told myself. My family helped integrate this area and its schools, starting in the 1950s. And these days, the block where I live is a place where I feel great care. (It’s away from that block, on less familiar streets, when my radar rises.) So I gave a chagrined laugh at what had just taken place. It’s all we can do sometimes. Smile against the pain and disappointment, reminding ourselves that it’s about more than us in any one moment – it’s about a tangled and brutal 401-year history.But this day was different. Earlier, after watching the horrific video of the killing in Georgia, I’d collapsed on our couch, tears in my eyesThat legacy is what I thought of when my son asked whether we could run through his favourite neighbourhood. It’s adjacent to ours, a bit north and a lot more upscale. One of those gilded, set-apart communities with a homeowners’ association and lawns that look like putting greens. It doesn’t seem to have any trees on the sidewalk strips, so when I run there I feel as if I am in a fishbowl. Everyone can see us. I’ve never seen another black person in that neighbourhood.It’s a beautiful place, no doubt. My son loves it mainly for its wide, lightly travelled streets. They’re ideal for jogging, especially now. “Dad, can we go there?”We’d been doing just that on occasion over the past few weeks. But this day was different. Earlier, after watching the horrific video of the killing in Georgia, I’d collapsed on our couch, tears in my eyes.I don’t fear that neighbourhood, at least not any more than my own. But I can’t move through it without heads turning, without drawing objectifying smiles or looks that feel like doubt. I didn’t need to feel any of that.“We’re not going there on this run,” I said. “Some other time, I promise.”“Why?” he replied.“Have you ever seen any people of colour in that neighbourhood?” I asked. “It’s even more segregated than where we live. I’ll tell you more one day. Just not today.”My son managed a comforting smile. We turned the opposite direction, making the best of every moment, every stride, me with eyes wide open, him lopping along, content and carefree. It ends up being one of the best runs we’ve ever had.‘Turn down your music!’On the surface, Los Angeles is a mostly liberal town, but white privilege runs deep. I was verbally assaulted by a white man while on a morning run. I’ve been dreading the moment I might run into him again, wondering if he will be emboldened by our encounter.I haven’t stopped running on that trail, and I don’t plan to. The only thing that’s changed is I now run with pepper spray.In 2017, my wife and I moved to suburban Columbus, Ohio. About two weeks after we moved, I was running in the morning down neighbouring streets, trying to establish new routes. A woman who was leaving her home and getting into a car in her driveway did not notice me until I was nearing her driveway. I keep keys in my pocket so I can be heard.When the woman finally noticed me, she let out a gasp and said, “I’ve got mace.” I kept my pace and continued to run in a straight path. By the time I was at her driveway she was reaching inside her bag and screaming, “I’ll mace you.” I passed her without changing my speed or deviating from the run. Then I just went home.For the past week or so, I can’t help but think of how close I was to being assaulted on the same block where white men are freely able to walk around carrying weapons.Every single time I step out my door to run alone I create a “What If” checklist. What if someone tries to run me over, what if someone pulls up next to me to yell at me, what if someone tries to pull me into a vehicle? I have a plan just in case one of those “what if” moments were to occur.I have my phone tracker on and have all photos and videos taken on my phone automatically uploaded to three different cloud platforms. I have given some friends and family access to my tracker so they can attempt to find me just in case something were to happen. And I am conscious of what I am wearing to make me not look as if I am “suspicious” or “not doing what I shouldn’t be doing”.I run more than 20 miles a week. And each mile is not a carefree mile. I carry the weight and burden of the fears of what may be a harmful or detrimental experience that is undocumented and unjustified.‘Even in my own neighbourhood, I fear’I’m a husband, the father of four beautiful daughters and in the army, so staying in running shape is not optional for me. I live in a gated community in the birthplace of the civil rights movement, but also the cradle of the Confederacy. There isn’t a day that goes by that I run and don’t think about safety.Even in my own neighbourhood, I fear. I think about how\u0026nbspTrayvon\u0026nbspMartin was in his own gated neighbourhood when he was followed and gunned downMost of the time I try to run in my army physical fitness uniform or bright clothes and a reflective belt. I always run with my phone just in case something happens. At least my family would know what happened to me if I could pull out my phone and record it.Even in my own neighbourhood, I fear. I think about how Trayvon Martin was in his own gated neighbourhood when he was followed and gunned down. When it starts to rain a little bit, as it did the night Trayvon was killed, I cut my run short because of what happened to him. I think, they won’t believe I’m just trying to run in the rain.There’s a lot of trucks here with Confederate flags similar to the one that followed and killed our dear brother Ahmaud Arbery. Unfortunately, there’s so much unwanted anxiety running while black, and it’s further exacerbated with this senseless murder. We want to make it home to our families.‘Did anyone else see that?’The worst of it came as we all went into shelter in place in Pennsylvania. All of our local running groups remind us to run early or late to avoid crowds. I unfortunately listened to that advice one morning and went for a three-mile run. Halfway through, as I turned around, there was a hunter green pickup truck stopped in the middle of the road. I found it bizarre and slowed my run to a trot. As I got closer, I noticed the truck was decorated with TrumpPence 2020 stickers, along with a Confederate flag. My stomach dropped and I felt panic run through my body as they revved their engine several times in the middle of the road. I looked for escape routes in case they tried to jump the curb to hit me. I decided to be brave and pretend they were not there.As I passed them, they turned a corner down the street. We all peered at each other, until turning the corner broke their gaze. It was so uncomfortable and so confusing. Did anyone else see that? (No – I was alone and the streets were empty.) What just happened? What was that? I told my boyfriend about it and haven’t shared that experience with anyone else since. I now choose to run during peak hours with my BFF, with enough people around – just in case.‘I don’t want you to shoot!’Before I step outside of the house, I run through the following set of questions: Is my beard too thick? Is it too dark outside? Am I dressed like a runner? Then, while on the run, I have to consider the following: Is my rap music too loud? Does my cap, worn backward, send the wrong message? Do I open up my stride now or wait until I get out of the neighbourhood and into the open roads so that I don’t appear to be “running away” from something or someone?Beyoncé urges George Floyd protesters to stay ‘aligned and focussed’John Boyega receives huge support from filmmakers after BLM speechBlackout Tuesday is over – now be prepared for the real hard workThen there is scenario-planning while running: If you see a white young woman on the same path, cross the street immediately and try not to make eye contact twice. If it’s a white older womanman on same path, wavenodsmile, cross street casually. If you’re running behind them and they don’t hear you, cough loudlyclear throat, cross street. If on a narrow sidewalk, always give way to walkersbikers and step into the grass or street even though you’ve shattered your ankle twice. Turn volume down on music when passing by neighbours. Need to be able to respond should they say something so as not to be profiled as an angry black man.I’ve been doing mental gymnastics while running since I was 16. I’m 37 now, and I’ll continue doing it for as long as I live. The truth is, I don’t really want to do any of those things, but sadly I’m too concerned with what would happen if I stopped. So at mile five, when I’m sucking wind, sweating profusely in sweltering heat with an elevated heart rate, you’ll always catch me across the street waving neurotically and smiling. Again, not because I want to, but because I don’t want you to shoot!Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The latest study, which involved 2,254 British adults, also revealed that around six in 10 people experienced worse sleep since lockdown began on 23 March.Charting Sweden’s no lockdown strategy“Nearly two-thirds of the UK public report some negative impact on their sleep from the Covid-19 crisis, clearly showing just how unsettling the pandemic and lockdown measures have been for a very large proportion of us,” said Professor Bobby Duffy, director of the Policy Institute at King’s College London.“And this is clearly tied to both how stressful we’ve found the virus itself, and how much we fear the impact of the lockdown on our employment and finances.”Data gathered in April by wearable technology firm Withings showed that people in the UK had been sleeping for 15 minutes longer on average each day during the lockdown.France saw the biggest increase in daily sleep times, with the average person sleeping for an extra 20 minutes each night.These findings can be partly explained by people not having to commute to work due to either working from home or not working at all during lockdown.Similar data from fitness tracking firm Polar revealed that people in Germany are also sleeping for longer.A significant increase in sleep time was recorded by Polar’s sleep-tracking devices as lockdown measures were introduced in Germany on 22 March.Researchers at University College London (UCL) are currently studying the effects lockdowns are having on people’s mental health.Early results suggest that higher levels of anxiety and depression are linked to lockdown restrictions.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt is also sometimes called the Rose Moon in Europe due to its arrival coinciding with the blooming of rose flowers. Neither name is a reference to the colour of the actual moon, which will appear as any other full moon of the year.It may appear pink or red when it is close to the horizon, however, as it is viewed through a much thicker layer of the Earth’s atmosphere.The full moon also coincides with a penumbral lunar eclipse, whereby the Earth comes between the Sun and the moon and blocks some of the light. The reduction in light can result in a reddish tinge to the moon\u0027s appearance.Created with Sketch.Pink supermoon lights up the night sky: In pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.June’s full moon follows a succession of so-called supermoons, whereby the moon appears bigger and brighter in the sky.The rare event takes place when the moon is at its closest orbit to Earth, allowing a better view of its craters, basins and other features.Various apps are available to track the moon’s progress across the night sky, including Star Chart, Sky Safari and Skyview.Each give details about which direction the moon will rise and set, as well as which phase the moon is in on any given night.​How to take the perfect picture of the supermoonThis year has been full of astronomical events with the supermoons over the past few months and it doesn\u0027t end there. Tonight the rare Strawberry Moon will rise and be visible each night over this weekend, Zoltan Toth-Czifra, founder of star chart maker Under Lucky Stars, told The Independent.In the current climate, a lower than average level of pollution combined with a good weather forecast means the view will be even clearer.The weather forecast for Friday suggests that viewings of the Strawberry Full Moon may be interrupted, at least for some.The Met Office states there will be “sunny spells and showers for many, some heavy with isolated thunder Heavy rain and gales developing across northern Scotland, edging south later.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAdditionally, the new advice by WHO suggested that people over 60, as well as those in high-risk groups, should wear medical grade masks in cases where social distancing isn\u0027t possible.However concern remains that masks may themselves introduce risk factors – including making people feel less inclined to continue other measures like social distancing and hand washing.Mr Tedros added: “Our guidance also explains how to use a mask safely. People can potentially infect themselves if they use contaminated hands to adjust a mask, or to repeatedly take it off and put it on, without cleaning hands in between.“Masks can also create a false sense of security, leading people to neglect measures such as hand hygiene and physical distancing. “I cannot say this clearly enough: masks alone will not protect you from Covid-19.”Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?The announcement comes just a day after the UK government announced it would be making face coverings mandatory on public transport following months of claims the science was not clear on their effectiveness.“We are advising governments to encourage that the general public wear a mask. And we specify a fabric mask – that is, a non-medical mask,” the WHO’s technical lead expert on Covid-19, Maria van Kerkhove, added. “We have evidence now that if this is done properly it can provide a barrier... for potentially infectious droplets.”The UN agency’s advice that all healthcare workers dealing with Covid-19 patients, or with suspected cases of the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, should wear medical masks remains the same, Ms Van Kerkhove said.However, now that advice has been broadened to suggest staff coming into contact with any patients or residents in clinics, hospitals, care homes and long-term residential facilities should also wear masks at all times.Additional reporting by Reuters.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She told her fans on Instagram: “This s*** happens ALL THE TIME.”Highlighting the article, Thirlwall wrote: “You might want to make sure you’re using an image of the correct mixed race member of the group.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe said ”it’s becoming a running joke”, adding that she is “done with us just having to laugh it off now”.Thirwall revealed that journalists often confuse the pair during interviews and that many photographers often shout Pinnock’s name at her when she’s attending events.How a new wave of dramas about rape is redefining victimhoodShe said that she has always “awkwardly brushed it off as a simple mistake when we both really know why”.“It offends me that you couldn’t differentiate the two women of colour out of four members of a group…DO BETTER,” she stated.Thirlwall’s comments come after Pinnock was praised for a video in which she shared her personal experiences of racism since becoming a part of the band in 2011.Pinnock said she often felt like the “least favoured” member of the group because of her race, and that she “sings to fans who don’t see me or hear me or cheer me on”.The star posted after being left “feeling really heavy” in the wake of George Floyd’s death after he was taken into custody by police in Minneapolis.A white officer named Derek Chauvin was filmed kneeling on Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes.

But for those wanting to persevere, there are two watching orders. Really, you should probably watch these movies in release order, starting the journey with Iron Man and moving onto The Incredible Hulk, then Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, finishing Phase One with Avengers – and what better time to undertake this marathon than when in lockdown due to the coronavirus?Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis order works well in terms of the post-credit scenes setting up the next movie, plus this gives the series the intended rhythm formed by producer Kevin Feige.However, many fans have taken to watching the movies in chronological order. This might be a little convoluted, but that should not put you off: below is every piece of MCU viewing material mapped out in chronological order, including movies, Netflix shows, one-shots (those mini-films you will find in the DVD extras), and other TV shows. In brackets are the years the films officially take place in, as confirmed by Marvel studios. The best Amazon Prime and Netflix shows to watch while self-isolatingThe 31 most underrated TV shows to watch while self-isolatingHidden gems: The best Netflix originals you might have missedAgent Carter (seasons one and two)Ranking the Marvel Cinematic Universe filmsSummary: Where the Marvel Cinematic Universe all began. While Iron Man may have been the very first film released, the Second Word War-set Captain America comes first on the timeline. The rest plays mainly out in release order, minus Brie Larson’s Captain Marvel. Released as part of Phase Three, the film takes place in the mid-Nineties (when Nick Fury still had both eyes) and therefore lands in the Phase One chronology. All Hail the King (one-shot – Thor: The Dark World)Agents of Shield (season one: episodes 1 — 7)Agents of Shield (season one: episodes 8 — 16)Agents of Shield (season one: episodes 17 — 22)s of the Galaxy (2014)s of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2014)Agents of Shield (season two: episodes 1 — 19)Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)Agents of Shield (season two: episodes 20 — 22)Agents of Shield (season three: episodes 1 — 19)What went wrong for Netflix and Marvel?Summary: Phase Two also plays out almost exactly in release order, except s of the Galaxy Vol. 2, which comes directly after the first s (like Captain Marvel, the film was released in Phase Three but actually takes place before then). Also of note, one-shots were phased out during Phase Two as the Netflix shows and Agents of Shield were introduced. For those who do embark on watching Agents of Shield (the second and third seasons are great), you should definitely watch along with the movies as their cinematic counterparts have major effects on the show’s story.Agents of Shield (season three: episodes 20 — 22)Agents of Shield (season four: episodes 1 — 8)Agents of Shield: Slingshot (web series)Agents of Shield (season four: episodes 9 — 22)Agents of Shield (season five, episodes 1 — 19)Cloak and Dagger (season one)Cloak and Dagger (season two)Ant-Man and The Wasp (2017)Agents of Shield (season five, episodes 20 – 22)Summary: Made it this far? Well done, you’ve watched a whole lot of Marvel! Phase Three marks some of the best MCU movies so far, but also some timeline bending difficulties. For instance, Doctor Strange begins before Civil War, but finishes after Civil War, Slingshot features lots of flashbacks, and Agents of Shield season five features a lot of obscure time travelling.Created with Sketch.Marvel films – ranked worst to best Show all 23Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, Avengers Assemble still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all.  5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma.

Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, Avengers Assemble still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all.  5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.Also, the first Spider-Man film takes place directly after Civil War, while Ragnarok, Black Panther and Ant-Man and The Wasp lead directly into Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. There’s also the latter part of Shield that takes place concurrently with Infinity War. Above is just a guide for a manageable way of watching based mainly on release order.Congratulations. If you’ve watched all of the above, you’ve processed over nine days worth of Marvel movies and television. Nine days! And there’s still more to come, including: Black Widow, The Eternals, Doctor Strange 2, Shang-Chi and Black Panther 2. Oh, and the upcoming Disney streaming service shows, focussing on Loki, Scarlett Witch and Vision, Hawkeye, and the Falcon and Winter Soldier.You can find a full list here.Ant-Man and the Wasp\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These are some of the stories behind the statistics:Sharing the full story, not just the headlines‘I work so hard yet I can’t afford the basics’: The NHS worker with no support from the stateTheo Manugerwa was struggling before the coronavirus crisis began. The 47-year-old, who lives with her two daughters aged 12 and 10 in Leicester, has been working in the NHS for 11 years, but her immigration status means she has no recourse to public funds (NRPF) – meaning she cannot claim any form of state support. As a result, the single mother has always had to work overtime in order to afford rent and provide for her children.Since lockdown started, Theo has been unable to work the extra hours.Her children are still going to school as she is a key worker, but after-school clubs are no longer operating and the friends who used to look after them while she was at work are no longer able to, due to the lockdown.She says: “It has become very hard. Once I take off my rent, I’m left with nothing at all. It has always been difficult, from the day they gave me that NRPF condition, but at least I could get extra shifts here and there to put food on the table for my children.How to support our campaign“The money I’m making now is not enough to cater for the three of us. We are depending on charity. I’ve always been very proud. I didn’t want to give in and ask for help. The feeling when you walk into a food bank is very painful. I work so hard yet I can’t afford the basics.”Theo, a Ugandan national who moved to the UK 20 years ago, is due to apply for her next visa extension next month, at a cost of more than £2,000, and she says the thought of it makes her feel sick. The Home Office told The Independent it would help Theo apply to get access to benefits under measures introduced to tackle the pandemic. But for now, she has also fallen into rent arrears, and fears she is going to generate serious debt. “I just need some support. I have no support at all. You get tired of depending on people. You don’t want to keep telling people your problems. I feel undervalued as a health worker during this time.“I feel abandoned. I’ve always worked hard to provide for my children, but it makes me feel like I’ve let them down.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Both financially and mentally,” says Sian Abbott. The 28-year-old’s family of seven started using food banks about a year ago when her husband lost his job as a poultry farmer – and she says things have become even more difficult during the Covid-19 crisis.Sian, who lives in Pembrokeshire and has five children, aged between 10 and three, says: “Three weeks into the pandemic I had a breakdown. We ran out of food because the food bank people couldn’t get to us. I ended up reaching out to my church and they sent us an emergency supply package.“It’s stressful, especially with the school closures. At least when the kids were in school they were able to get a meal. My husband and I go without meals sometimes so the children can eat.”Sian, who previously worked as a taxi controller and a carer but had to stop working to look after her autistic son, says she has noticed a lot more people who didn’t previously use food banks are now turning to them, but worries that the supply isn’t there.“In the supermarkets there used to be trolleys full of donations, but now there’s barely one. Prices are higher. The cost of nappies have nearly doubled, which is really difficult for us,” she adds.“It’s funny because when we first heard about food banks six years ago we were donating to them – usually around £50 or £60 a week – but now we’re having to rely on them ourselves.”Zoe Green and her husband David are “really struggling financially” for the very first time. The couple and their four children – aged from two to 11 – now depend on a weekly parcel from a food bank based at their local school in north London, a project supplied with fresh produce by The Felix Project charity.Ms Green, a 36-year-old freelancer who worked in TV and documentary production, hasn’t been able to find any work over the past few months. She received less than £1,000 pounds for a three-month period after applying for the government’s self-employment income support scheme.Although 39-year-old Mr Green still gets around £400 a month while on furlough from his part-time retail job, the couple have found they have a shortfall of around £300 a month for household bills. This is being met by The Film and TV Charity, but the couple do not know how long the emergency stipend will last.“It’s not been an easy time – we’ve never known food poverty until the coronavirus hit,” she said. “When we got the first food package from The Felix Project, I was literally crying as I took out all the fresh food. The work they and the other charities are doing right now is really, really appreciated. I never thought we’d need it.”“I’m really hoping the government will extend the self-employment scheme. I’m also hoping they might factor out the periods I was on maternity leave and wasn’t able to earn as much, so I can get a higher average amount.”‘Food banks have been a godsend’: Self-employed mother who isn’t eligible for government support Susan, 45, said she found herself in financial difficulty in the months before the pandemic after her fledging health drink business collapsed.The children going hungry during the coronavirus pandemicFood bank demand soars as newly unemployed wait weeks for benefitsAlthough she set herself up as a private education tutor in February 2020, she found she wasn’t eligible to apply for the government’s self-employment income support scheme after lockdown began.“I struggled to be able to buy food during the lockdown, as I’d lost income and also fell through the government net,” said the west Londoner. “It made a difficult situation even more difficult.”She and her two children, aged 10 and 12, are now relying on a weekly food bank set up at the Bollo Brook Youth Centre on her south Acton estate. “The children being at home is tough to manage. It’s stressful trying to keep up with it all and help with their school work whilst worrying about bills,” she said.“We’ve been fortunate and receive help with food that we would not have been able to buy. It’s been godsend to get us through this time until we can rebuild our lives back to normal.”‘It’s a battle to keep going’: Food bank manager whose demand is up tenfoldOriginally set up to provide support for single fathers, the Dads House charity now runs food banks for anyone in financial need at two sites in west and south London.Founder Billy McGranaghan said he and his volunteers saw between 30 and 50 people looking for help each day before the pandemic, but in the past couple of months demand for food parcels has shot up tenfold to between 300 and 500 people a day.“It’s heartbreaking to see the long queues,” he said. “The volume is something we’ve never seen before. It’s poverty like you’ve never seen. People tell us they’ve got £20 or £30 to get through the week. Some are telling us they’re having to sell possessions or borrow money from loan sharks.”Mr McGranaghan added: “Some people had been in very casual work before the crisis – bar staff, nannies, cleaners. So there’s no furloughing going on to help them. But in many cases they’re not necessarily self-employed either – they were dependant on that weekly wage. So they’re not eligible for the government self-employed scheme.”The food bank founder said many people were applying for universal credit, but they are forced to face at least five weeks before any money appears in their bank account.“I’m just hoping some people are able to get back into work when the shops re-open in a couple of weeks,” he said. “But at the moment it’s a battle for people to keep going.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis.

Figures from the Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) show a 175 per cent rise, with both charities reporting this their “busiest period ever”. Furthermore, a survey by the giving platform Neighbourly of 900 charities and community groups providing food to the vulnerable found that 70 per cent expect the situation to get even worse in the next six to 12 months.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent proprietor Evgeny Lebedev paid special tribute to the almost 6,000 ordinary iniduals who have dug deep to contribute to our appeal. He said: “Time and time again Londoners have shown that they are capable of immense generosity and community spirit in this period of crisis.“To all those that donated, bought and bid — I salute you.”Morgan Stanley said the bank and its employees in London had made the donation as part of their global Covid-19 response.How to support our campaignClare Woodman, head of Morgan Stanley EMEA, said: “The Felix Project plays a vital role in distributing food to people in need, especially those severely impacted by the pandemic. I am proud our employees in London are supporting them as part of our Covid-19 Hunger Relief Campaign.”Another substantial donor was Partners Capital investment group, which donated £95,287.John Collis, head of Partners Capital, Europe, said they “selected The Felix Project as one of our charities to support during this difficult period as it is one of the most impactful charities in London today”.Heads down for quiz nightThe original Top Gear trio — Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May — will tonight host a special Zoom quiz in aid of our appeal partner, The Felix Project. Participants in the Quintessentially Foundation’s “World’s Greatest Quiz Night” will face five rounds of questions devised by Nicholas Shearing, questions producer for top British TV quiz shows Pointless, Debatable and Impossible. May, who has driven Felix vans delivering food to vulnerable Londoners throughout lockdown, said: “At least in this stay-at-home pub quiz version, it will be easy to cheat.” 7.30-9pm. Tickets £10: thefelixproject.orggreatestquizOur appeal was also boosted by the silent auction, in partnership with Quintessentially Foundation, which closed this week with 135 bids placed for 36 lots and raising almost £40,000.The most highly prized lots were two tickets to a Liverpool FC game, four tickets to the Euro 2021 semi-finals, a video-chat with Spurs coach Jose Mourinho, a private guitar lesson with singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding and a helicopter lesson.The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

After paying rent and all her bills from the universal credit she receives at the beginning of the month, she now finds she has just £4.30 left over for food and nappies for the rest of the month.How to support our campaignSo she is almost entirely dependent on school vouchers available for her oldest two children (£15 per child per week) to buy absolute essentials, and one weekly food package dropped off by the Sufra food bank.“I don’t mind going hungry sometimes, so long as my kids have food,” said Ms Sarri-Gonzalez. “Sometimes I might have just one main meal for myself in a day. There was one point during lockdown I didn’t manage to eat anything for myself for two days, almost three days. But I always set the table for the children – I keep things as normal as possible for them.”“It’s so difficult at the moment. So stressful. I’m hoping when the kids go back to school later in the year I can go back to work and make things easier somehow.”The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project has quadrupled the volume of surplus food it gets out to people in need since the crisis began.The work remains as urgent than ever. The most recent YouGov poll for the Food Foundation charity shows over 1.5 million people in households with children have been unable to access food for economic reasons during the lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Watching parents struggle to put food on the table and go without food themselves is devastating.”Rebecca Archer and her partner – who have three girls aged eight, six and three at home in London’s High Barnet – have found it difficult to afford enough food during lockdown. “The shopping I do is costing a lot more with them at home all the time,” she said.Once the bills are paid and the main weekly shop is done on a Monday, the couple finds they have about £50 left to get through the week – about half the amount they usually had before the pandemic hit.The family has recently taken advantage of two £15-a-week school vouchers they get for their two oldest girls, and receive some cooked meals from their neighbour Katie-Louise Barber – a volunteer delivering food using The Felix Project’s supplies.“It’s been a real strain. Thinking and worrying about money all the time isn’t easy,” said Ms Archer. “I never thought I’d be worrying about having enough for the children to eat. There was one point we just didn’t have enough for the pre-paid gas meter, so we had to go without that for more than a week.”The Trussell Trust, which runs the country’s biggest network of food banks, has warned food charities cannot cope “indefinitely” with the huge spike in demand for help caused by the pandemic.A coalition of anti-poverty charities had written to the chancellor asking for an emergency income support scheme that would increase child benefits and end the five-week wait for initial universal credit payments.Anthony Cotterill, leader of the Salvation Army in the UK, warned: “It’s years since we have seen poverty to be such a real and present danger for so many people. We are approaching a poverty tipping point.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis. Find out how you can help here.

Everyone is very grateful,’ says a volunteer who also uses service when his own illness means he is unable to pitch inFormer music manager John McIntyre was unsure how he would cope when lockdown began.“I was very scared,” said the 75-year-old who has a respiratory condition and lives alone in a one-bedroom flat in Dalston. “If I caught Covid, I wouldn’t be able to get enough oxygen to the heart. I just had to follow the advice and be safe.” Mr McIntyre, who used to manage the jazz reggae band The Beatroots, has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema.He has relied for his daily meal from local charity Made In Hackney which is supplied by our Help the Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project. Mr McIntyre is one of more than two million people who are classified as “extremely vulnerable” because they have compromised immune systems. For the last 10 weeks, many of them have struggled to get access to food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSince March, volunteers from the River House Trust charity have been dropping off Felix produce to people living with HIV. One such volunteer is former actor Stephen Hart who was diagnosed in 2006. When he is too ill to leave the house, he also uses the food delivery service.Despite being high-risk and a life-long diabetic, Mr Hart has been helping to get food to those more vulnerable than him. He has been unable to work since his health deteriorated two years ago, but Mr Hart, who lives alone in south London, said he wanted to help others.How to support our campaign“When I feel well enough, I pick up boxes from River House and drop them off for people who need them,” he said. “I do it when I can but some days are bad days.”Mr Hart said his condition means sometimes he can’t get out of bed. He occasionally receives a Felix box for himself so he knows he has food when he is too sick to move. “It is reassuring to have food in the house,” he said. “Felix has been a lifeline.”Although the British HIV Association said there “remains no evidence” that people with HIV are at greater risk of Covid-19 infection, those with a low CD4 count – the white blood cells affected by HIV – have been advised to shield.Mr Hart said members of the HIV community have been “nervous” since the outbreak. “There isn’t much specific advice so the community has been trying to look after each other.”A 62-year-old living with HIV for 37 years, who asked not to be named, described how his parcels have helped him. He said: “I pick up the boxes as I don’t have energy to go shopping. They’ve been great.”Mr Hart said it was extremely moving to see the response to his deliveries: “It is amazing. Everyone is very grateful.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial. Our role as leaders is to keep that going, carry on putting emotional needs at the heart of everything we do, because then children are able to learn and benefit – and move through this crisis.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.All 5.7 million inhabitants of Singapore could be issued with a wearable contact-tracing device under new plans to combat coronavirus.The gadget can be worn on a lanyard or carried loose. It is designed to bypass glitches in an earlier smartphone-based system that used Bluetooth and had limited uptake – difficulties also experienced by other governments including the UK.Singapore has one of the highest coronavirus caseloads in Asia and is one of many countries trying find a technological solution that will allow it to ease restrictions on activity. The government did not specify whether carrying the device will be mandatory if it is distributed to the whole population.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“We are developing and will soon roll out a portable wearable device that will not depend on possession of a smartphone,” Vivian Balakrishnan, the minister in charge of the city-state’s smart nation initiative said on Friday.“If this portable device works, we may then distribute it to everyone in Singapore.”Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?The government’s earlier TraceTogether app was downloaded by about 1.5 million people, but hit snags especially on Apple devices whose operating systems suspend Bluetooth scanning when the app runs in the background.“We’ve had repeated discussions both at the technical and policy level with Apple, but we have not yet been able to find a satisfactory solution,” Mr Balakrishnan said.The pivot to wearables suggests Singapore, like Britain, has no immediate plans to adopt contact-tracing tech that Apple and Google rolled out last month, which has several restrictions designed to protect users’ privacy.Singapore has not provided details on the technology that will be used in the new wearable devices. However, analysts believe it may face similar challenges to its predecessor.“The government would likely have to mandate the use of such a device for the system to be effective, which is something that few countries have done so far,” said Frederic Giron, a Singapore-based analyst from market research company Forrester.Many experts have raised privacy concerns about contact tracing devices. Singapore has said data collected though its earlier app is encrypted and stored locally in the user’s phone, and will only be transferred to authorities if the inidual is confirmed to be infected with Covid-19.Singapore has about 37,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 24 people there have died with the disease, according to Johns Hopkins University.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

As long as you all abide by the strict social distancing rule laid out by the government.Before you start packing up your picnic baskets there does seem to be a slight roadblock.The National Trust, for example, has closed all its car parks as well as its parks and gardens, so until these types of restrictions change - people will have to wait a little longer before they are able to enjoy the nations new freedoms in full.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Alongside this, work is ongoing to understand how and when zoos and aquariums may be able to reopen in a safe way to the public whilst maintaining social distancing.”Following pressure from BIAZA, a debate on the reopening of zoos and aquariums is now set to take place in parliament on June .While the lockdown in the UK is being lowered in dferent phases, theme parks may be the last to open.Guidelines released by the government said: You will still not be able to use areas like playgrounds, outdoor gyms or ticketed outdoor leisure venues, where there is a higher risk of close contact and touching surfaces.Thorpe Park, Alton Towers and Drayton Manor have all remained closed for the season, with no estimated dates of when to reopen.Richard Mancey, who chairs the British Association of Leisure Parks, Piers and Attractions told the  that parks need to open by July and August or face problems reopening at all.He said: If we don’t get open by the summer season, a lot will be in serious trouble, even the big parks, who have more cash reserves.”It remains unclear when theme parks such as Thorpe Park or Alton Towers will open their doors again.In an update on Thorpe Parks website earlier this month, they gave no hints at reopening, writing: We are in contact with the Government and relevant authorities and will work to reopen the Resort to guests as soon as it’s appropriate to do so.Those who have purchased tickets for either Thorpe Park or Alton Towers have been told they will be valid for the remainder of the  season.Social distancing guidelines are likely to remain in some form until the virus signicantly fades.In the UK, this means staying at least two metres apart from people outside your household and avoiding physical contact.It is expected this will be enforced by staff in zoos and aquariums, in a similar way to how shops and supermarkets are supervised.Drastic changes may include having to leave the middle seat empty on rides and lowering capacity on rollercoasters and other rides.Elsewhere in Europe, other countries are beginning to reopen zoos and other leisure attractions.Austrias tourism minister Elisabeth Köstinger has revealed that hotels will be able to reopen on May , with zoos and swimming pools allowed to open from the same date.Belgium too have already reopened zoos, museums and other public spaces following Prime Minister Sophie Wilmés easing of restrictions last week.But in Belgium, zoos are forced to operate a one-way system and online ticketing with time slots - similar measures would probably be expected in the UK.Switzerland will also be reopening zoos on June .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Young children, the disabled and those with breathing dficulties will be exempt.So far, face masks on public transport have been only a suggestion.But The Sun reported in April the growing consensus on their effectiveness in helping to reduce the virus’s spread.And with more and more data suggesting the same, ministers are keen to enforce widespread use, especially with the numbers of businesses and schools reopening set to rise.At Thursdays Downing Street briefing, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said people in England will be “required to wear face coverings” on public transport both to ­protect themselves and others from mid-June.He said: “Face coverings will become mandatory on public transport.“That doesn’t mean surgical masks, which we must keep for clinical settings.It means the kind of face covering you can ­easily make at home.“We are doing what many other countries have asked transport users to do.We need to ensure every precaution is taken on buses, trains, aircraft and on ferries with more people using transport.“The evidence suggests wearing face coverings offers some protection against the spread of the virus.This will mean that you can be refused travel. If you don’t comply, you can be fined.“Alongside transport operators, this will be enforced by the British Transport Policenecessary.You cannot travel unless you wear a face covering. There will also be other powers, ultimately it could lead to fines.”It comes as:Masking the mouth and nose reduces the risk of asymptomatic carriers — who are infected but showing no symptoms — from passing on the bug.Private hire taxis and minicabs are also included in the ­measures.But the rules do not cover bus stops, railway stations and other terminals.Sir Peter Hendy, chairman of Network Rail, said: “We are expecting staff to wear face ­coverings themselves.This is about peoplebeing sensible.I’m not expecting a huge upsurge in railway staff having to police this.”A study for the World Health Organization this week found using a face mask cuts the risk of catching Covid by four-fths.Experts say universal uptake could help Brits safely “resume normal activities” and “protect people in crowded settings”.Linda Bauld, Professor of Public Health at Edinburgh University, called it a “sensible step” that could reassure commuters.Meanwhile, a study claims Brits could hug family and friends without risking a second peakeveryone stayed two metres from strangers.Researchers from the University of Oxford say existing social distancing rules are unnecessarily strict and are damaging the nation’s health and economy.They say it is possible to loosen the guidelines while still keeping coronavirus under control.The study recommends creating social bubbles or small groups of contacts who could be treated asthey lived in the same household and not have to stick to the two-metre rule. To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He and I worked together in The Hague on the prosecution of the Serb Generals Mladic and Krstic over the Srebrenica massacre in .They were both duly convicted and imprisoned with long sentences – that was justice properly applied, not the ludicrous allegations of struck off lawyer, Phil Shiner, or the mendacious work of the grotesquely expensive Iraq Historic Allegations Team.Well done to Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon for stopping IHAT in  and now to the present Defence Secretary, Ben Wallace, for finally killing off that most damaging process.Why would any sensible young person think of putting on the Queen’s unormthey thought they could be tapped on the shoulder years after an operation and questioned over  allegations No one is above the Law, soldiers included, but their employer, the Ministry of Defence, must exercise its duty of care to its people responsibly and never again allow wholesale unfounded allegations to be made.And so, to the Troubles in Northern Ireland around which the spectre of a knock on the door by police asking questions about incidents  or  years ago still lingers on for former British soldiers.Ex-Household Cavalry soldier, Dennis Hutchings, is standing trial for attempted murder in the High Court in connection with the killing of a civilian in Northern Ireland in .I have a copy of the letter from the Army Legal Services at the time informing him that, following a police investigation, the Director of Public Prosecutions had “directed that there is to be no prosecution of any military personnel” arising from this tragic event.Yet today, with no new evidence being presented against Dennis Hutchings, this -year-old veteran with end-stage renal failure must listen in by video-link while a single judge decides his case.When Dennis said the other day: “To say that I’m disappointed in our legal system would be choosing my words carefully”. That is a very polite understatement by a most loyal ex-soldier. Where, on the other hand, is the Government’s loyalty to him Dennis Hutching’s case clearly illustrates the disproportionate attention being paid to soldiers and former soldiers arising from their service in Northern Ireland. During the Troubles, around , people were killed in the Province and very many more injured.Reliable statistics show that % of the deaths were caused by terrorists .Less than  per cent of those who were killed between  and  were at the hands of the police and the military and of these, with a handful of exceptions, all were found to be lawful.There is no getting away from the fact that the vast majority of soldiers in Northern Ireland got up in the morning with a clear aim to abide by the Law and fulfil their duties with integrity.Terrorists, on the other hand, got up in the morning with the clear aim to kill and to maim, for purely political purposes.So, what is to be done  Accepting that no one is above the Law and that where credible allegations, backed by evidence, are made against anyone, then charges must be laid, a case heard in court and a proper finding reached.This applies to soldiers and to civilians alike. And there are still unexplained deaths in Northern Ireland. But for investigations to focus unduly on former soldiers is grossly unfair. The British Army kept detailed records of who was where, doing what on a given date.None of the paramilitaries, the IRA nor the UVF or UDA, kept such records, so starting with inquiries first to soldiers, while logical to the police mind, is thoroughly unreasonable and very worrying,done in the wrong way with an unexpected knock on the door.It is for that reason that the former Attorney General, Geoffrey Cox MP, proposed that such questioning should be on the presumption not to prosecute. In this way soldiers can be invited to provide information but without the fear that they will incriminate themselves or their comrades.Families of the bereaved have the right to know what happened to their loved ones but not at the expense of stress and worry to  and -year-old former soldiers. That offends natural justice and must stop.On my last morning as Chief of the General Staff on th August , two investigators presented themselves in my office in the Ministry of Defence to ask about a death in Belfast in . This was nothing more than a fishing trip and quite unacceptable.In the United Kingdom, we are justiably proud of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines. They take risks on the front line to protect our national interests and citizens at home and abroad.They are trained to follow core values of selfless commitment, courage, discipline, integrity, loyalty and respect for others. They go about their duties with these values very much in mind.They deserve the respect of the country and the support of the elected Government of the day whose operations they conduct on behalf of the people. They do not deserve to be accused and harassed years later.I am delighted that the appalling IHAT is now itself part of history, so too must be the witch hunt of former soldiers who did their duty in Northern Ireland.

The shining light in all of the darkness has been their twins Sean and Amelie, who are now almost  years old.They were just babies when Madeleine went missing, and although she hasn’t been in their lives for the past  years, they have had to grow up in their big sister’s shadow.Kate and Gerry are fiercely protective of the pair, and have tried to shield them from the outside world, especially the fetid online swamp of vindictive attention-seekers and conspiracy theorists.It can’t be easy trying to allow them to lead a normal le, while wanting to wrap them both in cotton wool and keep them safe.Any time I have offered this poor, bereft couple support, I experience a tiny pinprick of the kind of horric agony they have to endure.All I have to do is spend a few hours muting the vile trolls so they are effectively ranting in an empty room.Kate and Gerry are engulfed by a tsunami of prejudice and hatred every time Madeleine is back in the news.It’s already started up again.The next few days, weeks and months will open a lot of old wounds for Madeleine’s parents.They will have to relive the very bleakest times of their lives, and their hearts will be broken in pieces all over again.We all wanted Madeleine to be found alive, and for the family to have the chance to heal together.Realistically that’s not going to happen.But I hope to God they will finally find out what happened to their little girl and at least be able to mourn her.And then, somehow, try to get on with the rest of their lives.WHAT on earth was going through the head of racist cop Derek Chauvin as he snuffed the le out of George Floyd He must have realised the poor man couldn’t breathe and was close to death.Chauvin was also fully aware his actions were being filmed on a number of mobile phones, but he continued to forcibly put pressure on Mr Floyd’s neck and throat.Chauvin, who has been charged with second degree murder, displayed the most supreme arrogance.We can only surmise he feels himself to be above the law.I couldn’t watch the footage of a man dying before my eyes and I absolutely understand the despair and anger in the US, from everyone sick to their stomachs.Those who cry that Mr Floyd was a criminal are missing the point.Black men in the US are ASSUMED to be law breakers.They are stopped and searchedthey drive a half-decent car, and treated like dirt.They have to prove to cops they have nothing to hide while young white boys are not subjected to such prejudice.And it’s not all that much better on this side of the Atlantic.I absolutely understand the despair and anger following Mr Floyd’s death, and although I can sympathise, as a white person I can’t begin to understand what it’s really like because I don’t live with racism every day of my le.I completely respect people’s right to demonstrate and their heartfelt need to express solidarity with Mr Floyd and his family and to draw a line in the sand.At the same time I was deeply worried by the mass gatherings of people right in the middle of this pandemic, and concerned for their safety. You simply cannot have protests while observing social distancing.People were angry and upset and trying to comfort each other with embraces and hugs.There were confrontations with authorities – with police and protesters standing eyeball to eyeball.In London we saw isolated incidents of violence but most of the protesters were peaceful.They were, however, just too close to one another.And it would be an enormous tragedywe were to see a spike or second wave of coronavirus because of the heinous actions of one US cop.I really hope the killing of George Floyd is a turning point and there is some sort of common ground where people, regardless of their colour, start talking to each other to achieve a greater understanding.While we have a sour, embittered man in the White House who is using Mr Floyd’s death as a way to ide the nation and to further his bid for re-election, I seriously doubt any progress will be made, but we all need to try.I AM a huge admirer of Kate Middleton, who has the future of the Royal Family on her slender shoulders.She is never going to be a charismatic force of nature. But I don’t think that’s a bad thing – and not what we really want from our royals in any case.Kate is kind, hardworking, elegant and classy.  She takes her duties seriously and tries to help her chosen charities with an admirably hands-on approach.She is a loving mum, sweet-natured, reliable and loyal.This has led to some people accusing her of being rather dull.And she has been the subject of a snarky article in Tatler magazine, which claimed she has felt exhausted and trapped in the Royal Family ever since Harry and Meghan decide to run for the Hollywood hills.Kate is also dismissed as having “an aura of blandness” and accused of having acquired a much posher accent over the years.Kate was so incensed by this article she has taken legal action against the posh publication, claiming a string of inaccuracies – including a pre-wedding spat with her sister-in-law just before Meghan’s wedding to Harry.Incredibly, Tatler claims the pair fell out over whether Kate’s daughter Princess Charlotte should wear tights or not on the big day.It has all proved too much for Kate.She wants the world to realise she is not some sort of magnolia blancmange and to prove she is no pushover by demanding the offending article be removed.Kate might be quiet but she is also grimly determined.I suspect copies of Tatler will be airbrushed from all royal residences forthwith, never to darken their gilded coffee tables again.BIG congrats to the cast and crew of Holby City, who are up for a well-deserved Bafta in the Best Soap  Continuing Drama category.Much like late, lamented police drama The Bill, Holby has been shamefully overlooked and underrated when it comes to awards and recognition.The cast – in particular Rosie Marcel, as Jac Naylor, Bob Barrett as Sacha Levy and Kaye Wragg as Essie di Lucca – consistently put in cracking performances and the whole show just quietly gets on with knocking it out of the park week after week.I’d dearly love to see them taking home a Bafta,only to flag to BBC bosses what a gem of a show they have on their hands.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

All the other drivers on the motorway could see it too. But the Tesla, bombing along at around mph, with its self-drive autopilot system engaged, did NOT see it.It even went straight past the driver of the overturned truck who was at the side of the road, a good distance from the crash site, frantically warning oncoming motorists to slow down. And then came the impact.Luckily, no one was hurt. But the accident does serve as a useful reminder about technology. It can make le fun and it can make le convenient. But we’ve not yet reached a point where we can rely on it to behave itself. Take the wi in your house.The box sits in a cupboard, I should imagine, where there’s no wind or rain or weather of any kind. It is never bashed or dropped. And yet somehow, once a fortnight, it will suddenly stop working. There is no reason for this.In my London flat, the windows also serve as radiators. They are designed to come on in October and go off again in April.But every year, they get it the wrong way round and no one is able to stop them doing this, boiling me in the summer and sitting there in the winter while I slowly die of hypothermia.My laptop is no better. The last one became critically ill recently, so before it died completely, all of its information was transferred on to the model I’m using now.And that, about once a day, decides to freeze. Control-Alt-Delete  Forget it. It becomes as receptive as a brick. We have all experienced these things. And we have to believe the owner of that Tesla in Taiwan has as well.Yet he engaged the car’s self-drive system and sat back, assuming it would be able to see a crashed van directly ahead. Had he not researched the car at all  I know Tesla says its autonomous system is nine times safer than a human. But a quick Google search would suggest that sometimes, like all technology, it isn’t safe at all.I actually quite like Tesla’s current range of cars. I think they are interesting and fun and I can see why, in lockdown, the Model  was the best-selling car in Britain. But I have a word of warning for anyone tempted to buy one and engage its autopilot: Don’t.Think of it as the tool you get on a Swiss Army kne that can be used for getting stones out of a horse’s hoof. It’s a talking point . . . but you’d never actually use it.IT has been the biggest police manhunt in history. But now, after a multimillion-pound, -year search across  countries, there appears to be a genuine breakthrough in the search for Madeleine McCann.That’s great. But what staggers me is that the new chief suspect Christian B was living just a few miles from the Portuguese resort where she was last seen. His phone puts him in the resort itself on the night of the abduction.He was even interviewed by Plod back in . And it’s not like he was a model citizen. Described as a burglar and a drug dealer, it’s known he was also a paedophile. He’s even doing time in Germany right now for child sex offences. And yet somehow he was never arrested.It makes me wonder. Will they find Lord Lucan living next door to the house from which he fled in  And will it turn out that “Mr Herring” who rides around Fulham every day on a horse called Shiregar is actually the mysterious Mr Kipper who is said to have abducted Suzy Lamplugh back in  THE Hungarian justice minister Judit Varga responded angrily this week to claims her country had become a dictatorship.I’m not sure what she said, though.

She does to me what our Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, does for the girls.“I don’t care what you’re saying just so long as you keep on saying it.”At a rough guess, I’d say  per cent of everything on the internet is wrong.WHEN London was brought to its knees by a plague in the th century, a young man called Isaac Newton fled to the countryside and while in quarantine, came up with a cure.Recently unearthed papers show how he figured out the Black Death could be beaten with a medicine made from a powdered toad and some of its vomit.After it turned out this didn’t work, he went for a sit down in an orchard, where he saw an apple fall from a tree . . .THE the last-ever .-litre Bentley V rolled off the production line this week.

around the world came forward in support and plans were all in place in March.“We’re not easily put down and were determined to continue, against all the odds.”By good fortune we were able to build our fabulous display in what for the past year has been The Sun Gardening’s Golden Jubilee Garden in the Floral Fantasia area.Peter says: “What I can promise visitors in the next few weeks are fabulous fragrances from ft high sweet peas and banks of sweetly perfumed garden pinks alongside groups of strongly scented roses.”Hyde Hall was among the many great gardens that have just opened to the public after being closed by coronavirus.Remarkably, visitor numbers were three times higher than the same period last year.Here, Peter has picked his top of the plots to visit, with safe distancing in mind.Be sure to check online which gardens are open and which have ticket-only entry and timed visits.THE home of late gardening expert Christopher Lloyd is a mecca for gardeners around the world.They visit to see its clipped topiary, the long border and wild flower meadow.The steady innovation in plant combinations here set the fashion in gardening for years and is now continued in the hands of head gardener Fergus Garrett.I make a point of always checking out the arrangement of pot- and container-grown flowering plants around the front door.If you have no more than a square metre or two around your front door you will get inspiration here.IT has one of the longest streamside plantings of candelabra primulas in the country – a beauty to behold in early summer.The Alpine

enjoy flower arranging.INCLUDES the Queen Mother’s Rose Garden, which features modern cultis, and the shrub rose garden, which is packed with old traditional ieties.I really love the fruit and vegetable garden, which is surrounded by wooded countryside, where those having a go at growing some of their own for the first time will find plenty of interest.You will need time to explore all the meandering paths and find the Hot Garden, one of two colour-themed plantings.The other, Cool Garden, has paler shades.ITS  acres of gardens include the late Alan Bloom’s Dell Garden and Foggy Bottom, designed, planted and tended by his son Adrian.This is a plant lover’s heaven, with masses of summer-flowering herbaceous perennial flowers, many bred and raised at Bressingham, near the market town of Diss.Don’t miss Adrian’s Wood, with the ft redwoods he planted in , and take a notebook to record good planting arrangements in Alan’s Island Beds and a camera to record the beautul flint

beech hedge and long herbaceous border here, not to mention the palm house.The Royal Botanic staff also look after three other signicant Scottish gardens – Benmore in Argyll, Logan, near Stranraer, and Dawyck in Peebles.Dawyck is worth a visit just for the blue poppies – meconopsis – plus the bluebells and ferns along the tumbling burn, as well as the azalea terrace, which is just about to bloom.ITS five terraces spread out over  acres looking across the Conwy Valley to the Carneddau Mountains of Snowdonia.Every terrace is beautully landscaped, one with a lily pond and others with

Prigozhin has denied any such links.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But until now it was not known how many ended up actually getting a payment.Now official figures show % of them - around , - have not received a Universal Credit payment, as of June . Of those, around half had an award of £ in their first month due to their earnings being deemed too high. The other half were either deemed ineligible for Universal Credit or withdrew their claim. Labour MPs branded the figures “not good enough” - but a Tory minister branded the criticism a “feeble attempt to denigrate Universal Credit.” DWP officials insisted large numbers of those people will have joined other government support packages like the furlough scheme. Others would have received redundancy pay or their final month’s salary, meaning they earned too much to qualy for UC. Ministers added the % of applicants getting a payment was actually higher than the % in January and February. But Labour MP Neil Coyle, who obtained the figures, said they showed “ministers are letting people down just when they need help most.”  He said some of those rejected would have applied for an advance, only to find they did not receive a UC payment to repay it from.He also pointed out there were no clear figures on how many might have fallen through cracks in the system. “Universal Credit has been failing for seven years but the Government has finally been forced to admit it has been of no use at all to hundreds of thousands of people,” he said. “Universal Credit is an appalling, inhumane system and well overdue reform.” Some of those who received £ in the first month could still receive UC in future months,their earnings go down. But Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: We believe the five-week wait is too long to wait to receive support.“If a family has been awarded nothing for the first month then they could wait as long as nine weeks before receiving anything at all. It is not good enough. Overall a record .million households have applied for Universal Credit benefit between March  and May . But until now ministers had not made clear how many of those people did not end up getting a UC payment. Ministers confirmed the figures in a written question in Parliament, which took more than a month to answer.  It said between March  and March  there were , declarations made and processed to Universal Credit. Of those, % have received a UC payment, % had a “nil award due to earnings”, and % were either closed due to ineligibility or withdrawn. Less than % are still waiting for details to be veried. We asked the DWP for comment on its own figures. Minister for Welfare Delivery Will Quince replied: “This is yet another feeble attempt to denigrate Universal Credit.

But they are not the only casualties in the war against corona. Another is the truth. It takes some gall for Boris Johnson and his ministers to boast how well they are handling this crisis when the figures and daily revelations of cackhanded planning say otherwise. The highest official death toll in Europe, and an estimated , in care homes. Fewer tests proportionately than Belgium, Russia, Portugal and Spain. More than two million jobs lost with no indication from the PM of how he will stop that doubling. Locking down too late and easing it too early. No coherent proposal to get schools fully up and running. Reduced classes mean they are already at  per cent capacity. And without a plan for schools, there can be none for parents to get back to work. The British people now know that when Mr Johnson blusters that he has a world-beating this or a globe-leading that, nothing could be further from the truth. When a carefully considered programme for recovery is most needed, policy is made on the hoof. Health Secretary Matt Hancock failed to tell NHS staff they would need to wear surgical masks before announcing it. Today we compile the full charge sheet against the Prime Minister. And to that we should add the one of perjury for all the lies he has told. No government can be expected to get everything right when faced with an unexpected and unprecedented pandemic. But the governments of other countries clearly got more right than our own. Their lower death figures prove it. Boris Johnson failed us when the World Health Organisation said we must test, test, test. The least we deserved from him was truth, truth, truth. An admission that he was wrong is what is needed now. A little humility would not go amiss. Becausewe are to defeat this dreadful disease, we must have confidence in our leaders so we can do it together. The British lion needs its strength more than ever. It should not be led by donkeys. Bias must end Black Lives Matter. That should go without saying, of course. Yet it is an indictment of our society that it still needs to be said by protesters in Britain and all over the world following George Floyd’s death. Even in this country, police are more than twice as likely to have used force in deaths involving those from BAME groups.

And ­together they discovered the meaning of love. Oliver Hodkingson and Melody Torres are now happily married after connecting as teenagers on an app that helps you pick up a ­foreign language.  He said: “For some reason we just clicked.” After finishing school in , Oliver, now  decided to learn a new language online. Meanwhile , miles away in Central America, Spanish speaker Melody, now , was hoping to pick up some English. The two connected for a video call one-on-one. And the lessons started to get more and more interesting. Melody said: “I’d ­always loved languages and was teaching primary school children English so ­wanted to practise.  “Then I saw Oliver asking to speak Spanish with me. I was like, ‘Oh well, he’s nice to look at, think I fancy ­speaking with him.’ But his Spanish was awful, so it was dficult to communicate.” On seeing her face, Oliver, who was then ­working as a ­part-time barista, was ­determined to impress her.He said: “I tried to show off. I knew the Spanish for colours and months of the year butI couldn’t hold a conversation.”As well as using the app Busuu, which lets you connect to native speakers around the world, the pair exchanged voice notes in English and Spanish. With a seven-hour time dference, Oliver would stay awake until the early hours to speak to her. After months of exchanges, Melody, who also speaks Italian, ­realised she was falling for him too. She said: “I really liked him but it just felt like a hopeless dream because he was so far away.” Eventually she ­confessed her true feelings in a recorded ­message, this time in Italian, for him to translate. But Oliver mistook it for Spanish and was too embarrassed to admit he did not ­understand it.  He recalled: “I just assumed my Spanish wasn’t good enough and did not want to tell her I had no idea what she’d said.” But soon ­afterwards he plucked up the courage to phone and tell her he loved her. Still only , without a serious girlfriend to date and never ­having met her, he insisted she was The One. And the following year, he landed a one-month job in Guatemala teaching English, so he could meet Melody in the flesh. Oliver said: “I’m not the type to just jet off to the other side of the world, but that’s exactly what I did.” And he admits that, while his parents love Melody now, they were left speechless at the time. Oliver, who today is a Spanish teacher, said: “When I first told Mum and Dad I was flying out to Guatemala to meet Melody they thought I was crazy. “I was so adamant it would work I just told them, ‘You wait and see.’ “And I was right.” It really was love at first sight when the ­couple finally met at Guatemala airport. “She was perfect,” Oliver said. Melody added: “I was overcome with nerves but he was so handsome. “I knew he was the one. I had ­butterflies because I was in love.” But Melody had kept Oliver a secret from her strict Christian family. She said: “I couldn’t tell them because I wasn’t allowed to have a boyfriend ­unless we were getting married.” So when her parents finally met Oliver, using schoolboy Spanish, he made the best impression possible.

With hundreds still dying every week we are now moving slowly towards lting the lockdown that was imposed on the country back in March. But as Britain gets moving again it seem one area of the country almost entirely escaped the disease. With just  confirmed cases to date, and seven deaths, it seems that in the coastal council area of Ceredigion in Wales, the virus never really took hold.The initial flurry of cases in this rural part of Wales was comparable at the start of the outbreak to the local authorities of Wales that ended up being worst hit by the virus. Yet here it just sort of petered out, reports Wales Online. On the face of it, the geography of the largely rural county could explain the relatively low spread of cases, as across the world, big cities were the first and hardest hit by Covid-. Yet this alone does not explain why Ceredigion was spared. Neighbouring rural areas of Wales were far worse affected. The latest data from Public Health Wales show Powys has had  cases for every , people in the area. Pembrokeshire . Gwynedd a painful . In comparison Ceredigion has had just . Nor can this be accounted for by a lack of testing. The pitiless eye of the ONS shows that Ceredigion has had the fewest deaths where Covid- is mentioned on the death certicate: . for every , people compared to  in Pembrokeshire,  in Gwynedd and  in Powys.Neither can it be that the deaths simply werenapost attributed to Covid-. Data from the ONS shows that there have been hardly any excess deaths in the Hywel Dda health board area. The spike in the south and south-east of Wales simply doesnapost show up here. And Ceredigion has been the area of Hywel Dda with the least Covid-. And it is not that the virus never reached the area, with data showing it tracked identically to that of neighbouring Pembrokeshireaposs for the first two weeks until it, somehow, just subsided. In the mainland, no local authority has had fewer cases. Even the Highland council of Scotland has has had more . So what happened  One big dference that sets Ceredigion apart was that even before it had recorded its first case of Covid-, it had set up a homemade in-house test track and trace system.  The man behind it, Barry Rees, the corporate director for Ceredigion Council, is a scientist by training. He believes contact tracing is the only way of pursuing the disease then rather than following it. Is this the reason for why the county has emerged unscathed  Has a simple contact tracing system saved hundreds of lives, and what does it mean for the population in le after lockdown who havenapost yet built up immunity In the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, before the first death had been recorded in Wales, Ceredigion Council convened their first Gold Command meeting.Bringing together the key people in the council, including leader Ellen ap Gwynn and Mr Rees, they needed to decide what to do. Just weeks before Easter, the Ceredigion population would have been twice its normal size due to the thousands of students at Aberystwyth University and the early-season holidaymakers flocking to resorts like Llangrannog and New Quay along the Cardigan Bay coastline.  They had already worked closely with the university, which was one of the first universities to close in Wales. And, long before the national lockdown was announced, the council had instructed all holiday and caravan parks to close too. Thanks to the councilaposs proactive action, by mid-March, they were down to their core population, said Mr Rees. But even so, Eion Evans, the chief executive at CCC, challenged the group in Gold Command: Are we missing a trick  Is there anything we havenapost done  Sat around that table, Mr Rees, who was a biology teacher for  years, cast his mind to what happens with other notiable diseases like legionella and food poisoning. In those cases, it was up to the councilaposs public protection team to set up a contact tracing system and carry out investigative work, so why not do the same for Covid-, he thought. So I piped up about having read about contact tracing in south east Asia where they had trialled it and were able to put the manpower in to do it, said Mr Rees, who has been in his current post for two years.  I knew we had the skillset and so I got a couple of colleagues together who created something, based on research which was happening internationally. At first, it was nothing complex - just a simple questionnaire which could be filled in manually, as a way of contact tracing. Thataposs the way it has developed really, probably helped by our lower numbers. Mr Rees says that simple system has enabled them to carry out contact tracing on every confirmed case in the county. He said: Weaposve done so for the past seven to eight weeks now. Weaposve picked up all positive cases and been contact tracing on them all. A couple of environmental health officers were assigned to pick up on positive tests. Precautions were even extended to their own staff. Weaposve got a HR system where people will put down a reason for their absence on a daily basis, explained Mr Rees. So we check to seeanybody has put down their absence for coronavirus symptoms. We picked those up and were able to contact them as well.  Before they could begin, the team, led by Mr Rees, had to set out the moral imperative. He added: We also had a colleague from data protection,cecause for the first time really we were using peoplesapos data to contact potentially a secondary contact who was or wasnapost a member of their close family. So we were using their data in a new way, so we checked that out with our data protection officer and he liaised with the information commissioner office. We set up our own very simple data management system. It was a manual effort with one of the environmental health officers picking up the phone, explaining what we were trying to do. In the beginning, people werenapost aware of a test, track and trace system so we had to explain all of that to them. The data we collected was input to our data management system, which was very much homemade, so no one was scribbling down responses on a piece of paper. Then we used our in-house environmental health expertise to help decide how and when to contact people. Mr Rees, , is keen to stress he is just the ideas person who facilitates the work. He adds: The doing has been done by other people. He believes effective contact tracing is a race against time which is why his system took a conservative approach and assumed every symptomatic person was assumed to be a positive case. Numbers started off pretty low and there was one busy weekend where we had a couple of positive tests we needed to follow up, explained Mr Rees. We also had some symptomatic members of staff and we really needed to snuff that out and pursue that. Theyaposve subsequently been tested and that test was negative but we did some preventative stuff, prior to the test. One of the worries is that,the starting point for the contact tracing is a positive test, youaposre already some way down the line. If people arenapost following the advice being given, then youaposre missing a few days for people to go through the further process of being tested. You might be losing  hours where these people may not be following the guidance and potentially spreading the virus.  We short circuited that loop and didnapost wait for their test results to come back before taking action. We were able to send a note down to our contact tracing team to gather more information. If theyaposre showing symptoms then thereaposs almost the presumption of a positive test and that guides the advice we give to them. As the rest of the UK starts to catch up with Ceredigion, with a national test, track and trace system being rolled out right across the country, Mr Rees says we have to be careful what we wish for. A decision needs to be made, he says, between either speeding up the turnaround time for getting test results - thataposs got to be really really quick, or instigating contact tracing with a starting point of when people exhibit symptoms. Youaposve got to be careful what you wish for because suddenly we could swamp the whole system and the system could fail because of the numbers involved, he warned. In an ideal world weaposd have the capacity to catch people when theyaposre symptomatic, do some contact tracing and advise them on their behaviours and that would be able to really get hold of it. Weaposd be really pursuing the disease then rather than following it then. Mr Rees is wary about putting Ceredigion on a pedestal for doing anything better than anybody .

This week, Christian Brueckner was named as a new suspect in her disappearance. And tragically investigators say they believe Madeleine, who was three when she vanished, is now dead. According to reports, as a baby Brueckner, was taken in by Fritz and Brigitte Brueckner after his mother gave him up. But the couple ended up sending him to a reform home as they struggled to discipline him, the Daily Mail claims. After Mr Brueckner was injured in a car crash, he was also no longer able to look after the teenager, who was around  when he left their care. The teenageraposs disruptive behaviour was reportedly impossible for the couple to handle, prompting the move to the home.  Widowed Mrs Brueckner, from Bergtheim, near Wuerzburg, said yesterday that she knew nothing about his alleged crime, saying: I donapost want to know anything about it. Neighbours claim to remember Brueckner as an out-of-control youth who caused the couple no end of heartache. One told the Mail: He was often in trouble and he got worse and worse as he grew into a teenager.  Another said: If what I read is true it will destroy his mother. Mr Brueckner suffered a brain injury in  and used a wheelchair for the rest of his le, neighbours said. It has been reported that a tip linking Brueckner, , with Madeleineaposs disappearance was not acted on for seven years. Police in Braunschweig, Germany, received a tip about about Brueckner in  and sent it on to the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation, according to reports. But local reports say the tip was ignored.  German magazine Spiegel reported: One person did submit a tip about Brueckner but the resulting report from police in Braunschweig to the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation was apparently not acted upon, much to the consternation of the local investigators. Madeleine was abducted from a room in the Ocean Club holiday complex in the area on May  . Brueckner is known to have been living in Praia da Luz between  and .  Hans Christian Wolters, a spokesman for the Braunschweig Public Prosecutoraposs Office, said: In connection with the disappearance of the three-year-old British girl Madeleine McCann on May   from an apartment complex in Praia da Luz, in Portugal, the Braunschweig prosecution is investigating against a -year-old German on suspicion of murder.

The reproduction rate of the virus - known as the aposRapos - is higher in some parts of the UK than others. The emerging challenge has led Health Secretary Matt Hancock to caution yesterday that parts of England could face stricter lockdowns than others when outbreaks are spotted. But the government has faced criticism this week as some suggest it is easing the lockdown too quickly, with the UK death toll passing , yesterday. The new estimates suggest the R is between . and . in England,  in the South West and . in the North West. The R rate measures how many people with the  coronavirus on average go on to be infected from a single case of Covid-. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here It is being used by the governmentaposs science advisory group, SAGE, to monitor the efficacy of Britainaposs lockdown restrictions as officials strive to keep the R below . If it is  or higher, the virus will spread exponentially through the population, while a value less than  indicates the virus is in decline. Concerns over outbreak hotspots came as scientists and doctors pleaded with the government to hold an inquiry ahead of a potential second wave this winter. And schools in the regions emerging as suffering higher transmission rates are warning they should be able to keep their gates closed in local outbreaks. Schools are being strongly advised not to admit more pupils after new data suggested coronavirus could still be spreading in the North West of England.  Headteachers in Tameside, east of Manchester, have been told to delay the wider reopening of schools beyond key workersapos and vulnerable children, planned for Monday, until there is further assurance, the councilaposs director of public health, Dr Jeanelle de Gruchy said in a letter to schools. The North West has the highest rate of Covid- infections in England according to Public Health England . Data has suggested the reproductive rate, known as the R value, is higher than  in the region. Other local councils in the region are understood to be monitoring the situation with Tameside postponing the reopening of schools until June .  But Andy Burnham, Mayor of Greater Manchester, has questioned whether such measures are workable, calling them a recipe for chaos. Both he and Liverpool City RegionMayor Steve Rotheram have questioned whether lockdown relaxation was being lted too soon, driven from London, with the regions and the North not being listened to. Council bosses in Liverpool and Gateshead led a northern backlash against the Government announcement last month advising schools to reopen for Years  and  from June .  Many councils in the areas have only partially reopened to pupils other than vulnerable children or those of key workers. In a warning that could deal another blow to schools and other essential services fully reopening, experts are saying fear a bigger threat could be yet to come. Scientists are still racing to determine whether deadly Covid- will flourish in winter, like seasonal bugs including influenza, as the world continues the search for a vaccine. In a letter totoday those fears were outlined starkly in a direct public appeal to Boris Johnsonaposs government. Twenty-seven experts say the Government is without “quick, practical solutions to some of the structural problems that have made implementing an effective coronavirusresponse so dficult”. They write: “If, as seems probable, there is a second wave this winter, many more will die unless we find quick, practical solutions to some ofstructural problems,” adds the letter.  It was signed by top experts including former World Health Organisation director Professor Anthony Costello and former Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesmember Professor Deenan Pillay. The letter warned policy-makers and healthcare systems were poorly prepared for another onslaught of Covid-. It continued: “We call on all political parties to commit to a rapid, transparent, expert inquiry to address these issues. This must avoid erting the efforts of those responding to the crisis or apportioning blame, but should propose feasible ways to overcome the obstacles faced by those on the frontline of the response and help them to save lives.” Deaths in UK hospitals so far: , Deaths across all settings: ,Total deaths registered so far: ,Excess deaths so far in : ,Sources: coronavirus.data.gov.uk and ONS It was also revealed yesterday that the number of people with Covid- in England fell during the second half of May to , new infections daily, down from around ,. A more recent R infection update showed in the last week that new infections are flatlining, but outbreaks in hospitals and care homes are still sending fresh cases back out in to the community.  R rate in Englandaposs regions These are the estimated figures as a median average, according to research by Public Health England and Cambridge University. Research by Public Health England and Cambridge University’s MRC Biostatistics Unit - which estimates the R number in dferent regions - suggested it could be above  in the North West.

The person - whose identity, gender and age remains unknown - claimed they had gone to extreme s to maintain the lie, including moving into accommodation, attending lectures and befriending students, reports BirminghamLive. As well as fooling their parents with the lie, students attending the uni had also fallen for it, so they had to pretend they were sitting exams in dferent rooms. According to the Facebook post, the alleged student explained they had very strict parents and had been afraid to tell them they had spectacularly failed their A-Levels. So instead, they decided to create a fake results letter and pretend they had been accepted to their first choice uni to avoid being disowned. They wrote: My parents are very strict and wouldnapost accept me not going to university. I had UoB as my firm choice university but failed spectacularly in my A-levels and couldnapost even get into my insurance choice. What I regret doing was telling the other students I lived with the lie as well, I just wanted to fit in but they all believed it.  They continued: I ended up going to Freshersapos week and managing to go along to societies as a non member. What made things worse was I had a friend from home who also was doing my course and I took things too far and told her I couldnapost get into my timetable could she send me a copy of hers. I was shocked how easy it was to get into the lectures rooms and the first two weeks I went to lectures and made many friends who all believed me. I stopped after a few weeks but the people I met were great and I didnapost want to admit I had lied. I would just join in on the complaining about deadlines, I got around not being in their exam rooms by saying I had anxiety and had to be in a separate room.  The person went on to say that their parents were financially supporting them the entire time but they also worked in a restaurant to save money. In second year the lie got even deeper when they agreed to move into a shared student house with people studying the course they were pretending to be on. Their biggest worry wasnapost their pals finding out the truth though, it was all about the parents. My biggest concern was going to be my parents wanting to go to graduation but now its cancelled it couldnapost be more perfect for me, they wrote.  While that particular issue may have been resolved, the person is now unsure what le after fake uni will be like for them - and theyaposre even considering moving countries to escape the lie. None of my friends from home or anyone knows that I have faked everything and I am so deep into the lie Iaposve considered moving countries to escape. My parents arenapost going to be happy with me not having a grad job but Iaposve blamed it on corona. They added that they were unsure whether to add their pretend degree to their CV and asked the people of Facebook for some advice.

Demonstrators descended on Parliament Square in Westminster earlier following the tragic death of the -year-old in the US. During a minuteaposs silence hundreds of protesters went down on one knee while raising one fist in the air. The crowds then began chanting no justice, no peace and George Floydaposs name. Pictures showed the majority of demonstrates wearing face masks, with others using gloves and hand sanitiser. Hundreds held signs at the protest in solidarity with George, who died in Minneapolis on May  after a police officer detaining him knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes as fellow officers stood by. Many signs say black lives matter and no justice, no peace. As the rally began in London, one organiser used a megaphone to tell the crowds: We are not here for violence. Today is sheer positivity, today is sheer love. She added: Today we will not commit any violence to anyone. Protesters were also reminded to try and keep a two metre distance from others where possible and to be mindful of the pandemic. A group of drummers played for the crowds in London, many of whom were carrying placards and dancing in time with the beat. Elsewhere, huge crowds of people are also gathered in Piccadilly Gardens, Manchester holding placards and banners. Protests are also taking part around Cambridgeshire, where people appear to be social distancing while taking part. Many have gathered in Cathedral Square, Peterborough, with a huge sign seen saying apossilence is complianceapos. Protests have been held across the world, demanding justice for Floyd and against police brutality. Thousands took to the streets in Australia on Saturday, and hundreds in Japan.  In Brisbane, police estimated , people joined a peaceful protest, wearing masks and holding Black Lives Matter placards. Many wrapped themselves in indigenous flags, calling for an end to police mistreatment of indigenous Australians.  In Sydney, a last-minute court decision overruled a coronavirus ban as several thousand people marched, amid a heavy police presence, chanting: Whose lives matter  Black Lives matter.

From the orphan begging for more in Oliver Twist to the heartless Ebenezer Scrooge in A Christmas Carol, Dickens highlighted poverty and squalor. But as the gap between rich and poor grows wider and struggling families are forced to use food banks, how far have we really come since then  The Charles Dickens Museum’s Alex Werner said: “What has allowed Dickens to remain relevant is that he was a ­powerful social campaigner. “He was shocked by the extremes of poverty. He really tried to drive reform and improve conditions for the poor. “Bureaucracy was another thing he didn’t like, and poor education. He was always campaigning for better schooling. In the world we live in today those ­inequalities still exist.” The term Dickensian is often used to describe something that is reminiscent of the author’s work, such as poor social conditions or comically repulsive ­characters. So what would Dickens make of world ­leaders today such as Donald Trump and Boris Johnson  Mr Werner, head of history collections at the Museum of London, said: “Dickens attacked government with confidence, which is relevant today. “If he was alive now he’d be very much a campaigner and embrace the latest technology. “He’d be on ­social media giving his thoughts on Donald and Boris. He’d be using all that was available to comment on society.”  Dickens was born in Portsmouth in  when industrialisation was rapidly ­reshaping Britain. “London was the ­capital of the world at that point,” said Mr Werner. “That’s his backdrop and he has this amazing imagination creating this cast of characters. “He was the first author to capture what it felt like to live in a big city – the ­extremes of wealth and poverty, the buzz, the energy.” Dickens had a tough start in le. His father John worked as a clerk at the Navy Office HQ but the family got into debt after spending beyond their means. When his father was locked up in a debtors’ prison, Dickens was forced to leave school and get a job. At the age of  he was in a factory pasting blacking ­labels on bottles of shoe polish for six shillings a week. Mr Werner said: “He was really scared by his father ­going to prison. He’d been forced to work in the blacking factory and felt this enormous sense of humiliation.  “That never left him throughout his le. That’s why he was a workaholic. “He would always worry about money so he was driven by that humiliation. Often, great writers and artists have that in their le to push them.” Dickens first found success in  with the ­serial publication of The Pickwick Papers. He would go on to ­become an international celebrity, ­writing  novels, five ­novellas plus hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles. His works, including A Tale of Two Cities, David Copperfield, Hard Times and Bleak House, are some of the world’s greatest. Dickens’s books are still loved today and many have been adapted for the screen.  Mr Werner says Dickens’s talent would also translate well to modern day soap operas. “He focuses on ordinary people and his characters feel very real. From Jo the crossing sweeper in Bleak House to Tiny Tim the ­disabled child in A Christmas Carol, they’re all very lelike. “You can almost feel them in front of you. “I could see him as a scriptwriter for one of the soaps. Something like EastEnders or Coronation Street. I think he’d be really good at that. His character ­writing was exceptional. “There’s so much ­conversation in his books and that ­translates well on to ­television – creating a ­character through the words they use, the pace of dialogue and expression.” In his letime, fans just couldn’t get enough of Dickens’s works.  “His books came out in instalments and people would clamour for them,” said Mr Werner. “There are fantastic descriptions of people coming together, people who couldn’t read, and there would be one person reading out the next episode just to find out what happened. “They were page turners with mysteries and clfhangers – like the death of Little Nell from The Old Curiosity Shop. It sent a whole nation into mourning.  “People wrote to him begging him not to kill her off. It was a character the whole Victorian world had embraced. “Dickens travelled around the country, he gave readings, he packed theatres, he toured America twice. “People tried to get him to stand as a politician but he thought he had more freedom to comment on subjects as a writer.”  As the first superstar ­author, Dickens’s image was captured by some of the leading photographers. The pictures were circulated and sold in stationers’ shops. People would collect them. The chair Dickens sat in for these portraits was the one in which he wrote A Tale of Two Cities. Today it is in the collection of the Museum of London.Before the Covid- lockdown, towns and institutions across the land were poised to celebrate him on the th a­nniversary of his death. Now with many of these prevented from taking place, many organisations are opening archives for people to enjoy content from home. The Museum of London, for example, has shared with us a number of rarely seen objects and items from their collection reflecting Dickens’s le and the legacy that he left in London. . The author spent more than a decade setting up a safe house for women in Shepherd’s Bush, where they were taken to escape lives of ­prostitution and crime and trained for useful employment.  But as we look back on his achievements with rose-tinted glasses, Mr Werner reminds us that the father-of-nine was no saint. “He was really beastly to his we,” he said. “He told people she was insane and there is something uncomfortable about that moment of his le. “But maybe he was a bit ­frustrated by his children. He was a great, famous writer and I don’t know ­whether he had much time for his children. “There are photographs of the family together but you wonder how often that was.” Charles Dickens died on June , , at his home in Kent. He was  and had suffered a stroke. As we try to imagine the great writer in today’s world, the question is how would Dickens have coped in a lockdown  "},{"url":null,"title":"woman turns cottage bought 22","story":"NewsWoman turns cottage bought  years ago for £ into £k dream homeJane Beck, , bought the cottage with no water or electricity when she fell in love with it on a holiday break two decades agoShareCommentsByMirror:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsJane Beck, , bought the cottage near Tregaron in Ceredigion, Wales, when she fell in love with it on a holiday break two decades ago \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Completely unmodernised it was like stepping into the s, no electricity, no water and an outside toilet. On our arrival a river ran from the back to the front and out of the front door.

The pool is approximately one foot wide, two feet long and several inches deep. Although it appears to be cloudy in pictures, the pool is actually crystal clear and is most likely ancient filtered rainwater which seeped through the caveaposs limestone.

Peter Erdmann, , told the Sunday Mirror that Christian Brueckner gave sweets and cuddly toys to children aged seven to  for TWO YEARS. He said kids turned up at school with gts they said Brueckner gave them – and another local claimed children went behind the counter and into the storeroom of his shop.Peter now says police should investigate whether Brueckner, , was grooming kids at the kiosk just  yards from a school in Braunschweig, north Germany. The caretaker said today: “The police should definitely investigate whether Christian abused them. “He was mainly giving the presents to boys, but also some girls. He was giving them presents nearly every day and it went on for a couple of years. “I thought nothing of it and just thought he was a friendly man. I used to go into the kiosk and he would give me free shots of Jagermeister. He knew I was the school caretaker. It turns my stomach now.” Peter spoke as police in Germany revealed they are probing possible links connecting Brueckner to the disappearance of Maddie and three German children. Three-year-old Maddie, from Rothley, Leics, vanished while on holiday in Praia da Luz, Portugal, in May .Police are now looking at the cases of Inga Gehricke, five, and René Hasee, six, in Germany – and the murder of German girl Carola Titze, , in Belgium.Brueckner is in jail on drugs offences but can technically apply for parole. He was also jailed for seven years last December for raping a -year-old woman at her villa in Praia da Luz in . But a legal challenge over that conviction is reported to be under way over extradition issues.  Brueckner took a phone call in Praia da Luz on the night Maddie vanished. He lived locally, on and off, and had a grey Jaguar and a Westfalia campervan which were seen in the area. Caretaker Peter told the Sunday Mirror he regrets not speaking to police earlier. He worked at Grundschule Hohestieg School in Braunschweig from  until  and says Brueckner lived locally from -.Peter said: “The kids would come to school holding ponies and teddy bears. They said Christian gave them to them and he always had a big bag of them in the storeroom. “I asked himhe gave gts to the kids and he told me he had a box full of such gts in the kiosk.  “He would walk past the school at least once a day while walking his two dogs. I wish I had raised what was going on with my bosses at the time. “I regret it and not being more suspicious. It is gut-wrenching and I am disgusted by what I read about him.” There is no suggestion Brueckner abused any of the school’s pupils or the kids in the kiosk.  Another local named Norbert said he spotted kids as young as nine behind the counter. Norbert grew up in the area and later moved into Brueckner’s old flat nearby. He said: “He sometimes let children work behind the cashier. Children were also seen in the storeroom, but no one knew about his convictions then. He disgusts me.” Norbert allowed the Sunday Mirror inside the flat, which he says Brueckner left in a disgusting condition. He said: “There was rubbish everywhere. The floors and bottom of the walls were black and there was vomit and insects everywhere. Pest control had to disinfect everything. There were broken windows. The bedroom was wrecked. Everything was damaged. He was an animal. He held parties all night and neighbours complained to police.  “Who knowsthe children got involved  It wouldn’t surprise me.” Norbert also claimed Brueckner, who lived in the flat with a -year-old girlfriend, left two dogs to die of thirst during onevisit to the Algarve. And he alleged Brueckner ed and threatened him with a kne while demanding to take a freezer and air- conditioning unit he had left behind.

Police in Belgium are trying to establish whether there was a link between the -year-old paedophile and the death of Carola Titze, who was just  when she was killed. Since he was named as a suspect in Madeleineaposs  disappearance, he has also reportedly been linked with the disappearance of René Hasse, six, in the Algarve in , and that of five-year-old Inga Gehricke in . Carolaaposs mutilated body was found in sand dunes in De Haan, West Flanders, where she was on holiday with her family. In the days before she was killed, she had been to a disco with a mystery German man, who has never been located.  Commenting on the latest investigation into Madeleineaposs alleged killing, De Haanaposs mayor Wilfried Vandaele told VRT: A shockwave went through our community when the body of Carola Titze was found in woodland in the dunes in . Of course, we too want the perpetrator to be found at long last. Letaposs hope the German investigation can provide greater clarity.Carola died weeks after René disappeared while he was on holiday at the Amoreiras beach in the Algarve - less than  miles from Praia da Luz - in . That case, too, is being reopened in light of the alleged breakthrough in the Madeleine investigation. René was last seen running towards the sea, and only his clothes have been found since. Prosecutors are also reportedly taking a fresh look at the abduction of five-year-old Inga Gehricke, who disappeared in Diakoniewerk Wilhelmshof in Saxony-Anhalt in . Police raided Brueckneraposs home in February the following year hoping to find evidence linking him to Inga.  Although they were unable to prove his involvement at the time, they did discover a large number of child abuse images on a USB stick. Birte Iliev, a spokesman from the Stendal Public Prosecutoraposs Office, confirmed that the case has been reopened. He said: It is now being examined whether there is any new evidence in connection with the murder suspect in Braunschweig. Brueckner is serving a seven year sentence for raping a -year-old woman in Praia da Luz, close to where Madeleine vanished.  It has been reported that a tip linking Brueckner, , with Madeleineaposs disappearance was not acted on for seven years. Police in Braunschweig, Germany, received a tip about about Brueckner in  and sent it on to the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation, according to reports. But local reports say the tip was ignored. Der Spiegel reported: One person did submit a tip about Brueckner but the resulting report from police in Braunschweig to the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation was apparently not acted upon, much to the consternation of the local investigators. Madeleine was abducted from a room in the Ocean Club holiday complex in the area on May  . Brueckner is known to have been living in Praia da Luz between  and . Hans Christian Wolters, a spokesman for the Braunschweig Public Prosecutoraposs Office, said: In connection with the disappearance of the three-year-old British girl Madeleine McCann on May   from an apartment complex in Praia da Luz, in Portugal, the Braunschweig prosecution is investigating against a -year-old German on suspicion of murder. We are assuming that the girl is dead.

He also receive a £, house that Philip transferred into his name before he died. Philipaposs family said they were horried at Florinaposs reaction following his death and said he didnapost even seemed upset when he called to tell them the news.Retired Royal Mail driver Tony Clements spoke to Florin for the first time last Sunday after he called him to let him know Philip had died, reports The Sun Online.The -year-old said: “He’s a gold digger. Why would a chap his age be interested in an -year-old man  “If I was Philip, I’d have tried to find someone closer to my own age. But he obviously loved Florin. “I don’t think Florin loved him. I had no problem with him being gay, of course I didn’t. There’s no reason to. Tony said him and his brothers had stopped seeing Phillip as they felt angry about the  year age gap.  Philipaposs other brother Brian, , who served as a Royal Marine for  years, added: Florin is a leech and he’s got what he always wanted. But Florin today insisted that Philip wouldnapost have wanted him to be unhappy, saying: My darling people, it is not my fault that left me with this money.” Tony said they never cared about getting any money from Philip and he only cared that he was healthy. He added: “I don’t even know how much he had. As far as I knew, he was broke. He used to spend so much money on Florin, who just wanted designer things all the time.  Mr Marin said his late husband had fallen ill during the coronavirus lockdown after he was unable to visit his GP in the UK and was left running low on medication. He claims that despite Mr Clements developing a fever and becoming disoriented he refused to seek medical help resulting in him taking the former clergyman to hospital himself. Mr Marin said he was separated from his husband as he was whisked to a quarantined coroanvirus ward amid fears he had the disease, but when tests came back negative he was transferred to a cardiac ward where heslipped into a coma and later died. Mr Clements died alone and his widower told the sad news in a phone call from the hospital.  Mr Marin will be allowed to draw the £,-a-month pension for le as long as he doesnapost get remarried. Florin declined to comment on the claims of Philipaposs brothers. But he told Mail Online previously: People will think that I am a widow with a black hat who is crying, and I did cry, but two days is enough. Philip didnapost want me to cry, he wanted people to be happy whatever happened. I donapost want to show people my feelings because my husband died, because some people take advantage of that and there are people who are happy because of your sadness. The couple met on the online dating site Gaydar and got married three years ago in Kent - but their relationship hit the rocks when Mr Clements moved to Bucharest and rowed over Mr Marin clubbing into the early hours of the morning.  Mr Marin had an affair with a Spaniard named Jesús resulting in Mr Clements moving back to England a few months after they wed, despite having sold his home to live in the Romanian capital. However the couple kissed and made up in March this year after the ex-vicar said he was happy for Mr Marin to visit gay clubs at the weekends with people his own age. Mr Clements said at the time: I know when heaposs busy not to disturb him and to give him space. He goes to the gay club in Bucharest once a week and Iaposm fine with that. He must have space to be with younger people, itaposs very important when thereaposs this big age dference. Weaposve both learnt a lot. The new widow said the cash was aposnot that hugeapos and while he will always remember his late husband he wonapost rule out any future relationships.

Most fans would think an owner would buy a club and then buy other clubs in other countries.“How I would see it personally is that you create really good partnerships, like Aberdeen have with Atlanta. That’s a fantastic partnership.“I’ve been out there. The owner has more zeros than you can write down. They’ve got a great structure. There are amazing ways of working.”Asghar, who is currently working with United boss Robbie Neilson on recruitment for next season, feels the club – and Scottish football as a whole – has lots to learn from other nations’ approach to marketing the game and driving revenue.That’s a task he is passionate about accomplishing at Tannadice.“I understand that Scottish fans traditionally come to the game at  o’clock on a Saturday after a few pints with their pals,” he said.“[They] have a pie at half-time and after a game they’re moaning about the team or talking about how well it’s done. A brilliant weekend, back in work on Monday.“Now football is much more than that.“We’ve got the opportunity to get Dundee United out to places like India, the Middle East, South America and the US because technology makes it a lot easier.“We’ve got a product we can definitely market better across the world.“It’s challenging. American clubs speak to us about how we get such passion and support. Dundee United fans have fathers and grandfathers who supported the club. That’s always going to be our core.“Now we need to encourage that fanbase to be bigger.

Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this. It has been good to share some of the memories of Argyll with you.#"},{"url":null,"title":"gamers-enjoy-e-sports-success-gala-fairydean-rovers","story":"A TEAM of online gamers are representing Gala Fairydean Rovers FC in a virtual football competition.Gas engineer Darren Smith, of Galashiels, helped launch an -a-side league on FIFA  in which his hometown club has been enjoying considerable success.Smith, , told the Border : ldquoConsidering itrsquos the first season, itrsquos been excellent ndash and so has the reaction wersquove got from people.The Scottish league, played on a PlayStation , contains a number of teams representing official clubs, including Berwick Rangers, Greenock Morton andEast Stirlingshire.But the Galashiels side has been performing admirably, according to Smith ndash who has his sights set on a lofty finish.ldquoWersquove only beaten twice, said Smith, whose side currently sit third. ldquoLast Sunday we got beaten and we got beaten on the first day of the season.He added: ldquoWersquore still to play the second-placed team and wersquore still to play the team at the top.ldquoI thinkwe go unbeaten and they drop a few points, itrsquos there to be done and Irsquod be happy with second place.A total of  players have signed up to Galarsquos virtual squad, with three players from the town itself.As the recruitment drive was mainly carried out through Twitter, Smith was able to procure the services of gamers from across Britain and further afield.

The firrst houses are due to be built later this year.He said: ldquoWe have a unique opportunity here with a blank canvas for a new town at a time when climate change is central to policies.ldquoI also think the Covid- pandemic has driven forward the idea that people can work from home and find alternative ways to work with the support of digital technology.Central to the vision is alternative ways to travel with an emphasis on walkways and cycle routes.A new train station at a central hub within an area the council has dubbed Greater Blindwells will provide additional access to public transport.To the north of the central hub between Cockenzie and Port Seton and Longniddry there are proposals for a water park or outdoor leisure area with the potential to create a lido, space for kayaking and other water sports.At the former Cockenzie Power Station site, less than half-a-mile away, a new centre of excellence is proposed described as a training school and ldquoexemplar development in modular manufacture and construction.The council is launching an eight-week consultation on their vision for the area from tomorrow and people will be able to go in and give their views.They are also hoping that as lockdown restrictions ease they may be able to have outdoor exhibitions for people who cannot access the proposals online and will be advertising the consultation locally so people can get in touch through the post.The Scottish Government is currently looking at revising its framework and the council has made its case for the wider area to be classed as a National Development, which will give their proposals support at a national level.The consultation will open at https:eastlothianconsultations  from Monday, June ."},{"url":null,"title":"ball-outdoor-sports-return-garden-centres-re-open","story":"It was paradise for county golfers as they were able toto the greens after two months of inactivity.Some county bowling clubs also reopened, while beaches were busy during one of the hottest days of the year, despite East Lothian Council keeping coastal car parks closed.The majority of East Lothianrsquos -plus bowls clubs have reopened.The clubs still closed ndash including East Linton, Tranent, Elphinstone, North Berwick and Prestongrange ndash have indicated they are looking to open when the Scottish Government moves into phase two of its plan.

Parking attendants and Police Scotland were on duty over the weekend to advise and issue tickets as appropriate.ldquoThe easing of restrictions also allowed golf courses to reopen with new guidance for players about social distancing and hygiene practices.ldquoMany of the clubs have reported positive comments from members able to enjoy their sport again.

local authority with a series of images also unveiled.The proposed ClimatEvolution Zone would cover the under-construction town of Blindwells and surroundingcommunities stretching from Prestonpans to Longniddry and inland to Tranent and Macmerry.East Lothian Council is petitioning the Scottish Government to extend the National Development status given to the former Cockenzie Power Station site in its National Planning Frameworkdocument to a wider area in its planned revised framework which is under review.This could pave the way for the creation of the ClimatEvolution Zone which could transform the area over the next  years through innovative approaches to development.A public consultation on the vision has been launched by the council and breaks the plans down into dferent themes from environment to travel.It asks people to give their views on its approach to a wide range of issues including access and movement the water environment culture, heritage and leisure greenspace and bioersity strong communities and regeneration and enterprise.However, the vision has already come under fire from Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council which branded it ldquocomplex and unclear.The community council warned that the launch of a new vision for the area three years after the local authority produced its Cockenzie Masterplan document ndash which it has never adopted ndash would leave the public with no confidence in the planning system.East Lothian Council paid consultants to produce the Cockenzie Masterplan for the former Cockenzie Power Station site, which it owns, after a series of public consultations in  but the report remains an informal ldquovisionary document.Now the former power station site could be merged into the new ClimatEvolution Zone with no reference to the original masterplan.Bryan Hickman, community council chairman, said: ldquoThe community council are very concerned by the documents recently published by the council.\"We understood that the changes required for NPF related to the former power station site.\"The y report now extends to Tranent, Prestonpans, Cockenzie and Port Seton, Longniddry and Blindwells as well as the power station site.\"Whilst some of the objectives are to be welcomed, the overall content is complex and unclear and includes such a large area as to be unmanageable in its detail.ldquoThe existing communities have been consulted on the power station site and the result was a masterplan commissioned by the council but not adopted by them.\"We have submitted this masterplan to be included in NPF.\"A number of consultations have taken place in our area and they have come to nothing.\"The feeling is the residents have lost confidence in the system.Neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council also raised concerns about the consultation.Brian Weddell, chairman, questioned whether the proposed train station in the new plan would ever happen, saying: ldquoThere has been no meaningful consultation with local communities who all have concerns about the impact of this development on their communities.The new consultation is based around a study, drawn up in partnership with East Lothian Council, the Scottish Government, The Lothian Drainage Partnership, SEPA, Scottish Water and Scottish Natural Heritage.It considers how the council can take the opportunity of creating a new town at Blindwells and harness the latest technologies to reduce the arearsquos carbon footprint.Among the ideas up for discussion is using groundwater at Blindwells to create waterways and using natural geothermic energy to heat the outdoor water features.Douglas Proudfoot, project leader, said the idea behind the new water features was to avoid putting pipes underground to remove groundwater and utilise it instead as the new town of Blindwells develops on the former opencast coal site of the same name between Longniddry and Tranent.The first houses are due to be built later this year.He said: ldquoWe have a unique opportunity here with a blank canvas for a new town at a time when climate change is central to policies.\"I also think the Covid- pandemic has driven forward the idea that people can work from home and find alternative ways to work with the support of digital technology.Central to the vision is alternative ways to travel with an emphasis on walkways and cycle routes.A new train station at a central hub within an area the council has dubbed Greater Blindwells will provide additional access to public transport.To the north of the central hub between Cockenzie and Port Seton and Longniddry there are proposals for a water park or outdoor leisure area with the potential to create a lido with space for kayaking and other water sports.At the former Cockenzie Power Station site, less than half-a-mile away, a new centre of excellence is proposed described as a training school and ldquoexemplar developmentin modular manufacture and construction.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray welcomed the ambitious strategy.He said: ldquoThe Cockenzie and Blindwells sites are adjacent to one another and it has always been inevitable that their development will be closely linked, so it makes sense to seek to extend National Development status to Blindwells.ldquoThe whole area offers unique potential to transform these former industrial sites into places where people can live and work in a sustainable way.Kenny MacAskill, East Lothian MP, also welcomed the project which will lsquointeractrsquo with neighbouring communities.He said: ldquoThe area is a far wider community and cannot be seen in isolation.The inclusion of adjacent communities is therefore essential.Councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the proposals are not a lsquofinalised masterplanrsquo but rather a ldquohigh level document which sets out an ambitious vision for the area over the coming  years.He said: ldquoItrsquos an exciting opportunity to ensure that one of the key areas of East Lothian, is developed in an innovative way.\"Itrsquos not all about whatrsquos new, though.\"We are looking at enhancing the existing local environment and making the most of the arearsquos unique history as well as its mining and agricultural heritage and the site of the Battle of Prestonpans.The council launched its eightweek consultation on its online hub on Monday.The Scottish Government is revising its National Development Planning Framework which gives an overview of what it wants to see develop on key sites across Scotland.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoWe are grateful for the many

The standard SNP solution to all these types of issue is to announce an inquiry or a review. This covers the immediately required response but provides little .Inquiries take forever, as is currently the case with the Edinburgh trams fiasco, and are designed to report only once those responsible are either out of power or nearly so. The same will happen with both the Nike conference problem and that of the care homes.Politicians might announce they will make mistakes but they rarely take actual responsibility for these mistakes, just vague promises to look into the matter or, particularly in the case of the SNP, look to pass the blame on where. Is it any surprise therefore that nothing ever really gets solved in a timely manner Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow G.As I write, we are approaching  days of wearisome lockdown.  long days during which the Scottish and UK governments have struggled to deal with a virus which most other European nations had under control after about  days.They claim constantly that they are ldquofollowing the science.

My personal experience is somewhat dferent.On Saturday May , as an over--year-old retired NHS doctor with symptoms, I investigated online my eligibility for Covid testing. I was pleased to be offered an appointment for the following day at a testing centre at Edinburgh Airport, Dunoon, or , Perth. My home address was Glasgow. I selected Edinburgh Airport and was driven there the following day. The test was carried out very efficiently, and I was told to expect a result by text or email within  hours however, under exceptional circumstances it might take up to five days.On the sixth day, having heard nothing, I telephoned the registration telephone number on my receipt. I spoke to a very helpful lady who said she would \"flag it up for the NHS, and I should check my email\". She was unable to provide further information. I emailed the Scottish Health Secretary, who, to her credit ,replied the same day. Her answer was \"Itrsquos not our fault\": ie that this was nothing to do with the Scottish Government, as two separate testing schemes were in operation, and the Edinburgh Airport testing centre was under the auspices of the UK scheme and tests were carried out at the Lighthouse labs. She did offer to have her team look into my result, but because of the time lag and my improving symptom, I felt this was not requiredFour weeks later, a couple of days ago, I received an email from the Scottish Covid-Extended Testing Programme, once again saying \"Itrsquos not our fault\". They provided a telephone number to call.I have yet to receive a result for my Covid test, but am not pursuing this further as I am aware that at this stage a further test would be meaningless and antibody tests are not yet deemed reliable.Mary Watson, Glasgow G.COULD someone please treat us like adults and explain exactly whats happening. Government figures show that numbers in ICU are down by  per cent compared to the height of the pandemic deaths down by  per centand crucially, new infections down by % to an average of  or so a day, this latter figure akin to levels in South Korea .

However, theme parks are not allowed to open until Phase , which means the parksrsquo announcements do not technically comply with state guidelines and the decision to commence Phase  on the theme parksrsquo timeline rests with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.

She runs a Facebook group of over , members to help those who have annual passes schedule park meet-ups and said most people she knew were ldquochomping at the bit to get back to the parks.ldquoBecause wersquove been passholders for so long we know the calibre at which [Universal] operates, Wellman said. ldquoWe didnrsquot feel worried or scared.Wellman said the group fluctuated around  people throughout the night and they followed CityWalkrsquos guidelines. These rules require face coverings at all time ndash which includes both masks and bandanas ndash and respecting floor markings to maintain proper distancing.However, a selfie she took with people not wearing masks received online backlash. She explained that those people were eating and therefore allowed to take off their masks but it didnrsquot stop others from claiming she was being irresponsible.ldquoPeople were like, lsquoI canrsquot believe yoursquore going there,rsquo but they took precautions that felt right to them and so did we. Everybody has to live their own le, Wellman said.Wellman described the employeesrsquo energy as ldquotop notch, which was similar to how passholder Briana Posner defined her evening at CityWalk. Posner, a recent graduate from the University of Central Florida, said she felt comfortable ing to CityWalk for mini-golf because of how transparent the company was about their safety guidelines.ldquoThe people directing traffic were dancing in the street, Posner said, and she laughed remembering what that looked like. ldquoEveryone was glad to be there. Even as [employees] gave out social distancing guidelines, they were bantering, and it felt like a Universal show rather than an automated message.What she did have a problem with, however, was the mandatory face coverings.Posner has asthma, and the humid weather coupled with her mask made it hard to breathe. The Centers for Disease Control and Preventionrecommends cloth mask coverings because a signicant number of people do not show symptoms but can still pass Covid- to others. However, the CDC cites exemptions for people with breathing problems. Additionally, summers in Orlando have been known to reach highs of over  degrees Fahrenheit , which is made worse when the sun reflects off the pavement.Posner said she wouldnrsquotto the headline theme parks when they reopen unless they lted the mask requirement. However, she said the parks should still open because of the jobs they bring.Posner is one of the many Floridians who are now unemployed due to Covid-. Data from the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity shows . million Floridians lost their jobs in March and April, which brought the statersquos unemployment rate to .%.The Florida unemployment system was not built to handle those numbers and has the slowest processing times for filed claims in the country. Additionally, the website has been described as confusing and glitchy. There was even a data breach that released the full names and social security numbers of  people. They were not alerted until weeks later, according to The Florida Department of Economic Opportunity.ldquoI donrsquot qualy for unemployment and I donrsquot qualy for the stimulus check, Posner said, noting that many recent college graduates did not get the one-time stimulus check of , [just under pound] from the federal government. ldquoThey want me to stay home for two months or more not working and still expect me to pay rent, bills and health insurance. Itrsquos very dficult. I need things to open up.While many passholders seemed eager for theme parks to , the employees I talked to were less sure.Laurie, who asked to have her name changed for privacy, has worked as a ride operator and entertainment character at Universal for four years. Her biggest fear is that reopening the parks too soon is an unnecessary risk, and a large part of that has to do with the realities of sanitising after every guest. Laurie believes that while guests may feel comforted by the theme parkrsquos new sanitation measures, they arenrsquot realistic.ldquoWhat it boils down to is the lap bars, handrails, gt shop counters, chairs and lockers. Itrsquos impossible to create a sterile environment, Laurie said. ldquoYou canrsquot wipe down every single thing unless there are lots of team members in each venue, and thatrsquos adding more people to the equation.A personal issue Laurie worries about is that evenemployees like her follow every guideline, she doesnrsquot have the same protections as guests. She said she would wear a mask to protect parkgoers but doubts every tourist would wear one for her. Interactions with unmasked and possibly asymptomatic guests not only puts Laurie at risk of Covid-, but her family and roommates as well.ldquoIrsquod be ing [to the parks], but not happily, Laurie said. ldquoThe rush to get back to the parks is just a mindset Irsquom not personally in. I donrsquot even understand it.These sentiments were also shared by other park employees. Before Covid-, Isaac, who asked that his name be changed, was a waiter at a restaurant in Disney Springs. Isaac said he enjoyed his job but does not feel comfortable serving guests who wonrsquot wear masks.ldquoIs it worth sacricing the health and safety of the working class for the few people who are going to be profiting off it  Isaac asked me. I told him I wasnrsquot sure, and he said no one was.As businesses were forced to close, some unemployed Floridians began protesting for Floridarsquos economy to reopen without restrictions, and counter-protesters in masks called for a longer lockdown.

She said the real issue the pandemic has shown is that Florida cannot pride itself on prioritising its social safety nets.Even as small businesses struggled with closures in March, Floridarsquos largest corporations pocketed a .m tax refund as part of the statersquos newest budget proposal. A spokesman for Governor DeSantis said the money, ldquowill inject capital back to employers at a time when they need these dollars to continue operations and employment. But with Floridarsquos economy frozen and thousands filing for unemployment, critics said it wasnrsquot right that the statersquos largest companies were guaranteed a payout as the economic forecast for small businesses continued to worsen.Not only were small businesses left in the dust, but Eskamani said many vulnerable communities in Florida were also forgotten. There are an estimated , undocumented immigrants living in Florida, according to the Florida Policy Institute. Not only do they not qualy for social services, they are often afraid to seek medical treatment for fear of deportation.ldquo[My team] is supporting the non-profits who help the undocumented and vulnerable who may not be able to leave their homes to get tested, Eskamani said. ldquoWersquore trying to identy folks who live in hotels and motels to get them tested as well.I asked Eskamanitheme parks were a luxury or integral part of Floridarsquos economy, andeither made them a priority to reopen. Eskamani said that Florida is reliant on sales taxes and property taxes, which puts the state in a dficult spot during the pandemic. This is because the few businesses that reopened in Phase  were mostly services that are not taxed ndash such as haircuts at salons ndash and therefore not enough to keep the economy afloat.ldquoTheme parks are dficult to maintain strong public safety, Eskamani said. ldquoBut I think that when it comes to the economic side of it, sales tax is needed and thatrsquos what breaks my heart.If anyone abroad is wondering what will happen to the theme parks, they should expect the changes already being implemented. Visitors will need to social distance in line. They will order food through an app on their smartphones. As of now, they will wear masks in the summer, but may take them off to eat or drink.However, the answer toFlorida itself will be dferent after lockdown is staring us right in the face.

while on holiday with his family in the Portuguese Algarve.It comes as an investigation has been opened into whether the suspect was involved in the disappearance of Inga Gehricke.She was five years old when she vanished from a forest in the Saxony-Anhalt region on May  .Prosecutors in the northern German town of Stendal confirmed to the PA news agency they are probing possible connections between the cases of Madeleine and Inga.But they said the man, who has been partially identied as Christian B by local media due to the countryrsquos strict rules on the naming of criminals, is not currently a suspect.He reportedly had a property in the town of Neuwegersleben, around  miles south-west of Stendal when she went missing.Meanwhile, the Sun newspaper reported that a witness had identied the suspect as a man she saw acting suspiciously outside the McCannsrsquo apartment.According to the Sun, the British woman ndash referred to as a ldquocredible witness ndash said ldquothatrsquos the man I saw when shown a picture of the suspect.The woman reported the sighting within hours of Madeleinersquos disappearance, the newspaper added.It comes after claims, originally reported by Sky News, that the suspect confessed to his part in Madeleinersquos disappearance to a friend as they watched a TV news report on the case in a German bar on the th anniversary of her disappearance.Scotland Yard said his name was already known to its investigation, but he did not become a suspect until after information was received as a ldquodirect consequence of a  appeal.:Madeleine McCann suspect is convicted child abuser and drug traffickerThe forcersquos Operation Grange still considers the case a missing person inquiry because there is no ldquodefinitive evidence whether Madeleine is alive or dead.The suspect is reportedly serving a seven-year prison sentence in the German port city of Kiel for the rape of a -year-old American woman in Portugal in  after he was convicted of rape at Braunschweig District Court in December last year.Der Spiegel reported his criminal record contains a total of  entries, including a conviction for the sexual abuse of a child in  when he was aged , and a  conviction for abusing another child and possession of child pornography.The details emerged after British, German and Portuguese authorities revealed a new suspect had been identied in Madeleinersquos disappearance as a fresh appeal was launched on Wednesday night.Detective Chief Inspector Mark Cranwell, who is leading the politan Police probe, said he was ldquopleased with information coming in after receiving more than  calls and emails by pm on Thursday.Madeleinersquos doctor parents Kate and Gerry McCann from Rothley, Leicestershire, welcomed the latest appeal in a statement saying: ldquoWe will never give up hope of finding Madeleine alive.Their spokesman, Clarence Mitchell, said on Friday: ldquoThey certainly will be encouraged to know the appeal is yielding results already and hopefully within that there will be crucial bits of information the police can act upon.He added: ldquoThey are trying to maintain as normal a le as possible under the circumstances, continuing their medical work where necessary and bringing the twins up as best they can, while shielding them from all the attention.ldquoThey wait to hear any developments from police.The suspect is known to have been living in the Algarve between  and , where he funded his lestyle by committing crimes, including breaking into hotel complexes and holiday apartments.His Portuguese mobile phone was in Praia da Luz when it received a half-hour phone call around an hour before Madeleine, three, was last seen.Detectives said he was believed to have been living in a distinctive early s VW T Westfalia campervan at the time and re-registered a  Jaguar XJR in someone rsquos name the day after her disappearance.Christian Hoppe, from Germanyrsquos Federal Criminal Police Office , has said that German police have not ruled out a sexual motive for the alleged crime against Madeleine.He said that the suspect may have broken into an apartment in the Ocean Club complex, where Madeleine was on holiday with her parents and her twin siblings Sean and Amelie, before spontaneously kidnapping her.The revelations raise questions over whether mistakes in the Portuguese probe may have allowed the suspect to slip through the net.Portuguese police would not answer questions about whether Brueckner was ever spoken to as part of their initial investigation."},{"url":null,"title":"online-dj-sets-social-distancing-freshers-week-age-coronavirus","story":"Freshers week ndash thefirst week of university le ndash is synonymous with heavy drinking, big club nights and young people enjoying their first taste of adult freedom.But as universities prepare for a phasedin the autumn, the coronavirus crisis means this years student experience looks set to be verydferent.Sweaty nightclubs will likely be off limits. Tables will be spaced out in bars to keep people apart.Freshers fairs, in which university societies vie to attract new members, could be massively scaled back or moved online.Meanwhile, quirky ways to encourage social distancing ndash such as large comedy hats or wearable tables ndash may become a feature of student union events.A Universities UK briefing previously suggested students could be kept in small groups under a \"protective bubble\" approach.It comes amid fears universitiesface operating deficits of between pound million and pound million in the next academic year alone.Blake Gray, honorary secretary of theGlasgow University Union , said it is working on three dferent plans.The first is based around a normal freshers week, while the second is an \"off-the-shelf\" plan that would allow much of the traditional festivities to be delayed until it is safe to push ahead.The third looks at how freshers week could take place with restrictions and social distancing.This could involve greater use of online technology, while events usually held in smaller spaces ndash such as pub quizzes ndash could move to larger halls and debatingchambers.\"I wouldnt underestimate the creativity and the ingenuity of students in coming up with things that well be able to do,\" Gray said.He said the union is \"cautiously optimistic\" that bars will be open by September.Meanwhile, student officials have been attending online training sessions run by a security and stewardingcompany, focusing on ways the venue can operate safely.\"Were having risk assessments and things carried out,\" Gray said. \"Were very keen that once we open again it will be safe and it will be secure.\"He said the union \"of course\" feels sympathy for incoming students keen for a traditional freshers week.\"We all had that experience, and we really loved it,\" he said. \"We want to make sure we can give them as much of it as we can.\"He added:\"Were really focused on the idea thatwe cant provide that type of experience in September, we really want to provide that at some point in the year and still have a freshers week at some point.\"Nam Ranpuria, president of the GUU, said it all depends on what guidance is in place at the time.Kayla-Megan Burns, vice president of community atStrathclyde Studentsrsquo Union, also pointed to a greater use of online technology.\"I think were definitely trying to get bars open because that is just one of the key places for students to socialise,\" she said.\"Its one of the freedoms that you get whenever you come to uni.\"People turn  and they can go out and socialise and have a drink with all of their new mates.\"So I think were definitely going to try and keep them open, but at the same time, itll be quite dferent.\"Tables will need to be more spaced out.\"Were currently looking at more quirky ways to try and socially distance students.\"Youve seen across the globe clever and funny ways to keep people socially distanced, like wearing the funny hats with the big arms on them to keep people two metres apart, or the floating tables to give people a two metre radius.\"She said such unusual measures might not look all that out of place in a student union, adding: \"I think wed be able to take it in our stride, hopefully.\"Club nights present one of the biggest issues.\"At those kind of events students do tend to take a drink and that, and it becomes really, really dficult to ensure that people are socially distanced in that kind of crowd,\" Burns said.\"I dont knowthats going to be something were going to be able to do straight away, because as much as we do want students to get those really crucial experiences where they get to go out and have a bit of fun, at the same time its much betterwe leave those kind of mad events until we know its definitely safe.\"The fun isnt worth itstudents come out ill at the end of it.\"Burns said forging a sense of community is \"extremely beneficial for peoples sense of wellbeing, and can be really beneficial for retention in university courses\".International students could find it particularly tough.She said the union is hoping to hold events in person, but it \"wont be the same sort of thing\".Burns said: \"Previously, our freshers fairs would take place across two days and our entire ten-storey building nearly every nook and cranny would be filled with student societies, sports clubs, other student-related groups.\"Our whole building would just be packed with that for two days straight.\"Obviously social distancing just wont allow things like that to happen.\"She said the fair could instead happen over a \"much longer time period, so we dont need to worry about capacity as much\".\"Rather than everyone trying to jam in to see everything within two days, its more likely that we would have a much smaller scale fair over the course of potentially a few weeks, so that students still get that experience but they arent as at risk of being in a crowded space and social distancing measures are still able to be there and theyre still able to be safe,\" she said.Kellie Ioannou, vice president of student activities atDundee University Students Association , said it is not expecting its nightclubs to have reopened byfreshers week.She said: \"In the absence of our club nights, we are exploring creative alternative events that comply with social distancing requirements but also ensure that students can connect with each other and with DUSA.\"When we do reopen our nightclubs, we plan to have a full freshers week event programme, however, we understand this may not coincide with the start of the new academic year.\"We will continue with our online DJ sets that we currently run over the weekends and we are still actively encouraging our fantastic student societies to host inventive online events.\"She said the union is \"in the process of investigating how our freshers fair, which usually attracts over , people, can be facilitated online to ensure that students donrsquot miss out on signing up to over  student-led societies\".It is a similar picture where.Jamie Rodney, president of the University of St Andrews Students Association, said freshersrsquo week \"will look very dferent this year, but were working hard behind the scenes to bring students some unique and creative events that can be enjoyed both from home and in St Andrews come September\".Meanwhile, Aberdeen University Students Association saidCovid- restrictions \"mean that some of the typical freshersrsquo week events will not be able to take place as usual\".It said it is \"continuously monitoring the situation and opportunities to ensure that we can provide an exciting and welcoming experience for new and ing students\", with a \"iety of online and on campus activities planned\"."},{"url":null,"title":"neil-mackay-time-stand-journalism","story":"It struck me, during the height of the Dominic Cummings scandal, just how absurd things had got. Here was the UK Government, mired in a scandal of double-standards and hypocrisy amid the pandemic, and yet the press was somehow in the firing line.On social media, terms like ldquoscum media trended. The press was accused of a witch-hunt against Cummings. We were doing our job ndash which by its simplest definition is holding power to account as honestly as we can ndash and for that we were hated by a vocal section of the country.Emily Maitlis on Newsnight was attacked for comments she made on air which were simply factual: that Cummings broke the rules. The BBC panicked and distanced itself from her. So, in the end, the only person to get in trouble for the Cummings scandal has been a BBC journalist who spoke the truth.Of course, in the Cummings case, the attacks came from the right. The Brexiter camp was angry its man was in the spotlight. But anti-truth attacks come just as often from the left. A journalist can be decried as a stooge for capitalism one minute, and a Trotskyite the next. In Scotland, a journalist can be a figure of hate for nationalists today, and a figure of hate for unionists tomorrow. In a single afternoon, Irsquove been attacked as an ldquoSNP apologist or ldquoNat hack, and also part of the ldquoYoon MSM and a ldquounionist lickspittle. Over the years Irsquove been called a commie, a fascist, a republican, a loyalist, an MI agent, and a traitor to Britain. Like many journalists today, Irsquom whatever someone wants to call me when it suits their own hardline political agenda.When I hear these insults I recall it was President Richard Nixon who said ldquothe press is the enemy. Politicians of all dominant parties in Britain feed this idea ndash often retweeting attacks on journalism from the internetrsquos blogosphere. If you see a politician cosying up to a journalist then the journalist isnrsquot doing their job right.When a reporter becomes a figure of hate for one side, however, the other side adopts them as a spokesperson. Just look at the behaviour towards Piers Morgan. Hersquos baited the left for years, and the left came to hate him. Now, though, as he holds the Government accountable over coronavirus, hersquos suddenly a hero for the left hellip and the right hates him. Meanwhile, the left also discovered that Morgan has previously said things they agree with ndash like guns in America are bad. If the hate wasnrsquot so relentless it would be comic. Until the advent of social media, most journalists considered their job well donethey annoyed both sides of the political ide ndash that meant you had held everyone to account. Today, the simple act of trying to do your job to the best of your ability unleashes a tidal wave of abuse that goes on for days. Anybody would find it psychologically distressing.Perplexing predicament Why are we in this strange place where people who try to tell the truth as best they can are objects of hate The bottom line is that the internet has changed how information is consumed. Journalists break into the closed conservation loops that define the digital age. We are, as the phrase goes, the awkward squad. We donrsquot make things easy. The best of us try to draw out reason in any argument, and as Michael Gove said not so long ago ndash British people are tired of experts. Ideological polarisation means many now see ldquotheir politicians as heroes. Therersquos cultish elements to Brexit, Corbynism, Remainerism, and Scottish nationalism. People donrsquot like you questioning their heroes or faith. Itrsquos easier to hate the questioner. Wersquove been here before, though ndash and itrsquos been much worse. At times of political extremes ndash and wersquore most certainly living in a time of political extremism ndash writers and journalists often find themselves the whipping boy. Extremists and authoritarians donrsquot like people who disagree with them or speak their mind and the British media landscape is a rambunctious place where voices of all stripes are to be heard, both left, right and in between.In Germany, the term ldquoLuumlgenpresse has recently made a comeback. Luumlgenpresse was a Nazi slur meaning ldquolying press. It was a catch-all for the left and Jews. But the term was around long before the s. It first cropped up during the  revolution in Germany and was used to denounce the ldquoliberal press, as reformers demanded political change. Under Hitler, the phrase would lead to the death of the free press, and the murder of journalists in concentration camps. Today, the far-right Pegida movement in Germany likes to throw the term ldquoLuumlgenpresse around, as do alt-right neo-Nazis like Richard Spencer in America. Itrsquos not just the right that uses the term though. In the interwar period, Marxists deployed ldquoLuumlgenpresse against ldquobourgeois journalists. During the  revolts in Europe, far-left students in Germany described the mainstream media as ldquoLuumlgenpresse.What is Luumlgenpresse but an old-style term for Donald Trumprsquos ldquofake news  Itrsquos the same old authoritarian trope just played to a new tune. Whatrsquos ldquoLuumlgenpresseitrsquos not the attacks on journalism by those on the extremes of the Brexit and Scottish independence debates. In Scotland, unionists will cheer the Daily Mail and hiss at The National. Scottish nationalists will cheer The National and hiss at the Daily Mail. In truth, both papers simply cater for the political views of their readers. Papers which adopt a centre-ground, impartial approach get it from both sides because their journalism subjects both sides to the same scrutiny.  One of the reasons why the media now finds itself hated by hardliners of all persuasions is that in recent times the press has had to take on the role of an almost semi-official opposition when it comes to some Western governments. In America, Democrats have been incapable of holding Trump to account. CNN does the scrutiny. In Britain, Corbynrsquos Labour Party was incapable of holding the Tories accountable. It took journalists to root out the truth about Brexit, where Labour dithered. In Scotland, opposition parties seem incapable of holding the Government to account. In a country where some Yes voters will let the SNP away with almost anything as long as the independence cause is advanced, thatrsquos not a recipe for good Government. And so the press gets it in the neck for doing its job.Mistakes admitted Think of any recent modern scandal, and itrsquos the media which exposed it. Without journalism wersquod be blind. None of this, however, is to say that the media is without fault. Far from it. Indeed, the press has made many, many mistakes. Therersquos myriad serious problems ndash but you donrsquot fix problems by calling for the closure of newspapers and resulting redundancies, the dismantling of TV channels, the sacking of writers, and the imprisonment of editors, simply because you donrsquot like what theyrsquove said. Unless, of course, yoursquore an extremist.One of the biggest scandals of the British press was phone-hacking ndash but the scandal would never have come to light unless newspaper journalists investigated the issue. The press reports well on itself. The BBC, in particular, is a past master at self-inflicted punishment via reporting.We need to fix media problems, not wage war on journalism. Every social pillar in the West is creaking today ndash politics, the health service, bureaucracy, religion, policing, education, the military, finance and industry. The media shares the same problems. An intelligent national discussion about addressing failings in the media ndash just as we do with politics, policing, banking, schools and hospitals ndash is surely a better way to improve things than hate and threats.If there are concerns about balance, letrsquos address them. Surely a new mode of media ownership can be worked out. Is there enough plurality of voices  If not, letrsquos work on getting more ersity into newsrooms. How do we reassure the public about oversight without handing government a stick to beat the free press  If therersquos concern about clickbait then look at the funding model which stimulates that.No-one is saying the media is free from sin, but the narrative today is that the press is somehow the enemy when, in fact, the press is a necessary pillar of democracy. No pillar of democracy is rock steady these days but itrsquos not a good idea to try kicking any of them down as the whole edice might fall on your head.The best thing the media could do to build trust is to be more transparent. Explain why we do things, open more dialogue with readers ndash bring critics into newsrooms, show them how editorial decisions are taken.Once a society starts normalising attacks on journalism itrsquos on a slippery slope to ruin. Britain is a long way from that yet, but America isnrsquot. Trump has weaponised hatred of the press ndash just as hardcore Brexiters and Scottish nationalists have tried to do. But in America, Trump has been successful. What started with words turned into threats, and now we see journalists arrested for doing their job.You may not like the political position of certain newspapers but the alternative to the press is the wild west of the internet where the biases, prejudices and conspiracy theories of often one untrained, and usually obsessive, blogger are what passes for editorial standards. Media law doesnrsquot cover the internet the way it covers the traditional media. Newspapers and broadcasters in Britain are held to some of the highest legal standards in the world. If I defame you, you sue me. If a TV report is biased, it gets sanctioned and shamed. There are no standards online.The politics of the Dailyare pretty far removed from my own, but it was Thewhich broke the expenses scandal story and helped hold MPs to account in a way politicians had never been before. Many in the online world find it impossible to dferentiate between fact and opinion. They see a columnist hold a position and conflate it with the position of an entire paper. Or they see a pundit on a talkshow and think thatrsquos the stance of the BBC. However, an edition of Question Time doesnrsquot represent the views of the BBC. I donrsquot represent the views of this newspaper. News is played straight in nearly all British newspapers. A headline isnrsquot the same as the story beneath.When it comes to opinion, though, itrsquos a free country and people can say what they want.Some parts of the media, particularly the BBC, havenrsquot helped themselves, however, by attempting to introduce faux balance into reporting. When it came to Brexit, for example, the economics of leaving were clear ndash it would be a disaster. It was almost impossible to find a reputable economist who would say Brexit was a good idea. So to provide ldquobalance, TV stations sought out pundits to weigh against the economists. In a way, TV couldnrsquot win. The law requires balance, but sometimes balance is absurd.In this case, balance meant that someonersquos feelings were judged as equal to another personrsquos facts. The same happened with climate change ndash the science was conclusive, but to achieve some strange idea of balance, preposterous climate deniers were brought on to news shows to give the counter argument.Confirmation bias At the heart of the angry anti-truth movement lies the problem of confirmation bias. Most people like to hear what makes them feel good. Until the advent of the internet that wasnrsquot possible. Newspaper and TV editors curated the news and let you know what was happening.Now you can retreat into your own self-curated bubble and unless you read intelligent papers, magazines and books, yoursquore unlikely to break out of the bubble. Look at how many people on social media in Scotland were shocked to learn of the Sheku Bayoh case in the wake of the George Floyd killing. If you donrsquot want to know these days, you can just look away ndash andsomething is forced upon you, then you can rail against it for interrupting your world view.Journalism quite literally bursts the bubble. Itrsquos invasive and uncomfortable. As politics has polarised ndash with many of the most extreme now getting their information from fellow extremists online in a mix of conspiracy theories, outright lies and propaganda ndash so anything which attempts to put facts first is seen as partisan. Trying to be impartial these days is often seen as an act of extreme partiality.Therersquos something known as the Eliza Effect. It involves a computer which has been programmed to basically repeat your questions back to you. One conversation went like this: Human: My boyfriend made me come here.Eliza: Your boyfriend made you come here Human: He says Irsquom depressed much of the time.Eliza: I am sorry to hear you are depressed.Human: Itrsquos true. Irsquom unhappy.Eliza: Do you think coming here will help you not to be unhappy Humans liked the computer because it fed back to them their own thoughts. The press does the opposite. It interrupts your thoughts and asks you to think things that might be uncomfortable. That triggers hate and threats.None of this is to compare whatrsquos happening in Britain to whatrsquos going on where in the world. Journalists are being killed with appalling frequency. Now coronavirus is being used to suppress freedom of the press even in EU states like Hungary. However, Britain has seen journalists murdered. Martin OrsquoHagan, who I knew, and Lyra McKee, were both killed by terrorists in Northern Ireland. A journalist in northernEngland, Amy Fenton, had to flee her home recentlywith her child after threats, simply for reporting a court case. The Coventryeditor Keith Perry has warned that ldquotruly appalling online abuse of journalists is becoming the ldquonew normal.The central battle of our time is between reason and emotion. That puts journalism slap bang in the middle of an ideological war. I have not written here in defence of any particular newspaper or broadcaster and I fully acknowledge the failings within my own industry. This is simply a heartfelt plea saying real journalism matters. A society at war with journalism is at war with itself and the biggest casualty will be the rights of citizens and their ability to access the truth."},{"url":null,"title":"lockdown-need-wear-bra","story":"For many, this means saying goodbye to a slower way of le and easing back into the grind of a daily commute.

We are rightly proud in the Northern Isles of having some of the highest standards of produce in the world. Farmers and consumers alike deserve peace of mind about fair standards and fair prices for the food we produce and eat.He continued: “I am astonished that the government has leapt directly from denying earlier this year that lower food standards would be permitted to defending this policy turn wholeheartedly. Undercutting farmers and crofters is not what was promised about the “brave new world” of future trade deals.“It is concerning that the government seems more interested in carrying water for Donald Trump and his #America First# mentality than in supporting our farmers. The government should be accountable to the people they represent, not the whims of US negotiators.”Speaking in the House earlier in the week, Mr Carmichael highlighted the potential impact to farmers and crofters in the Northern Isles: “I would like to hear what the Government’s response is to press reports today that the Government are set to open British markets to food products produced to lower US standards as part of the trade deal with Donald Trump. This was the rhetoric we were given by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster: he told us that there would never be chlorinated chicken on our plate.“Now, in fact, we hear that as a consequence of the so-called dual tarf process it is quite possible that we will see such products being imported to this country. In fact, we are told that the Secretary of State for International Trade is arguing that these tarfs should be reduced to zero over  years, giving farmers time to adjust to the new “normal”.“For the farmers and crofters in my constituency, it will be a hard reality for them to survive in. Because we are a long distance from the market, we have not gone for mass-produced food. We have sought to improve the quality of the products we have and put into market with a view to export. Tarfs on those export markets will be absolutely fatal to the agricultural interests of the highlands and islands.”Responding for the government, the Paymaster General, Penny Mordaunt MP, said: “I fully understand why he may be sceptical about trusting the government, but trust the people. They value animal welfare, we should trust the consumer and there are massive opportunities for our farmers for rest of world trade.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However, we are asking you, for now, to please stay within, or close to, your own local area. And don’t use public transport unless it is absolutely necessary.”The first steps out of lockdown could only involve “careful and cautious” changes, she said.In Orkney, this means that travel on public bus and inter-island ferry and air services will continue to be for essential reasons only during Phase One, with passenger numbers severely restricted as a result of and in line with social distancing requirements.Across Scotland it is assessed that social distancing will reduce transport capacity by  per cent –  per cent and this figure is very much in line with the assessment in Orkney for our ferries and local bus services.During Phase One, there will be no changes to the current timetables for local bus, ferry and inter-island air services.For Orkney Ferries, the aim is to help protect residents in the isles from the risk of infection – along with the crews who operate the service – and to ensure that the ferries can continue to run and deliver freight and other essential supplies.The Scottish Government’s new guidance, published on Tuesday , will help public transport operators and passengers prepare for the further lting of lockdown restrictions at a future date.Detailed information from the government on the newly announced Public Transport Guidance has been sent to the council. Careful consideration is being given to how this might apply locally when the move to Phase Two begins.The guidance does state that people should wear face coverings when using public transport and further information on the council’s expectations on this will be provided in due course.The government has acknowledged that there will be geographic challenges in implementing the guidance and that there can be no ‘one size fits all’ to the approach taken across Scotland.The government’s latest travel advice is available here: https:www.transport.gov.scot coronavirus-covid- transport-transition-plan advice-on-how-to-travel-safely copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It also indicates there will be further major costs from Brexit for years to come and also highlights that without an extension or having a free trade deal in place, Scotland’s agriculture, fisheries and manufacturing sectors will be especially badly hit.Ms Todd said: “Coronavirus is causing enormous economic disruption and people across the Highlands  Islands expect government to be focused on protecting public health and the Scottish economy.“It would be an act of extraordinary recklessness for the UK government to allow us to crash out of the transition period at the end of this year.“The SNP believe the best future for Scotland is as an independent member of the EU.“But regardless of your opinion on Brexit or independence, it makes no sense to crash out of the European single market at precisely the moment we need stability.“Businesses in the Highlands  Islands are focused on securing their future — they simply don’t have the capacity to prepare for Brexit on top of a pandemic.“The UK government must do the sensible thing, protect jobs in the Highlands and Islands and extend the transition period.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The minister has agreed to look at Mr McArthur’s suggestion and highlighted that the government is looking at a range of ways to offer support to farmers.Following the exchange, Mr McArthur said: “The COVID- outbreak has forced ious initiatives planned by SNH and the Orkney Greylag Goose Management group to be put on hold. As a result, local farmers have been faced with having to spend more time and resources trying to keep resident greylag geese numbers under control.“I know from seeing first-hand the impact that greylag geese can have on crops and farmland. Over recent years, as the resident Greylag population has increased, so too has the damage and the cost of trying to address the problem. “It would seem sensible, therefore, to use any funding earmarked for the earlier control measures to help reduce the financial burden on farmers having to take steps themselves. This could include contributing to the cost of cartridges, but there may be other options available.“I’m pleased that the minister responded positively to this suggestion and agree to explore the options for providing such support, as well as wider efforts to bring Orkney’s resident Greylag goose population down to more sustainable levels.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"more vessels but aprils gross tonnage is well down on last year ","story":"Lerwick Harbour saw a big reduction in shipping tonnage during April compared with the same month last year – although the number of arrivals was actually up slightly.A total of  vessels called, compared with  in April , but the overall tonnage dropped from , to ,grt.The deficit was partly due to no cruise ships callinglast year, although ferries, live fish carriers and oil traffic were all also down considerably.The April arrivals this year included  fishing boats,  workboats tenders,  ro ro ferries,  live fish carriers, eight oil boats, eight tugs, five tankers, five ferries and three pilot boats.The fishing vessels comprised  Shetland,  British, three Danish, two French and one Norwegian boat.For the first four months of the year the overall number of arrivals at Lerwick holds up reasonably well with  – , as compared to , in .

I do hope, however, that it offers some help.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/pylon-map-2.jpg","title":"isle of skye pylons plan public urged to have their say on cable route through the west","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineScottish and Southern Electricity Networks is planning to replace the existing electricity powerline that runs from Fort Augustus to Ardmore in the north of Skye.Next Tuesday, Wednesday and ThursdaySSEN Transmission will host its first ever online consultation events to engage with the local community on plans to upgrade the transmission network.The company has said the current line, which was constructed in three distinct sections between  and , is now reaching the end of its operational le.The volume of power on existing overhead wooden pole lines is limited, so the company says that massive steel structures will be required to meet the required capacity all the way from Fort Augustus to Edinbane.Wooden poles will remain in place from Edinbane to Ardmore.SSEN said it would be too costly to place the cable underground.However, some consideration could be given to undergrounding the cable along the most environmentally sensitive sections.The replacement line is seen as essential to maintain security of supply to homes and businesses along its route, as well as to the Western Isles, which is supplied by two subsea cables from Ardmore pointIn addition to keeping the lights on and improving network reliability, the replacement line will also deliver greater network capacity to allow the connection of new renewable energy generation.Consultation on the proposal was originally planned to take place in March this year, but seven public engagements were cancelled due to the Covid- pandemic.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blackouttuesday0206.jpg","title":"racism and respect we should embrace the different cultures when visitors return to the","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA police officer had held him down with his knee on his neck for over eight minutes.Black Lives Matter as an organisation wasn’t created in response to this incident but has been around for seven years, originating after the killing of a black teenager in Florida.Discussing racism is often dficult, it is easy to black out our pictures, write suitably appropriate sentences showing our abhorrence at brutality, and adding liberal and rational support to communities on the other side of the world.But actually discussing, trying to understand and reason why is dficult, because it questions humanity, culture and even our own place and identity.One of my friends was complaining, understandably, about nearly being knocked off his bicycle by two cars.He added that they were “full of Asians” driving erratically.His point was actually the slipping of lockdown and the onset of visitors, and not I believe the race of those visitors, but their colour was an identying feature, and he made comment.We often find ourselves using race and colour in this way, similarly I might mention Asians who stayed in our wigwam cabins, butit is related to something negative, I confess to sometimes feeling uncomfortableI find myself mentioning race as I speak, and wonderingI am sounding racist, orI am just being too sensitive to some politically correct protocol.People look dferent, and much of it is accidental and geographical.If you were born in Bagdad or Delhi you would probably have browner skin thanyou were born in Uig, and possibly a lighter skin colour than should you have been born in Nairobi.It is all an accident of birth, and is to do with the amount of melanin in the body, which protects against harmful ultra violet sunlight.The culture people are born into is also accidental.Again,you were born in Baghdad, then you are likely to be Arabic and Islamic. If born in Delhi then you might be Hindi or Sikh.Kenyans are more likely to be Christian.In Scotland, your type of Christianity might also depend on location catholics and protestants coming from fairly well-defined geographical areas.Of course, culture is more than religion, but even for non-adherents and atheists, it is often a signicant part of the richness of the societies we live in.I was in Bali, Indonesia earlier this year during the festival of Galungan.The place was literally dripping with decorations.Ornate and huge ‘penjor’ lined the roads and adorned buildings, taller than telegraph poles and more prevalent, they were beautully twisted and plaited from palm fronds.Shrines and offerings were everywhere. It was vibrant, colourful and beautul. It was a religious festival, but totally embedded in the culture of the Balinese, in the way Christmas is in Scotland.Balinese people are among the friendliest I have come across in all my travels, a genuine and warmth in their demeanour.Balinese folk are brown in colour, because it is very sunny in Indonesia they have evolved to have more melanin, and therefore more protection against the sun.We don’t choose the colour of our skin, or the culture we are born into, but what we do with our lot is a product of our upbringing, our wider society experience and everything that has happened to us.Most of our behaviour is due to nurture not nature, and is down to choice.Our values and empathies lie in our reaction to our experience and learning from consequence. The problem stems in that much of that experience lies out with our control.If we are black, poor and have been persecuted by institutional society since birth, we might take to the streets.When pepper sprayed, or met with water canon, rubber bullet or tear gas, we might resort to throwing rocks, petrol bombs.Windows might be broken, we might loot.If our role model father figure was a gun toting white supremacist, we might believe ourselves to have a greater entitlement than those of a dferent colour.We would be wrong.These are extreme examples # rationalising and trying to understand the actions of others is fraught with generalisation and perhaps cliché.We can never know what makes a person act the way they do, and we can only imagine being in their shoes, and seeing through the lens of their eyes.What is as tragic as a police officer killing another human being in a slow, seemingly deliberate fashion, is that a society, a culture and its institution can produce someone capable and accepting of such an action.I hope the killer will be brought to justice, and that a grieving family can find peace and forgiveness, but more importantly can we heal the society that produces this behaviour.Most of the ills are due to poverty, deprivation, and the inequality of opportunity.Fear and ignorance is layered on top, with greed and entitlement. Power normally resides with the rich, who want to stay rich.The cry is that we are all the same underneath, black, white, brown yellow, and yet we are all dferent, unique, products of vastly dferent culture, geography, upbringing, beliefs and experience.We are both the same and both dferent, and this confusing contradiction should be embraced, celebrated and above all respected.Scotland is known for celebrating ersity, but it is more than the music, the festivals, the ceremonies and the food, it is the people and their attitudes and their experience we should celebrate.It may be sometime before visitors from other continents arrive back to the Highlands in any number, but our communities as hosts are in a perfect situation to embrace the cultures brought and above all respect both dferences and similarities.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1942-2020-Stalag-9C-No-1401Original.jpg","title":"shinty pipers to commemorate the heroes of st","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine June , was to become one of the most important dates in the history of their regiments.It was to become, arguably the equivalent of the battle of Festubert in World War I which had a colossal and catastrophic impact of shinty playing communities.Both battles are seared in the memory of many families still involved with the game.The contribution through piping towards the special commemoration which has been organised for next Tuesday is being organised by Shinty Memories Scotland, the project which uses archive material to help people with dementia or suffering from isolation and loneliness.Shinty Memories will also be telling some of the stories involving the period after the battle.Shinty Memories ambassador John MacKenzie said: “The name St Valery is right up there with all he battles which have had tragic consequences for many families who were, and still are, involved with shinty.“Some of our greatest players and iniduals were involved at St Valery.

Alliance, the SDLP and Ulster Unionists are also likely to be cautious.Mrs Dodds said that the economic consequences of not opening for business would be colossal.She has written to Health Minister Robin Swann, who is responsible for Northern Ireland#s coronavirus regulations. The Department of Health will now order risk assessment modelling.Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride and Chief Scientic Officer Professor Ian Young are expected to give their views to the Executive before Monday#s meeting.The DUP move comes as the Taoiseach announced a fast-tracking of the Republic#s journey out of lockdown, with all shops allowed to reopen on Monday unless they are in a shopping centre.Mrs Dodds said we had to move more swtly out of lockdown. Every month that passes with signicant restraints on trading is the equivalent of a large scale recession, she said. Northern Ireland output is at least %-% down. I have never tried to sugar-coat this. I fear that the recovery will not be as quick as the decline.The greatest help we as an Executive can provide to people is to allow our economy toagain in a manner that protects both staff and customers. On that basis I have requested that the Executive considers allowing the wider retail sector to open up and begin trading again.The DUP minister said she wanted to see as much of our economy open as possible.She added: Obviously this reopening must be in line with our knowledge about the transmission of the virus and consistent with the medical advice. However, as long as shops, cafes, restaurants, bars and attractions can open up in a safe and sensible way then we should move ahead with that phased reopening.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseA sign encouraging social distancing of two metres FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappA sign encouraging social distancing of two metresMrs Dodds said that the Executive had big decisions to make on social distancing.She noted that UK, Irish, US and Swiss government advice was that people should remain two metres apart.In Germany, the Netherlands and Poland it was one-and-a-half metres. Sweden, Finland, Norway and Austria have adopted the WHO-recommended one metre. New research funded by the WHO suggests that keeping one metre apart can reduce the likelihood of catching Covid by some %, Mrs Dodds said.It is generally accepted that we will be co-existing with this virus for some time. The dference between one and two metres will dramatically impact on workplaces such as a production line on a shop floor or a hotel#s ability to hold s such as wedding receptions, conferences or banquets. Likewise it impacts how many customers a restaurant or bar can safely serve at one time, or how many people can visit a theatre, travel in a bus or sit in a cafe. These are the balance of judgments that the Executive has to make.Businesses have been pressing for a relaxation of guidelines.

Archdeacon David Huss, who is originally from Lisburn, took to the roads of south Donegal on his bicycle this week and will keep up the pace for as long as needed. Due to the current Covid- restrictions, the -year-old has not seen many of his flock in his Donegal group of parishes since the last services were held in churches on March .However, he has been able to keep in touch with them via phone and video calls, alongside online worship. He is now encouraging them to come to their doors and say hello from a distance of at least two metres. That also means he will not be accepting any cups of tea or entering any houses on his rounds. I was missing seeing people face-to-face, he explained.We#re now permitted to do #outdoor# get-togethers as long as we#re not in groups of more than four, so the idea came: why not do it by bike  Archdeacon Huss said his GP we Beverly had a hand in his two-wheeled ministry. The actual idea of going out on the bike was probably hers, so she#s very pleased to see me breaking away from my sedentary lestyle and getting exercise, he added.Day one of his visits around his parishes of Donegal Town, Killymard, Lough Eske and Laghey took place on Wednesday, which coincidentally was World Bicycle Day. I#ll be setting off each day at about pm and finishing who-knows-when, he said.From next week I#ll crank it up to longer distances there are a few hills in the parish but I#m spreading it over several days, so I should be fine.The father-of-three is at pains to point out that he will be observing social distancing at all times while on his travels. I hope to wave to people, stop at the gate, say hello, hopefully say a quick prayer. I won#t go into people#s houses or accept cups of tea, not until I#m permitted to do so, and that won#t be for the foreseeable future. Physical distancing doesn#t mean spiritual distancing, though, so it#s important to keep in pastoral contact. Doing it by bike is a great way of doing it, it#s good for my health and fitness, and it may create a bit more interest.

Every day we put them in a dferent themed pose except for Sundays when we always do church, Sunday school and creches, and then on Saturdays the theme will be sport of one kind or another.Now we are in the winding down stage and the bears will be going into hibernation. We have decided to repeat our top ten favourites including Northern Ireland Bake Off and Wimbledon.When the Belfastfirst covered what the couple were doing - the idea initially was to put a smile on the faces on people walking past their home, but now Mr Corrin said he and his we have benefited so much as well.Mr Corrin continued: My we loves teddy bears and I always got her a Harrods bear as part of her Christmas present when I used to go back and forward to London on business, so now she has  and around  dferent bears in total. We have been so fortunate with the weather but I have put the gazebo up in case it rains because these bears are very precious.My we is shielding and because she is I am too, so we haven#t been beyond our garden gate in ten weeks. We started this because we wanted to put a smile on people#s faces. As the weeks have passed we have heard more and more about the effects being in lockdown is having on people#s mental health and even our Minister said how beneficial this has been for everyone, he said.It has been of great benefit to us too because we have enjoyed seeing people saying hello from the other side of the gate and of course knowing we have raised so much for Marie Curie has been the icing on the cake.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: PSNI to seek prosecution of organisers of Black Lives Matter protests Madeleine McCann: Holidaying family from Louth may have witnessed abduction#I want to do it as best as I can and that#s me as a human being speaking, not me as Trimble speaking# - David Trimble#s son #humbled# to be new mayorRevealed: Michelle O#Neill discussed reconciliation, coronavirus and partition in phone call with Queen#We deserve to know about our parents# - Siblings who were abandoned in tartan bags on both sides of Irish border say story is far from over,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, this occurred on May .Meanwhile, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced the Republic#s five-phase plan had been cut to a four-phase exit, bringing forward the dates for the reopening of stores and parts of the hospitality industry.It led to warnings that Northern Ireland will be disadvantaged unless it moves quicker.TUV leader Jim Allister said the Executive needed to stop dragging its feet and get on with easing our economy-destroying lockdown.Former Economy Minister Simon Hamilton, who is now chief executive of the Belfast Chamber of Commerce, said the Republic had taken a bold approach.He warned we were now at risk of lagging behind, adding that the Republic#s move would increase pressure on the Executive.We#re not saying the date here needs to be exactly the same, but they can#t allow us to fall behind other jurisdictions like our neighbours in the south, he added.However, the Executive Office said that while it understands the damaging effects of the restrictions, the priority is still saving lives.The pressure on Stormont increased in the wake of Mr Varadkar#s lunchtime address on Friday. From Monday all retail outlets in the Republic will reopen with staggered hours. Distance restriction on exercise has been extended from km to km, or any distance within a person#s own county boundaries.It means people here could soon eat a meal in a pub or buy a pair of shoes across the border. Mr Hamilton added: We#re now sitting as a bit of an outlier. England is moving forward with dates for their retail and hospitality, and the Republic is accelerating its original timetable, which is interesting and signicant, and highlights the dichotomy on two sides of the border.We have dates for some retail to reopen, and hotels, but in the south dates are being brought forward. The contrast is that very soon you can go for a meal in the pub in Dublin, in Donegal or Dundalk, but you can#t in Belfast, and you can buy a suit and new shoes in Dublin, but you can#t in Belfast.Hospitality Ulster chief executive Colin Neill said pubs and restaurants also needed the certainty of when they could open.With the Government in the Irish Republic announcing that it is bringing forward its dates for when retail and hospitality can reopen, the Northern Ireland Executive urgently needs to follow suit, he insisted.The Northern Ireland Hotel Federation said it hoped hotels could reopen faster.They are slated to reopen here on July  - the original date set in the south, which has been brought forward to June .We are aware that this is the wish of hotels in a number of locations who rely on a strong summer season, said its CEO, Janice Gault.The Nisra figures, which showed  deaths in the week to May , are less than a third of the  recorded in one week at the height of the crisis. They had fallen to , ,  and  in previous weeks.It led Professor Karol Sikora, a former World Health Organisationexpert, to declare the worst ravages of the crisis is over in Northern Ireland.He believes we can now afford to follow in the Republic#s footsteps. Prof Sikora said coming out of the lockdown is always a calculated gamble, but pointed to countries like Austria, Denmark and the Czech Republic, saying they have emerged from restrictions weeks ago without seeing a second wave of cases.He added: Northern Ireland has been good about the lockdown. I think you can come out faster.The Executive Office said: Ministers understand the damaging effects of the restrictions on people#s livelihoods and their health and wellbeing, and have agreed not to keep any restriction in place longer than necessary.But the priority is still saving lives and the Executive will continue to be guided by the scientic evidence and medical advice to move through recovery in the safest way possible.

The following day, the story of the baby left in a driveway appeared on the front page of the #Belfast #, but no one came forward to claim him.Across the Border, six years later, Donal Boyle, a lorry driver from Macroom, Co Cork, was on his way to Belfast when he stopped in Dundalk to make a call. Inside a phonebox close to a local hospital, he found a red tartan duffel bag with a baby girl stowed safely inside. The little girl was wearing a handmade dress and the bottle placed next to her was still warm. Again, efforts to trace the baby#s parents proved unsuccessful.Without birth records or parents, the two abandoned babies were adopted and grew up as David McBride and Helen Ward.They both led happy lives, David in Lisburn and Helen in Dublin, but fundamental questions about identity, about when and where they were born, meant a reckoning with the past was inevitable.When I was , I asked my [adoptive] dad, Helen told the Irish Independent this week. He said, #Let sleeping dogs lie# and I think he said that because he wanted to protect me.Helen, now , made several fruitless attempts to discover more about her origins, including a  interview with the Irish Independent which led her to Donal Boyle and an appearance on RTÉ#s #Liveline#. Separately, David launched an appeal for information on the radio in  and appeared on the Gerry Kelly TV show in the North, also in vain.I had sort of given up a wee bit, said David, speaking from his home in Birmingham this week.I did a newspaper article in  but that was it then. It is like hitting your head against a brick wall sometimes, so you go through phases.Despite several news stories at the time, no one ever made the connection about the tartan bags. Helen just south of the Border, David north of it.That is until Ariel Bruce, a social worker who has made a career of tracking down long-lost relatives, entered the frame.My sister encouraged me to send my DNA profile to Ariel to seeshe could find a match, said David.Separately, Helen had entered her own DNA on to the system a year before, a th birthday present from her best friend Eimear.It was the best gt anyone has ever given me, Helen said.Through the advances of modern science, there then followed a remarkable discovery. When Ariel put David#s DNA into the online database, she discovered he had a perfect match.Not a parent in fact, but a sister, a full sister. It was Helen.Ariel had never come across anything like it before, said David.Helen doesn#t know this, but I was asked to send a second profile. I think they wanted another test because at that point they had spoken to Helen and they wanted to confirm exactly what they found. I ended up doing two DNA tests.What followed was an emotional meeting, featured last weekend on #Long Lost Lives, Born Without a Trace#, an ITV programme that tracks down lost relatives. In an extraordinary moment captured on screen, David and Helen met for the first time.Tears were shed, stories exchanged. And they were left with more questions than answers. The show has not been broadcast in Ireland, prompting the siblings to tell their story here, in the hope that they can piece together the missing parts of a puzzle that kept them apart for years.We know there are people in Ireland who know something, he said. We would appeal to those people to come forward and confide in us. We deserve to know about our parents.As the programme revealed, when researchers trawled an ancestry DNA site, they found profiles that matched Helen and David. Family members connected to both their parents had uploaded their DNA, leading the team to establishing who their mother and father were.David and Helen#s mother was Catholic who had a love affair spanning almost  years with their father, a married man with  children. Both lived in Dublin.Our father was a musician who played in a Dublin dancehall and I presume that#s how they met, said David. Our mother worked in retail. She was from Kerry but had moved to Dublin. We know little about their relationship as it stands.Both birth parents have sadly passed away. Their father died in , aged , and their mother in  at the age of .The siblings have also learned that their mother was  when she had David, and  when she gave birth to Helen - never marrying or having any more children.Illegitimacy and the religious ide sealed David and Helen#s fates their mother#s death three years ago meant some mysteries would always remain unsolved, some wounds impossible to heal.If we had met her before she passed, I probably would have wanted to know why she did what she did, said Helen.From that question you would probably get answers as to the times, as to the circumstances, as to her choices.Out of respect for two families they are still trying to get to know, both David and Helen have asked that, for now, their birth parents are not named.They have four older sisters and  older brothers on their father#s side and extended family members on their mother#s side, and they are still making tentative steps to learn more about each parent.We are hoping this will help jog memories, said David.In Kerry, someone might recall something. With a bit of luck, it might jog the memories of our mother#s side too. People might say, #Look, we have kept this under the carpet for too long, we need to come out and reveal this, particularly because Helen and David need to know.# Our mother and father have passed away. They were our parents and we have a right to know what went on between them.Central to their shared story, the siblings believe, is the Ireland of the s, a time and place that was a cold house for unmarried mothers.Back then, a child born out of wedlock was a scandal, but a child born to a Catholic mother and a married Protestant father was another scandal entirely.After meeting each other for the first time last October, the siblings journeyed to Kerry, where they laid flowers at their mother#s graveside.It was a journey I never thought I would make with a brother, said Helen.She was our mother and we believe she wanted the best for us. In doing what she did, she sentenced herself to a letime of suffering in silence.As part of their journey together, each has visited the spot where the other was found and they both now have theories on why their parents did what they did.In , Donal Boyle told Helen that he recalled there was a car parked close to the phone box - and while he was inside, this car circled around before driving off. It is a detail that still niggles.There are a few dferent ways of looking at it, said Helen. Until we find out more, we can#t actually say, right, #It was your mum and dad who put you in the phonebox that night#. Was it a friend  Was it a grandparent  Was it an aunt  Friends of my father, friends of my mother Although lockdown has prevented meetings with extended family members on both parents# sides, David had a brief meeting with some of his relatives before Christmas.I met some of our mother#s family in Kerry, he said.I learned that she had a personality very much like Helen#s - she was a dressmaker, like Helen. She was sociable and articulate and very kind.Like his sister, David believes someone helped his mother on the night she left Helen and that their parents may have been influenced by other people when decisions were being made.I think there are people who assisted our parents, he said.I am almost certain the lady who was seen the night that Helen was found was our mother. I also think it was our mother who placed Helen in the telephone box.Whether the gentleman that was in the car was our father, or a family relative of our mother, I don#t know.It may have been that the inidual who went along with our mother that night may have been going along to make sure that Helen was placed in a telephone box to make sure what they had agreed was happening.The siblings believe shame and fear may stop them getting to the full truth.Several themes run through their story, close-knit communities in rural Ireland, the influence of the Church, the attitude of society to unmarried mothers, and the bubbling tensions in the North.There was a lot at stake, said David.If they had been found out, their lives were over. They would have been sent to prison and cast out by their families.As Helen and David spoke via a shared video-call this week, thoughts ed to the almost identical bags each was placed in as babies.The siblings have learned that their father was born in Scotland and moved to Dublin as a baby.Was the red tartan a nod to his heritage  Or is the simpler explanation that their mother wanted someone to make a link between her two children  I think there is a connection with the bag, said David.There was six years between us. Our mother or father, or both of them, had to find the same bag, which was the same colour and the same make. I think someone wanted a connection to be made.The question of how no connection was made until last year is one they have both discussed.We were found in two dferent jurisdictions in the s, said David. There was a huge mistrust between the RUC and gardaí at that time.I would question how much co-operation there was between the two jurisdictions at the time and whether or not there was a concerted effort to link up.To date, the siblings have no knowledge that their parents had any link to the North.Again, they are looking for answers about why David was placed there, on a quiet residential street, under the cover of darkness.Our story didn#t end with the programme, said Helen.It brings us to another chapter, one we will share together as we try to find out the truth.I hope our story will encourage people to let the secrets of the past be free, for their own peace of mind and for those who need answers.

Kerry keeper Shane Ryan managed to claw Paddy Smalls speculative shot from above the bar, before toe-poking to the safety of Stephen OBrien. The Kenmare man offloaded to David Moran, who in turn thumped a long ball down the Cusack Stand sideline. When defender Davy Byrne lost the flight of the ball, Tommy Walsh didnt need a second invitation. Killian Spillane burst purposefully through the middle. Walsh, only on the pitch two minutes, gave him the ball. Dublin had enough bodies to deal with it, but Spillane had other ideas. Fresh and fearless. With one feint of the shoulders, he was onto his left foot before burying to the net. Stephen Cluxton shouldve done better, but the Kerry mans low bolt unleashed a bottled emotion from five years of waiting. googletag.cmd.push In , he was the fulcrum of Jack OConnors attack as Kerry won a first minor All-Ireland in two decades. With - to his name and a natural ability to kick off both feet, he lit up that summers championship. In most other counties, he wouldve been straight into the senior team the following season. This was the year of the senior and double. How can we ever forget Kieran Donaghys retort at Joe Brollys statement of Kerrys demise. His family tradition would suggest that he was born to play for Kerry, but Spillane – son of four-time winner Tom - was going to have to wait. googletag.cmd.push Stephen OBrien, Johnny Buckley, Donnchadh Walsh, Paul Geaney, Donaghy and James ODonoghue held the senior jerseys. Darren OSullivan, Kieran OLeary, Declan OSullivan and Barry John Keane were all on the bench. When the squad was announced for the  Super s game with Donegal, Spillane was listed at number , but started the game. Peter Keanes secret weapon notched three points in a - apiece blockbuster. He had arrived and his All-Ireland final goal announced him as a Kerry star of the future. A marked man. On the Ring of Kerry, you will pass through Templenoe. Apart from the sign, you wont even know youve passed through it until you reach the nearby Kenmare. The clubs pitch, which produced Tom, Mick and Pat Spillane, hugs the bay. They supplied four players to the Kingdom squad for last years All-Ireland final - Gavin Crowley, Tadhg Morley, brothers Adrian and Killian Spillane. Almost a tenth of their , from a club that won an All-Ireland junior title. ANOTHER PATH In years between being a minor winner and Eacuteamonn Fitzmaurice handing him a senior league debut, in , Killian played on the Kerry junior team. Jason Foley and Graham OSullivan, mainstays of the current defence, did the same. Conor Cox, now playing with Roscommon, used the junior grade as a step ladder to the next level of his career. It has a ruling that enforces a county to change their entire team after winning it, yet Kerry have still won it five times in a row. Its not the most prestigious title in the world, but its football and a shop window. The fact that Kerry are getting such a pull from the bottom rung, gives them such an advantage. Declan OSullivan hails from Dromoid Pearses. In Tyrone, you have Rock supplying Kieran Gourley when Tyrone were in their pomp. Galway goalkeeper and An Spideal man Maghnus Breatnach has played for the juniors, a grade that helped elevate his clubmate Antaine Oacute Laoiacute to Paacutedraic Joyces attention. Mayos Darren Coen was the same. Derry are nowhere close to getting this type of . In the last  seasons,  players have played league or championship. From John Brennans Ulster final season of  to the present day, none come from junior clubs. Goalkeeper Oran Hartin had two appearances and played junior championship for Limavady, but of the  seasons, they have played at intermediate level for six of them. Of the , only  hail from intermediate clubs. For the purposes of the study, the club is graded on the number of years playing at championship level in the last decade. It ranks Greenlough and Newbridge as senior, with Foreglen at intermediate. Enda Lynnhas represented Derry most during the window. Oisin Duffy, Niall Keenan and Neil Forester are the only intermediate players to exceed  outings, with Marty Donaghy taking his tally to  in the  qualier exit to Longford. In terms of championship action, nobody outside of the senior grade has played more than  times, though Niall Keenan is likely to be the first. A debate for another day is the lack of city players that have made the breakthrough. The total sits at three. Neil Forester and Eoghan Concannon, neither of whom are on Rory Gallaghers senior squad, are two. Ben McCarron is the third. Of around  boys in a year group at St Columbs, I remember Eamonn Burns saying that only around  had the basic skills by the time they entered the gates in first year. Some dont have clubs at all. Until that changes, it is dficult to see the city really giving Derry the support it needs to progress as a county. And there are people promoting Gaelic games in the city, who are as passionate as anywhere  in Ireland. There just arent enough. When I think of the joy in the face of Neil Forester after winning games with Derry minors and the sheer dejection after Castledawson beat Steelstown in the  intermediate final. Real emotion. If only there were more like him to drive the GAA message in the city. Back to the topic in question, getting players from minor to senior. The Derry conundrum. Rather than going around in circles, why not enter a team in the All-Ireland junior championship  Since there are no Ulster teams involved, it would take travel and money. And it would take time. Derry have been at the top of the charts in recent years, in terms of funding from Croke Park. Maybe it is time to filter some of that cash into the area that is failing most and leave underageto clubs and schools, who are continually churning out players. From chatting to a few people from non senior clubs, there could be an appetite for it. But it would need to be done properly. Not a half-arsed job. As a starting point, draw up a football development committee. Call a meeting, for all the captains and chairmen of Derrys intermediate and junior clubs and put out the feelers. Ask the hard questions. Why have players been overlooked  Leave it open to players who either have not made the U , or are too old for it. Take a look at the club manager circuit and approach someone to take it on. It wouldnt take up that much time, as players need to have access to their club. They have the first draw on the players after all. Essentially, it is a development squad for the seniors. What would it have not done for a Lee Moore, who was one of the best county minors in Ireland for two seasons  He wasnt ready to displace Paddy Bradley. Who was, Lee had all the qualities to have been his successor. A Paudie ONeill needs his class properly massaged into county senior player. It is a long shot and it will be hard to sell. There will be plenty of obstacles. But isnt there always, in all walks of le. If it was easy, it would have been done already. In the last ten years, Neil Forester, Niall Keenan, Oisin Duffy, Eoghan Concannon, Marty Donaghy and Bliain Gormley are the six intermediate players, from the  who have worn an Oakleaf championship jersey, to have played in the championship for Derry from outside the senior ranks. Its not enough. Kerrys Shane Ryan and Killian Spillane dont play for senior clubs. They were county minors in , and five years later – in their senior debut season – they were on the front line, battling for Sam. ALSO READ - Be careful what you wish for. More...

Stephen Cluxton shouldve done better, but the Kerry mans low bolt unleashed a bottled emotion from five years of waiting. googletag.cmd.push In , he was the fulcrum of Jack OConnors attack as Kerry won a first minor All-Ireland in two decades. With - to his name and a natural ability to kick off both feet, he lit up that summers championship. In most other counties, he wouldve been straight into the senior team the following season. This was the year of the senior and double. How can we ever forget Kieran Donaghys retort at Joe Brollys statement of Kerrys demise. His family tradition would suggest that he was born to play for Kerry, but Spillane – son of four-time winner Tom - was going to have to wait. googletag.cmd.push Stephen OBrien, Johnny Buckley, Donnchadh Walsh, Paul Geaney, Donaghy and James ODonoghue held the senior jerseys. Darren OSullivan, Kieran OLeary, Declan OSullivan and Barry John Keane were all on the bench. When the squad was announced for the  Super s game with Donegal, Spillane was listed at number , but started the game. Peter Keanes secret weapon notched three points in a - apiece blockbuster. He had arrived and his All-Ireland final goal announced him as a Kerry star of the future. A marked man. On the Ring of Kerry, you will pass through Templenoe. Apart from the sign, you wont even know youve passed through it until you reach the nearby Kenmare. The clubs pitch, which produced Tom, Mick and Pat Spillane, hugs the bay. They supplied four players to the Kingdom squad for last years All-Ireland final - Gavin Crowley, Tadhg Morley, brothers Adrian and Killian Spillane. Almost a tenth of their , from a club that won an All-Ireland junior title. ANOTHER PATH In years between being a minor winner and Eacuteamonn Fitzmaurice handing him a senior league debut, in , Killian played on the Kerry junior team. Jason Foley and Graham OSullivan, mainstays of the current defence, did the same. Conor Cox, now playing with Roscommon, used the junior grade as a step ladder to the next level of his career. It has a ruling that enforces a county to change their entire team after winning it, yet Kerry have still won it five times in a row. Its not the most prestigious title in the world, but its football and a shop window. The fact that Kerry are getting such a pull from the bottom rung, gives them such an advantage. Declan OSullivan hails from Dromoid Pearses. In Tyrone, you have Rock supplying Kieran Gourley when Tyrone were in their pomp. Galway goalkeeper and An Spideal man Maghnus Breatnach has played for the juniors, a grade that helped elevate his clubmate Antaine Oacute Laoiacute to Paacutedraic Joyces attention. Mayos Darren Coen was the same. Derry are nowhere close to getting this type of . In the last  seasons,  players have played league or championship. From John Brennans Ulster final season of  to the present day, none come from junior clubs. Goalkeeper Oran Hartin had two appearances and played junior championship for Limavady, but of the  seasons, they have played at intermediate level for six of them. Of the , only  hail from intermediate clubs. For the purposes of the study, the club is graded on the number of years playing at championship level in the last decade. It ranks Greenlough and Newbridge as senior, with Foreglen at intermediate. Enda Lynnhas represented Derry most during the window. Oisin Duffy, Niall Keenan and Neil Forester are the only intermediate players to exceed  outings, with Marty Donaghy taking his tally to  in the  qualier exit to Longford. In terms of championship action, nobody outside of the senior grade has played more than  times, though Niall Keenan is likely to be the first. A debate for another day is the lack of city players that have made the breakthrough. The total sits at three. Neil Forester and Eoghan Concannon, neither of whom are on Rory Gallaghers senior squad, are two. Ben McCarron is the third. Of around  boys in a year group at St Columbs, I remember Eamonn Burns saying that only around  had the basic skills by the time they entered the gates in first year. Some dont have clubs at all. Until that changes, it is dficult to see the city really giving Derry the support it needs to progress as a county. And there are people promoting Gaelic games in the city, who are as passionate as anywhere  in Ireland. There just arent enough. When I think of the joy in the face of Neil Forester after winning games with Derry minors and the sheer dejection after Castledawson beat Steelstown in the  intermediate final. Real emotion. If only there were more like him to drive the GAA message in the city. Back to the topic in question, getting players from minor to senior. The Derry conundrum. Rather than going around in circles, why not enter a team in the All-Ireland junior championship  Since there are no Ulster teams involved, it would take travel and money. And it would take time. Derry have been at the top of the charts in recent years, in terms of funding from Croke Park. Maybe it is time to filter some of that cash into the area that is failing most and leave underageto clubs and schools, who are continually churning out players. From chatting to a few people from non senior clubs, there could be an appetite for it. But it would need to be done properly. Not a half-arsed job. As a starting point, draw up a football development committee. Call a meeting, for all the captains and chairmen of Derrys intermediate and junior clubs and put out the feelers. Ask the hard questions. Why have players been overlooked  Leave it open to players who either have not made the U , or are too old for it. Take a look at the club manager circuit and approach someone to take it on. It wouldnt take up that much time, as players need to have access to their club. They have the first draw on the players after all. Essentially, it is a development squad for the seniors. What would it have not done for a Lee Moore, who was one of the best county minors in Ireland for two seasons  He wasnt ready to displace Paddy Bradley. Who was, Lee had all the qualities to have been his successor. A Paudie ONeill needs his class properly massaged into county senior player. It is a long shot and it will be hard to sell. There will be plenty of obstacles. But isnt there always, in all walks of le. If it was easy, it would have been done already. In the last ten years, Neil Forester, Niall Keenan, Oisin Duffy, Eoghan Concannon, Marty Donaghy and Bliain Gormley are the six intermediate players, from the  who have worn an Oakleaf championship jersey, to have played in the championship for Derry from outside the senior ranks. Its not enough. Kerrys Shane Ryan and Killian Spillane dont play for senior clubs. They were county minors in , and five years later – in their senior debut season – they were on the front line, battling for Sam. ALSO READ - Be careful what you wish for. More...

Seldom would you attend a Lavey game without bumping into him. He was never far from the effort needed to keep the wheels of the club turning. Every management team he was involved with, benefited from his diligent efforts. And he never walked past without speaking. Ians gone. And we are devastated, read the words on Laveys social media. In our club, Ian Hendry was peerless - as passionate Lavey man as there has ever been. Jovial, witty, unassuming and steadfastly loyal, Ian Hendry cut no corners in his work over many years with all Lavey teams, the statement continued. googletag.cmd.push His dedication to the cause will be the source of many stories over the coming days, weeks and indeed years. He ferociously protected all things Lavey footballs, hurls, sliotars, jerseys and above all, club pride. Two seasons ago, Lavey Us played in the final of the Paul McGirr U tournament, in the teeming rain. A game they almost wrestled back from Carrickmores clutches. In defeat, the team bounced back to win the Ulster minor tournament. On that day in Dromore, in the midst of the Us disappointment, a football went missing. Ian wasnt defeated. Not yet. When Lavey ed in for an Ulster league game with Dromore the following, he went looking again and found it. googletag.cmd.push It typied the unyielding determination of Ian Hendry who was above all a kind hearted and generous man, a loving husband, father and devoted grandfather, Laveys statement added. Our thoughts and prayers are with Ians we Agnes, daughters Orla, Mairead and Dymphna, sons Cahal and Eunan and all the wider family circle and friends. Like the story of the lost and recovered football, Ian never forgot. And Lavey will never forget Ian Hendry. Ar dheis Deacute go raibh a anam uasal.

The Church of Ireland Bishop of Derry and Raphoe, Rt RevAndrew Forster, joined scores of parishioners from the Parish of St Augustine’s and further afield for the service at Bishop Street car park in the city centre on Sunday morning to mark Pentecost Day. The service,which took place in glorious sunshine,was led by the Rector of St Augustines - ‘The Wee Church on the Walls’ -Rev Nigel Cairns. The car park adjoins St Augustine’s Parish Hall and is opposite the city’s courthouse. A team of volunteers, dressed in ‘high-vis’ vests and PPE gear, oversaw a one-way, ‘car ferry’ type system, that meant cars were directed in one entrance and out bya dferent route after the service. googletag.cmd.push Social-distancing guidelines required all those present to remain in their cars during worship, and parish volunteers ensured that none of the worshippers fell victim to the soaring temperature. Bishop Andrew, who preached the sermon,welcomed the congregation to what he called his ‘back garden’ . He said: St Augustine’s was known as ‘the Wee Church on the Walls’. Today, we’re the wee church without walls. I always think about St Augustine’s as the wee Church with a big heart and today we’re showing our big heart because we’re together, worshipping God on this Pentecost Sunday. googletag.cmd.push “This is definitely a first for me,” the Bishop said, “and I would imagine it’s a first for many of you as well, but God is here and we worship him in spirit and in truth.” Rev Cairns echoed Bishop Forster’s welcome to the first ‘Drive-through Church’ in the inner city, and thanked all those who had helped make the service possible. He said the St Augustine’s parishioners would be gathering for worship in the same location again next Sunday.

The plan was to bring entertainment to the war weary inhabitants of the town.This meeting would lead to the formation of St Patrickrsquos Operatic and Pantomime Society and their first production was Phyllis, the Farmerrsquos Daughter mdash a title that has dated somewhat.The public responded by volunteering as actors, stage hands, working with costumes and music.Principals and chorus rehearsed separately. Only one week before opening night did they merge, coming together for the first time on the stage of St Patrickrsquos Hall.It was advertised as lsquoA Feast of Music, Song and Dancersquo boasting  voices. Rehearsal took place in the McLean home, the cast rehearsed upstairs, while machinists and costumiers worked downstairs.Phyllis, the Farmerrsquos Daughter was performed on Sunday, May , and Monday, May , .It proved successful enough to be followed in  by other productions such as Tangles, The Enchanted Rose and Quest of Olwen.The performances, in the absence of film footage and photographs, appear to be lost in the haze of time.Tangles, described as a grand musical comedy, was performed in St Patrickrsquos Hall on Monday, June , the night before the Normandy Landings. The performance was in aid of the Down County Infirmary.The programme included cast and production notes. The actors, credited as lsquoMortalsrsquo included Michael Tomelty as Lollipop, Sally King as Princess Pansy, Lillian Lundy as Dame Mouldy, Leslie Rice as Lord Humbug and Master Michael Rea as the Inn Keeperrsquos Son. lsquoImmortalsrsquo included Peggy Halloran as Titania, Maura Blaney as Nona and Mary Gilmore as lsquoCinderellarsquo.Also included was an array of guardsmen, a chorus of fairies, village chorus, court dancers, innkeeper chorus, fairy partners, bunnies and a chorus of gnomes, who included Maureen Dorrian, Annie Murphy and June Doyle. In all, the cast numbered .The scenic artist was Mr James Maguire and the costume designer was Mrs OrsquoKelly. In charge of actors make-up were Mrs Maguire, Kathleen Branf and Mrs Gilmore.But, what was the story  With appearances from gnomes and Cinderella it may have had a little to do with fairyland.Is there anyone out there who remembers  At this distance, it is just a forgotten show, one of many that enter-tained people at a most dficult time in history.Around Lecale and where, there were a number of amateur dramatic companies, many more than today, who performed many shows. Here are but a sample.Old King Cole by May King, with nine scenes and a chorus of , was a three-hour show, staged in St Patrickrsquos Hall, Downpatrick, at pm on Sunday, February , .Reserved tickets were on sale from Mr Breen, Mr Fox and Mr Doris.Ballykilbeg Dramatic Society gave the public a production of Paul Twyning by George Shiels on Sunday, March , and Tuesday, March , , with a repeat performance in St Patrickrsquos Hall, Downpatrick, the following Sunday.Kilclief Parish Amateur Dramatic Club staged Shielsrsquo new comedy, The Fort Field, in St Malachyrsquos Hall in the village on Sunday, May , . They also performed it in the Stella Maris Hall in Strangford the following Friday.Killyleagh Dramatic Society presented St John Ervinersquos lsquoBoydrsquos Shop at the Belfast Dramatic Festival during the first week of September , having staged it during the late summer of that year in Strangford.On the night of Sunday, November , , you could treat yourself to Stars over Ballynoe, an all-star iety concert in St Patrickrsquos Parochial Hall, Ballynoe, with Alister Dick, the famous Irish tenor, Alfie Donnelly, Irelandrsquos funniest comedian, the Legamaddy Dancers and the Portaferry Hawaiian Band.

Hopefully, therersquos more to come, he said.Joersquos latest work is QUINN - No Place to Hide, a standalone follow-up to a successful launch of the first in the series. The title is dedicated to his great grandfather, Sam Quinn, a man Joe admired for the way in which he dealt with the harshness of le in Downpatrick at the turn of the twentieth century.ldquoHe worked -hour shts, six days a week, as a yard foreman at the Rearsquos bottling plant in Market Street, Downpatrick. It was backbreaking work for which he earned a pittance to feed a large family. He never complained, never took a holiday, and never ventured outside the confines of the town. He lived through two world wars, the creation of the Irish Republic, and countless other momentous times, yet he kept his head down and simply got on with his own le.Joe is quick to point out that the character in his latest book is nothing like his ancestor. ldquoAll Irsquove taken is his name. My version of Quinn is that of an international assassin who leaves Downpatrick to join the Irish Rangers and later becomes a gun for hire in America. Talk about two dferent worlds! Perhaps though, therersquos a bit of parallel in that I transferred old Sam Quinnrsquos stoicism and relentless nature into a make-believe cut-out who lives his le by those very ideals.With a -year background in journalism, it was hardly surprising that Joe wanted to keep writing when he switched careers in  to head up Down Business Centre, a support enterprise agency to help promote start-up businesses.He said: ldquoI loved the interaction with local entrepreneurs, but the writing bug doesnrsquot go away. I had always an idea for a book and couldnrsquot stop scratching the itch. After a few years, I decided to put it into action.That first book mdash SOMEONE HAS TO PAY mdash was a product of the Northern Ireland Troubles. It is set in the unlikely surroundings of Bishopscourt, a former RAF base just outside Downpatrick, and features a British government elite squad assembled under the relative anonymity of the old complex for the purposes of waging a final shoot-to-kill war against the IRA.Joersquos own assessment of the story brings a wry smile. ldquoItrsquos a far-fetched idea, isnrsquot it  It couldnrsquot have happened, could it  Thatrsquos the essence of the storyteller and I guess itrsquos why I love doing it.A recurring theme in Joersquos books is that he likes toin a mention of his hometown whenever possible. Yoursquoll find Downpatrick cropping up a lot in background narratives, or as the setting for a few hair-raising episodes that attempt to weave their way into the history and fabric of the area.ldquoItrsquos just something I like to do. Irsquom a Downpatrick man and I have the urge to shout about it when the chance arises. Wersquove a lot going for us in this area and it can only do good to let the world know wersquore here.One of his other books SPENT FORCE, which was a crime thriller set in the West of Ireland and featured a fading Garda detective, attracted praise from two signicant sources. One was Ken Bruen, the international bestselling author of the Jack Taylor Irish crime series, who wrote: ldquoSometimes a book comes along that you instantly know......damn, I am now going to have to read this all over again for the sheer joy of the narrative. It means that I will have to swear off other books for a time as very few can provide the utter joy and delight of Joe McCoubreyrsquos superb novel.Another unexpected source was a serving Garda sergeant who posted a glowing review on the Amazon . ldquoA top-class novel which deserves high praise. I am from Irish law enforcement and this novel is as close to a real-le investigation as you can get. Gripping from start to finish, totally believable characters, strong storyline, Highly Recommended.Joe admits he was floored by the feedback. ldquoOn the one hand there was an endorsement by perhaps Irelandrsquos foremost crime thriller author, while on the other there was vindication from a policeman that the research and effort to get things right had paid off. Itrsquos what any author craves, and itrsquos what makes you want to get back over the keyboard and start into the next adventure.That next adventure is taking Joe back to the West of Ireland to team up again with his favourite Garda detective. The sequel is provisionally titled FORCE OF NATURE which delves into the murky world of a serial killer. Not surprisingly, Downpatrick features heavily again.ldquoYes, the killerrsquos first three victims are young girls from Downpatrick. The story will move from here to Westport and back again. Irsquom still not sure how it will end, and thatrsquos as much an appeal to me as it is to the reader.Joe explains that hersquos not a dedicated story plotter. ldquoI use a broad brush. I get an idea and just run with it. I donrsquot like to be confined to structure from start to finish, with the result that Irsquom not quite sure where Irsquom going from one chapter to another. I think of it as being spontaneous, which means I usually go off on tangents that keeps things fresh and moving along. Itrsquos a seat-of-the-pants alternative to being a plotter.Joe publishes all his books under his own publishing house, Inishfree Communications, which also offers support to local writers. To date, he has helped eight others to complete their author journey ndash between them they have published more than  titles. He provides proofing, formatting, and design services, including suggestions on the most effective covers for inidual books.ldquoItrsquos a big part of what I do these days, says Joe. ldquoThere are lots of budding writers and independent authors out there who just need a bit of extra help and encouragement to bring their work in front of the masses. I get as much of a kick out of seeing these books go on sale as I do from my own works.Joe McCoubreyrsquos books are available as paperbacks or eBooks on the Amazon and Barnes  Noble s..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd June 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Call for hedge removal after near miss  ","story":"AN overgrown hedge close to a BT exchange in Killyleagh is being blamed for a near miss involving a pedestrian and a bus last week.A woman who was forced to step on to the main road to avoid the hedge was almost struck by the vehicle as it passed, leaving both her and the driver shaken.BT has confirmed that it plans to cut the hedge this week, but local councillor Billy Walker said the telecoms giant must go further and remove it completely.He said there was a wall behind the hedge, suggesting that once the hedge is removed, BT would only have to build a small fence on top of it to secure its base.ldquoThe overgrown hedge has been an issue for many years and there have been countless near misses involving people who have had to step off the footpath to pass, including mums with prams. What happened last Friday is the final straw as far as I am concerned, declared Cllr Walker.ldquoThe only sensible solution is to remove the hedge in its entirety. To do so would not cost a lot of money, but would save lives as at this time of year as people would not have to walk on a busy main road to pass.Cllr Walker says he has raised the issue with the telecoms company over the years, but was told the hedge could not be cut back as it was the nesting season.ldquoMy biggest fear has always been that someone could end up getting killed or seriously injured at this part of Killyleagh. While I am thankful the woman who stepped off the footpath last Friday was not seriously injured, this must be the last incident of this kind, said Cllr Walker.ldquoI am appealing to BT to do the decent thing and finally remove the hedge.

Some people have looked at Everest and thought climbing it is necessary. Others call those people crazy.Everesting is described as ldquofiendishly simple, yet brutally hard. Ride hill repeats on any hill anywhere in the world mdash or on Zwt, the virtual cycling simulator mdash in a single activity until you climb the equivalent height of Mount Everest.The concept was created by Hells , who also control the induction into the Everesting Hall of Fame. Website Everesting.cc contains the rules to follow.Well, call me crazy, but I did it. No, I didnrsquot fly to Nepal and climb the actual mountain. Irsquom not a former pro athlete or extraordinarily gted human, nor am I an adventure adrenaline junkie looking for a fix. Irsquom just a  something mdash  to be precise mdash son of God who has a family, a job, a dog, a bicycle, and I landed myself in the Everesting Hall of Fame. And you can too.I decided to use the challenge to help raise funds for mental health organisations Aware and Ballynahinch Counselling Service, or The Hub, as itrsquos known locally. My initial target was pound but I was astounded and humbled by the generosity of people. In the end donations totalled pound,.I chose to start at am so I could have family support at the finish. Despite the early start I was joined by my we, Jennie, and through the day she was a great support, bringing me fresh drinks and relaying messages of support.I turned on my favourite music playlist and hit the hill with a measured effort that I thought I could sustain for hours. I planned a bidon of sports drink for each ascent, as well as -g carbs per hour. Real foods early in the ride and gels and sugary drinks for later in the ride.The first three or four ascents felt strangely comfortable, averaging  minutes up each time. I was almost an hour ahead of my estimated -hour schedule by midday. I later noticed some friends,, who were tracking my progress, were saying how strong I was riding and hoped that I wouldnrsquot pay for it later.They were right! Ascents six and seven were so tough, even to the point where I felt physically ill, and my times were now over  minutes per climb.vEveresters add the tag lsquovEverestingrsquo to their Zwt profile name which means anyone on the course that sees it knows you are vEveresting and many will ride with you, congratulate you, give you a thumbs up, or just encourage you to keep going.These wonderful sherpas made it a much more enjoyable experience, especially during the sixth and seventh ascents when it was dficult to want to keep riding and my butt was telling me that I was crazy to push on.Despite wanting to reach the finish as soon as possible, I had to listen to my body, and so I stopped for some food and a bit of a rest. Another quick shower, kit change and application of chamois cream, and I was ready to continue.I was joined online this time by good friends Nathan Mullan and Stephen Hanna, both from Dromara Cycling Club, and Sam Carmichael and Nigel Bradley, from my old club, Northwest CC. Seeing them there gave me a real boost and that combined with knowing I had the end in sight really spurred me on to the finish.The final  metres of climbing were the best - I was getting messages of encouragement from Zwters from places as far away as Germany, USA and Colombia. I finished shortly after pm, over  hours after I first leapt into the saddle and boy did I sleep well that night.So to finish, Irsquod like to say a huge thanks to everyone for their support, to those who donated in such hard times mdash Irsquom so grateful and Irsquom hopeful we will make le that little bit easier for others.I havenrsquot put any thought into the next challenge mdash on Sunday I said never again mdash but the beauty of cycling is therersquos always the next time.

Thatrsquos something our whole extended family embraces.ldquoItrsquos going to be bittersweet but we are happy for Mary and the lovely couple who are adopting her. Itrsquos good to know that she will be going to her forever home and will have a lovely little le. Thatrsquos always the ultimate aim for a child, particularly a younger child.ldquoHowever, one of the challenges is trying to teach her about adoption. How do you teach a three year-old that she will be leaving us and going to a forever family  We had to be creative and came up with the idea about the Christmas elf. Like many houses, we had Bauble the elf at Christmas, who was then lsquoadoptedrsquo by Mary and now lives with us all year round and is part of our family. We even made an adoption certicate to show her it was real.ldquoWhile Covid- has put a hold on this for now, we still have to prepare both Mary and ourselves, as it will be hard to say goodbye. But, as our daughter keeps saying, itrsquos part of foster care and what is right for Mary.ldquoEveryone has been writing their goodbye letters to her. We have prepared a book about her time with us and videos so that she wonrsquot have any gaps when shersquos looking back on her le.The Dicksons have been fostering since  and have looked after eight children so far, ranging in age from one to eight. They do respite fostering ndash temporary childcare for another fosterer or family ndash and short-term foster care.Itrsquos something that the couple have wanted to do for a long time.ldquoI wanted to foster for as long as in my early twenties and my husband felt the same, said  year-old Tanya. ldquoWe both came from family backgrounds where close relatives were in the caring professions.ldquoWe were very united in knowing that we would foster one day, even from the day we were married. However, when our daughter Hannah came along, we wanted her to be part of it, obviously, and to wait until the time that we were sure she understood the impact of it.ldquoWe waited until she was about  before we contacted the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust. Thatrsquos where our journey started, and we havenrsquot looked back once. The Trust has been with us every step of the way. The only regret we have had about fostering is not doing it sooner.The Dicksons have also been supported by their nearest and dearest in doing something that many other people consider doing.ldquoWe were lucky that our families were always on board with us regarding our fostering, Tanya said. Our employers have been amazing, our church family and even the village family of Crossgar. Everyone has really embraced our fostering journey.After making contact with the Trust Tanya, who works at Kilmood Early Years Playgroup, said that after a period of assessment and training they began to foster six months later.ldquoI think the assessment can put people off, but I believe itrsquos an invaluable tool as you come out of it knowing yourself better, she explained. You know your own personal qualities better and your skill base.ldquoItrsquos also essential as it helps the Trust match children with dferent needs with dferent foster carers. The only thing we stipulated is that any child we cared for would be at least two years younger than Hannah as we wanted her to be the eldest child in the house.Hannah, who is a student of Saintfield High School, has been integral to the couplersquos success as foster parents and has relished her role as lsquobig sisterrsquo.Mrs Dickson said: ldquoHannah has been so great with the children. With Hannah maturing, she is showing her experience of fostering in a very positive and beautul way by showing empathy to others.ldquoThatrsquos something she would never have experienced had we not fostered and she feels more grateful for her family le. She wants to be a nurse and I can see that great caring spirit being fostered in her care of Mary. Itrsquos been so rewarding and has changed us completely for the better.Unlike many first-time parents, Tanya said foster parents always have help and support available.She said: ldquoEvery child that comes through our door is dferent and you adapt accordingly for whatever that child needs. We have the support of a link worker, who has had a lot of training. Yoursquore never on your own.ldquoWe have learnt to take things at a childrsquos pace. Some children who have been looked after before are used to being more independent and self-sufficient. You have to walk a fine line at the beginning with each child to know what they want you to do for them.The Dicksons hope to continue fostering for as long as possible and to do their best for any child that comes their way.ldquoCaring for a toddler has kept us young. You are on the ball from the crack of dawn until bedtime. I would like to think we could continue fostering for as long as we want as therersquos no age limit to fostering, she added.If you are interested in becoming a foster carer, like Tanya, or just want to find out more about what is involved, visit the HSC Northern Ireland Adoption and Foster Care website or call    to find out more.* Maryrsquos name has been changed to protect her identity..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd June 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Dean pops the question at open air gig  ","story":"A KILMORE man enlisted the help of local musician Eddie Booth when he got down on one knee to propose to his girlfriend recently.Dean Campbelland his girlfriend of ten years Laura Walters, have been big fans of Eddiersquos lsquoLive at the Lamplightrsquo gigs which he performs from his garden in Kilmore each Saturday night during the Covid- lockdown.However, unbeknown to Laura, who is a care worker for the NHS, Saturday, May , was about to become the most memorable of them all.Dean, who works for a local quarry company, says keeping the proposal a secret from Laura was the hardest thing he ever had to do.ldquoI had spoken with Laurarsquos parents, who live in England, to let them know what I was planning and arranged for them to be tuning into Eddiersquos gig via Zoom, he said.While Laura, who is also , was excited about seeing her family, she remained oblivious to the fact Eddie, was in on the delightful conspiracy.ldquoTherersquos just so much sad news around at the moment, I thought it would be a wee morale boost for the community to pop the question, so I approached Eddie to ask for his help.

Republicans are already planning a memorial on council property in Castlewellan and it is believed that loyalists in Ballynahinch may erect a memorial to dead UVF terrorists on council land at Langley Road.KILLYLEAGH ndash A new community forum, to represent the interests of a wide range of groups in the Killyleagh area, is to be set up.The umbrella organisation will represent what has been described as the ldquoimpressive level of community activity in the area.The idea to create the new group was floated at last weekrsquos annual meeting of the Killyleagh, Shrigley and District Town Committee by secretary Peter Bryson.He said the new group is vital to enable better communication and planning and help with the compilation of joint funding applications to a range of funders.He said the creation of the new group could provide the perfect  on which to develop partnerships of shared interest in the Killyleagh area.SAINTFIELD mdash As the controversy over the dangers of mobile telephone equipment continues, Saintfield residents have found themselves at the centre of the most recent debate.Parents and councillors met in the local library last week to discuss their fears of two telecommunications masts at Comber Road, which they believe are casting a shadow over the local high school.The public meeting was called by mother-of-three Laura Bill in the wake of the independent Stewart report which advises parents not to allow their children to use mobile phones, and pointed to children as being most likely to be affected by possible health risks.Leukaemia is one illness which reports have suggested could be caused, or aggravated by, radiation from mobile phone masts.One woman told Thursdayrsquos meeting that a pocket of seven children under  years of age suffer from childhood leukaemia in the Saintfield area, leading to parental fears that this could be aggravated by the existence of the masts.BALLYGOWAN mdash A shooting incident in Ballygowan during the early hours of Monday is being linked to a paramilitary feud.The house at Comber Road was sprayed with automatic gunfire by four men who smashed a number of windows.

Indeed, the safety of those working in the sector, as well as that of the wider public, will be paramount in all of this.Ms Rogan said that the reopening of tourist accommodation will depend on the rate of transmission, appealing to people to ensure this can go ahead as planned by continuing to follow social distancing guidelines.She added: ldquoIf we continue to work together, to follow the guidelines and stay safe and save lives then we can get our tourism economy open for business again.Cllr Curran said he was pleased that a major part of the tourism sector was scheduled to reopen and echoed calls for people to continue following public health advice, suggesting aldquochallenging world awaits all aspects of business in the months and years ahead.ldquoTourism is the districtrsquos number one product and, prior to the pandemic, generated hundreds of thousands of pounds for the local economy, helping sustain thousands of jobs, he continued.ldquoClearly, the safety of staff and the public is paramount moving forward and I have every confidence that those who run our hotels, guesthouses, caravan parks and other tourist accommodation will have this at the top of their agenda.Cllr Curran said he concurred with the economy ministerrsquos contention that enabling accommodation businesses to generate essential revenue will help to protect iniduals and livelihoods which support families and communities across Northern Ireland.He said hoteliers and tourist accommodation providers will be seeking clarity of exactly what services they will be able to offer, so that they can plan for reopening with confidence.Cllr Curran recently called for the umbrella group that represents Northern Irelandrsquos  councils to have a role in helping the tourism industry recover from

have changed signicantly when the crisis ends, but I believe there are opportunities to build for the future.ldquoSouth Down and the wider Lecale area relies heavily upon tourism and the sector must

redevelopment of a major town centre site in Downpatrick were discussed at a key meeting yesterday.A steering group overseeing the redevelopment of the former Irish Street police station, a number of adjacent empty buildings and a Newry, Mourne and Down Council-owned car park met to discuss a new brochure which has been designed for the near two acre site.While it was suggested that the coronavirus pandemic is likely to delay the redevelopment of the huge site, traders and politicians are keen to see work starting on the eagerly-awaited economic regeneration of this historic part of the town.The local council and the Department for Communities are spearheading an ambitious regeneration project with the new brochure mdash understood to be still in draft form ndash designed to provide potential developers and other interested parties with an overview of the sitersquospotential and secure expressions of interest.A number of Irish Street businesses have already invested in upgrading their respective shop fronts while the former police base was recently given a fresh coat of paint as part of a revitalisation scheme.The development site stretches as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue and is also adjacent to the Irish Street car park, with council officials looking to make the brochure available to the pubic virtually.Described as a strategic and prominent location in the heart of Downpatrick, senior council officials, politicians and members of the business community are excited at the Irish Street sitersquos development potential.While the imposing former police station enjoys protected status and cannot be razed to the ground, it is hoped that potential developers will be able to come with an imaginative plan for the building.It has been identied as a development opportunity site in the Down Area Plan, with the area to the front included in Downpatrickrsquos conservation area.While it has been suggested that housing could form part of any redevelopment proposal, the building has been touted as a potential base for offices.Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities are keen to revitalise Irish Street and hope its redevelopment will act as a catalyst for the wider economic and social regeneration of the town.They are keen to retain Irish Streetrsquos uniqueness where residents and traders live and work alongside each other and ensure that there is adequate parking. There have already been suggestions that an underground parking facility at the current Irish Street car park would allow retail units to be built on top.Work was recently completed on a protracted public realm scheme in Irish Street and it is hoped that the redevelopment of the former police base will complement this project, which resulted in the provision of new granite paving, street furniture and lighting.Downpatrick councillors are keen to see the redevelopment proposal increase the number of shoppers to the town to provide a boost for existing traders who have been at the heart of the townrsquos economy for many years.It is also hoped to regenerate the town centrersquos night time economy with politicians eager for the Irish Street scheme to create a number of much-needed new jobs.Earlier this year, a number of Downpatrick councillors were given the opportunity to view the inside of the former police base and the expansive grounds to the rear.Local council officials say they are committed to working with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site and had been planning to meet with them to discuss the way forward prior to the coronavirus pandemic.In addition, the local authority aims to work alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have previously expressed an interest in the Irish Street location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre. However, it remains to be seenthat interest remains given the current economic climate.Downpatrick councillors say that they recognise the Irish Street regeneration project provides an opportunity to regenerate the town centre and provide a boost for existing businesses and hope that the project can be progressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd June 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Minister asked to give assurances on bypass  ","story":"STORMONT roads minister Nichola Mallon has been asked to make it clear that delivering Ballynahinchrsquos multi-million pound bypass remains one of her key priorities.The appeal has been issued by South Down MP Chris Hazzard mdash a former minister at the Department of Infrastructure mdash who is keen to see work starting on the poundm project.When he was at the helm of the Stormont department, Mr Hazzard signed off the eagerly-awaited bypass in December .Since then, there has been major progress to deliver the near two-mile scheme to link the Newcastle and Saintfield roads, with work already completed on a major archaeological investigation along parts of the route.Work was due to complete on the schemersquos economic appraisal before the end of last year, with roads engineers confirming recently that in order to advance the bypass schemersquos state of readiness, preparatory work on contract documents was ongoing to ldquominimise the time required to initiate a procurement competition, should funding become available for construction.The bypass, which would be the single biggest road scheme ever constructed in the district, is expected to take in excess of  months to build, with major new roundabouts proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Mr Hazzard said while the coronavirus pandemic has consumed much time for all government departments, he does want to diminish Ms Mallonrsquos role in working constructively with her executive colleagues in mitigating the worst effects of the global emergency.But he said since that taking over the reins at the roads department five months ago, the minister has issued statements on electric bikes and hydrogen buses and what he described as ldquoplenty of positive soundings on other capital projects, but there hasnrsquot been a single word on the long overdue Ballynahinch bypass.ldquoThis is a relatively low-cost, yet strategic infrastructure scheme that is shovel ready. Yet it hasnrsquot featured in any of the ministerrsquos public commentary on her departmentrsquos priorities for the time ahead since taking office in January, said Mr Hazzard.ldquoIt is unsurprising then that local businesses and commuters are beginning to question the infrastructure ministerrsquos commitment to deliver this scheme.The MP says he has once again asked Ms Mallon to definitively set out that the Ballynahinch bypass remains a priority for her department and set out a timeline for commencing construction.He added: ldquoIn light of the severe economic impact of Covid- and ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the successful delivery of this project will be a vital step in improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of our local community in these dficult times.In a letter to Ms Mallon, the South Down MP said the bypass scheme is at an advanced stage and is as close to ldquoshovel ready as any other project in the government departmentrsquorsquos capital programme.He has asked the ministerthe Ballynahinch scheme remains a ldquopriority capital project, what stage is it currently at and when will construction work be signed off Responding to Mr Hazzard, a spokesman for the roads minister said that while she is currently faced with ldquoserious and challenging budget constraints, she has already stated that she is committed to working to find solutions that deliver better for communities and improve lives across the North.ldquoShe very much recognises that many in the local community support the provision of a bypass in Ballynahinch, the spokesman continued.ldquoIn finalising budget decisions, the minister is focused on addressing the need to fund essential infrastructure work, promoting a green recovery and getting other strategic projects underway.The spokesman said that in particular, Ms Mallon is considering her long term priorities for strategic road improvement schemes and how they might facilitate complementary improvements to promote sustainable travel choices, connecting people and communities, creating thriving and liveable places that enhance opportunities and our economy.The spokesman added: ldquoThe minister understands the frustration among the people of South Down at the failure of previous administrations to deliver important projects.ldquoShe has already set out her ambition to address regional imbalance with the delivery of projects and hopes elected representatives from across all parties and across the Executive will support her in securing the money to deliver strategic projects which improve both our economy and the wellbeing of our local communities in South Down and across the North in these dficult times..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd June 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"National Trust sites reopen  ","story":"A NUMBER of local National Trust properties reopen from today.The National Trust has confirmed that Saintfieldrsquos stunning Rowallane Garden and Castle Ward and Mount Stewart mdash both on the shores of Strangford Lough mdash will be welcoming visitors after being closed for a number of weeks as part of the coronavirus lockdown restrictions.In total,  properties are reopening across the province, with Trust officials confirming that advance bookings will be required in order to limit numbers and maintain public safety.

The older generation have been practising social distancing, the younger ones either hadn’t heard of it or simply didn’t want to know. William Hague : Other rd Party \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This week I watched, mouth opened, dozens of them, bottles in hand, lined up on the railings of a beach, not a bottle’s width between them, waiting no doubt for the families to leave the beach so they could start partying on what was a glorious summer night of weather. It was left to the locals next day to clean up the mess they left behind. Only the intervention of the police prevented the same happening the next night.On that first night, a gang of them vaulted a wall to climb into a nearby children’s play area, despite it being locked up and an official Do Not Enter sign on the gate. They left when told off by locals.With many of us worrying about what the world might be like when the current young generation inherit the reins of power, this week former Foreign Secretary and Tory leader William Hague thinks the young must be saved from a miserable post co-Covid future. In his Dailycolumn he wrote: ‘Young people will be the prime victims of a looming catastrophe, their lives littered with abandoned careers, opportunities that evaporated and dreams that suddenly died’. He believes that, while the most tragic casualties of the pandemic are the older people, the generation ‘bearing the greatest burden of the side-effects will be the youngest’.William Hague is a bit younger than me so perhaps he doesn’t understand what it was like for us in the s and early s when the economy hit the buffers as industries collapsed and politicians were almost as incompetent as some of today’s are. Working conditions were bordering on the primitive and wages were inadequate. Trade unions kept us on strike for weeks with no wages. In Northern Ireland, we had the added burden of dealing with terrorism which threatened the lives of all of us who had to work in the towns and cities each day.Sandra Chapman column : JPIMediaToday’s young generation thankfully missed the worst of it and feel, perhaps, they are entitled to do as they please whatever politicians say. Naturally, we want our children to grow up confident knowing that hard work brings rewards. Yet, there are many amongst them believing they are answerable to no one. Entitlement is their mantra. Lockdown  Sorry, but that’s just for the oldies and who cares about them anyway In fact, a new report out actually decrees that older homeowners ‘are contributing to the housing crisis by staying put in large properties with m surplus bedrooms in total’. The report by Cass Business School and the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation suggests this will rise to m unused bedrooms by no action is taken. And what action, I might ask, is that supposed to be, given, that in another decade or so this current young generation will be in charge of the country and may feel this isn’t fair to them  What happens to the mantra that a person’s home is their palace evenit’s only a wooden hut The report suggests the best approach would be to waive stamp duty for “last time buyers” who are moving into a smaller retirement property and that councils should be ‘ordered’ to build more houses suitable for older people, a suggestion which went down like a lead balloon in this house. It smacks of official government interference in our lives and should be resisted. After all,today’s young generation can totally ignore politicians, police and officialdom of all kind, as they appear to do now, couldn’t the older generation learn from that and defy the dictators who come knocking \"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Mark Hamilton: \"It was also interesting that there was little criticism of the mass Black Lives Matter protests in the United States, Belfast, Dublin and the UK with regard to social distancing\" : Other rd PartyThe LGBTcommunity, which have been the BBC’s darlings for many years, must be feeling neglected now that the BBC’s affections are now focused on BAMEcauses. While the death of George Floyd was disgraceful and I’ve no doubt black American communities have genuine grievances , the BBC’s reporting in the aftermath has been over-the-top and unbalanced.The coronavirus pandemic has been relegated to a side-story.Letter to the editor : Johnston Press Resell \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...On Wednesday, I watched the BBC morning news with Victoria Derbyshire, and had to checkI has stumbled upon a new Black Empowerment channel. A headline at the bottom of the screen, referring to Black Lives Matters and other related protests in the United States, proclaimed ‘protests mainly peaceful’ and when they did report on instances of trouble, there was minimal mention of looting and violence which is widespread according to reliable contacts of mine in the United States. The coverage smacked of bias and seemed pro-protest and naturally anti-Trump.The programme then wheeled out commentators who reminded us all of ‘white privilege for centuries’, the Grenfell tragedy, the Windrush Generation and then showed reports that members of the BAME community were more likely to die from coronavirus and more likely to be fined for non-observance of lockdown restrictions. Finally, a story not linked to the BAME community was aired, a tale of woe about a transgender person who was insulted, nothing more than jeered at, in a bar in Los Angeles last August. Is someone being insulted in a bar really world news It was also interesting that there was little criticism of the mass Black Lives Matter protests in the United States, Belfast, Dublin and the UK with regard to social distancing. It seems the BBC feel these mass gatherings are fine which is surprising given that they spent days and days conducting a microscopic analysis of Dominic Cummings’ interactions with his family. I am no fan of Cummings and do not wish to defend him in any way buthe is to be lambasted surely so should protestors who seem oblivious to social distancing laws. I suspect the BBC would not give Cummings credithe saved a child from a rabid dog due to his part in Brexit.In the opinion of many including myself, the BBC’s reports on the mass gatherings at republican funerals that took place here in Northern Ireland during lockdown were about as spineless as they could be. No pressure was put on, or hard questions asked to, those involved in the funerals or to the police for that matter. Why  Maybe teenagers on a beach are easier targets.In my mind, the increasingly left-wing liberal BBC is not fit for purpose. It has become obsessed with BAME, LGBT, feminist and political-correctness issues with equality used as a flag of convenience. I think of the Radio Ulster Talkback programme as the Left-Wing Lunchtime Love in.If the BBC was self-financing, I would say let them produce and broadcast whatever they want and they could live or die based on advertising revenues and subscriptions, but it is infuriating that the general public are forced to pay a licence fee which enables them to produce material that is repulsive to so many members of the public. It is also worth saying that the vast majority of politicians are silent on this issue.Mark Hamilton, Coagh—— ——A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

That work has to be done in effect by June  .”The Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural AffairsPermanent Secretary Denis McMahon told MLAs there are around  lorries entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain every day.He explained officials are working on plans to extend current facilities at ports into EU approved border control posts.Dr McMahon said officials have met with Larne, Belfast, Warrenpoint, Foyle sea ports and the two main airports, and are working seven days a week on the application.“We have a lot of work to do and a very short amount of time to do it in,” he said.He said a paper was published by the UK government on May  was the first “clear mandate” and “clarity of the UK government’s position”.“We’re now moving from information gathering to active delivery planning in anticipation we will need to move quickly,” he said.Dr McMahon said officials need support from both the UK government and EU to “make this work”.“The UK government has confirmed it will provide the Northern Ireland Executive with support and expertise to deliver the project but this is not the only support we need,” he said.“Importantly the success of this project is not entirely within our control. We will need the help of both the UK government and the EU to make this work, and they will need to help us work through these issues over the coming weeks and months.“Basically the simpler the processes while maintaining biosecurity, promoting public health and complying with the law, the more likely we will be able to succeed in our aim of reducing trade friction.”Dr McMahon said % of UK food imports are from the EU and % of the retail food supply to Northern Ireland comes from Great Britain, adding “to put it bluntly, we all need to make this work”.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Writing in the FT this week about the possibility of a severe recession becoming a depression, former World Bank president Robert Zoellick recalled the warning of the s: “The Depression caused more than economic pain. It metastasised to a loss of faith in democracies, the triumph of ideologies of hate, a turn to demagogues, a breakdown of international trade and finance and, ultimately, the second world war.”With much of the world seething with anger, stoked dangerously by our increasing reliance on mass communication technology the implications of which we still do not fully comprehend, with a rise of nationalistic populism, and a widespread sense on both left and right that for years the old economic order has been breaking down, that is a sobering historic reminder.With Northern Ireland’s long and bloody history of tribal ision, and with heightened constitutional dispute in recent years ahead of the looming centenary commemorations, there are obvious dangersthe upheaval now upon us cannot be managed in a way which both unionists and nationalists believe to be fair.Northern Ireland’s large public sector will only partially cushion the inevitable mass unemployment when the government’s furlough scheme stops paying % of the salaries for jobs which in many cases will no longer exist.The UK economy could shrink by betweena quarter and a third over the second quarter of this year, according to theInstitute for Fiscal Studies, but in a way which exacerbates existing inequality, hitting the poorest most viciously, as well as disproportionatelyhurting women and the young.That economic emergency will only be one of multiple crises which the Executive will face over the coming months. Having been chaotically ided in the early weeks of the pandemic, the Executive has – at least outwardly – come together in the last month. But that unity has been bought at the expense of delaying crucial dficult decisions over how and when lockdown will end. That most pressing question is just the start of a period in whichscores of major decisions will have to be taken about how to reshape NorthernIreland’s economy and multiple areas of society.In that is opportunity as well as threat – but also the potential for Stormont’s sluggish decision-making and mutual vetoes to delay the decisions which could helpbring some good out of this period of death and disruption.Through the increased public expenditure in England to respond to the crisis, the Executive has already seen signicant new income. Much of that has just been doled out in broadly similar ways to GB, attempting to prop up as much of the economy as possible until lockdown ends.But as time goes on there will be increased scope for local decision-making as to how that money should be spent. If, for instance, it becomes clear that tourist numbers are going to be signicantly depressed for years, does Stormont prop up such a sector, or use that money where Queen’s University academicJohn Barry hassuggested a massive retrofit of the worst insulated homes, something which could improve the lives of those in the most dficult circumstances, improve air quality and provide jobs.\u2028Others have suggested following some European cities which have pedestrianised city centre roads, allowing cafes and cyclists to fill the streets in an attempt to revitalise city precincts which otherwise could shriveleateries are unable to survive by serving only a tiny percentage of their normal customers due to social distancing.With technology having allowed a large percentage of the population to work productively from home, many of those people are either unlikely to everto the office, or to only do so intermittently.That has implications for the historically higher house prices in cities –we don’t need to be in a city centre office, why not buy a larger home further away Those without gardens, and especially those living in expensive shoebox apartments, may after lockdown prioritise securing a morespacious property with a garden or some other outdoor space.If we are trying to stay apart, using public transport is less practical than driving, walking or cycling. Butpassenger numbers collapse, does Stormont then bail out Translink so that it can maintain sparsely-populated bus and train services, or does it ask it to cut services, thus forcing the same number of people on to fewer buses and trains where social distancing will be impossible If a company has been able to effectively maintain its operations with staff working remotely, it decide to stop renting expensive city centre offices, especiallyit is struggling to break even as a result of the recession.Those decisions and a thousand others will then have implications for planning and infrastructure policy, with increased potential for urban sprawl and city centre decay.Politicians will have to decide whether to continuing deepening our relationship with China despite its reckless lies over coronavirus, whether local manufacturing should be prioritised as a part of a move to deglobalisation, the role of the public sector, and relations with unions as relationships between workers and employers are transformed.While very few young people are likely to die from the virus, they will suffer in a decimated job market, with the potential to trigger inter-generationalanger.Yet there is now a rare moment of opportunity for visionary politicians to use their power to reshapehow we live and work. This is a moment which for many politicians never arrives even in a long political career: The chance to dramatically reshape society and fix some of what they knew to be broken.Behind many of these questions, the prudent retort of“how are you going to pay for that” will not retain the potency which it had – at least until there are massive tax hikes – because we have seen how when government felt something was of sufficient importance it was able to borrow money more than at any time since the Second World War. Though largely not a matter for Stormont, the debate will therefore sht from whether borrowing for policy X is possible, to whether it is of sufficient importance to add to the gargantuan national debt – and whether that is fair to future generations.There are also areas where Northern Ireland is well positioned to profit from the post-pandemic world. In recent years Belfast has become a centre of cyber-security expertise. With technology now more dominant in our lives, and the online security commercially paramount as we handle company secrets on laptops in our kitchens or bedrooms, that area has potential for sustained growth.Our large agricultural sector may also benefit as the severing of global supply lines demonstrates the criticality of maintaining food security. Stormont will face an ideologicalargument on top of its traditional constitutionalargument in the midst of what will be at least a recession and possiblya depression – and possibly still a public health crisis.That would challenge any government, let alone our constitutionally and ideologically ided Executive. But it is also an opportunity for it to do something truly momentously meaningful.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch on social media.There is a lsquoPODS public grouprsquo on Facebook, PODS quiz nights are being held on Zoom, and there is a website to keep track at podspenarth.org article_url   content_id   site_id

dutyOrangemen in Co Armagh have raised more than £, to help those fighting against coronavirus and those worst affected by lockdown.By Graeme CousinsThursday, th May , : pm\"\"Bessbrook District made a special delivery of a food pack to Bro Thomas Alderdice in Kilkeel : Other rd PartyDistrict and private lodges have provided food hampers for its own members and other vulnerable people in the community, donated to frontline NHS staff, raised cash for charity and boosted PPE provision in the area.Right Worshipful Brother Denis Watson, county grand master, said: “The money we’ve raised has gone towards assisting all communities and, as the largest community-based organisation within Co Armagh, it shows that the institution is so much more than just a parading body and has had a very positive impact in all areas of the county.“Almost as soon as the impact of the coronavirus pandemic became known and lockdown was implemented, the  district lodges and many private lodges in Co Armagh made spontaneous and impressive efforts to assist in their local communities.Rt Wor Bro Denis Watson, County Grand Master, and Wor Bro Jeffrey Lawson, Deputy County Grand Secretary, presenting the cheque for £, to Jane McKimm, Head of Communications, and Helen ONeill, Director of Finance.at the Southern Health and Social Care Trust, for specic use at Craigavon Area Hospital : Other rd Party“The tremendous response from the County Grand Lodge was immediate and the monies came from existing funds, with no member asked to contribute, unless to do so in a voluntary capacity.”Support included preparing food hampers for elderly and vulnerable brethren, and others in the community, making donations of food and goodies to frontline hospital staff, making monetary donations to charities, and providing PPE to nursing homes and community nursing services.A substantial donation of £, was made to the Southern Health and Social Care Trust, specically for Craigavon Area Hospital.Mr Watson said: “One of the first things put in place by the County Grand Lodge was the issue of a daily prayer from our County Grand Chaplain, Wor Bro Rev Dr Alan McCann, to members by email and posting on the Museum of Orange Heritage at Sloan’s House, Loughgall Facebook page.County Grand Lodge Officers made a donation of £, to the Southern Area Hospice as they are currently unable to fundraise, and this was presented to Anne Dalzell, hospice representative, at Sloan’s House : Other rd Party“The response has been very favourable in these trying times, with the daily reach on Facebook being between  and over ,.”He added: “The museum at Sloan’s House was very proud to display the Grand Lodge banner of support for the NHS and other frontline services on the front of the building and encouraged young people to send in rainbow pictures for display on the front windows of the premises. “The County Grand Lodge central committee has been able to liaise by having regular Zoom conference meetings and this has proved very beneficial in maintaining contact and co-ordination.” Reflecting on the work he said: “It’s a very commendable effort by the Orange brethren of Co Armagh and of course this is being replicated in other counties within the jurisdiction of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland.”\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\"
