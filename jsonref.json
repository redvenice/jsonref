God, it\u0027s gotten good,\u0027 he added.\u0027But it hasn\u0027t. Things have changed, things have improved, and then things have gotten worse. \u0027Progress doesn\u0027t go like that (up). It goes like this (up and down) and there are downturns and we\u0027re in one and that\u0027s why I think Green Book is an important movie to remind us that we are all the same people.\u0027No matter how far we seem to be, all you have to do is talk to each other and there\u0027s a common ground in there and there\u0027s a way to unite.\u0027  The 62-year-old director - famed for comedy hits like Dumb And Dumber and There\u0027s Something About Mary - said he feels cable news is not doing much to help the current ide in the country. \u0027Unfortunately, people aren\u0027t talking. People are watching Fox News and they\u0027re watching MSNBC and that\u0027s not a discussion that\u0027s being talked to,\u0027 he said.\u0027But what we\u0027ve got to do is talk to each other the way people always did in the past.\u0027          The film starring Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortnensen, tells the story of world-class pianist \u0027Doc\u0027 Don Shirely (Ali) as he is protected by Italian-American bodyguard Tony Lip (Mortensen) on a tour of the deep South during segregation in the 1960s.

We should stick to it,\u0027 she told reporters. With the prospect of Mrs May\u0027s plan passing the Commons looking vanishingly small, opponents are pushing their own visions of how to proceed. Labour\u0027s Yvette Cooper and Tory former education secretary Nicky Morgan have tabled an amendment to the Finance Bill today designed to make it harder for the government to push ahead with no deal.The change would effectively limit the Treasury\u0027s tax-raising powers, making it more difficult to respond to the disruption from crashing out.As the PM wooed Tory MPs in Downing Street last night, business minister Richard Harrington made clear he will resign if the government backs no-deal after Mrs May\u0027s plan is defeated. Several Cabinet members, including Justice Secretary David Gauke, have also signalled they would quit - while some Conservatives have insisted they would vote no-confidence in the government to avoid a chaotic departure.             Amber Rudd (left), Matt Hancock (centre) and Steve Barclay (right) were among the ministers at Cabinet today   Home Secretary Sajid Javid (left) and Aid Secretary Penny Mordaunt (right) were also at the gathering in Downing Street todayCulture minister Margot James yesterday broke ranks to suggest Brexit might have to be delayed if Mrs May\u0027s deal is voted down. According to the Telegraph, EU sources say UK officials are \u0027testing the waters\u0027 for extending Article 50.Even if Mrs May\u0027s deal was to pass next week there are serious questions over whether the full legislation would be passed to implement it by March. Mr Barclay this morning insisted the policy was still to leave the bloc at the end of March, and warned an extension would cause \u0027very practical issues\u0027.  Barclay said: \u0027It\u0027s not a unilateral decision for the UK. That is not a decision the UK Government could take, it would require the consent of all 27 member states.\u0027It would also generate some very practical issues, for example EU parliamentary elections at the end of May.\u0027He continued: \u0027The real question for Members of Parliament who voted to give the public a say through the European referendum in 2016, who voted in large numbers to trigger Article 50, (is) the consequence of triggering Article 50 is you either have a deal and the EU have been clear that the only deal on the table is the PM\u0027s deal. You either have a deal or you have no deal.\u0027 Downing Street has repeatedly dismissed the idea of a delay in the departure date, with Mrs May\u0027s official spokesman saying: \u0027The Prime Minister has been very clear on a number of occasions that extending Article 50 is not something we are intending to do.\u0027Speaking on a visit to Mali, Mr Varadkar said: \u0027We don\u0027t want to trap the UK into anything.\u0027We want to get on to the talks about the future relationship right away,..

That is not a decision the UK Government could take, it would require the consent of all 27 member states.\u0027It would also generate some very practical issues, for example EU parliamentary elections at the end of May.\u0027He continued: \u0027The real question for Members of Parliament who voted to give the public a say through the European referendum in 2016, who voted in large numbers to trigger Article 50, (is) the consequence of triggering Article 50 is you either have a deal and the EU have been clear that the only deal on the table is the PM\u0027s deal. You either have a deal or you have no deal.\u0027 Downing Street has repeatedly dismissed the idea of a delay in the departure date, with Mrs May\u0027s official spokesman saying: \u0027The Prime Minister has been very clear on a number of occasions that extending Article 50 is not something we are intending to do.\u0027Speaking on a visit to Mali, Mr Varadkar said: \u0027We don\u0027t want to trap the UK into anything.\u0027We want to get on to the talks about the future relationship right away,..

Who is the greatest – Rembrandt van Rijn or Leonardo da Vinci? The two geniuses both have big anniversaries this year. According to the Netherlands, 2019 is officially the Year of Rembrandt. Amsterdam’s Rijksmuseum, the Mauritshuis in The Hague and the Museum De Lakenhall in Leiden are all putting on shows for the 350th anniversary of his death in 1669. Yet Rembrandt isn’t getting his year to himself. This also happens to be the 500th anniversary of the death of Leonardo in 1519. It’s a great excuse for exhibitions by Britain’s Royal Collection and British Library as well as a grand retrospective at the Louvre.So which is the bigger anniversary? The smart bet might seem to be Rembrandt. His art is so absorbing, tragic and inward. His portraits are the painterly equivalents of King Lear. He is a painter in whose shadows the soul can linger. By contrast, Leonardo is a pop star who’s still busting the market 500 years after his death – and isn’t that a bit oppressive? It’s hard not to feel alienated among all the smartphone-touting tourists in front of the Mona Lisa. Not much room there for the meditative silent communion you can have with a Rembrandt.Did Leonardo ever create anything so disarmingly and rawly human? I’d reply with another question: has anyone under the age of 30 ever given a hoot about Rembrandt? Self-portraits that probe the inner self are all very well, but there’s a universality to Leonardo that puts him in a different league. I became a fan of his genius when I was about eight. I had a Ladybird book about great artists. The story of Leonardo da Vinci was like a fairytale – there was a picture of him buying birds at market just so he could release them. What’s Rembrandt got for an eight-year-old? And how many copies would The Rembrandt Code sell?As for depth, it’s a false test to compare a Rembrandt self-portrait with the Mona Lisa. To grasp the real wonder of Leonardo you need to look at his drawings. He finished very few paintings and all are commissions in which self-expression struggles with patrons’ demands. It’s in his notebooks that Leonardo truly soars. In page after page he studies nature, designs machinery, invents weapons, plans fortifications and seeks the secret of flight.The greatest of all these visual investigations are his anatomical drawings. These are his artistic answers to Rembrandt’s portraits – and they are also miracles of science. He wrote of the dread he felt when he stayed up all night in a dissection room full of cadavers, alone with the dead. Out of these experiments he produced drawings that go – literally – deeper than Rembrandt. Instead of being moved by a face, Leonardo digs and cuts in search of life’s hidden structure. The drawings that record his fleshy discoveries outdo Rembrandt’s greatest portraits as images of what it is to be human. There’s no more moving work of art on earth than his depiction of a foetus in the womb, esconced as if in a capsule bound for the stars.The quivering mystery of Leonardo’s drawings of the lungs and heart, the precision of his studies of the eye and brain – these are his most sensitive as well as mind-boggling works. His anatomical drawings belong to the Queen and many will be touring the country this year.Sure, Rembrandt is the Shakespeare of painting. But Leonardo is Shakespeare, Einstein and the Wright brothers rolled into one. Come off it, Rijksmuseum. This just isn’t Rembrandt’s year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83c7ace3f40ebe1e5e5b34057a45bfea3e9dd1c1/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e838d4cb364b72a94740125ea534270","title":"ask angie thomas your questions","story":"Got something you would like to ask the award-winning author of The Hate U Give? With the publication of her second YA novel coming up next month, here’s your chanceAngie Thomas is the author of the bestseller The Hate U Give, a novel for young adults that was inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement and which tells the story of Starr Carter, a 16-year-old African American girl who is drawn to activism after witnessing the police shooting of a childhood friend. Published in 2017, the book has been on the New York Times young adult bestseller list for 96 weeks and has won many awards, including children’s book of the year at the British book awards, and the Waterstones children’s book prize for 2018. Writer Nikesh Shukla described it as “one of the most important books of 2017” and it has also recently been made into a successful film.Thomas grew up in Jackson, Mississippi, and she was the first black student to graduate in creative writing from the city’s Belhaven University.

If nothing else, books give us a glimpse into lives that we may not have known about before they can promote empathy.”“Freedom of speech isn’t necessarily free, especially when you’re young and black.”“Every time a black girl comes up to me and says, ‘Thank you. It’s the first time I’ve seen myself in a book like this’, that’s better than hitting the New York Times bestseller list.”“Hashtags are nice, but I would ask people to put in some work!

It was ruled over by kings who regulated trade, waged wars against other similar city states and settled disputes.The discoveries are important not just for South Africa – which some still claim was largely uninhabited before white settlers colonised the western coast and then pushed inland – but the African continent as a whole.In recent decades researchers have conclusively shown that western imperialists and historians who dismissed sub-Saharan Africa as a vast wasteland awaiting “civilisation” by Europeans were entirely wrong.Instead scholars have explored the riches, power and sophistication of cities and civilisations such as Great Zimbabwe, the empire of Mali, the kingdom of Benin and many others. Research has also revealed a continent that was part of global systems of commercial and intellectual exchange from the 15th century – well before the arrival of Europeans.A recent wave of research has gone further, revealing new layers of complex commercial, agricultural and urban development.“Now we understand that there was a network of settlements across very large territories and trading connections. These didn’t have a single major site and have left limited written or oral traces so have gone under the radar,” said Thomas Vernet-Habasque, a Johannesburg-based historian from the Sorbonne who is an expert on the history of pre-colonial Africa.Kweneng was one of several large settlements across northern parts of what is now South Africa that were inhabited by the Tswana-speaking peoples for many centuries before the first European settlers arrived. Many of these settlements were devastated – but not entirely depopulated – in violent upheavals at the beginning of the 19th century.The existence of Kweneng has been known for decades, but the new laser technology has revealed its true extent. The laser system works in a similar way to radar detection, except that instead of radio waves, the system sends out laser pulses. A computer then converts the pulses to a high resolution image, from which archaeologists can reconstruct how the area looked in the past.The city appears to have been split into three main neighbourhoods spread over 20 sq km (8 sq miles), with two very large stone walled enclosures that may have held cattle.“If all the 900 homesteads of which we’ve found traces were inhabited at once, then the population could have been up to 20,000, but given references to other cities in the region, it was probably more like 5,000,” said Sadr.There is evidence of considerable sophistication too. “There were four or five levels of local government, probably with regiments organised by age that could be called up for civic work or war. They buried their important dead under the walls of the central cattle enclosures but there was a very strong egalitarian tradition and the king went out of his way to not stand out,” Sadr said.Finding an exact date for the end of Kweneng’s days as a major metropolis is very difficult, as current archaeological techniques are not accurate to within decades. But the final days of the city may have been fearful and violent, a victim of the chaotic conflicts known Mfecane, or great scattering, triggered by the military expansion of the Zulu kingdom further south.A previous dig by a team from Witwatersrand University excavated three homes in the city which appeared to have been deliberately destroyed with fire. Animal bones, weapons and valuable items such as beads had been abandoned, suggesting residents left in a hurry.“My guess is that the whole city was hit hard. The question is whether it was totally destroyed,” said Sadr.In South Africa, such questions have long had a political dimension. The history of the trading state of Mapungubwe, which was capable of manufacturing magnificent gold objects 800 years ago, was deliberately obscured by racist officials during the apartheid era.They wanted to hide evidence that the land occupied by white settlers had not only been home to a major African civilisation but also that local populations they dismissed as fit only for manual labour were capable of sophisticated artistic production.Work at Mapela, once thought to be a small town under the authority of the kings of Mapungubwe, shows the settlement was much bigger than previously thought. Archaeologists have found thousands of glass beads, which suggests that it was a thriving trade centre.“The trade networks were very complex and intricate. A similarity in copper ingot style suggests that there was trade and exchange between central Africa and southern Africa. Colonial interventions first of all saw the establishment of borders which ided related peoples,” said Shadreck Chirikure, an archaeologist at the University of Cape Town, who has excavated parts of Mapela.The history of land ownership and habitation remains a potent and sensitive issue today.If Kweneng was still inhabited in the middle of the 18th century, claims by local people to ownership of the land on which the city stood will be strengthened. Demands from local communities to reclaim land that they say is theirs have been blocked in a series of court cases for decades.The new findings may also begin to change the way visitors to southern Africa understand the environment.Researchers point out that landscapes seen by tourists as representing the “real Africa” in a pristine “natural” state are nothing of the kind. Communities living in much of South Africa’s Kruger national park were forcibly removed when it was established as a nature reserve. Even the famous savannah across much of the continent has been worked by man, with many plants relatively recent introductions by local communities.“Those environments that we saw as ‘wild’ are not wild at all,” said Vernet-Habasque.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ffa89609f87c12bfb2039935df042b528a8dd33/0_0_5976_3992/master/5976.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=594b168cbfcb49de7a8c98a2144e0398 1440w","title":"carcinogens cosmetics brexit britain eu makeup","story":"Leaving means losing stringent EU rules on hazardous chemicals in makeup in favour of opaque US-style self-regulationHow would you feel about putting a lovely dollop of formaldehyde on your nails? No? Well, perhaps I could interest you in a sprinkling of asbestos for your skin? Hmm, tricky customer, eh? OK, surely you couldn’t object to some coal tar on your eyelids, to really make them pop. Oh, come on, who wouldn’t risk a little light cancer for a really banging shade of eyeshadow? You wouldn’t? Too bad. In our brave new Brexit world, where EU legislation is no longer in force, and we are forced to accept trade deals on Trump’s terms, expect all these known carcinogens and more to be appearing on a beauty shelf near you.Since 2007 UK consumers have been protected by the EU’s “precautionary principle”. Essentially, the EU doesn’t think that chemicals that have been linked to cancer and birth defects belong in cosmetics, and so they are banned from use in consumer products. And who could argue with that?Well, the US, actually, where a chemical is only banned if it poses an “unreasonable risk”. Whereas in the EU there is no “safe” level of exposure to a proven carcinogen, the US system, is “steeped in quantitative risk assessment”, says Mike Belliveau, executive director at the Environmental Health Strategy Center.The result is a major disparity in the level of consumer protection from hazardous chemicals. The EU bans 1,328 chemicals from use in cosmetics – including formaldehyde, asbestos and coal tar – that are known or suspected to cause cancer, genetic mutation, reproductive harm or birth defects. The US Food \u0026amp Drugs Administration (FDA), by comparison, has only banned or restricted 11.Of course you could argue that adults can make their own choices about what to use on their own bodies. If I want to put asbestos on my face, then the American Dream says that I should be free to do so. Down with the nanny state!The thing is that only works if consumers are able to make meaningful choices, based on adequate information. And in the US, they are not, thanks to the handy “fragrance loophole”. This legislation, intended as a way of protecting trade secrets, in fact means that hundreds of chemicals linked to cancer, birth defects and hormone disruption can be smuggled into all sorts of personal care products under the catch-all, innocent-sounding “fragrance”.The multibillion-dollar US fragrance and cosmetics industry hit back at such concerns, saying that it tests its products for safety. But those studies have never been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, and the industry refuses to publicly release the safety data. So we just have to take an industry that has spent millions of dollars lobbying against more transparent labelling requirements on trust. Rather than, as in the EU, having a right to know what it is we’re putting on our bodies.But this right is at risk if we lose access to EU data – a major concern given how reliant we have been historically on other EU countries doing chemicals testing for us. Even more worrying, our government has made no commitment to keep aligned with EU chemical rules, leaving us at risk of becoming a dumping ground for hazardous chemicals – a future that was heralded last month by a civil servant who explained that the UK would consider EU decisions, but also “look at what the US does”. Welcome to Brexit Britain, where the chicken is chlorinated, and the cosmetics could be carcinogenic.This wasn’t on the ballot paper in 2016. Instead we were like US consumers: asked to make a choice while being denied adequate information. This is not what democracy looks like. Now that the true costs of Brexit are emerging, the honourable and democratic thing is to give people a final say. Theresa May should stop blackmailing MPs with threats of a no deal, and instead bow to the will of the people, and give us a people’s vote.• Caroline Criado-Perez is a freelance journalist and feminist campaigner"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/626f9f64766c136f8ee017934ba73910d2d5a6a1/0_95_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f009a52a7b7d20171addf9c00b621b94","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of healthy","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘healthy’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘healthy’.Share your photos of what healthy means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 9 January at 10am.

The most up to date stats show a gap of 28 percentage points between black and white students in terms of receiving firsts or 2:1s at university. Yet despite the fact that this evidence has been around for a while, the gap doesn’t seem to be closing.Universities and politicians agree that this is a sticky issue, and there have been calls for concrete and sustainable solutions to address the gap. This has been a long time coming because some issues relating to student performance are deeply embedded in the fabric of our society, and play out as conscious and unconscious biases in our institutions.’s recent series on bias attests to how this can affect people at every level of society. Yet many myths persist within universities as to why the BAME attainment gap persists.

But when census data was reviewed by the Runnymede Trust, it showed that BAME students marginally surpass their white peers at GCSE level.So what’s going wrong? Experienced researchers in this area, such as Prof Jacqueline Stevenson, who heads research at Sheffield Institute of Education, found that BAME students feel just as confident as their peers at university. The main difference is a sense of entitlement to its support services, resources and opportunities, she found. If a lack of confidence is not the problem, it appears that the presence or absence of a sense of privilege might be playing a larger role.In my experience as a lecturer, universities aren’t doing enough to listen to the lived experiences of BAME staff and students. I attended several talks that have discussed the attainment gap: they were primarily aimed at (mainly white) widening participation staff tasked by their universities with “fixing the problem”. On the occasions that BAME staff or students were present at these events, they often functioned as “bystanders”, with few opportunities to participate in discussions. This was compounded by the use of confusing university policy jargon.I’ve found that many BAME students and staff have grown weary of the usual initiatives aimed at improving race equality in universities, such as mentoring, which can feel tokenistic. We know that nothing will change unless these initiatives are part of a comprehensive strategy for equality, ersity and inclusivity that is owned and driven by senior managers.These strategies must be tailored to the inidual institution and its culture, rather than using a one-size-fits-all approach. For example, what might be suitable for a university with a large BAME student population (such as London politan) might be less applicable to a university on the fringes of London with a different student intake, such as Roehampton. The strategic approach should involve the staff and students it affects, and focus on the specific barriers to attainment. A good example is Kingston University’s inclusive curriculum framework. This makes eradicating race inequality a priority across all parts of the university, from curriculum design to teaching to assessment.Where universities aren’t able to develop their own frameworks, engaging with the Race Equality Charter is a step forward. This requires universities to recognise race inequality and its impact through data, and develop robust plans for action to sustain long-term culture change. As an evaluation panellist for the Race Equality Charter, the best submissions I’ve seen have shown a commitment by senior managers to advance and embed race equality at every level of the institution to work with the local population to improve the university’s relationship with the community to level the playing field for staff recruitment and promotion and, as well as student attainment, to review teaching and learning to provide a more inclusive curriculum and experience. It’s clear that we shouldn’t just be “minding” the gap. We should be peering into it with a powerful microscope to rescue the student and staff population that has fallen into it. As a university sector, let’s make this our goal for 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69993a6335cb98af38511ff71b64a14619f106c6/0_677_5154_3091/master/5154.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b16125f63184e611c716bd7e702e6fd","title":"bath abbey heated water hot springs roman baths","story":"Green energy scheme uses 1.1m litres of hot water flowing through Roman baths each dayWork to install eco-friendly heating in Bath Abbey using hot water from the city’s Roman baths is beginning.Contractors are surveying the great Roman drain, which carries steaming water from Bath’s hot springs to the River Avon, as part of a project to use the springs to warm the nearby abbey that starts on Tuesday.Every day, 1.1m litres (250,000 gallons) of hot water flow through the Roman baths from the thermal spring located at the heart of the site. A large quantity of this hot water eventually ends up in the Avon via the great Roman drain.When harnessed and converted, the abbey says it could potentially produce 1.5MW of continuous energy to support a 200kW ground-source heat pump system.Isoenergy, a renewable energy company, will be exploring the great Roman drain to plan how to install heat exchangers in the structure as part of the abbey’s £19.3m Footprint refurbishment project.Alix Gilmer, Footprint’s project director, said: “The abbey’s Victorian heating system is sadly outdated, inefficient and expensive to maintain. This combined with the work we’re doing as part of our Footprint project to repair the abbey’s collapsing floor makes this the ideal time for us to install a new underfloor heating system and is a truly exciting way of using Bath’s most famous resource to create sustainable energy.”Edward Levien, commercial director of Isoenergy, added: “The drain survey marks the first practical step in installing what is one of the world’s first hot spring heating systems. Our engineers will be taking measurements and planning how the heat exchangers will be installed in the great Roman drain beneath York Street so work can be carried out with minimal disruption to the drain and the road above.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3abd2f95c9cdb893e56a0f05e9245d381cedb9d/0_132_1376_826/master/1376.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c3766ed67fd9fb1ce83f4aa8d08383b","title":"sixty four metre fatberg discovered in english seaside resort sidmouth devon","story":"Eight weeks needed to remove mass of fat, oil and wet-wipes from sewer in Sidmouth, DevonA block of hardened fat, oil and wet-wipes longer than six double-decker buses has been discovered in a sewer metres from the sea in a popular Devon resort town.It will take workers eight weeks to cut up and remove the 64-metre “fatberg” from the sewer beneath The Esplanade in Sidmouth.South West Water is also planning to open a pop-up shop in the town to inform people about the unwanted visitor and to urge them not to “feed” fatbergs by pouring fat, oil, grease and wet-wipes into the system.The company’s director of wastewater, Andrew Roantree, said: “It shows how this key environmental issue is not just facing the UK’s cities, but right here in our coastal towns.“It is the largest discovered in our service history and it will take our sewer team around eight weeks to dissect this monster in exceptionally challenging work conditions.“Thankfully it has been identified in good time with no risk to bathing waters.

Once responses have been considered, parliamentary time would need to be secured to pass the legislation ahead of the new market’s launch.However, the prospect of households giving clean energy away in the long term has been put to rest. The government said it believes “small-scale low-carbon generation should not be provided to the grid for free”.Perry said: “This new scheme could help us to build a bridge to the smart energy system of the future, with consumers firmly at its heart – not only buying electricity but being guaranteed payments for excess electricity they can supply to the grid.”She defended the switch from a subsidy to a market regime, telling MPs: “It is only right that as the price of this power provision has tumbled that we stop using other people’s money to subsidise something that we don’t need to do in order to bring forward solar.”Suppliers will be free to set the price they offer but there is no floor price beyond companies having to pay more than 0p. That will disappoint the Solar Trade Association which has warned that without a floor consumers risk being paid an unfair fee.However, the Renewable Energy Association welcomed the proposals which it said could “usher in a new era for small-scale renewables”.Rates could vary depending on the time of day and demand across the energy system.It is not yet clear what level companies will offer, but the current regime is equivalent to payments of nearly £80 a year for a typical solar installation.Households will be protected from the prospect of having to pay energy suppliers when prices go negative. Such a scenario can happen when energy demand is low in the summer and output from windfarms and solar panels is high, which officials expect will happen for several hours a year from 2020."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d7c97a81b2e77822f8ec317f96337c8f614df26/1_0_2720_1632/master/2720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efa294c4f6bb7ab9b59c43073b9cfb7b","title":"what to see in amsterdam the design lovers guide","story":"Quirky-cool Amsterdam has long been a draw for the creative crowd but now, thanks to the direct Eurostar service from London, it’s closer than ever. Artist and designer Yinka Ilori goes in search of galleries, boutiques and hip hangoutsAmsterdam’s always been one of these places friends keep telling me is amazing, while I’ve just nodded and gone: “Yeah, I’ll go there someday.” So it was about time I did. Getting there by Eurostar, without the faff of going to the airport, taking off your jacket and dealing with security makes all the difference. I constantly get inspired by things when I go away, and I’m always bringing back loads of stuff, from trainers to magazines, food and drink, so I love not being hampered by airlines’ weight restrictions. This time, though, I didn’t actually buy that much – I was too busy checking out some incredible places. Here’s my pick of where to go.Be a culture vultureI love photography, and so, it seems, does Amsterdam there are certainly plenty of places that focus on it. Don’t miss Foam, on Keizersgracht. It’s only a small gallery, but it has an impressive collection of work, built up since its opening in 2002, including images by international photographers such as Noémie Goudal, American artist Daniel Gordon, Dutch photographer Viviane Sassen and – a favourite of mine – Brit Juno Calypso. There’s such a good mix of work: black and white, colour, different themes and formats.You almost don’t need to go inside modern art museum Stedelijk its newest wing, unveiled in 2012, looks like a sculpture in itself (or a bathtub, according to some locals). It’s an impressively big, white structure that contrasts with the original, 19th-century building it’s attached to. Venture inside and you’ll find art, design and photography from a lot of people I admire, including Keith Haring, and Arthur Jafa, who’s worked on videos for Jay-Z and Beyonce.Art in the red light district? It exists W139 is an artist-run space on Warmoesstraat. Back when it launched in 1979, you could find anything from painting to spoken-word performances or punk rock, and it’s still got a fairly anarchic vibe today.Wine and dine, Amsterdam styleAmsterdam’s foodie scene isn’t only about great meals there are some awesome interiors too. I really appreciate good bar and restaurant design – it creates an atmosphere of its own, and none more so than at Café-Restaurant de Plantage, a gorgeous greenhouse-like structure in the middle of the city’s beautiful botanic gardens I could see flamingos strutting around outside from my table. The food’s mainly Mediterranean – think handmade ravioli stuffed with fennel sausage, or Spanish fish soup. It’s rightly jammed, and the service is fab and friendly, without being fawning.For a similar feel, try the jade-green-hued Bar Botanique, in the Eastern Docklands, which is hung with plants and bamboo trees, and serves a mighty fine negroni. The Kanarie Club on Bellamyplein is an old tram depot – you can still see tram tracks on the floor – and its vast, industrial space is softened with ropes of lights, and vibrantly painted steel beams. Upstairs, by the bar, is an empty swimming pool, which is a bit bonkers. But I found the way they’ve used the space inspirational it used to be derelict, and home to squatters – but the way they’ve given it a new lease of life echoes what I do, upcycling furniture. Also, they do the best burger I’ve ever had.I was really taken with the ethos of A Beautiful Mess, located a little outside the centre in a former prison. All the food is made by refugees from places such as Afghanistan, Somalia and Syria, and the experience they gain in the kitchen here paves the way to viable careers in hospitality. You’ll get everything from Lebanese flatbreads to chapatis and curry. Also, the interiors are very colourful – which always earns extra points from me.Round off your night with a visit to Hiding in Plain Sight (if you can find it). It’s undercover, like a speakeasy, with a louche feel. The barmen are great, and it feels like a locals’ place a really secret address.Explore new neighbourhoodsYou could spend a whole morning or afternoon checking out the NDSM district, reached by a ferry from near the train station. Formerly home to Amsterdam’s shipyards, it’s been transformed into a buzzing cultural hotspot with bars, cafes and pop-up shops. The IJ-Kantine bar and restaurant is located in the building that once housed the shipyard offices and workers’ canteen, and PLLEK, another hangout on the waterfront, is made out of shipping containers.There’s even a hotel in a crane the Faralda Crane Hotel has three plush suites inside, and you can bungee jump off it, too (I didn’t). This district is one of those places where you can just wander around for ages soaking up the atmosphere, gazing at the street art, having a beer and people-watching for hours. It’s no surprise that festivals and outdoor performances are regularly held here, and once a month there’s a massive flea market.Back over the water, I loved cycling round the charming neighbourhood of Jordaan, to the north-west of the city centre. It’s got a lot of history, including the Anne Frank Museum, and all the culture, food and shopping you could want. Lose yourself in the Nine Streets, a little network of passageways between the canals, crammed with independent homeware, fashion and interiors boutiques, but don’t leave without making a pilgrimage to Winkel 43. Why? Quite simply, it does the best apple pie you’ll ever eat. I had one slice there, and bought another to take home, it was that good.On my return Eurostar to London, I make the most of the journey. Getting inspiration down on paper while it’s fresh is important for my work, so, wherever I go, I’m always drawing and working. When you travel by plane, the lack of space can make that quite stressful, so being able to plug my phone and laptop in – with enough room to work properly – really was the icing on the cake – or perhaps the sugar on the Oliebollen, if we’re being Dutch about it.Getting thereEurostar has a twice-daily direct service from London St Pancras to Rotterdam and Amsterdam Centraal, with prices starting from £35 one way. On the return journey, passengers will need to take a Thalys train from Rotterdam or Amsterdam to Brussels-Midi for security checks, before boarding the Eurostar to London.

A year ago, those releases included best picture Oscar nominees Darkest Hour, The Shape of Water, Lady Bird, Phantom Thread, The Post and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.This year, first out of the gate is The Favourite. And the good news for cinemas is that this dark period comedy-drama is shaping up to be a big fat hit, with a debut of £2.2m for the weekend (£3.97m including previews). Director Yorgos Lanthimos’ previous biggest film was The Lobster, which achieved a lifetime total of £1.52m.The big question is whether The Favourite can match the giant numbers achieved by Darkest Hour (£24.1m) and Three Billboards (£15.2m).The latter title began with £2.17m (£2.36m including previews), so The Favourite is encouragingly ahead of the pace. Darkest Hour debuted with a bigger £4.06m, benefiting from appeal to a huge swathe of older cinemagoers interested in Winston Churchill and D-day. The Favourite benefits from must-see cachet plus support for national treasure in waiting Olivia Colman, but its appeal to fans of The King’s Speech is moot.The new film from Robert Zemeckis landed outside the Top 10 with a disappointing £145,000 from 328 cinemas (£242,000 including takings on 1-3 January). Welcome to Marwen stars Steve Carell as an artist who, after a vicious beating, retreats into a fantasy world, creating a small-scale second world war-era Belgian town in his back yard and populating it with dolls. Given a production budget estimated at up to $50m, Welcome to Marwen has already been declared a big cash loser for backers Universal, with losses up to $60m including marketing costs.The takeaway from Welcome to Marwen is that the storyline needed to be realised as a modestly budgeted arthouse film, rather than the CGI-heavy production delivered by Zemeckis. The story was previously told in acclaimed 2010 documentary Marwencol.Wins for best picture and best actor in the Golden Globes drama category on Sunday should help sustain Bohemian Rhapsody in the run-up to the Baftas and Oscars. The film enjoys a strong IMDb user rating of 8.310, plus a weaker Metacritic score of 49100, indicating a large disparity between the audience and critical opinion on this title.Admissions data – the number of tickets sold – is calculated separately and takes longer to tabulate. When these numbers arrive, 2018 is expected to show a rise on 2017. If box office is flat and admissions rose, the logical conclusion is that cinema ticket prices fell slightly in 2018, thanks to the growing popularity of unlimited-use loyalty cards and two-for-one promotions.

Shred 12 medium-sized mint leaves and add them to the dressing. Beat in 1 tbsp of peppery olive oil and set aside.Trim 240g of fennel (that’s a medium-sized bulb), reserving any fronds for decoration. Finely slice the fennel, then add to the bowl of yogurt dressing.Wipe 150g of large radishes or mooli, slice them as thinly as you can, then add to the dressing. Watermelon radish is good looking, but what you are after is anything that is firm and crisp. The long, white and sadly underappreciated mooli may well be the answer. Toss everything gently together then leave the salad for 20 minutes before serving. Finish with any reserved fennel fronds.

To ensure the fennel and radish are at their most crunchy, slice them thinly then leave them in a bowl of water and ice cubes for a good 25 minutes before adding them to the dressing.

My favourite is as a cool, refreshing base for sizzling lamb chops, straight from the grill, adding a scattering of crumbled feta over the top. The lamb, radish, yogurt and feta work together superbly. Use the dressed fennel as a filling for warm flatbread, stuffing the salad into the pockets with minced lamb that you have fried in a very hot pan, with very little oil, some garlic, thyme and a little ground sumac.

It is time we got serious about women’s sideburns, ’taches and all the other unexpected sproutingsWomen, throw down your razors: Januhairy is here. This month-long body-hair amnesty is the new Veganuary. Which is the new Dry January. Which, bless, is so retro it doesn’t even get a neologism. And even Brexit got one of those.For the women who have been unwittingly celebrating Januhairy since the moment they caught a glimpse of their leg hair in the wintry split-second between removal of jeans and pulling-on of pyjama bottoms and thought: “Fuck it” … well done. You are ahead of the curve. And probably someone who, like me, reacts to any month-long initiative that is ostensibly designed to improve us, but often results in more shame, in much the same way as misogynists react to a woman with hairy legs.My overall response to Januhairy is … bristly. On the one hand, good for Laura Jackson, the Exeter University student who started the campaign. Just like the hair that never stops growing, this work is never done. We live in a world where a razor advert depicting a woman removing body hair makes the news. It feels ridiculous to say so (pesky internalised misogyny), but it takes genuine guts to go out in summer with bare legs as hairy as mine get. On the other hand, this isn’t exactly a taboo that’s being busted when we’re still illustrating it with that image of Julia Roberts’ hairy pit from the 90s.And isn’t it always armpits? And white women? You don’t often see campaigns for the rights of whiskers, sideburns, taches, and – whisper it – nipple hair. The fact is, not all body hair is deemed equal, or rather, equally disgusting.What is a woman to do but, to the best of her ability, whatever the hell she likes? Like a man with his facial hair, I go through phases. I grow my body hair. I shave it off. As I get older I appear to be growing it more than removing it. But when I was a young, brown, hairy girl, it was a different story. In a natural extension of my self-hatred, I hated my body hair. I shaved my arms and watched in horror as the hair sprouted back thicker and blacker, as though my body was expressing my resistance for me. A boy who bullied me mercilessly mocked my moustache every day. Finally I bought some Jolen cream (because it sounded a bit like the Dolly Parton song) and dyed the hair on my upper lip bright orange. Even the hair-removal creams considered my race a joke, it seemed. I would love to say I marched into school with a flaming tangerine tache and, Anne of Green Gables style, cracked a slate over that boy’s head, but I didn’t.

Low numbers of property transactions, which have declined amid fears over Brexit, may also have had an influence, they added.Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent and former residential chairman of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said: “At first glance, the Halifax numbers are really positive as they reflect a time of particular political uncertainty and the height of Brexit turmoil.“But when taken with the recent fall in transactions, it is clear that the increase has more to do with a shortage of stock rather than a bounce-back in the market generally.”The average cost of a house in Britain is £229,729, according to Halifax, although there are significant differences across the country in house price growth. Property values in London and the south-east have either fallen or barely risen, while house price inflation has increased sharply in other parts of the country, including the midlands and the north-west of England."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f93213e9d745cb491e6c0285ca0416a57401c2d4/0_305_4928_2955/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d33beb779fe9014e91506ca3abe8d09","title":"virgin tickets advance fares terms change refund","story":"I want to draw your attention to my problem with Virgin Trains.

Cley Marshes nature reserve on the Norfolk coast is an unusual place for a gig, but the perfect stage for an evening of music inspired by the birds of Orkney.Cooper, known for the folk-rock of Erland and the Carnival and the more experimental soundscapes of the Magnetic North, migrated to new terrain for his debut solo album Solan Goose, released last year. With its combination of contemporary classical, ambient and electronica, it drew comparisons to Sigur Rós, Ólafur Arnalds and other music of northerly latitudes, as well as radio play and winning admirers in unexpected places, from literary figures including John Burnside and Robert Macfarlane.“We were a wee bit stressed,” says Cooper to his audience in Cley, after a four-hour drive to the coast, “and all of a sudden the geese flew over and it reminded us why we make music. We want to take you to the Orkney islands, very slowly, very gently.” For all the gentleness, Cooper’s songs are deeply emotional and given lift by three classically trained multi-instrumentalists, particularly the wordless notes delivered by the soaring soprano of Lottie Greenhow.“If it moves me close to the point of tears, I’ve probably achieved what I wanted,” says Cooper when we meet the following week on London’s South Bank, where he’s rehearsing for an appearance with a rather different collaborator, Paul Weller.The “release” that Cooper finds in his spare electronic and classic “ecosystem of music” is matched by the release he finds in natural landscapes: “You can feel like you’re going to sob and you don’t quite know why.”He has created the music for Nest, a light and sound installation in Waltham Forest’s Lloyd Park which this weekend will mark the opening of the first ever London borough of culture. Cooper’s compositions sample the voices of 1,076 people from local school, community and gospel choirs. One listener praised his samples of birdsong Cooper was delighted – they were children impersonating a starling murmuration. “They pretended to be starlings, singing at random times which is exactly what you want, and very quickly they came together, and sang together, which is scary like Hitchcock,” he laughs.Solan Goose was hatched almost by accident. Cooper, born and raised on the archipelago of Orkney, was feeling increasingly stressed and claustrophobic in London. He’d arrive at his studio and turn a noise he had heard – a jackhammer perhaps – into a note, “create a drone out of it” and then improvise a piano over that. He named each recording after Orcadian dialect for island birds: solan goose (gannet), shalder (oystercatcher), tammie norie (puffin) and, most deliciously, cattie-face (short-eared owl). “It was a way to pull me home, pull me back to childhood memory. Before I knew it, I had this fully fledged thing,” he says.It wasn’t all quite that simple. In keeping with his commitment to Orkney traditions, Cooper tried putting traditional folk lyrics to his music. It didn’t work. “Imagine being on a South Ronaldsay beach and all of a sudden there’s this red balloon popping up in the middle, and you’re no longer looking at the landscape. It was so out of place, it had to go.”In fact, Cooper has found it a relief not to sing during a year of performing the album – beginning at the Walthamstow Wetlands nature reserve, in London, and taking in summer festivals that included Womad and Port Eliot. “I fell out of joy with my own voice,” he says. “It’s a habitual experience when you doubt whether you can sing in the first place.” Instead, he has embraced playing with classically trained musicians.“The classical world can be very intimidating for some, but I remind myself that music is just sounds, just patterns,” he says. “I’m always trying to write the simplest thing, trying to do more with fewer notes.”Cooper has completed the second of a trilogy of albums shaped by Orkney’s air, sea and land, as celebrated by Orkney poet George Mackay Brown. Solan Goose is the air the sea is next the record will be released in the spring."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb1c9a52de00eba1301313f115475e995b0e78d0/351_573_2453_1472/master/2453.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8df9d76e4e3b4d33c6e4adc0990417bc","title":"brexit minister stephen barclay rules out article 50 extension beyond 29 march","story":"Stephen Barclay says UK has not held talks with EU about delaying departure dateStephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, has discounted the possibility that the government might delay Britain’s exit from the European Union beyond 29 March.Following reports claiming that UK officials were actively exploring the possibility of extending article 50, he said the government still planned to leave on time.His comments followed claims from Margot James, the digital minister, who said on Monday that “we might have to extend article 50” if May loses next week’s parliamentary vote on her Brexit deal.Interviewed on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Barclay said he had not had any discussions with the EU in terms of extension.Asked if he was denying reports in the  on Tuesday that officials had discussed an extension in Brussels, Barclay said: “Yes, I can be very clear that the government’s policy is to leave on 29 March.”Saying there would be practical problems to any extension, such as colliding with EU elections, Barclay said: “It is important the we reflect the result. The consequence of triggering article 50 is that you either have a deal or you have no deal.”Any extension to article 50 must be unanimously agreed by all EU member states, and EU officials have hinted in the past that the UK could be granted a “technical extension” in order to give time to enact legislation or complete a general election or referendumBarclay appeared to confirm that the EU would give further written assurances about the nature of the Northern Ireland backstop before next week’s key vote at Westminster on the Brexit deal.“And bear in mind a lot of the opposition to the withdrawal agreement and the backstop might be based on suppositions and misunderstandings about our intent as a European Union.”Barclay said Varadkar’s comments reflected the prime minister’s understanding. “The comments from the taoiseach reflect the fact that the EU want to see this deal passed but its also in the UK’s interests to avoid the uncertainty of not having a deal and the problems that would flow from that.”MPs will resume their debate on the Brexit deal on Wednesday, with a vote expected next Tuesday.The government is widely expected to lose that vote unless there is a significant development, prolonging the current parliamentary impasse over Brexit.May said on Monday she would set out in the coming days what assurances her government could give domestically on the backstop as well as those from the EU.An amendment to the finance bill – the legislation that gives the budget legal status – would restrict the government’s powers to pursue a no-deal Brexit unless parliament voted for no deal or the government requested an extension of article 50."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9854316d332caf1339961c21c2bdbd46d39fd0b8/870_1023_1568_940/master/1568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f440938c6e2ec06f854e2b54c618116","title":"mps must stop wishful thinking and back may on brexit irish deputy pm simon coveney","story":"German foreign minister urges British MPs not to let UK crash out of EU without a dealGermany has said it stands in “full solidarity” with Ireland over the Irish backstop, saying a hard border would be unacceptable to the EU.Germany’s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, was speaking as Ireland’s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, said MPs who were planning to vote against Theresa May’s deal needed to stop their “wishful thinking” that the EU would reopen Brexit negotiations.“Some people call us stubborn, but the truth is avoiding a hard border in Ireland is a fundamental concern for the EU, a union that more than anything else serves one purpose – to build and maintain peace in Europe,” said Maas.In a significant intervention, he urged British MPs to “act responsibly” and not allow the UK to crash out to a disastrous no deal.“Walls and borders can threaten peace. We believe in the peace-making powers of the European Union,” said Maas, adding that the Good Friday agreement that ended decades of bloodshed in Northern Ireland was “living proof of this principle”.“During the Brexit negotiations, all 27 member states agreed on a common position and stood by it. This unity includes full solidarity with Ireland. We insisted, and still do: a hard border iding the Irish island is unacceptable.“Brexit is less than three months away and the final outcome is up in the air. Even a no-deal scenario is still an option despite the serious damage this would cause on both sides.“There’s too much at stake to take this lightly. We urge our British friends to act responsibly,” said Maas in a speech to Irish ambassadors in Dublin on Tuesday.Addressing the same gathering, Coveney said: “These are fateful days and weeks in British politics. I remain convinced that there is a majority in the UK parliament which will do all it can to avert a disastrous crash-out Brexit.“The time for wishful thinking is over. There is no alternative 585-page agreement waiting to be dusted off,” he said. “And it is also wishful thinking to ignore the default outcome if nothing else is agreed – that default is a crash-out.”He said it was time for MPs to be realistic and to stop holding on to the notion, expressed by the former Brexit secretary David Davis on the BBC on Tuesday morning, that the EU was playing negotiating games.“Surely now is the time in Westminster for everyone – in government and in opposition – to cast aside unrealistic options based on promises that simply cannot be delivered,” Coveney said.In an indirect appeal to the 100 or so MPs who are expected to vote against  May’s deal next week, he said reality needed to take hold in Westminster.“If that doesn’t happen quickly, in the absence of that realism, it is the hardliners who think no price is too high to pay for their version of Brexit who will win out to everyone’s cost, including Ireland’s.”Speaking later at a press conference, Coveney said Ireland would not block any British request to delay leaving the EU by extending the article 50 process.“If it is the case that at some point in the future that the British government seeks an extension of article 50, then that is something that will have to get consideration at an EU level. But certainly from an Irish perspective, if such an ask happens, we won’t be standing in the way on that.”Maas was vaguer, saying it was premature to discuss any extension request before next week’s Westminster vote.The German diplomat echoed Coveney’s warning that all sides would pay a price if “playing for time” led to a no-deal outcome.The two speeches came after the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said the EU did not want to “trap” Britain and was working hard on written assurances to help May get the withdrawal agreement ratified in Westminster next week.Coveney also appealed to the DUP and Sinn Féin to get Northern Ireland’s devolved government back up and running quickly. “With a UK decision to leave the EU about to cause unprecedented dislocation – there is simply no excuse for the parties in Northern Ireland not to find a way to work together.”Davis told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that fresh written assurances from the EU to address his concerns over the Irish border element of the deal would not be enough as they would not be “legally binding”.The assurances are expected to include a pledge that a trade deal could be signed off by 2021, thereby obviating the need for a backstop if the transition period was extended for one year.Davis expressed confidence that the EU would make a U-turn, was merely “testing the mettle” of the UK and predicted the EU would reopen negotiations.Coveney said on Tuesday morning this was impossible. “The European council provided reassurances about the backstop in December and we are ready to provide additional clarifications if these are helpful,” he said“However, we cannot reopen the withdrawal agreement text itself, which was the product of multiple compromises and highly detailed negotiations in a very wide range of areas.”Varadkar said EU leaders did not wish to trap Britain in the backstop indefinitely and had already made that clear."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56eb304bb0998efad286b81642834e47c39a6369/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dd483cd731fb99ddf8bfb1bfae9e4c7","title":"the way the eu treated the uk opened my eyes bolsovers brexit","story":"Walking into the debating hall at a school in Bolsover during the EU referendum campaign, Kate Godfrey couldn’t quite believe her eyes. On the front row, ahead of the sixth-formers she had come to address in her role as east Midlands field manager for Britain Stronger in Europe, were five teachers wearing green ties advertising the Grassroots Out campaign.“Here” is Shirebrook, a former pit village five miles south-east of Bolsover, a market town famed for its allegedly haunted castle – as well as its cantankerous Beast, Dennis Skinner, MP since 1970. The main colliery, which employed more than 2,000 men in its heyday, closed in 1993. The mine shaft was filled in and Sports Direct, the bullish discount retailer, plonked its 75,000 sq metre (800,000 sq ft) headquarters on the site. Mitchell worked there when he was 16. Most young people in Shirebrook have at least had a holiday job in the gargantuan warehouse, where a  investigation in 2015 revealed workers were toiling for effectively less than the minimum wage. In the 13 years since Sports Direct moved in, thousands of eastern European people followed, taking up insecure agency jobs. Old miners moved out, their homes snapped up and then carved up by landlords sensing a quick buck. Bedrooms were ided in two by sheets of cardboard, sellotape on windows marking which half of the window belonged to which tenant. Living rooms became sleeping quarters, forcing new residents out into local parks to do their socialising, drinking cans of Tyskie and Żubr that had ousted stout and bitter from the corner shop.It has led to a “ided community”, believes Mitchell, who works 25-30 hours a week at Tesco, where he is a union steward, and is studying for a degree in sports coaching and development. “Now, I go out with a Polish girl personally and my best friend is Polish, but there has been an integration problem because there’s such a large amount of migrants, they’ve got their own shops where they speak Polish, they’ve got their own little communities and there’s this ide. In many ways, I think that’s what Thatcher wanted right from the beginning. She wanted to ide and conquer, and she’s been able to do it through European Union policy,” he said.Selling hot dogs outside Sports Direct last week, 27-year-old Chris Handley said his girlfriend used to work inside and voted leave partly as a result of her experience: “She struggled with work because her colleagues were from eastern Europe and she felt pushed out as a result.”Along with Mitchell, Ashley Taylor, 23, is one of the youth officers of Bolsover constituency Labour party. A landscape architect, he voted remain in the referendum but has now changed his mind. “I would vote to leave now because the way the EU has treated the UK on its exit has opened my eyes up a little bit. I’ve seen what they have been doing to other countries, particularly Greece,” he said. “As a Labour party member with Jeremy Corbyn at the helm, I believe in socialist values and I believe we could generally achieve more nationally under him than we could in the EU.”He is against a second referendum: “We’re already in a situation where domestic policies have been totally forgotten about because of Brexit. I don’t believe a second referendum would solve homelessness on our streets or improve our NHS.’”It is that sort of talk which makes Alan Gascoyne want to wring some young necks. A former miner down Shirebrook pit, the 63-year-old is now secretary of the Miners Welfare, a community centre and charity in the town. He has been listening to Naomi Crew, the 26-year-old barmaid at the Welfare, explain why she would probably have voted leave, had she actually turned out in the referendum. “People my age, people born after 1990, don’t know what it was like round here once – the Shirebrook Alan talks about, when people looked out for each other and the pits were still open and acted like glue for our community. We’ve never known it stitched together like that,” she said. “Maybe Shirebrook people used to look out for each other, but now it’s every man for himself.”Gascoyne is similarly dismayed at the rapidly diminishing Labour vote in the area. Skinner, a lifelong Eurosceptic who announced his plan to vote for Brexit in the Morning Star, has seen his majority slashed to 5,288 from 27,149 in 1997.The generational ties are breaking, sighed Gascoyne. “It was always the case that you voted how your dad voted and he voted how his dad voted. In one of the last elections my daughter rang me up and said, Dad, I’m thinking of voting Lib Dem. I said fine, but don’t show your face around our house any more.” He laments the lack of political education among many young people. “They don’t know that it was Labour that founded the NHS and that it is the EU which has given them many of their employment rights. They think they’ve just dropped from the sky.”Many young people the  meets in this large constituency just aren’t bothered: “Doesn’t make a difference to me, duck.” But Brexit will change Bolsover. Its biggest employer is already making contingencies for life outside the EU. Foreseeing a recruitment problem when the ready supply of young eastern Europeans is cut off, Sports Direct has been investing in some “partial automation for the Shirebrook warehouse operations” on internet fulfilment orders. This, according to the annual report, should “mitigate any potential staffing shortfall after Brexit”. We often hear that no one voted to be made poorer. They probably didn’t vote to lose their jobs to a robot either."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/327c22ade296f526da7a59d742e58fc9dae833db/0_44_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d750c501803713402fe3e9d063c5811a","title":"brexit latest news no deal amendment liam fox says backing amendment designed to make no deal harder would be irresponsible politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including the possible vote on the no-deal amendment during the finance bill debateSpeaking outside Scotland Yard, Laurence Taylor, the deputy assistant commissioner of the politan police, said that officers would be expected to intervene if protesters tried to stop MPs going about their daily routines. Asked if the Met would take specific action over John Bercow’s concerns about the safety of MPs outside parliament, Taylor said:It’s one of the allegations that we are assessing at the moment to determine whether any criminal activity has taken place. We’ve given a very clear direction to our officers on the ground that if they witness criminal behaviour then there is an expectation that an arrest will be made. And also if they witness any behaviour that is intimidating, or to an extent that it is obstructing somebody going about their normal daily routines, then we would expect an intervention to be made according to what’s happening at the time.Taylor said the policing operation near Parliament would be “enhanced” in the run-up to the Brexit vote next week. He went on:From a policing perspective, policing Brexit is always going to be very challenging. It’s a very contentious issue, and it’s going to bring out people with opposing views.Obviously politicians are part of those arguments, and our role as a police service is to make sure that people are able to voice those views in an appropriate manner without causing stress or criminal behaviour. We’ve reviewed our policing plan on the back of incidents yesterday. You will see a visible policing presence (near parliament). We’ve had a policing presence there for a number of months with ongoing protest. We recognise the challenges there at the moment and certainly leading up to the vote next week we will be enhancing the policing presence and we will ensure that we have appropriate measures in place to attempt as far as possible to reassure people that they can go about their lives without fear of harassment or alarm.Greg Clark, the business secretary, told MPs during business questions earlier that a no-deal Brexit “should not be contemplated”. He said:I’ve always been very clear, representing the views of small business and large business, that no deal should not be contemplated.Conservative MPs are being told to vote against the CooperMorgan amendment to the finance bill intended to make implementing a no-deal Brexit harder (see 9.31am), my colleague Jessica Elgot reports.But, as Jessica points out, at the Downing Street lobby briefing the prime minister’s spokesman made it clear that the government won’t regard it as the end of the world if it loses the vote. I will post more on that, and what else was said at the briefing, shortly.The vote will take place after 7pm.In the Commons, when the Labour MP Stephen Doughty asked about the “racist” abuse being directed at people by pro-Brexit campaigners outside the Houses of Parliament, John Bercow, the speaker, described this behavour as “a type of fascism”. He said:It’s a type of fascism. Let’s be quite clear about that, it’s a type of fascism. Women and ethnic minority citizens in particular are being targeted. I don’t say that they’re the only people on the receiving end of this completely unacceptable behaviour but they have been and are being deliberately and disproportionately targeted. That is not acceptable and we have to ensure that something is done about it.Here is an extract from the letter John Bercow, the Commons speaker, has written to the politan police about campaigners intimidating MPs outside parliament. (See 12.52pm.)I would like to ask for your help in addressing, as a matter of urgency, a number of incidents of aggressive, threatening and intimidating behaviour towards MPs and journalists in the vicinity of Abingdon Green. The issue was raised with me in the House of Commons yesterday by colleagues who are concerned for their personal safety when they go to and return from media interviews. I am also adding my support to the growing call for police action by at least 60 members, who I believe have already submitted letters to you on this matter.It is frankly intolerable if members of parliament and journalists cannot go about their lawful business without being ritually insulted, abused, intimidated, threatened and harassed. There seems to be a pattern here of a regular coterie of burly white men who are effectively targeting and denouncing members whom they recognise and dislike - most notably female and those from ethnic minority backgrounds. One report I have is of a member being surrounded by iniduals who hurled abuse at her as she walked back to parliament. I have also been warned that school children visiting the estate are at risk of witnessing these toxic attacks. Naturally I recognise that you and your officers have a difficult job striking the balance between allowing peaceful protests and intervening when things turn sour. There is of course a right to protest and that is important. However, it’s one thing demonstrating from a distance with placards, or calling out slogans - and another, where the protester invades the personal space of a member, subjects him or her to a tirade of menacing, racist, sexist and misogynistic abuse, and follows them back to their place of work. I politely suggest that the present situation is not only intolerable but untenable. Matters cannot stand as they do today. A change in policy is required. I would therefore ask you and your officers to do your utmost to increase security for members, journalists and visitors to the parliamentary estate, and ensure there is safe access to and from Abingdon Green.In the Commons John Bercow, the speaker, has just told MPs that he has written to politan police commissioner Cressida Dick asking for help to tackle “aggressive, threatening and intimidating behaviour” against MPs and journalists outside parliament.I’m just back from the Number 10 lobby briefing. The highlight came when the prime minister’s spokesman was asked about these tweets from the Times’ Sam Coates.(Reminder: these people actually run the country.)Here are more of Coates’ tweets.Alex Salmond has won his legal challenge against the Scottish government’s investigation into claims he sexually harassed two women, after the government admitted its processes were unlawful, my colleague Severin Carrell reports.I’m off to the lobby briefing now. I will post again after 12.30pm.David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, was interviewed on the Today programme this morning. He is the one who resigned over the Chequers Brexit plan in the summer, remember, not the one who resigned over the actual withdrawal agreement (Dominic Raab). Davis got the main 8.10 slot on the programme, outranking the current Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, who was on a bit earlier.Here are the main points.What is going on at the moment is they’re testing the mettle of the British government ... The simple truth is that they will hold fast to the line - this is the traditional approach of the European commission, the European Union - until the last possible minute. And then, if we hold fast to our line, then they will actually come back and renegotiate.Davis also claimed that today’s  story, saying EU sources are saying British officials have been “putting out feelers” about extending article 50 (a story played down by the Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay, but not categorically denied) confirmed his theory. He said:Asked what the EU would offer in a future negotiation, Davis said: “It will be what we demand.” Those demands would included legal assurances on the backstop, and some undertaking on free trade, he said.Davis could theoretically be right, although a very large number of senior EU figures have said, repeatedly and categorically, that they are not willing to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement. Nathalie Loiseau, the French Europe minister, said that again only this morning. (See 10.30am.) And, as my colleague Lisa O’Carroll reports, Ireland’s deputy prime minister Simon Coveney has said that Brexiters like Davis are guilty of “wishful thinking” if they think the EU is willing to make new compromises.The French are moving heaven and earth. They have found places outside Calais to have their inspection regimes. The head of French customs has said they are going to facilitate and accelerate through-put. Indeed, other ports are saying the same Rotterdam, Zeebrugge, Rotterdam, all saying the same. And they are taking on thousands of people.When it was put to him that a no-deal Brexit would inevitably cause delays at the ports, he replied:That is why the French are taking all the action they’re taking. This does not get reported in the British press, but they are taking loads of actions to ensure that it’s dealt with quickly.He also said that French lorry drivers had blockaded ports before, without the British economy grinding to a halt.Denis MacShane, the former Labour Europe minister and a fervent pro-European, claimed later that Davis was talking “nonsense”.Davis was actually referring to a report from the Lords European Union committee (pdf) published in 2017 which concluded: Although there are competing interpretations, we conclude that if agreement is not reached, all EU law—including provisions concerning ongoing financial contributions and machinery for adjudication—will cease to apply, and the UK would be subject to no enforceable obligation to make any financial contribution at all.But Geoffrey Cox, the Brexiter attorney general, challenged this when asked about it in the Commons in December. He said:The view of the government, and my view, is that we would have obligations to pay a certain amount of money were we to leave the European Union without a deal. The House of Lords European Union committee concluded that there would be no obligation under EU law. That is a stronger argument—not necessarily an incontestable one—as to our obligations under EU law, but the committee also concluded that we might have obligations under public international law, and with that I agree. There is an argument that we would not have an obligation under public international law, but it is an argument unlikely to be accepted by any international tribunal.My view is therefore that we would owe a presently unquantifiable sum were we to leave the European Union without a deal. It is impossible at this stage to say how much. It is true that the European Union is not a member state and is not a state, and therefore it is unable to take the case to the international court of justice. It might therefore be difficult to enforce the public international law obligation that existed. However, I ask the House to reflect on the fact that if this country, acknowledging that such obligations probably exist or do exist, did not pay them, it would be likely to cause the deepest resentment, just as it would to any of us who were unpaid a debt. If we leave a club, we pay the bar bill. If we do not pay the bill, we are not likely to get a lot of consideration from the other side. Today the government is launching a radio advertising campaign intended to give people information they might need in the event of a no-deal Brexit. But the government does not seem to be very keen on publicising its own publicity drive, according to the BBC’s Norman Smith and the ’s Christopher Hope.Nathalie Loiseau, the French Europe minister, told reporters this morning as she arrived at the EU’s general affairs council that the Brexit withdrawal agreement will not be renegotiated. Asked how the EU could prove to British MPs that it does not want to use the backstop, she said:We have said it repeatedly. The president said it at the end of the previous European council. Indeed, we all want to have a fruitful, profitable relationship with the United Kingdom in the future. So the backstop is just a last resort solution.Asked if that meant no new reassurances would be offered, she said:These are political assurances. But there is nothing more we can do. The withdrawal agreement is indeed a good agreement, both for the UK and the European Union. We should stick to it.Asked about extending article 50, she says she did not want to discuss “hypotheticals”. But she said the prospect of raising it had not been raised with France.Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, was also on Sky this morning. In that interview he claimed that some Tory MPs were now “much more open” to supporting Theresa May’s Brexit deal.Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, has been giving media interviews this morning. As my colleague Rajeev Syal reports, he dismissed reports that the government is contemplating asking the EU if it can extend article 50.As PoliticsHome reports, Barclay also angered anti-Brexit MPs by arguing that the intimidation of Anna Soubry by pro-Brexit campaigners outside the House of Commons showed why a second referendum would be a bad idea.Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, has said the EU is willing to give written assurances about the withdrawal agreement ahead of next week’s vote at Westminster. Speaking to reporters during a trip to Mali, the taoiseach said: The summit conclusions at our last meeting in December provided written assurances, but what’s happening at the moment is there is close contact between the UK and EU institutions as to whether a further set of written guarantees, explanations and assurances could make a difference. Our intent, once the withdrawal agreement has been ratified by Westminster and the European Parliament, is to get into talks on the future relationship on the new economic and trade treaty with Britain, on the new security partnership with Britain. We don’t want to trap the UK into anything - we want to get on to the talks about the future relationship right away. I think it’s those kind of assurances we are happy to give.The EU has repeatedly said that any assurances of this kind would not amount to a renegotiation of the withdrawal agreement. Instead, they would take the form of a clarification.But Varadkar also said he could not satisfy the DUP or Brexiters. He said:It’s impossible for me to speak on behalf of the DUP or on behalf of the Brexiteers.I can’t say what would or would not satisfy them. What I can say is that Ireland set out its objectives from day one. We regret the UK is leaving the EU, but they are.On Newsnight last night Richard Harrington, a business minister, said he would resign if the government went ahead with a no-deal Brexit. He told the programme:We will not be leaving with no deal. We’re going to leave with the prime minister’s deal. And I think people are beginning to realise that it’s the prime minister’s deal or there may not be a Brexit.Asked if he was prepared to resign to stop a no-deal Brexit, Harrington replied: “Definitely, I would.” Harrington also said his view was “not an uncommon one”. It is thought that some of the pro-Europeans in cabinet, like Greg Clark, the business secretary, and David Gauke, the justice secretary, would also quit if Theresa May decided to take the UK out of the EU without a deal. Gauke has effectively said as much in public.At the weekend the Sunday Times (paywall) rather ingeniously suggested that this amendment was could “derail a no-deal Brexit this week by starving the government of cash and creating a Donald Trump-style shutdown”. In truth, it is nowhere near as significant as that (although a second amendment, tabled by the Lib Dems, would be much more likely to hamstring the government in the event of a no-deal Brexit, although that is much less likely to get called”). The Daily Mail quotes a Treasury source saying the government is “pretty relaxed” about the amendment because it would only “stop us doing some little things to make the tax system work better”, suggesting that around lunchtime we could well get an announcement saying the government will accept the amendment.But that would still be awkward for the government because the amendment, tabled by Labour’s Yvette Cooper and the Conservative Nicky Morgan, effectively provides a template for stopping the government exercising all manner of powers in the event of a no-deal Brexit. (It says certain no-deal related powers in clause 89 of the finance bill could only be exercised if there is either a) a deal b) an extension to article 50 or c) a Commons vote authorising a no-deal Brexit. It is easy to imagine more amendments being tabled attaching these three conditions to a huge range of government bills.)And Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, has said it would be “irresponsible” for the government to have its hands tied in this way. Speaking in California, where he is on a trade trip, he said the amendment would not stop a no-deal Brexit. As the BBC reports, he went on:The government has to ensure that all eventualities are covered. It maybe that we cannot get agreement with the EU and that we have to leave without an agreement in which case the UK has to be prepared.Here is the agenda for the day.11am: Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, speaks at the publication of a Shelter report saying England should launch the biggest council and social house building drive in its history to rescue millions of people from a future in dangerous, overcrowded or unsuitable homes.After 12.45pm: MPs debate the finance bill. At some point there may be a vote on an amendment intended to make it harder for the government to implement a no-deal Brexit.As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web.

But what makes some men send photographs of their genitals to unsuspecting women – and is it time for a change in the law?When Leah Holroyd joined a dating site five years ago, the 31-year-old noticed a lot of men had listed The Great Gatsby as a favourite book. “So, to be slightly provocative, I mentioned in my profile that I thought it was overrated, and challenged someone to persuade me it was great,” she says. A postgraduate student in English literature sent her a message that read “a bit like literary criticism”, and they began exchanging messages and discussing their favourite books. Holroyd found him pleasant enough, but she was looking for a relationship rather than just friendship, and he only ever talked to her about authors.After a couple of weeks, the bibliophile said he would be visiting London where Holroyd, who builds online learning courses, was living. “He asked if I fancied meeting for coffee and a walk by the river,” she says. He suggested they swap phone numbers to make arrangements easier. “Almost instantly, he sent me closeups of his penis.”Laura Thompson, a researcher at City, University of London, whose work examines harassment over dating apps, says the issue has until now been trivialised. “The research in this area is really limited. I think this blind spot says something about how society and the law tends to think of the problem: that dick pics are an annoying internet phenomenon as opposed to ‘real’ flashing. The term ‘cyberflashing’ wasn’t even in widespread use until about a year or so ago. Research reflects the world we live in, and I just don’t think this problem has been taken seriously until relatively recently.”Yet the question that plagued me after hearing Holroyd’s story was: why? What happened in the mind of that man between talking about books, inviting a woman for coffee and a walk – and sending her a photograph of his penis? Unsurprisingly, I did not get very far by asking men in person if they had ever sent unsolicited photographs of their penis. So I set up an account on Reddit, where users can post anonymously in forums on a range of topics, and I asked the question again. Shortly afterwards, I went to the cinema. When I checked back a few hours later, I discovered more than 500 comments, and the moderators had shut the thread down.The comments were fascinating. The most important thing I learned is that sending pictures of one’s genitals has different meanings for different men – and different meanings for the same men at different points in their lives. Stephen Blumenthal, a consultant clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst at the Portman – an NHS clinic that offers specialist long-term therapy to patients with disturbing sexual behaviours – says: “There’s always a tendency with these issues to provide one kind of formulation a one-size-fits-all explanation. But the reality is that there are many different motives that people have, some of which are perhaps more troubled and troubling than others.”Some who shared their experiences anonymously wrote about not feeling confident with their bodies, and wanting praise. One Reddit user, Jake, told me: “I’ve done it a few times in the past, and I think it’s mostly about validation. Although most men will never admit to it, we are very insecure about our bodies, especially down there. So, unconsciously, we just want someone to say we look nice, or that we are attractive. OK, sending an unsolicited dick pic is really not the way to do it, but I do think that’s the driver. We are just desperate for someone to tell us we’re OK. Not even sexy or incredibly handsome – just OK.”Others described wanting to turn up the sexual excitement in a messaging conversation they felt was flagging. Another user, Dave, wrote: “If the conversation had some potential, but was slowing down or becoming boring, I would sometimes send a dick pic. Because either they stop texting me or I get laid.” He added that “dick pics now only get sent upon request”.For others, it was “a numbers game”. For all the unsolicited pictures that were ignored or rebuffed, there was the occasional woman who responded in kind, and if one picture “worked”, it was worth it. Jake wrote: “When they were well-received, I felt good about it, from the validation and the boost to my self-image, but also the precedent it opened. It was now OK for them to reply in kind, or to steer the conversation down more sexual routes.”Another, John, estimated he has sent 100 unsolicited pictures in chatrooms over the years, after becoming aroused. “I’d see people chatting about various subjects. If they were remotely sexual, I think that served as my entry point to sending a pic,” he wrote. While he did have a couple of his “best pictures” saved on his phone, “the thrill of it was taking a pic in that moment and sending it … I think it may have been about creating or imagining some kind of sexual connection in that moment. The feeling was a bit of a rush in the anticipation of a response.”He described the four types of responses he received: very rarely, it would lead to an overtly sexual conversation in a chat window, in which further pictures might be exchanged or he might be sent a complimentary message or he might receive a negative, angry response. But, most often, he received no response.John is now in his 60s and has not sent a picture like this in more than a decade. He wrote: “As I have become older, frankly, it just seems a combination of rude, silly and empty. I have learned this is offensive and an unwanted intrusion, even if it is the internet and anonymous. Even online, it is a violation, in my opinion little different from the stereotypical street flasher in a trenchcoat. Really, those who send these unsolicited pics are essentially standing on a virtual street corner digitally flashing women they don’t know for their own sexual gratification.”I was intrigued by John’s condemnation, so I asked if he included himself among these online flashers. “Yes. The anonymity of the internet facilitates doing things online you’d never contemplate in the real world, so I think that helps men distance themselves from any consequences or impact on the person they send it to.”This notion makes a lot of sense to Blumenthal. “The internet has brought out all sorts of new varieties of unusual sexual proclivities that are related to previous versions, and might have some similar dynamics,” he says. Blumenthal believes there is a hidden narrative underneath some of these stories, which is what he has experienced with his patients who have committed indecent exposure: “Some will be trying to impress, whereas some will be seeking to intrude. And this intrusive aspect is an important one,” he says.“The guy on the train using AirDrop is flashing in the digital age. The flasher is looking for something very particular: he is interested in the response, focused on the faces of these women – he wants to see shock and surprise, and a kind of disabling of the person he is flashing.”In almost every case of real-world indecent exposure, he says, there will have been a childhood incident where the perpetrator endured a trauma that made him feel out of control. This is the notion of identification of the aggressor: determined never to be a victim again. As an adult, he unconsciously twists this act around so that, “he is now in the driving seat, watching the reaction of those he disturbs, inserting into his victim a feeling of shock, surprise, disturbance”.John says he has never heard about women being distressed by pictures sent by somebody they are already talking to online, describing them as “really more of an annoyance”. Perhaps some women do feel that, but others find them much more disturbing. When Holroyd received several explicit pictures from the man with whom she had just agreed to go for coffee and a walk, she tells me, “I felt totally shocked. Nothing in the conversation had made me think he was going to do that. I felt really worried because it seemed like a deception, I was confused, I didn’t know what he was really looking for, I didn’t feel safe.”When she replied to this man to say that she no longer wanted to meet him, she says, “he got really angry and aggressive. He told me that I must be mentally unstable because I had changed my mind so quickly. He said: ‘If you can just change your mind like that there’s something wrong with you.’ And he told me I should get professional help. He put the blame on me made me feel I had done something wrong and had been unfair to him.”In expressing his rage towards Holroyd, he was also describing exactly how he had made Holroyd feel about him: he was the one whose behaviour had been unstable, unpredictable, disturbed and disturbing. He had projected his feelings directly on to her.Some men said they had stopped sending unsolicited photographs after a negative response. Another Reddit user, Jeremy, wrote about the one occasion he sent a photograph to a girl he had been messaging on Tinder: “She replied with: ‘Ew!’ and blocked me. Rightly so. Haven’t done it since.”Others replied that leaving it up to women to teach men what is acceptable by responding negatively could put those women at risk.Blumenthal says that it is crucial to distinguish between noncontact offences, in which the perpetrator does not touch his or her victim, and contact offences – and that the overlap between those who commit indecent exposure and those who go on to sexually assault their victims, is low. Yet the term “noncontact offence” in this context, is an interesting one – it almost feels inaccurate: while sending an unsolicited photograph does not involve physical contact, it can feel like a violation an assault.Cyberflashing can be prosecuted under a number of different laws, which carry prison sentences of up to two years. But there are problems with these laws, says barrister Kate Parker, director of the UK-based Schools Consent Project, a charity she founded to educate young people about consent and sexual assault. A prosecution would need to prove that the sender’s purpose was either to cause distress or anxiety, or that the image was “grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character”.Parker says: “In an era where sending dick pics is becoming increasingly normalised, the depressing reality is that such intent might not be proven. Some men think it is an appropriate way to start a conversation, or take an existing conversation to a more ‘flirty’ level.” And when it comes to the notion of indecency, the threshold is increasingly high: “as our online and offline worlds are increasingly saturated with sexual imagery, it may be that society’s collective perception of sexual indecency begins to shift”. She supports the creation of a new law – one “that finally includes a consideration of the recipient’s – typically a woman – response to such messages as a determinant of criminal liability”.We can improve the law, criminalising this latest incarnation of flashing, but, unless we try to understand the motivations behind it, we have no hope of stopping it. When I was a schoolgirl, a man flashed me as I walked home from the local park – he ran ahead of me then stood masturbating, with his T-shirt over his face. When I was 17, on holiday in Paris with my best friend, a man thrust a photograph of a deformed penis in our faces. When I was in my 20s, a man I was flirting with texted me an unexpected dick pic. All these experiences, shifting in format, but not in nature, as technology progressed, were shocking, and unpleasant. On the upside, I am happy to report that in researching this piece, I did not receive a single one.Some names have been changed.

This is not something I went into lightly. You could look at this as a natural progression but it isn’t something I take on without a certain amount of trepidation.“It’s something I thought long and hard about.

Barely has the lucrative deal with CVC Capital Partners to inject new capital into English club rugby union been signed before renewed efforts to move the goalposts have commenced. Fresh attempts are already being made to suspend relegation from the Premiership this season, the first step towards a very different ball game to the one that exists.Did anyone seriously imagine CVC would sit on its hands and idly wait for its investment to be repaid? It wants a healthy return and wants it asap. Bang on cue, Formula One’s former ringmaster Bernie Ecclestone popped up with some soothing words in the Mail on Sunday. “If you got hold of the guys and tarted them up, it would be bigger than American Football.” Thanks for that, Bernie.Clearly there is scope to improve how the club game is marketed and promoted, although those with in-depth knowledge of television rights remain highly sceptical of claims there is still a limitless broadcasting rights universe out there. For the sport to propel itself into this “boldly go” Star Trek era at full warp factor, however, it is crucial its core support believes fully in the mission.Which is why talk of slamming shut the trapdoor to the Championship mid-season would be counterproductive, even if that is what transpires at some stage. As Nigel Melville, the Rugby Football Union’s acting chief executive, suggested last month, it is “wishful thinking” to imagine otherwise. What about those in the Championship (London Irish aside) who have invested in players with the intention of pushing for promotion this season or next? If the rules are explicit in advance, fine. If not, there is already understandable talk of legal action being taken by aggrieved Championshipsecond-tier clubs.What happens thereafter, though? What does “tarting up” mean in this delicate context? Where does all this leave traditionalists and less well-populated unions? Is playing games in China really the answer to anyone’s prayers? The Chinese have just landed on the far side of the moon where there will be more atmosphere than for Worcester versus Newcastle in Beijing. The Shanghai Scorpions might have a better chance of attracting local loyalty but, even then, it would take years. The Premiership games played in the United States to date might as well have been staged behind closed doors on Saturn in terms of engaging the average American sports fan.The public’s appetite for rubbish makeovers being distinctly finite, it boils down to doing it right or not at all. If an NFL franchise-based competition is the endgame, it has to involve a proper draft system, a decent geographical spread and a centralised pot to ensure there are no stragglers, a respected league commissioner making far-sighted decisions for the common good and, crucially, a league that works for the many not just the few.It is not simply a matter of studying how the Premier League broke free of the Football Association and cutting and pasting the same terms and conditions. Rugby is not football where, incidentally, promotion and relegation remain integral features of the model. Get it wrong and the professional game will not easily be rebuilt. Nor will its architects be trusted to do better next time. One shot, one opportunity and all that.In that respect the timing of the supposedly leaked Premiership Rugby League meeting minutes is interesting. Ever since the Rugby Football Union missed a huge trick by failing to contract the top English players centrally at the outset of professionalism in 1996, the club versus country narrative has underpinned everything. The big difference now is clubs are flush with new cash at a time when RFU budgets are under pressure and no permanent chief executive is in place at Twickenham.It remains fanciful, nevertheless, to imagine a rebel league completely independent of RFU funding, full of players who have opted to turn their backs on representing their country. That would seriously weaken international rugby and fail, in the longer term, to assist the Bath owner, Bruce Craig, and others at the forefront of the new enterprise. “Bruce wants his best international-quality players available to him but he also knows they become better players if they play for their country,” said one insider. “He’s not stupid.”It is equally true the RFU cannot simply stick its head in the sand and wait for its worst nightmare to disappear. Nor can the union say it has not been warned. “When London Welsh went bust they should have got round the table and said: ‘How are we going to stop this ever happening again,’ said another source. “They haven’t done it. It is a massive own goal.”Those of us who believe in rugby remaining open to all also have to acknowledge that, in a professional sport, money talks. If there were enough sugar daddies keen to fund a fully-pro second domestic tier they would have stepped forward by now. It would not surprise me if, eventually, some kind of global conference system materialises with a world club final at its apex. It will be rugby, Jim, but not as we know it. Which, for its new investors, is the whole point of the exercise.Losing a couple of players to the sin-bin might be considered unfortunate being shown a red card and three yellows is beyond careless. And yet still Bath were not finished off by Worcester until the 99th minute at Sixways as the game’s labyrinthine regulations and interminable sanctions regarding close-range scrum offences took their course. Gripping stuff, in a perverse sort of way, but not something anyone wants to see every week. Referees are increasingly being placed in an invidious position and a law change should be the consequence. Any side in receipt of three simultaneous yellow cards should automatically have a penalty try awarded against them.Not a team or a player this week but a dinner. Each year the Rugby Union Writers’ Club hosts its celebrated annual dinner in London as an antidote to dry January and much else besides. There have been some legendary nights down the years and the shortlist for the Pat Marshall Trophy, awarded to the personality of the year, is once again excellent. In alphabetical order it reads: Tadhg Furlong, Siya Kolisi, Stuart Lancaster, Joe Schmidt and Johnny Sexton. The winner will be announced at the dinner next Monday.

Information was scarce then, and accurate maps were extremely hard to come by. So departing expatriates tended to pass on any treasures to new arrivals. As he did so, my benefactor paused. “Be careful,” he said, “You don’t want to get caught with this.”Maps, you see, can be dangerous. I think of this when I meet Martin Greenaway, a cartographer at Stanfords in London. Martin is sitting by a couple of computer screens behind a treasure trove of maps: tables covered in vast colourful countries, wall racks groaning with continents, drawers stuffed with cities and mountain ranges. Stanfords has been making maps since the mid-1850s, and has operated from this purpose-built site on London’s Long Acre since 1901. Now it is moving on – opening new premises in nearby Mercer Walk on 10 January.Martin laughs at my Yemen story. “A customer came in and told us how, in the 1970s, he pulled out a 1:50,000 map on a bus and got into trouble with a Spanish secret policeman sitting next to him. Now we sell those same maps to walkers.”And do many still buy them, I ask. Isn’t the internet killing the paper map?“GPS and Google have certainly eaten into the market,” he says, “But I think paper is going to make a comeback. You just cannot orientate yourself as well with a handheld device.”Part of the reason for this possible comeback is that Stanfords can now print any map you need, centred on the place you choose, at a scale that suits your purpose. Martin takes me through the process. “You know how the hike you want is often at the join between two or more maps? We simply re-centre it and print it for you.”I’m reminded of the OS Explorer maps for the Lake District. Four sheets, all of which manage to fail miserably for anyone doing a walk centred on where they meet, roughly Grasmere Common. Now there’s a solution for someone like myself, a folded paper aficionado.And who buys such maps?“All sorts: a man who was researching an ancient pilgrim footpath in Italy got me to create a whole new map for it a canoeist doing the Yukon River needed something similar. We get homeowners who are in boundary disputes, pilots – and a lot of people who can’t get maps in their own country.”That interests me. Many years ago I bought a map in Stanfords for a journey in Sudan. I knew I wouldn’t find anything like it once I was there. Repressive regimes around the world have always wanted to limit cartographic freedom.Martin nods. “We had one man who wanted a street map of Homs in Syria.”In a time when facts are to be treasured, perhaps paper maps have real significance, recording as they do a version of the truth less susceptible to tampering and fakery.Martin quickly demonstrates the opportunities and limitations of digital mapping by pulling up all the information he has on Yemen’s capital, Sana’a. It’s not a lot. “This is Open Street Map, a website that uses GPS data from contributors’ phones to build maps.”Home in on our own current location and the quality is good: every shop and alleyway in London’s Covent Garden is accurately plotted. Move to North Yorkshire and a footpath I’ve recently walked in the Howardian Hills is totally absent.Not that paper is infallible. The Ramblers is currently running a volunteer project called Don’t Lose Your Way, the purpose of which is to recover lost rights of way that somehow failed to make it on to maps. Its conservative estimate is that England and Wales are currently missing about 10,000 miles of footpaths on what are intended to be the definitive maps. These are held by all local councils and used by organisations including Ordnance Survey.Martin himself clearly delights in the new technology but his love of paper has a practical aspect. “I trained as a pilot when I was a teenager and we still need those paper maps.”He flies a lot in Canada, relishing the remote regions where many lakes remain unnamed, and where if geographical features have a name, they tend towards the bizarre. “My favourite is an escarpment in Alberta called Head Smashed In Buffalo Jump. Mind you, the UK is pretty good: you’ve got places such as Cold Christmas and Unthank.” To which I can add, from personal experience, Wetwang and Slack Bottom.We go through the process of printing a map: I choose an OS Explorer-style production with my own house bang in the middle. Handy for walks straight from the door. Martin bumps up the scale a bit. “It’s amazing how much more you see in a map when the scale is changed from 25,000 to 12,000. There’s no more information – we can’t add that – but you do spot things you’d previously missed.”We move to the formidable printing machine and load up with the paper of my choice, then watch as woods, streets and rivers roll out. Next to us is the map of London’s streets that taxi drivers use when learning The Knowledge.“People still do it?”“Oh yes. We sell a lot of these.”This formidable task is all the more fascinating at a time when the effects of the digital era on humans’ mental map abilities are becoming apparent. A recent study at the University of Montreal found that some video games that relied on non-spatial strategies could reduce growth in the hippocampus, an all-important region for mental mapping. The dangers of digital maps, it seems, could be inside your own head, rather than in the secret policeman sitting next to you.Martin keeps both options. “I always carry a GPS, a paper map and a compass.”I ask if he has a favourite map.“Stanford’s 1871 world map, showing the trade winds.” He fishes out a copy from one of the wall racks and we gaze in wonder at the colours and textures. “It’s a work of art.”It seems that paper maps will always trump digital in one important respect: beauty.

Her music career was an uncomfortable exercise in oversharing. Her acting work isn’t nearly as interesting as the behind the scenes articles written about her acting work. Her social media output is at least partially made up of genuinely troubling videos where she adopts a Middle Eastern accent and forcibly attempts to remove refugee children from their parents.And yet here we are. Lindsay Lohan’s actual reality show, Lindsay Lohan’s Beach Club, starts on MTV this week. It follows the day-to-day machinations of Lohan’s new job running what might honestly be the very worst place on the entire face of God’s green Earth.The story is this: a few years ago, Lindsay Lohan was on holiday in Mykonos with an abusive boyfriend. Lohan’s reaction to one instance of assault was to say, “One day I’ll own this beach”. And now she does, operating the Lohan Beach House cabana and club from the very same stretch of seafront.It is a typically Lohan origin story, one where she yet again manages to snatch a modicum of victory from seemingly undeniable defeat. And yet it is slightly let down by the fact that Lohan Beach House looks legitimately hellish. It is a place that courts the world’s most obnoxious percentile of wealthy, do-nothing trash, and does its best to attend to their whims. You or I would instantly lose the will within a second of arriving there. We would hear the words “bottle service” and start eating sand just to end the misery. And yet people arrive there in their droves, hoping to catch a glimpse of the woman they love from the second worst Herbie film.So if you’re a fan of essentially just watching some people rent sun loungers to idiots, this is the show for you. The bad news is that, if you’re hoping to see what Lindsay Lohan is really like in person, it isn’t. Because Lindsay Lohan is barely in Lindsay Lohan’s Beach Club. People on the show talk about her constantly, and she sometimes pops up in talking head segments, but that’s about the extent of it.Instead, the bulk of the show follows a gang of American “ambassadors” shipped over to Greece, either because they want to be part of the Lohan brand or because their ashamed parents just wanted them out of the country. They are all dreadful, each of them drawling a whale-song gurgle of valley girl vowels where anyone else would use actual words. One of them – I want to say his name is Chad – proudly calls himself a “waitress slayer” because he sleeps with everyone he works with until they quit. And he’s one of the better ones.Lohan recruits these dimwits – hilariously, given her endless “you’ve got to be the best of the best” hard-nosed businesswoman spiel, she does this by flipping a coin – and then essentially passes them off to her business partner Panos. Panos is the brains behind the operation, as evidenced by the scene where he notices that one of the recruits has blue hair, then remembers that the club’s DJ also has blue hair, and then decides that this is probably too much blue hair.The first episode revolves around a guest from Dubai, who is awful but rich. She tries to fondle the waitress slayer, and he lets her because it means that she’ll spend more on booze, and at the end Panos congratulates him for not resisting her advances. All the episodes might be like that. I don’t know. There honestly isn’t enough money in the world to make me watch them.A second season of Lindsay Lohan’s Beach Club seems unlikely. Lohan Beach House suddenly closed in September. The signage has been ripped from the walls and literal tumbleweed now rolls through the place. It might reopen next summer, but rumours abound that the enterprise is now done for good. If that’s the case, then let’s at least console ourselves with the fact that it looked horrible and formed the basis of an awful series.Meanwhile, Lindsay Lohan just tweeted a Parent Trap GIF at the Pope so don’t worry about her. She isn’t going anywhere."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a075f2f19ccb1cd28530ab02fc72f3fbe5ac7352/0_225_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68d1df2243db0e6b580cc14f43213e1b","title":"erdogan us bolton turkey syria withdrawal kurdish","story":"US security chief tempers withdrawal claims, jeopardising Turkey’s plans to target Kurdish groupsTurkey has asked Washington to hand over its bases in Syria as the Trump administration appeared to reverse plans to withdraw from the country’s north-east on Tuesday, jeopardising Ankara’s plans to launch a widespread military operation targeting Kurdish groups.The fresh row between the two Nato allies broke out as the US national security adviser, John Bolton, was in Ankara to row back on a surprise announcement by Donald Trump in December that US forces would leave imminently, abandoning Kurdish proxies who had led its ground war against the Islamic State terror group. Turkey views those same Kurdish groups as mortal foes.In a scathing speech to parliament, delivered while Bolton was still in the Turkish capital, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said the US envoy had “made a serious mistake” and that Turkey would never agree to a compromise that protected the Kurdish militia, known as the YPG, whose members helped a US-led coalition push Isis out of most of Syria’s east.“Elements of the US administration are saying different things,” said Erdoğan. “The YPG and the PKK can never be representatives of the Kurdish people.”Signalling the rift, Erdogan appeared to snub Bolton by not meeting with him, leaving the US National Security Adviser to instead hold talks with his Turkish counterpart, Ibrahim Kalin, and other officials at Ankara’s presidency complex.The Turkish leader said Ankara’s military had finished preparations to enter Syria and that Washington was stalling on a commitment to leave the town of Manbij as a first step.Before arriving in Ankara, Bolton had directly contradicted the US president, claiming Washington would not leave Syria without first receiving guarantees that Turkey would not attack its allies.The added condition came amid a furore over Trump’s claims that Isis had been defeated and his apparent disregard for the fate of Kurdish forces recruited for the cause, whom Ankara had never accepted as legitimate allies. Erdoğan on Tuesday repeated his insistence that no there is no distinction between the YPG in Syria and the PKK in Turkey, with whom Ankara has fought a four-decade civil war.Throughout the Syrian war, and in particular since the US partnered with the Kurds in 2014, Turkey has been deeply wary of Kurdish postwar ambitions, and what they might mean for the 500-mile border it shares with its southern neighbour.An emboldened Kurdish cause has been a nightmare scenario for Turkish officials, whose crackdown on the Kurds inside Syria intensified 11 months ago, when the country’s military invaded an enclave in Syria’s northwest, ousting the YPG from the town of Afrin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/681764af403482ed59f69910f7f1fe9dada7fa29/391_331_3218_1931/master/3218.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86088bc2505a8a177963faa1569d90e1","title":"french author defends remarks about women over 50 yann moix","story":"Yann Moix says he feels no need to apologise for telling interviewer he was ‘incapable’ of loving women in their 50sThe French author and television presenter who claimed he could not love any woman over the age of 50 has said he has no regrets over his remarks that caused widespread outrage.Yann Moix, 50, who is promoting his latest book, Rompre, said his personal preferences in women were his own business and he was only being honest.“I don’t see this as pride, but almost as a curse. It’s not my fault. We are not responsible for our tastes, our penchants, our inclinations. I’m not here to hold forth on this,” he told RTL radio.Moix, a prize-winning novelist, sparked a furious backlash after a question and answer interview was published in the latest edition of Marie-Claire magazine in which he claimed he was “incapable” of loving women in their 50s because they were “too, too old”.In the radio interview, he suggested it was important to face up to certain truths even if they caused offence. “We’re living in a society where it’s hard to be an inidual. We have to always represent the universal citizen … someone who displeases nobody,” he said.He added that while he considered himself a victim of his preferences he did not feel obliged to apologise for “being different”.“Every inidual is a prisoner of their tastes. I’m a prisoner of mine. It takes nothing away from a woman of 50 years that I don’t want to sleep with her,” he said.“I’m not responsible for my tastes I’m trying to be honest. Of course I have a problem, I’m an adolescent, I’m a child and I don’t interest women in their 50s either. They’ve got better things to do than to drag a neurotic around who spends his time yelling and reading and likes doing things that only excite children. It’s not easy to be with me,” he said.Asked whether he thought his comments would affect sales of his book, Moix said: “The system is so perverse that sales are about to rise like an arrow.“I don’t regret saying these things because they concern only me. I love who I want and I don’t have to answer to any good taste police … for me that would be a complete lack of taste.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb1362a73daa1cd2ebfae3032bb40b3ce20d2c0b/0_23_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f14a06aaa76893672f30e0220e8c04d0","title":"what does 2019 hold for kim jong un and north korea podcast","story":"Kim Jong-un goes into 2019 with momentum to build on after last year’s historic meeting with President Donald Trump.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsThe Irish Government would not object to a request from the British government to delay Brexit should they seek an extension to avoid a damaging no-deal scenario, Tánaiste Simon Coveney has said.Speaking alongside German foreign minister Heiko Maas in Dublin, Mr Coveney told a press conference that a request from the UK seeking an extension of the Article 50 withdrawal from the EU on March 29th would need to be considered an EU level but that the Government would not resist such a request.UK media reports on Tuesday claimed British officials were exploring the possibility of extending the withdrawal date as the prospect of a no-deal Brexit looms given the political isions at Westminster to the proposed withdrawal agreement finalised in negotiations by the EU and the UK.“From an Irish perspective, if such an ask happens and is justified, we won’t be standing in the way of that but that is really a matter for the British government to make decisions on,” Mr Coveney said.The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs stressed, however, that British prime minister Theresa May had made it clear that the UK would be leaving the EU as planned on March 29th.“That is why all the focus now needs to be on the deal and providing the clarifications and reassurance around the detail of that deal,” said Mr Coveney.Stephen Barclay, the British Brexit secretary, discounted the possibility that the UK government might delay an exit beyond March 29th.He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme this morning that the government’s policy was still to leave on March 29th. UK digital minister Margot James said on Monday that Britain might have to extend article 50 if Ms May lost next week’s parliamentary vote on the Brexit deal.German foreign minister Heiko Maas told reporters in Dublin after speaking at a conference alongside Mr Coveney that he did not really want to think about “the possibility of extending article 50 here and now” should Westminster reject the draft Brexit treaty in a vote next week because it would “devalue” efforts to debate and ratify the withdrawal agreement in the UK parliament.“I don’t think that this is what we ought to focus on today. Those who do so and who hope that is going to happen in order to have a better position for further negotiations run a great risk,” he said at Dublin Castle.“Should Theresa May not get the majority for her proposal next week, it will be a very difficult situation indeed.”The German minister said that a no-deal Brexit “would trigger disadvantages” for Germany and the EU and there would be economic disadvantages for Germany and other countries.“It might have a negative effect on jobs in Germany and that is something that we intend to prevent at any possible cost,” he said.Mr Maas also urged British politicians “to act responsibly” and unite behind the draft Brexit agreement to avoid a damaging no-deal scenario.He said less than three months before the UK’s exit from the EU, the final outcome was “up in the air” and a no-deal scenario was “still an option, despite the serious damage that this would cause on both sides.”“There is too much at stake to take this lightly. We urge our British friends to act responsibly and unite behind the agreement that we have spent so much time and effort negotiation,” Mr Maas told an annual gathering of Irish ambassadors at Dublin Castle.The German minister, a guest speaker at the Global Ireland 2025 conference, said EU member states were unified in “full solidarity with Ireland” behind the backstop guarantee in the draft Brexit agreement to avoid the return of a hard Irish border, pointing to the strength of standing together.“We insisted and still do that a hard border iding the Irish island is unacceptable. Some people called us stubborn,” Mr Maas told the conference.“But the truth is avoiding a hard border in Ireland is a fundamental concern. It is a matter of principle, a question of identity for the European Union. A union that, more than anything else, serves one purpose: to build and maintain peace in Europe. ”Mr Maas said Germans “understand how walls and borders can threaten peace.”“We believe in the peace-making power of European unity, a belief we share with you, the Irish. Your Good Friday Agreement is living proof of this principle,” he said.Speaking to the conference before introducing Mr Maas, Mr Coveney said “the time for wishful thinking” about Brexit was over. He urged UK politicians to “cast aside unrealistic options based on promises that simply cannot be delivered.”The Tánaiste encouraged British politicians to support the proposed Brexit agreement that has ided the UK parliament saying that there was no alternative “waiting to be dusted off somewhere.”“These are fateful days and weeks in British politics,” Mr Coveney, the lead Government Minister on Brexit, told the conference.The European Council was “ready to provide assurances” about the contentious backstop within the agreement that guarantees no hard border on the island of Ireland, he said.The proposed Brexit agreement the table was “very best available” and achieved both vital goals of protecting the UK’s economy and the peace process in Northern Ireland.He said the EU could not reopen the withdrawal agreement text, which is “the product of multiple compromises and highly detailed negotiations in across a wide range of areas over a two year period.”“Believe me, the compromises were hard won on both sides,” he said, sharing a stage with Mr Maas.As the prospect of a no-deal Brexit increases, Mr Coveney pressed British politicians to accept the deal.“It is also wishful thinking to ignore the default outcome if nothing else is agreed - that default is a crash-out. Surely now is the time in Westminster for everyone, in government and in opposition, to cast aside unrealistic options based on promises that simply cannot be delivered,” he said.“If that doesn’t happen quickly, in the absence of that realism, it is the hardliners who think no price is too high to pay for their version of Brexit who will win out to everybody else’s cost, most notably Ireland’s cost.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

I think it’s those kind of assurances we are happy to give.”MPs will resume their debate on the Brexit deal on Wednesday and Mrs May said on Monday that she would set out in the coming days what assurances her government could give domestically on the backstop as well as those from the EU.“So we will be setting out measures which will be specific to Northern Ireland, we will be setting out proposals for a greater role for parliament as we move into the next stage of the negotiation and we are continuing to work on further assurances on further undertakings from the European Union in relation to the concern that has been expressed by parliamentarians,” she said.More than 100 Conservative MPs have indicated that they will join the opposition in voting against the deal and the DUP’s 10 MPs have insisted that there must be legally binding changes to the nature of the backstop.British negotiators have pressed in recent days for the EU to promise to negotiate a post-Brexit trade deal by 2021, a demand that is unacceptable to the remaining 27 member states.Downing Street said on Monday that the vote on the Brexit deal would go ahead next week, despite the expectation at Westminster that it will be defeated.In a speech to Ireland’s ambassadors on Tuesday, Tánaiste Simon Coveney will warn that the time for “wishful thinking” is over if Britain is to avoid crashing out of the EU without a deal.“Surely now is the time in Westminster for everyone, in government and in opposition, to cast aside unrealistic options based on promises that simply cannot be delivered,” he is expected to say.“If that doesn’t happen quickly, in the absence of that realism, it is the hardliners who think no price is too high to pay for their version of Brexit who will win out to everyone’s cost, including Ireland’s.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

File photograph: Olivier Douliery-PoolGetty Images.The annual St Patrick’s Day parade in Washington DC has been cancelled due to a “precarious financial position” partly created by heightened security requirements connected to such large public events. In a statement on its website, the St Patrick’s Parade committee of Washington, DC said it was “distraught to announce that the 2019 St Patrick’s parade is cancelled”.“After the 2016 tragedy in Nice, France, the government of the District of Columbia has significantly increased preventative security requirements for public gatherings such as the St Patrick’s parade. The corresponding rapid increase in overhead, in combination with relatively stagnant funding, have put the committee in a precarious financial position,” it said.Some 84 people were killed and 300 injured in Nice on July 14th 2016 when a man drove a truck into a crowd on the Promenade des Anglais.The Washington committee said certain expenses for the parade were offset by a grant from the government of the District of Columbia.“We have relied on this grant support for many years, but as costs have increased, recently the grant has not had the same effect in reducing our financial burden. This reality and the committee’s steadfast commitment to holding the St Patrick’s Parade of Washington, DC in 2020, its 50th year, have led us to the very difficult but necessary decision to cancel the 2019 St Patrick’s parade,” it added. The committee said it was an “all-volunteer non-profit organisation” that existed solely for the purpose of raising funds for and producing the parade in the US capital.“Members of the committee proudly carry the torch of the original committee members who conceived of such a parade at a local watering hole in the late 1960s and produced the first-ever St Patrick’s parade in Washington in 1971.”The committee said each parade was planned well in advance and included multiple meetings with neighbourhood advisors, the National Park Service, and the mayor’s special events task force, among others.“The greatest overhead in producing an event of this magnitude is the government-related expense of security and street closures,” it said. Fundraising events for the 2020 parade will not be impacted by the decision, the committee added. It said it had been in contact with its counterparts at the Baltimore and Annapolis St Patrick’s Day parades and encouraged people to consider attending, entering, or otherwise participating in those on March 10th.The first St Patrick’s Day Parade in Washington DC was held in 1971 and travelled along Massachusetts Avenue from Dupont Circle to the statue of Robert Emmet.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

Her family have not commented on the allegations, although her father is believed to have now arrived in Thailand.Ms al-Qunun managed to avoid being deported on a flight to Kuwait in a seemingly coordinated effort by the Thai and Saudi authorities after her cries for help sparked a global media frenzy and frantic efforts from human rights workers and diplomats to assist her.Late on Monday she was taken into the protection of the United Nations office for refugees (UNHCR) to process her asylum request.Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun walks by Chief of Immigration Police Surachate Hakparn in an image released by the immigration bureau“We are very grateful that the Thai authorities did not send back Ms. Al-qunun against her will and are extending protection for her,” said Giuseppe de Vicentiis, the UNHCR’s representative in Thailand, in a statement on Tuesday.  “It could take several days to process the case and determine next steps”, he added. “For reasons of protection and confidentiality we are not in a position to comment on the details of inidual cases.Ms al-Qunun had been in possession of a valid tourist visa for Australia when she was detained at the aiport, as she had been planning to seek asylum there.After fears were raised by her supporters that the visa had been cancelled, the Australian government responded that it was “pleased” that the UNHCR was now handling her case.“The government has made representations to the Thai government and the Bangkok office of the UNHCR about its serious concerns on this matter and the need for Ms al-Qunun’s claim to be assessed expeditiously,” a Department of Home Affairs official told The .“Any application by Ms al-Qunun for a humanitarian visa will be carefully considered once the UNHCR process has concluded,” the official added.The teenager was being held in a secure location in Bangkok on Tuesday. It is not known if she met with her father Mohammed al-Qunun, a Saudi government official from Ha’il province, whose arrival, she told her growing Twitter following, “worried and scared me a lot.”After a day of high drama on social media on Monday, where she used livestreaming videos to transmit her increasingly panicked requests to meet the UN and for help from Western governments, her account remained relatively quiet as she processed her asylum paperwork.However, Ms al-Qunun and her friends increasingly urged Canada to open its doors to her. “I want Canada to give me asylum!” she tweeted.Stefano Maron, a spokesperson for Canada\u0027s foreign office, said: Canada is very concerned by and watching closely the situation of Ms. Rahaf al-Qunun. We are in close contact with partners about her situation. Canada will always stand up for human rights, very much including women’s rights.Canadian diplomats have been praised by human rights workers for their commitment to her case behind-the-scenes.Phil Robertson, deputy director at Human Rights Watch in Asia, who was closely involved in the case as it unfolded, lauded the Canadian embassy for being “steadfast \u0026amp superb at every step of the way” to help save Rahaf.Germany also spoke out in support of the young woman. Georg Schmidt, the German ambassador to Thailand, had been one of the first foreign officials to publicly express “grave concern” over her situation.The UK’s foreign and commonwealth office has remained silent on the matter. In one of many apparently desperate tweets as she tried to stave off repatriation, Ms al-Qunun had appealed directly to Jeremy Hunt, the Foreign Secretary, to help organise an emergency UK travel document. Ms al-Qunun’s relentless use of social media to highlight her plight sparked a turnaround by the Thai authorities, who had initially claimed she had been running away from her family to avoid marriage and appeared at first to be reluctant to allow the UN access to her.By Monday evening, the Thai authorities had instead assured her safety. If deporting her would result in her death, we definitely wouldn’t want to do that,” said Surachate Hakparn, Thailand’s immigration chief.The outcome was hailed as a “good day for the cause of human rights around the world,” by Human Rights Watch, which said in a statement that “Rahaf’s tremendous courage and resilience” had been “met with a global surge of sympathy for her” to persuade Thailand to do the right thing.Please review our commenting policyKeep out of yellow vest revolt, France warns Italy, after populist ministers offer support to movementBrexit live: Michael Gove compares Tory rebels to \u0026#39mid-50s swingers waiting for Scarlett JohanssonChinese New Year celebrations could further spread deadly African swine fever outbreak Brexit analysis: Why an extension of Article 50 now looks inevitableWhat is the Brexit backstop, and why has it delayed the vote in Parliament?Comment: We must not tolerate the protesters intimidating MPs on both sides of the Brexit debateComment: This is why a real Brexit will be a win for Leavers and Remainers alikeMan dressed up as Theresa May prances around stage on Russian TVAlternative for Germany politician severely beaten in suspected politically motivated attackTurkey\u0026#39s Erdogan warns US of \u0026#39big mistake\u0026#39 in making conditions for Syria withdrawalPaul Gascoigne pleads not guilty to sexual assault over allegation he kissed woman on a trainWhat is the Finance Bill and what does its amendment mean for Brexit? Twenty-year-old suspect arrested in Germany data leak acted \u0026#39out of anger\u0026#39Panama sees rise in deadly hantavirusAlex Salmond wins legal case against Scottish Government over its handling of harassment complaintsYouth football coach accused of abusing young boys dies day before trial after driving car into a tree One dead as crew abandon oil and chemical tanker on fire off Hong KongMan arrested after attacking Beijing primary school pupils with hammerBrexit: The Uncivil War - who is Robert Mercer, what is AggregateIQ, and did they swing the referendum?We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"man dressed theresa may prances around stage russian tv","story":"Theresa May’s dancing has been mocked on Russian television once again.A man dressed as Mrs May prances around a stage while ballet dancer Nikolai Tsiskaridze expertly twirls on the spot.The dancing pair also sing to one another in English accents.

The prime minister’s deal was “far from perfect” but had been supported by London First as the only option for businesses desperate to avoid crashing out of the EU on 29 March.£800bn of assets moves from London to EU financial hubs before BrexitThe Independent, along with the People’s Vote campaign, has backed a Final Say referendum on the Brexit deal.London First chief executive Jasmine Whitbread said the country is now “teetering on a cliff-edge”.“Time has run out and continuing to head towards a no deal is irresponsible, irrational and risks further damage to jobs and growth,” Ms Whitbread said.“If we don’t have a deal next week, it’s time to stop the clock and revoke Article 50, so the Government can stop spending billions on last-ditch efforts to manage a no deal and instead come up with a plan that works.“If such a plan cannot be found, the decision must go back to the people. Continued uncertainty is never welcome, but it will be vastly less damaging than crashing out of the EU.”Research commissioned by London First suggests that just 41 per cent\u0026nbspof businesses feel they’ve been able to plan effectively for Brexit.The group argues that falling back on World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules would mean huge practical and logistical problems for UK companies.The latest bad news for the government’s Brexit plans came as preparations for no deal descended into farce this week as dozens of lorries occupied a disused airfield in Kent in a “live test” of how ministers plan to ease congestion on roads to Channel ports.The Department for Transport (DfT) confirmed that just 89 drivers, each paid £550 to take part in the test, showed up out of an expected 150.Former Conservative chairman\u0026nbspLord Patten said the exrecise\u0026nbspwas “enough to make one weep”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Co-op grew its sales by 3.4 per cent, making it the only chain to expand faster than in 2017.Savvy shoppers increasingly chased the best deals, taking advantage of voucher codes and visiting a range of supermarkets to lower their food spend at Christmas, research from Nielsen found.Sales growth overall more than halved from to 1.8 per cent in the last four weeks of 2018, from 3.7 per cent a year earlier. Online sales were up 9 per cent and now account for 7.5 per cent of the nation’s spend on groceries.Mike Watkins, Nielsen’s UK head of retailer insight, said shoppers are now favouring multiple trips over one big shop, spreading the cost across multiple retailers.“Moreover, with over half of consumers not confident about their finances, shoppers are more budget-conscious and the various promotions and price cuts are a response to help them manage their household budget.”Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said lower inflation had reduced total grocery spend.“This slower inflation rate helped shoppers to manage their festive budgets, with 60 per cent\u0026nbspof customers looking to make savvier decisions to make their money go further over the holidays.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Credit card debt was at £72.5bn, or £2,688 per household.“The government is skating on thin ice by relying on household debt to drive growth,” Ms O’Grady said. “A strong economy needs people spending wages, not credit cards and loans.Credit card debt hits £72.5bn despite fears for UK economy’s future“Our economy is not working for workers. They need stronger rights and bargaining powers. Trade unions should be allowed the freedom to enter every workplace to negotiate higher wages.”Amit Kara, head of UK macroeconomic forecasting at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research,\u0026nbspsaid student loan debt is a “different animal” from credit card debt, for example, because borrowers don’t pay money back unless they are earning over £21,000.\u0026nbsp“This prevents the most extreme outcomes,” he said.“In aggregate, consumer debt as a whole is below the level it was in 2008, although that is hardly a comfort and means there is still vulnerability.”Mr Kara also pointed to concerns around the\u0026nbsplow level of saving by households. “If there is some kind of trigger or\u0026nbspflare-up – most obviously a rise in interest rates or unemployment – that could have a negative effect on the economy.”A sharp rise in interest rates could have a “material impact” on economic growth which, at 1.4 per cent, is already comparatively low, Mr Kara said.On the positive side, he said\u0026nbspthe Bank of England’s stress tests demonstrate that lenders are in a better financial position than they were before the financial crisis, with more capital to act as a buffer in the event of a shock.However, the central bank has much less room to manoeuvre than it did in 2008. Faced with a\u0026nbspdownturn the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) would typically lower interest rates, making debt cheaper and fuelling a recovery. But rates are already close to all-time lows.On the other hand, if inflation were to rise the bank would typically raise interest rates to cool demand and rein in price increases.Perhaps the most likely trigger for rising inflation in the near future is a potential fall in the value of the pound in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspWhile governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney has warned that rate rises could occur if the UK crashes out of the EU, the MPC would likely be reluctant to raise its benchmark too far or too fast for fear of damaging an already fragile economy at a time of upheaval.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Officials at the American Embassy and China\u0027s Ministry of Commerce provided no details on the meeting.\u0026nbspBoth sides have expressed optimism over the potential for progress in settling their tariff fight over Beijing\u0027s technology ambitions.

He said the warship, which he said was the destroyer the USS McCampbell, had violated Chinese and international law, infringed on Chinese sovereignty and undermined peace and stability.\u0026nbspWhy Trump’s trade war with China is a danger to world prosperity“As for whether this move has any impact to the ongoing China-US\u0026nbsptrade consultations... to properly resolve existing issues of all kinds between China and the US\u0026nbspis good for the two countries and the world,” Mr Lu said\u0026nbspHe added, “The two sides both have responsibility to create necessary and good atmosphere to this end.”\u0026nbspThere was no immediate comment from the US\u0026nbspside about the Chinese complaint.\u0026nbspThe American side in the trade talks was being led by a deputy US\u0026nbsptrade representative, Jeffrey Gerrish, according to the US\u0026nbspgovernment. The delegation includes agriculture, energy, commerce, treasury and State Department officials.\u0026nbspThe Chinese government gave no details of who would represent Beijing.\u0026nbspThe talks went ahead despite tensions over the arrest of a Chinese tech executive in Canada on US\u0026nbspcharges related to possible violations of trade sanctions against Iran.\u0026nbspECB warns of trade war threat to eurozoneUS and China agree to pause trade war, after G20 dinner Trump and Xi to sit down for dinner as US-China trade war ragesTrump and China\u0027s Xi Jinping agree to \u0027strengthen economic exchanges\u0027Millions of jobs at risk from continued global trade war, WTO warnsMr Trump imposed tariff increases of up to 25 per cent on $250bn of Chinese imports over complaints Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology. Beijing responded by imposing penalties on $110bn of American goods, slowing customs clearance for US\u0026nbspcompanies and suspending issuing licenses in finance and other businesses.\u0026nbspWashington, Europe and other trading partners complain Beijing\u0027s tactics violate its market-opening obligations.\u0026nbspThe standoff also reflects American anxiety about China\u0027s rise as a potential competitor in telecommunications and other technology. Mr Trump wants Beijing to roll back initiatives like “Made in China 2025,” which calls for the state-led creation of global competitors in such fields as robotics and artificial intelligence. American officials worry those might erode US\u0026nbspindustrial leadership.\u0026nbspThe ruling Communist Party is reluctant to give up initiatives it sees as a path to prosperity and global influence.\u0026nbspChina\u0027s leaders have tried to defuse complaints by emphasising its potential as an export market and by promising to increase foreign access to their auto, finance and other industries as well as the technology initiatives.\u0026nbspEconomists say the 90-day postponement of additional tariff increases that had been meant to take effect 1 January\u0026nbspmay be too short to settle the disputes bedevilling US-Chinese relations.\u0026nbspBeijing\u0027s goal may be to show enough progress to persuade Trump to extend his deadline, they say.\u0026nbspCooling economic growth in both countries is turning up the pressure to reach a settlement.\u0026nbspChinese growth fell to a post-global crisis low of 6.5 per cent in the quarter ending in September. Auto sales tumbled 16 percent in November over a year earlier. Weak real estate sales are forcing developers to cut prices.\u0026nbspThe US\u0026nbspeconomy grew at an annual rate of 3.4 per cent in the third quarter, and unemployment is at a five-decade low. But surveys show consumer confidence is weakening because of concern that growth will slow this year.Beijing has tried in vain to recruit France, Germany, South Korea and other governments as allies against Trump. They criticise his tactics but echo US\u0026nbspcomplaints about Chinese industrial policy and market barriers.\u0026nbspThe European Union filed its own challenge in the World Trade Organisation in June against Chinese rules that the 28-nation trade bloc said hamper the ability of foreign companies to protect and profit from their own technology.\u0026nbspFor their part, Chinese officials are unhappy with US\u0026nbspcurbs on exports of “dual use” technology with possible military applications. They complain China\u0027s companies are treated unfairly in national security reviews of proposed corporate acquisitions, though almost all deals are approved unchanged.\u0026nbspSome manufacturers that serve the United States have shifted production to other countries to avoid Trump\u0027s tariffs.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The firm claims owners won\u0027t notice the TV on the wall, as it merges with the room\u0027s decor.LG has gone one-step further with its design, making the television screen disappear from view completely at the touch of a button.\u0026nbspLG\u0027s rollable OLED TV is a true game-changer, freeing users from the limitations of the wall and allowing them to curate their own personal space, the firm said.The TV will be available in the US before the end of the year, though LG is yet to set a price or release date.Industry experts said they expect the technology to appeal to consumers, given the right price point.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

The three are arranged in a strange line-up: the lenses are in a triangle, and the flash is laying off to the side.As well as the unusual arrangement of the lenses, even the large bump is likely to prove controversial among Apple users who have complained about the fact that modern iPhones\u0026nbsphave small hills sticking out of their back.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe use of three lenses has long been rumoured as a potential future product for the iPhone, but it is unlikely that anyone expected them to be arranged in this way.

The prime minister’s deal was “far from perfect” but had been supported by London First as the only option for businesses desperate to avoid crashing out of the EU on 29 March.£800bn of assets moves from London to EU financial hubs before BrexitThe Independent, along with the People’s Vote campaign, has backed a Final Say referendum on the Brexit deal.London First chief executive Jasmine Whitbread said the country is now “teetering on a cliff-edge”.“Time has run out and continuing to head towards a no deal is irresponsible, irrational and risks further damage to jobs and growth,” Ms Whitbread said.“If we don’t have a deal next week, it’s time to stop the clock and revoke Article 50, so the Government can stop spending billions on last-ditch efforts to manage a no deal and instead come up with a plan that works.“If such a plan cannot be found, the decision must go back to the people. Continued uncertainty is never welcome, but it will be vastly less damaging than crashing out of the EU.”Research commissioned by London First suggests that just 41 per cent\u0026nbspof businesses feel they’ve been able to plan effectively for Brexit.The group argues that falling back on World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules would mean huge practical and logistical problems for UK companies.The latest bad news for the government’s Brexit plans came as preparations for no deal descended into farce this week as dozens of lorries occupied a disused airfield in Kent in a “live test” of how ministers plan to ease congestion on roads to Channel ports.The Department for Transport (DfT) confirmed that just 89 drivers, each paid £550 to take part in the test, showed up out of an expected 150.Former Conservative chairman\u0026nbspLord Patten said the exrecise\u0026nbspwas “enough to make one weep”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

If Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal cannot pass parliament, the default will be that the UK leaves without a deal, which is expected to cause a major economic crisis.The European Court of Justice has however ruled that the UK can unilaterally revoke Article 50 if it wants, effectively cancelling Brexit.\u0026nbspAn extension, which is separate from revocation,\u0026nbsprequires the unanimous approval of the other 27 EU countries.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

We should then go back to the EU with a discussion about a customs union.”Mr Corbyn also urged Labour supporters demanding he stop Brexit to “recognise a number of things”, saying: “About 60 per cent of Labour voters voted remain, about 40 per cent voted leave. We have to recognise why people voted in those directions.Conservative and Labour MPs join forces to stop no-deal Brexit“Labour is unique as a party, because it’s got to bring all sides together – hence my view on a customs union, on access to the market.”However, some estimates have put Labour voters’ backing remain at more than 60 per cent – while one recent poll found their support for a further referendum to be 80 per cent.The interview triggered a backlash from some Labour MPs, Chris Leslie, the Nottingham East MP, tweeting: “If Jeremy Corbyn facilitates Brexit he’ll share responsibility for the job losses, trade barriers and decade of austerity to come.Angela Smith, the Penistone and Stocksbridge MP, said: “We need to get the message over to Jeremy Corbyn that Labour members and supporters want a People’s Vote.”Created with Sketch.Newspapers react to Theresa May pulling the vote on her Brexit deal Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.And Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: “There you have it, Jeremy Corbyn refuses once again to take the blinkers off. He is ignoring the concerns of his own supporters and the economic damage experts warn Brexit will do to the UK economy.”In reality, the chances of a snap election in the new year are slim, with Theresa May having ruled it out – and many Tories opposed to her deal happy to run down the clock to a no-deal Brexit.Instead, Mr Corbyn is under pressure to swing behind a fresh referendum if – as seems certain – the prime minister loses the “meaningful vote”, in the second week of January and his vote of no confidence in her government fails.Some Labour insiders believe Labour backing for a referendum is all-but certain in those circumstances, given the party\u0027s inability to set out what the other “options on the table” it could pursue might be.Expats set to lose healthcare under no-deal Brexit, NHS toldThink homelessness is bad now?

The EU says that for a country to participate in the single market, and reap economic rewards from having goods and services flow freely across borders, it must accept the free movement of people.So if we want to control immigration to a significant degree, to the extent that we set\u0026nbspour\u0026nbspown policy in full, it does mean leaving the single market.And\u0026nbspif we want to maintain an open border\u0026nbspbetween\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland and the Republic, the EU have consistently argued that Northern Ireland at least must remain part of the customs union – otherwise goods that have not been subjected to the common tariff could make their way into EU territory across the Irish border.These are just two issues emanating from the single market and customs union questions, but there are many more. To pick one – the closer a country is to both affects what kind of trade deals, if any, it can make with the rest of the world. \u0026nbspIt is for all these reasons that both of the major British political parties have opted for middle-of-the-road Brexit policies, that seek to compromise between keeping as much of the economic benefit of these two systems as possible, whilst also seeking to satisfy the 2016 referendum result, by doing away with parts of them that have fed displeasure over EU membership.Both Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have said they will leave the single market and customs union, allowing them to end immigration that is governed by the EU’s free movement principle, which so riled many of their voters.Corbyn calls for public ownership of railways amid train fare hikeBut whereas Jeremy Corbyn has backed a new customs union with the EU, Ms May has said she wants the UK to have no part in a customs union with Europe, which would allow greater leeway to sign trade deals with other countries.Mr Corbyn has said he wants a deal that delivers the “exact same benefits” of the single market, albeit with greater leeway for the British government to intervene in domestic industry, something restricted by the EU’s state aid rules.Ms May meanwhile has said that after the transition period, she wants a trade deal with the EU that would leave the UK outside of the single market, but with as frictionless trade\u0026nbspas possible. In the meantime, Britain would effectively adhere to customs union rules and single market rules during a transition which could last to December 2020 and beyond.Whatever the outcome, the state of the UK economy, the lot of the British people and the government’s freedom to act after Brexit is likely to be directly related to the country’s links to these two critical supranational structures.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

Co-op grew its sales by 3.4 per cent, making it the only chain to expand faster than in 2017.Savvy shoppers increasingly chased the best deals, taking advantage of voucher codes and visiting a range of supermarkets to lower their food spend at Christmas, research from Nielsen found.Sales growth overall more than halved from to 1.8 per cent in the last four weeks of 2018, from 3.7 per cent a year earlier. Online sales were up 9 per cent and now account for 7.5 per cent of the nation’s spend on groceries.Mike Watkins, Nielsen’s UK head of retailer insight, said shoppers are now favouring multiple trips over one big shop, spreading the cost across multiple retailers.“Moreover, with over half of consumers not confident about their finances, shoppers are more budget-conscious and the various promotions and price cuts are a response to help them manage their household budget.”Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said lower inflation had reduced total grocery spend.“This slower inflation rate helped shoppers to manage their festive budgets, with 60 per cent\u0026nbspof customers looking to make savvier decisions to make their money go further over the holidays.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Credit card debt was at £72.5bn, or £2,688 per household.“The government is skating on thin ice by relying on household debt to drive growth,” Ms O’Grady said. “A strong economy needs people spending wages, not credit cards and loans.Credit card debt hits £72.5bn despite fears for UK economy’s future“Our economy is not working for workers. They need stronger rights and bargaining powers. Trade unions should be allowed the freedom to enter every workplace to negotiate higher wages.”Amit Kara, head of UK macroeconomic forecasting at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research,\u0026nbspsaid student loan debt is a “different animal” from credit card debt, for example, because borrowers don’t pay money back unless they are earning over £21,000.\u0026nbsp“This prevents the most extreme outcomes,” he said.“In aggregate, consumer debt as a whole is below the level it was in 2008, although that is hardly a comfort and means there is still vulnerability.”Mr Kara also pointed to concerns around the\u0026nbsplow level of saving by households. “If there is some kind of trigger or\u0026nbspflare-up – most obviously a rise in interest rates or unemployment – that could have a negative effect on the economy.”A sharp rise in interest rates could have a “material impact” on economic growth which, at 1.4 per cent, is already comparatively low, Mr Kara said.On the positive side, he said\u0026nbspthe Bank of England’s stress tests demonstrate that lenders are in a better financial position than they were before the financial crisis, with more capital to act as a buffer in the event of a shock.However, the central bank has much less room to manoeuvre than it did in 2008. Faced with a\u0026nbspdownturn the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) would typically lower interest rates, making debt cheaper and fuelling a recovery. But rates are already close to all-time lows.On the other hand, if inflation were to rise the bank would typically raise interest rates to cool demand and rein in price increases.Perhaps the most likely trigger for rising inflation in the near future is a potential fall in the value of the pound in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspWhile governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney has warned that rate rises could occur if the UK crashes out of the EU, the MPC would likely be reluctant to raise its benchmark too far or too fast for fear of damaging an already fragile economy at a time of upheaval.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The argument is aimed at liberal critics of her record who argue she was sometimes too quick to side with the police and too slow to adopt sentencing reforms.I know that most police officers deserve to be proud of their public service and commended for the way they do their jobs, Ms Harris writes in The Truths We Hold. I know how difficult and dangerous the job is, day in and day out, and I know how hard it is for the officers\u0027 families, who have to wonder if the person they love will be coming home at the end of each shift.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut, she continues, I also know this: it is a false choice to suggest you must either be for the police or for police accountability. I am for both. Most people I know are for both. Let\u0027s speak some truth about that, too.After high-profile fatal shootings involving police officers and unarmed people of colour, the criminal justice system\u0027s treatment of minorities is a top issue among Democratic voters. The passage suggests Ms Harris is aware her seven years as the district attorney in San Francisco, followed by six years as California\u0027s attorney general, is something she will have to explain and signals how she may frame her law enforcement career if she decides to run for the White House.Elizabeth Warren kicks off 2020 bid by attacking corruptionIt\u0027s a presidential campaign, and every aspect of a candidate\u0027s record is going to be scrutinised and they\u0027re going to have to answer for it, said Mo Elleithee, a long-time Democratic operative who leads Georgetown University\u0027s Institute of Politics and Public Service. She knows that this is something that\u0027s heading her way and a good candidate is one who doesn\u0027t wait for it to hit them. A good candidate is someone who addresses it proactively, and she appears to be doing that.\u0026nbspBeyond the book, Ms Harris recently supported legislation that passed the Senate late last year and overhauls the criminal justice system, especially when it comes to sentencing rules.\u0026nbspIn the book, Ms Harris recounts an instance when she was an intern at the Alameda County district attorney\u0027s office and an innocent bystander was one of many people arrested during a drug raid. Ms Harris said she begged and pleaded on a late Friday afternoon for a judge to hear the case so the woman could avoid spending the weekend in jail.\u0026nbspKate Chatfield, the policy director of the California-based criminal justice reform group Re:store Justice, said Ms Harris did do some good when she was in law enforcement but it was incumbent on the public to hold her accountable for the ways in which she either didn\u0027t do enough or actually did some harm.\u0026nbspWhen the conversation shifts, one should be expected to be questioned about those choices, Ms Chatfield said, noting among other issues Ms Harris\u0027s advocacy for tougher truancy laws.By addressing policing in the book, Ms Harris is taking on an issue that confronted Democrats and some Republicans in 2016. Democrat Hillary Clinton was criticised for her husband\u0027s role in passing the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which created stricter penalties for drug offenders and funnelled billions of dollars towards more police and new prisons.The issue is likely to be the subject of fierce debate in 2020 as well and could expose isions among the wide field of candidates –\u0026nbsppresenting hurdles for some and opportunity for others.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Who could be running against Trump in 2020?

New Jersey Senator Cory Booker was central to the passage of the Senate\u0027s criminal justice overhaul package and is certain to tout it if he decides to launch a presidential campaign. Meanwhile, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, who is also considering a 2020 bid, often refers to her own prosecutorial past.\u0026nbspThe memoir – and the publicity surrounding it – will shift the 2020 campaign spotlight to Ms Harris this week after much of the focus has been on her Senate colleague, Elizabeth Warren. Last week, the Massachusetts Democrat became the most prominent person yet to take steps towards a presidential run by launching an exploratory committee. Her weekend trip to the lead-off caucus state of Iowa also generated largely flattering headlines.\u0026nbspSome criminal justice advocates said they were happy the issue would get more attention in 2020.\u0026nbspWhen we had the 2016 elections, it was at the height of Ferguson and Baltimore, and we still didn\u0027t have serious engagement with criminal justice reform, said Phillip Goff, the director of the Centre for Policing Equity, referring to the protests that followed the deaths of black men by police officers in Missouri and Maryland. My hope is that we require candidates to demonstrate that they know more than the catchphrases of the activists in their bases.\u0026nbspKamala Harris \u0027didn’t know\u0027 aide was accused of sexual harassmentPolice evacuate office of Kamala Harris and San Diego Union-TribuneJoe Biden has a strategy for the presidential runElizabeth Warren struggles with black voters ahead of 2020Beto O’Rourke meets with Barack Obama as he considers White House bidSurveys underscore the potency of criminal justice issues among Democrats. A February 2018 poll conducted by the Associated Press-NORC Centre for Public Affairs Research found majorities of Democrats – but far fewer Republicans – think there has been little progress for African-Americans on criminal justice or policing issues over the past 50 years. The poll showed 45 per cent of Americans, including 62 per cent of Democrats and 19 per cent of Republicans, thought there had been little to no progress on fair treatment for black Americans by the criminal justice system. Similarly, 46 per cent of Americans, including 63 per cent of Democrats and 23 per cent of Republicans, said there has been little to no progress for African-Americans on fair treatment by police.While it is not yet clear how Ms Harris\u0027 prosecutorial background could affect her primary bid, it could help her if she faces President Donald Trump in the 2020 general election.He ran as the law-and-order president, Mr Elleithee said of Mr Trump. Being able to go toe-to-toe with him on law and order in a smarter way, I think, is going to be important. Should she win the nomination and does it by navigating this topic well, then I think she would be a strong voice and a force to be reckoned with when it comes to issues of law and order, criminal justice and civil rights as they collide in a general election.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Much more can and must be done to protect and assist children.”Children living in countries at war have come under direct attack, have been used as human shields, killed, maimed or recruited to fight. Rape, forced marriage and abduction have become standard tactics in conflicts from Syria to Yemen, and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to Nigeria, South Sudan and Myanmar.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialOver the course of 2018:- In Afghanistan, violence and bloodshed remain a daily occurrence, with some 5,000 children killed or maimed within the first three-quarters of 2018, equal to all of 2017, and children making up 89 per cent of civilian casualties from explosive remnants of war.Unicef photographer captures men bonding with their newborns- Cameroon has seen an escalation of the conflict in the northwest and southwest regions of the country, with schools, students and teachers often coming under attack. In November, more than 80 people, including many children, were abducted from a school in Nkwen, in the northwest of the country and released a few days later. To date, 93 villages have allegedly been partially or totally burned due to conflict in the areas, with many children experiencing extreme levels of violence.- In the Central African Republic, a dramatic resurgence in fighting has enveloped much of the country, with two out of three children in need of humanitarian assistance.- In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, interethnic violence and clashes between security forces and armed groupsmilitia in the Kasai region and in the eastern provinces of Tanganyika, South Kivu, Nord Kivu and Ituri have had a devastating impact on children. The response to the ongoing Ebola outbreak has been seriously hindered by violence and instability in eastern DRC. In addition, an estimated 4.2 million children are at risk of severe acute malnutrition. The situation is compounded by violations of children’s rights, including forced recruitment by armed groups and sexual abuse.Pierre’s mother died after he was born three years ago he now lives with his father in the Central African Republic- In Iraq, even as fighting has largely subsided, four children were killed in November in the north of the country when the truck they were travelling to school in came under attack. Children and families returning to their homes in areas previously impacted by heavy violence continue to be exposed to the danger of unexploded ordnance. Thousands of families remain displaced and now face the additional threats of freezing winter temperatures and flash floods.- In the Chad Basin, ongoing conflict, displacement and attacks on schools, teachers and other education facilities have put the education of 3.5 million children at risk. Today in northeast Nigeria, the lake region of Chad, extreme north of Cameroon and Diffa region of Niger, at least 1,041 schools are closed or non-functional due to violence, fear of attacks, or unrest, affecting nearly 445,000 children.- A recent surge in violence in the border region between Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger has left 1,478 schools closed.- In Myanmar, the UN continues to receive reports of ongoing violations of the rights of Rohingya remaining in northern Rakhine State, which include allegations of killings, disappearances and arbitrary arrests. There are also widespread restrictions on the rights to freedom of movement and barriers to access health and education including in central Rakhine State. Ensuring children have access to quality education and other essential services will avert a “lost generation”\u0026nbspof Rohingya children otherwise they will lack the skills they need to contribute to society.- In northeast Nigeria, armed groups, including Boko Haram factions, continue to target girls, who are raped, forced to become wives of fighters or used as “human bombs”. In February, the group abducted 110 girls and one boy from a technical college in Dapchi, Yobe State. While most of the children have since been released, five girls died and one is still being held captive as a slave.Nawai, 15, during a ceremony to release children from armed groups in Yambio, South Sudan- In Palestine, over 50 children were killed and hundreds more injured this year, many while\u0026nbspdemonstrating against deteriorating living conditions in Gaza. Children in Palestine and Israel have been exposed to fear, trauma and injuries.- In South Sudan, relentless conflict and insecurity throughout the annual lean season pushed 6.1 million people into extreme hunger. Even with the advent of the rainy season, more than 43 per cent of the population remain food insecure. While the promise of a revitalised peace agreement offers a glimmer of hope for children, reports of extreme violence against women and children continue, most recently in Bentiu, where more than 150 women and girls reported suffering horrific sexual assault.- In Somalia, more than 1,800 children were recruited by parties to the conflict in the first nine months of the year, with 1,278 children abducted.Unicef’s research on water predicts one in four children will not have access to clean water by 2040- In Syria, between January and September, the UN verified the killing of 870 children – the highest number ever in the first nine months of any year since the start of the conflict in 2011. Attacks continued throughout the year, including the killing of 30 children in the eastern village of Al Shafa in November.- In eastern Ukraine, more than four years of conflict have taken a devastating toll on the education system, destroying and damaging hundreds of schools and forcing 700,000 children to learn in fragile environments, amid\u0026nbspvolatile fighting and the dangers posed by unexploded weapons of war. The situation is particularly severe for 400,000 children who live within 20km of the “contact line”, which ides the government and non-government-controlled areas and where shelling and extreme levels of mine contamination pose a lethal threat.- and in Yemen, the UN has verified 1,427 children killed or maimed in attacks, including an “unconscionable”\u0026nbspattack on a school bus in Sa’ada. Schools and hospitals have come under frequent attack or been used for military purposes, denying children access to their right to education and healthcare. This is further fuelling a crisis in a country where every 10 minutes, a child dies due to preventable diseases, and 400,000 children suffer from severe acute malnutrition.A doctor measures the arm of Yemeni Ali Mohammed Ahmed Jamal, 12, who is suffering from malnutrition“2019 marks the 30th anniversary of the landmark Convention on the Rights of the Child and the 70th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, yet today, more countries are embroiled in internal or international conflict than at any other time in the past three decades. Children living through conflict are among the least likely to be guaranteed their rights. Attacks on children must end,” Fontaine says.Unicef calls on all warring parties to abide by their obligations under international law to immediately end violations against children and the targeting of civilian infrastructure, including schools, hospitals and water infrastructure. Unicef also calls on states with influence over parties to conflict to use that influence to protect children.In photos: a toddlers recovery from malnutritionConflict in Congo has led to children being recruited as soldiers“Much more needs to be done to prevent wars, and to end the many disastrous armed conflicts devastating children’s lives. Yet even as wars continue, we must never accept attacks against children. We must hold warring parties to their obligation to protect children. Otherwise, it is children, their families and their communities who will continue to suffer the devastating consequences, for now, and for years to come,” Fontaine says.Across all these countries, Unicef works with partners to provide the most vulnerable children with health, nutrition, education and child protection services. For example, in October, Unicef helped to secure the release of 833 children recruited into armed forces in northeast Nigeria, and are working these children to reintegrate them into their communities. Since conflict broke out in South Sudan five years ago, Unicef has reunited almost 6,000 unaccompanied and separated children with their families. In Bangladesh, in 2018, Unicef reached thousands of Rohingya refugee children with mental health and psychosocial support. In Iraq, Unicef is working with partners to provide specialised services to women and children affected by gender-based violence.Democratic Republic of the CongoOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Really I only ask because when the fly-by happened on New Year’s Day, the space craft was traveling at ,mph.This is known in technical circles as “very fast”.And think about it. If you try to take pictures of the underside of a motorway bridge as you pass by, you’re not going to learn much.And you’re only doing .So what nuggets of information came back from the edge of our solar system Ah well. Because the probe only has a -watt transmitter and because it’s four billion miles from earth and because the sun’s currently in the wrong place, we won’t have all the graphs and the algebra for  months.By which time, the boffins will have been given another gazillion dollars to go and look at another bit of frozen rock.I’m not one of those people who say the money should be spent on blankets for refugees.But can we stop pretending that space is a big encyclopaedia of facts we need to know Because it isn’t. The moon taught us nothing of any great consequence.Missions to Mars have given us nothing but a very good film starring Matt Damon and all we know about the bit between is that it’s cold and empty.Yes, further out, beyond the Thermal Shock Region, ten or five thousand galaxies from here, there could be all sorts of juicy titbits for the boffins to analyse.But we can’t get there.And we never will.Becauseyou were on a space ship that took off like the Enterprise, you’d fall over.So let’s concentrate our efforts on something which IS achievable.Turning space travel into the ultimate zero-g theme park ride for tourists.A CHINESE space craft landed on the Moon this week.I anticipate it will learn nothing of any great value but that, within a week, it will have built a factory that makes , pairs of training shoes every month.LIKE many other bores and cowards, I decided on New Year’s Eve to quit drinking for a little while.As I write, it’s lunch time on January  and already, a small rash has developed on my stomach.I looked it up on the internet and, of course, it’s cancer.I was going to have a drink to help me think about that but then I noticed that the pain in my hip is also cancer and so is my failing eyesight and so is my deafness and so is my wonky ankle and so is every symptom anyone has ever developed anywhere.As a research tool, the internet is brilliant. As a doctor, however, it’s scary . . . and almost always wrong.THERE are many noble and well-meaning attempts to make people stop filling the sea with bits of discarded plastic.Iceland, the supermarket chain, has started a “reverse vending machine” scheme which gives you a ten pence voucher for every empty plastic bottle you deposit.And there are many volunteers who comb the world’s coastlines, pulling plastic bags from the mouths of turtles and stranded dolphins.I wish all these people well.But I think a more targeted approach is necessary.Every time I go for a walk on Britain’s coastline, I notice that the high-tide mark is always littered with the plastic wrappers from milk chocolate Bounty bars and Flora margarine tubs.So how’s this for a plan You go to the people who make these things and you give them an ultimatum.Do something about it. Or we will do something to you, involving sharks.AS I watched the fireworks light up the night sky over London on New Year’s Eve, I wondered how long it would take someone to say the money should have been spent on the NHS.The answer, very depressingly, was about four seconds.Well, let me provide a retort.The amount of public money spent on the fireworks was £.million.Which isn’t even enough to buy one decent MRI scanner.Let me put it this way.You could save all your money for a rainy day and live on gruel.But it’s nice once in a while to spend a bit of it on beer and curry.MANY don’t enjoy the first few weeks of the year because it’s usually cold and dark and miserable.I love it though because all my friends are back from their Christmas holidays.Which means my Instagram feed is no longer full of their legs on a beach with nothing in the background but the blue sea and the bloody blue sky.I’M delighted to hear that Olivia Newton John isn’t as poorly as was reported earlier.I’ve always been a fan.Once, in fact, I wrote to Jim’ll Fix It askinghe could fix it for me to sleep with her.The filthy little pervert never even replied.THERE are so many exciting new things set to lt our spirits in .We have what will probably be the last Avengers movie and, a quarter of a century after the original, a new Toy Story.On the small screen, Game Of Thrones will be back and there will be world cups in rugby and cricket.The soundtrack will be provided by the Spice Girls reunion and . . .  none of you will be paying attention to any of it because this month, Theresa May’s useless Brexit deal will be dashed on the foreshore of democratic debate.This will cause Corbyn to propose a vote of no confidence which will trigger a general election.And the winner of that will stage a second referendum which will provide the same result as the first so there will be riots, petrol bombs, power cuts, death and the end of days.Despite this, though, I’d like to wish you all a happy New Year.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And leaving it is a wrench.So a lot of people will be full of dread at the prospect of going back to work.But I actually think that January can be one of the most productive, exciting and dynamic months.And just in case you don’t agree, I’m going to share my tips on how to make January into Fanuary.The first step is to focus on what you want out of this new year. Becauseyou don’t make a plan you will end up exactly where you started, but this time in .If you hate your job, don’t just keep saying that: Work out why you hate it and what steps you need to take to change it. Brush up on your skills. Look for learning opportunities wherever you can — and take them.Be active and invest time in yourself. Dare to dream a bit by applying for jobs you like the look of, evenyou think they are out of your league.Andyou need a helping hand, sign up to my masterclass which will help you to write a killer CV — and even get the pay rise you want.It’s also really important to be positive — evenyou don’t always feel it.If you are surrounded by miserable, negative people you will end up that way too, so go out of your way to mix with positive, enthusiastic types.It’s very easy to stay in your comfort zone but you’ll never know what you are capable of achieving unless you try. Be brave and start taking risks.Another scenario is that you might not hate your job, but wish you felt more challenged, appreciated or engaged.If that’s the case, write a list of things you would doyou were fearless. Then act asyou were. Take small steps: Speak up in a meeting or put yourself forward for something you’ve never done before.And evenyou fail, be proud that you’ve tried.It’s also important to trust yourself — that’s the first step to improving your self image.If you lack self-confidence you won’t achieve much.You might be thinking, “It’s easy for you to say that — you’re successful”.But after my A-levels I never went to uni, and had no other qualications.I had to work really hard and be super-resilient because I could only ever rely on myself.On the way to success you’ll inevitably experience setbacks — but it’s how you respond to them that determines what happens next. Trust that you can handle them.One of the core communication skills is to be assertive, so try to have faith in your opinions. Sure, respect other people’s views but respect your own too.If you’re hoping for a pay rise or promotion in , I firmly believe thatyou don’t ask you don’t get.If the answer is no the first time round, find out what needs to change and work on that so that next time the answer is a yes.Personally, I never hear the word “No”.I hear: “Find another way to get what you want.”Most importantly, never stop encouraging yourself — and find a network to plug into.To network, you have to be ­interested and interesting. First impressions are made in the first seven seconds so, when you meet someone, make eye contact, smile, be polite — and dress the part.Put your phone away and work out an articulate way to explain who you are in  seconds. Be enthusiastic and be your own best friend.Feeling better about January now  I hope so.If you really want to Get What You Want — sign up to my new Masterclass and make this year all about you.IT’S not really a newsflash that British children are addicted to sugar. But the problem is worse than we might have thought.New research shows that from the age of two, children are consuming an average of almost oz of sugar a day, which is more than twice the recommended maximum daily allowance.This is not just destroying our young people’s teeth. Britain now has the worst obesity rate in Western Europe.Being overweight increases the risk of major health problems including Type  diabetes.So this is an unprecedented health crisis waiting to happen.And the reality is it’s not the fault of the Government, the NHS or the schools – it’s down to parents.It’s our responsibility to read food labels and cook healthy meals from scratch rather than relying on ready meals and takeaways.We also need to teach our kids to make good choices themselves and to develop a taste for healthy food.Unfortunately, though, the hardest word in the English language is “No”.Saying: “No, you can’t have sweets, crisps, fizzy drinks or sugary cereal” can be hard.And, often, it’s so much easier to say yes. Sure, you certainly get an easier le, but you’ll also have an obese, unhealthy and unhappy child.Obesity is now a disease. And it’s almost always a self- inflicted one, which takes years off our lives.The good news is that it’s reversible.Perhaps eating less sugar is one new year’s resolution we should all aspire to keep ANYONE  joining me by doing a Dry January this year I’m becoming a bit of a pro since I seem to do it every year.And while I wish I had some uplting advice about how to get through it, the reality is that I am prepared for a depressing, miserable boring month.The only way to survive it is to not go out, not have friends over, do absolutely zilch and just keep on sipping water.I suppose that’s the whole point, in a way.So welcome to the wagon – but roll on February.HUGE congratulations to Abbey Clancy and Peter Crouch on the announcement that they are expecting their fourth child.And also . . . isn’t Abbey looking fabulous in her Instagram snap Most of us, me included, looked like a bag of spuds after two children. But she has three kids already and another on the way and still looks incredible.I guess that’s a combination of good genes, good diet and the right exercise. But whatever she is doing, it’s working. Good for her!SOMETHING tells me that Justin Bieber might regret his new tattoo.He’s had the word “Grace” inked above his eyebrow, which is a lovely sentiment, but at first glance I’m sorry to say it looks a bit like he’s had stitches.And that’s not going to be a great image when he is .I’ve never understood tattoos – let alone on the face – and especially when the result looks like you’ve had a am trip to AE.I’M so happy to hear that every child is going to learn basic first aid including CPR in school to help boost heart attack survival rates.Education Secretary Damian Hinds has announced that he wants all pupils to be able to give emergency care by the time they leave school so more lives can be saved.All I can say is: About time.I did an advanced first aid course and now offer them to all my employees at West Ham. In fact, I actively encourage them to do it.You never know when you might use it, andsomeone does need it you could save their le. Now all schools need to do is bring back home economics lessons so kids can cook for themselves.Then they’ll have some real le skills when they finally leave home.“COULD do better”. That’s the phrase that went through my mind watching Khloe Kardashian twerking on New Year’s Eve for her boyfriend, Tristan Thompson . . . who was completely oblivious.A video showed Khloe shaking her bits and bobs in a silver and black leopard-print bodysuit for Tristan’s benefit – only to look round for a kiss and see that his back was turned.She is a beautul girl and, frankly, she doesn’t have to try so hard.Khloe could be with someone who is genuinely interested in her as opposed to flogging this dead horse. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Will it be a General Election, a second referendum, the Government’s deal or a “no deal” exit My guess is that the last two are the most likely.Theresa May’s tactic is to run down the clock until MPs feel they have no option but to back the Government’s deal and avoid a no-deal departure.The Government has been blitzing constituencies to put pressure on MPs via their supporters.But a recent poll indicated that  per cent of Conservative constituency workers think a no-deal Brexit would be better than the PM’s deal.So that tactic hasn’t worked, and a nasty Commons confrontation looms.It is not surprising that David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary, has suggested the PM should postpone the vote for a second time.It is the Irish backstop, that tortuous measure which binds Northern Ireland closely to EU regulations, which has caused the most dficulty, particularly as the Government is dependent on DUP votes for its survival.To the DUP it is unacceptable that there should, in effect, be a border down the Irish Sea. To Conservative MPs there is also the danger of being locked into the backstop indefinitely and that, having already agreed to accept £billion, the EU would have no incentive to move on and negotiate a decent Free Trade agreement.If the PM could somehow get firm assurances from the EU that would guarantee the backstop was definitely a temporary measure then that might persuade MPs, including the DUP, to change their minds.After all,the backstop is only temporary, all the things that are objectionable in the backstop, such as the inability to sign new trade deals, are also only temporary.It is not impossible that there could be a concession on these lines. Butthe Government is defeated in the Commons, what then In some ways the PM’s hand might be strengthened and she could say to Brussels that it is absolutely clear the present deal cannot get through ­Parliament.The EU will maintain that its offer is final, but this would not be the first time the EU has said that, only for a new offer to then appear.Opponents of Brexit cling to the hope that defeat in the Commons will lead either to a second referendum or a General Election. But neither will happen automatically.Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, a General Election can only be heldParliament votes for one or the Government loses a vote of ­confidence.The DUP don’t want Jeremy Corbyn as PM and as long as Mrs May’s deal has not passed, the DUP will continue to support the Government.A second referendum could only happenthe Government introduced legislation for one. No Conservative PM would survive doing that.The remaining option is the so- called no-deal Brexit, which really means trading on World Trade ­Organisation terms with both the EU and the rest of the world.This is how much of world trade is conducted and how many countries outside the EU trade with the EU.Strictly speaking there is no such thing as a no-deal Brexit.There would be many side deals covering administrative areas that are not strictly trade, such as health regulations, safety, aviation, transportion of animals and so on.No one is claiming there would be no problems. Inevitably there will be some, but they would essentially be short term, and we would not face a bill of £billion.Leaving without a deal is feared by some large businesses anxious that integrated manufacturing supply chains might be interrupted. But Britain imports manufacturing components already from many non-EU areas of the world. These issues are solvable.Roberto Azevedo, Director General of the World Trade Organisation, has said there is no reason why trading on WTO terms should lead to disruption.He presumably knows what he is talking about.But the Government seems unable to make up its mind about a no-deal Brexit.Originally the PM boldly declared: “No deal is better than a bad deal”. Presumably she meant it.But recently the Government has launched Project Fear Mark , highlighting the alleged disaster of a no-deal Brexit in a lurid way.This campaign provoked a civil servant to write a remarkable anonymous article in a national ­newspaper declaring that “the civil ­service was ready for no-deal”, advanced preparations had been made and she accused the Government of deliberately concealing the work that had been done in order to pressurise MPs to swallow the ­Government’s “disastrous deal”.It seems probable that the Government will not be able to get the PM’s deal through Parliament and so will have to go back to Brussels, not just once, but maybe several times.If the EU refuses to budge, the automatic legal position is that the UK will leave on March , eventhere is no deal and stalemate in Parliament.There is very little that Parliament can do to stop that now. It is what Parliament has voted for in the past.My guess is that the EU may well come up with some concession, perhaps a legally binding clarication, and that there will be a lot of arguing, probably right up to midnight on March .But whatever happens, the next day we will leave.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Thanks to this Prime Minister, we haven’t a clue how  will start, let alone finish.Chaos is the only certainty as the Government faces parliamentary defeat over her Chequers botch.We might then be in for a grinding marathon of rematches, a crisis General Election, a second referendum or — the only really positive option — joining hands with the rest of the world.Thanks to Brexit saboteur Phil Hammond, the path to those open seas is blocked by tank traps, landmines and treasury barbed wire.Hammond, aided by EU fth columnist Olly Robbins, is the panic merchant behind Project Fear Mark .Unless we accept Brexit In Name Only , abide by EU rules on trade and customs and bow to the European Court of Justice, we will starve to deathwe are not first eaten alive by rats. These are only “worst case” scenarios, you understand.More likely, we would prosper and flourish without a deal and, after a brief period of turbulence, wonder what this bitterness and recrimination was all about.Hammond, who loathes Mrs May and would have been sacked in a flash had she won her catastrophic  election, is now lead blues singer with The Remoaners.When the history of this bungled mess is written, he will emerge as principal villain, the Scrooge Chancellor who blocked every attempt to win a real deal from Brussels.He has waited until too late to unleash a few quid to build ferry and port infrastructure.His motive, shared by the hostage PM, is to drive home the fraudulent nightmares of No Deal at the expense of the national interest.Olly Robbins, a fan of Stalin’s Soviet Union, is the so-called Brexit negotiator who failed at any point in the last two miserable years to wring a single unwilling concession out of Brussels.History’s verdict will be harsher stillwe now end up bogged down indefinitely with BRINO, locked into EU coils without any of the benefits of actually getting out.Brussels doesn’t want us to leave — and they will make damned sure we don’t.The catalyst will be the day Mrs May actually signs off £BILLION to keep the leaky EU afloat while Britain remains shackled to a sinking ship.So far, this vast sum is merely a digital symbol with no immediate impact on the hard-pressed taxpayers who must pay.But once this cheque is cashed, reality will dawn with unpredictable consequences.For there is no magic £billion sitting in Treasury vaults. We would have to borrow it to bail out the EU — while struggling to pay our own bills here at home.Britain has little appetite for social unrest. For the moment, we can look across the Channel with bemused detachment as Paris is engulfed in flames.But .million people here voted for Brexit. They knew what they were doing.The same is not quite true of those who voted to stay.Many were reluctant Remainers. Some would have voted for Brexit, but for George Osborne’s original Shock and Horror. They know better now.They have seen ministers crying “wolf” too often.They don’t believe Theresa May, Hammond, the Treasury or discredited George “Six Jobs” Osborne.No Deal terries Brussels but it doesn’t scare waverers any more.Along with Tory MPs ing fortied by local supporters after the Christmas break, most are braced and ready for leaving the EU on global trade terms.Mrs May is banking everything on a last-ditch deal with Brussels over the Northern Ireland scam.Without it, she — or someone  — must tear up the cheque, hoist the sails and steer Britain out of the EU and into clear blue water.ENERGETIC Health Secretary Matt Hancock wants to make the patchy NHS world class.Here’s one good reason why he must.A friend with a skin blemish was booked for a biopsy in Chelmsford, Essex, last March.Months rolled by.So she paid out of her savings for a biopsy and then surgery after a specialist confirmed cancer and warned delay might have serious consequences.This weekend, NINE months later, she received a letter of apology and an update on her place in the queue for the biopsy.How many patients die before they get a letter like that Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

When I came back into the kitchen I spotted something on the floor.At first I didnt recognise it as a snake so I picked it up to put it in the bin but then it started wriggling.Quick-thinking Barry grabbed a saucepan lid and trapped the young snake underneath before calling the RSPCA.RSPCA animal collection officer Ella Davies said: Barry must have been quite shocked when he realised there was a snake in his kettle.He explained to me that he had some problems with his sight so when he first saw the snake he thought she was string or part of the plastic packaging.Only when he picked her up did he realise she was alive. He said he liked snakes but wanted to confine her quickly as he was unsure what species she was.The unharmed snake was taken to the charitys Putney Animal Hospital.ACO Davies added: Barry thought the snake may have travelled from China - which is where the kettle was made - but I suspect she snuck into the box at a storage warehouse somewhere in the UK.Corn snakes are talented escape artists so I suspect this little one has escaped from a viium somewhere.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s permeable material,” Willesee said.“The dome was only meant to be a temporary solution until the US came up with a permanent plan,” he said, describing the concrete solution as a cost-cutting exercise.The  US government report also warned that the increasing severity of storms in the region meant the dome was at risk of being blown apart.The same report said that kind of major breach of the facility would not cause further damage to the islands than had already been caused by the Cold War nuclear testing.In , the US granted the Marshall Islands independence and wrote them a cheque for  million, intended to generate money to be used as payment to claimants as a result of damage and injury caused by the nuclear testing.In , a lawsuit by the Marshallese arguing over “changed circumstances” over the Nuclear Claims Tribunal established to manage the claims was dismissed by the US Supreme Court.An attempt to undertake another clean-up took place in , treating contaminated areas with potassium, but since then the rising sea levels have caused more issues.Residents of the Marshall Islands fear their homes are at constant risk of inundation.As sea levels continue to rise and the climate becomes more unstable, locals are faced with the harsh reality that their island homes are becoming uninhabitable.The children who live there now refer to themselves as “the last generation”.“Time is very limited,” -year-old Charlotte Jack told US TV network ABC.“Sometimes I think that by the time I graduate and go get my education, try to come back and serve my island, there’s no more island. There’s no more nation.“There’s no more culture. And I’m just there, stuck on the mainland, thinking, ‘What could I have done ’”In the Marshall Islands, the most common cause of death is diabetes, which is related to a thyroid disorder.

Right ahead.”Then we all sat and waited for the impact that would surely follow.And waited . . . and waited, as Gemma remained stubbornly upright for the duration.Such is le at Dancing On Ice, “the show where anything could happen”, according to the continuity announcer, but never actually does.That’s the main reason why people stopped watching and ITV buried it in a cold and shallow grave five years ago.Then, without much warning or any great demand, it was suddenly brought back to le, last year, and proved every bit as underwhelming and injury free as I remembered.There’s no horse too dead for another ITV flogging, though, so it’s just ed for yet another run, with most of the same fixtures and fittings.Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby do a solid enough job of hosting, considering their script could suck a black hole inside out, and there’s a four- man Ice Panel where the truth bombs are exclusively supplied by Jason Gardiner, who arrived dressed as Bret Maverick for Sunday’s opening show.What seems to separate this year’s Dancing On Ice from almost every other series, however, is the line-up. It’s actually quite imaginative and offers the show a serious chance of redemption,just one of them can be hospitalised before the end of the run.Among the  contenders, we’ve got: Westle’s Brian McFadden, Richard “Hollywood is the catalyst for everything I do” Blackwood, cricketer Ryan Sidebottom, and Saira Khan, who was advised by Ruth Langsford to “do Strictly”, but is a bit too low rent for the BBC so is stuck here wearing skates and tights.Despite having two hours to fill, none of that lot actually got to dance on Sun- day, though, as, I suspect, ITV wanted to clear the decks for its preferred bookings.These include -year-old Didi Conn , from Grease, Corrie’s Jane Danson, who was put in “a horse lt, with half rotation”, and Mark “Joe Mangel” Little, who’s turned into Dog The Bounty Hunter since we last saw him on Neighbours.But let’s not kid ourselves here. The reason many of us probably tuned in, on Sunday, in was to see Gemma Collins.Towie’s self-styled “GC” the first letter of which stands for Gigantic. A woman who really could do with a heavy landing on that over-entitled a**e of hers or, better still, developing a work ethic and some humility.I prayed for the worst then, and saved what was left for her partner, Matt Evers, but he’d clearly taken one look at Gemma and thought “screw that for le without a disability allowance”.There were no lts, no falls and she didn’t even have the decency to rip her drawers when she tried the splits. Sunday was just another entry in DOI’s endless list of crushing disappointments.Partly thanks to some very sympathetic marking, from everyone except Jason, Gemma will also get to skate again in a fortnight, which, I think I’m right in saying, means they’ll have to make an attempt at the infamous “King Kong lt”.And then, once Addison Lee has dropped her off at the rink, it’s on with the skating.Piers Morgan: “I bumped into Gemma Collins in Langan’s restaurant, at Christmas, and . . . ”A “She’s OK, actually.”B “A Japanese sports network bought the footage for million yen.”THE expression TV gold doesn’t begin to do justice to BBC’s fly-on-the-wall documentary about Matt and Luke Goss’s O reunion gig.It’s a genuine masterpiece that would deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as Spinal Tap,the pair of them weren’t so wonderfully serious about everything.Bros: After The Screaming Stops is the title of the film, directed by David Soutar and Joe Pearlman, who had the good sense just to point their cameras at the boys and let them say things like: “I made a conscious decision, because of Stevie Wonder, not to be superstitious.” “Rome wasn’t built in a day, f*** me that’s true, but we don’t have the time Rome did.” “He was a rectangle, I was a rectangle and together we made a square, which is a fortress.” And “There were  one-way streets and one solitary two-way street, where me and my brother met in the middle.” .As well as all the tortured metaphors and Matt’s profundities, though, the film also features a fantastically earnest rant about conkers and an escalating feud between the boys, which should have had every single viewer crying out for both of them to be included in the next I’m A Celebrity line-up, pretty much from the word go.But how did I feel at the end of this emotional dual carriageway In the words of poet philosopher singer Matt Goss: “Two words. Privileged.”John Humphrys: “At least  of the  books of the New Testament are usually attributed to which author ”The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “New Year’s Day in the UK, January or December ”Lauren: “December.”And Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “In , Mark Calaway, who’s better known as The Undertaker, retired from which sport ”Gerry: “Golf.”The Voice UK fooling me into thinking it might go a whole episode without Jenner Hudson “spontaneously” bursting into song.Luther turning out to be a soulless, unpleasant, far-fetched mess. The insane pouting contortions of Candice “Bake Off” Brown during Celebrity Mastermind.The BBC somehow crowbarring an anti-Brexit dig into The Greatest Dancer.And Dee Dee Wilde calling her old Tena Lady troop, on the same show, Pan’s Fans, rather than the far more appropriate and eye-catching Pads People. Basic stuff, really.Steve Howey: “You need to have experienced that experience to have the experience.”And Phil Thompson: “All these City players are like for like. Even Danilo, who isn’t as good as Kyle Walker.”JUST when they thought we couldn’t send them anything worse than the potato famine, up pipes Last Leg Of The Year guest Sue Perkins with this Brexit bonus: “My New Year’s resolution is to try and track down a dim and distant Irish relative, so I can finally get that passport.”Andthere are any genealogists who can help, send the information to me marked “Generation Game: Urgent.”Knighthood’s in the post.Paul Ryan’s Farage cameo on Brexit: The Uncivil War.Clarkson not trying to be likeable, on Millionaire, which, ironically, made him very likeable.Bradley Walsh hating every second of his skye on ITV’s Breaking Dad.Simplicity Cremations’ perfectly-placed advert during The Last Leg Of The Year .And Billy Connolly, overwhelmed by love, on BBC, paying tribute to: “All the things that made me good and bad, Scotland.”Match Of The Day’s Jonathan Pearce on Alo Morata: “He needs to do that game in, game out to prove he’s good enough for Cha.”“They need to do that gay men, gay marriage to prove he’s good enough for Cha.”Sent in by Iain Milne, Newcastle. Picture research: Amy Reading.TV dramatists haven’t yet rewritten the result of Brexit.But, trust me, they will eventually. This is just the start of the softening-up process.Brexit: The Uncivil War, a Channel  production that toyed with neutrality, for about  minutes, but had given up any pretence long before the drama’s rather desperate postscript finally stopped trying to nudge viewers in the Remainer direction.The two main characters weren’t entirely subtle either.One, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, was Dominic Cummings, the hi-vis dork who was in charge of the Leave campaign.The other, “I’M IN” leader Craig Oliver, whose portrayal, by Rory Kinnear, as a brilliant-but-tragic hero, was rather undermined by the fact Craig Oliver was also one of the drama’s political advisers.What saved The Uncivil War, though, was the acting, particularly Paul Ryan’s Nigel Farage turn, and Cumberbatch, who wasn’t a perfect fit for Cummings as his Durham accent slipped too often.It’s a performance brimming with such mesmerising charisma, though, I can genuinely see The Uncivil War effecting genuine change – two extra zeroes on Dominic Cummings’ next salary.Such is the real power of TV drama.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Scotlands highest civil court today ruled the Scottish government acted unlawfully when investigating complaints involving the ex-First Minister. Allegations against the former SNP leader - which he strongly denies - were made a year ago. But Scotlands most senior civil servant, Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans, today accepted the investigation of two complaints made was procedurally flawed. Speaking in Edinburgh today, Mr Salmond said the process was unfair, unlawful and tainted by bias and he was not guilty of any criminality. He said the Permanent Secretary of the Scottish Government should consider her position and take appropriate action.  He added he was glad to have won and sad its been necessary, and said surplus crowdfunded legal funds will now be donated to good causes. Mr Salmond told journalists: Because the process has been agreed as unlawful, unfair and tainted by apparent bias, the Scottish government have had to concede on the case and on the expenses to the maximum extent. That is going to raise a cost to the public purse of many many hundreds of thousands of pounds. All of this was unnecessary.  Ms Evans said lawyers for both sides had informed the Court of Session that his action has been settled and the court has approved that settlement. Contact between the investigating officer and the two complainers around the time the allegations were made in January  could have created an impression of partiality, Ms Evans conceded. She stated: There is nothing to suggest that the investigating officer did not conduct their duties in an impartial way.Unfortunately, the interactions with the complainants in advance of the complaints being made meant that the process was flawed, however impartially and fairly the investigating officer conducted the investigation.  Ms Evans stressed: The Scottish Government has acted in good faith at all times and will continue to do so. It was right and proper that these complaints were investigated and I stand by the decision to carry out that investigation. It is also important to note that the procedural flaw in the investigation does not have implications, one way or the other, for the substance of the complaints or the credibility of the complainers. The Judicial Review was never about the substance of the complaints, but about the process that took place to investigate those complaints. As a result she said it was open to the Scottish Government to re-investigate the complaints, adding that subject to the views of the complainants, it would be our intention to consider this.  But Ms Evans said this would only be once ongoing police inquiries have concluded. Ms Evans said an internal review would be carried out by the Government, and stressed: We shall learn and apply the lessons of this case to any future complaint addressed under our internal procedure. She stated: My priority remains the duty of care to my staff, including anyone in the organisation who brings forward any concerns about inappropriate conduct, regardless of the identity or seniority of the inidual complained about. Finally I would reiterate that the single procedural flaw which led to this decision is deeply regrettable. In particular, I regret the distress it will cause to the two women who raised the complaints. In the court, Judge Lord Pentland said the decisions in August were unlawful in respect that they were procedurally unfair and that they were tainted with apparent bias. The Court of Session in Edinburgh heard the person who investigated the complaints of sexual misconduct, which MrSalmondstrongly denies, had involvement with the complainers prior to being appointed investigating officer.

Labour MP Stephen Doughty claimed after non-existent ferries and lorries going nowhere it was just another sign of farce. Now we have radio adverts asking questions with no answers, the pro-EU MP said.   What a illustration of the mess this government is in - and all the more reason why we need a peoples vote to end this Brexit chaos. But really, the format of the ads isnt that surprising.

Among these were Economists for Free Trade, a hardline group which has strong links with Brexiteers Jacob Rees-Mogg and David Davis and has claimed that there is “nothing to fear” from leaving the EU without reaching agreement. It is led byProfessor Patrick Minford, a former economic advisor to Margaret Thatcher, whose earlyBrexit forecasts were described as “really far-fetched” and “crazy” by academics at the London School of Economics.   The controversial group was hosted at Downing Street- the heart of the Government’s Brexit operations - between June and early October this year, the latest period for which figures are available.At the end of September, Theresa May was left fighting to save her Brexit plans and her authority as Prime Minister after she was ambushed at the end of the Salzburg summit of EU leaders.The meetings also included one with the free-market think tank Institute for Economic Affairs, whose trade policy chief Shanker Singham has been described as the “Brexiteers’ brain” and whose close contacts with influential pro-Brexit MPs has attracted scrutiny. Top civil servants at the Department for Exiting the EU also held talks with officials from the Adam Smith Institute, a neoliberal organisation credited with inspiring some of the most controversial privatisations of the Thatcher and Major governments.   Both of these took place at the Foreign Office during a three month period, almost all of which was under Jeremy Hunt who took over from Boris Johnson as foreign secretary. MPs criticisedthe lack of alternative economic viewpoints represented at the meetings, revealed under freedom of information laws. Leading anti-Brexit Tory MP Anna Soubry said: “They’ve got to consult with everybody and most importantly people who actually know all about business and about how the economy actually works.

But what sort of parent decides to hurt those children as a result When Valentina Naidenko discovered her daughter had been swapped with that of another woman in a hospital blunder  years earlier, she did not rail or blame. She said: I am happy that I now know. Svetlana is my daughter. And Katya is my daughter too, this is how it is. When Maria Gerbeno was sent home from hospital with a baby that wasnt hers, she started legal action for DNA tests, but didnt spit her dummy. She said: I spent three weeks with a baby that was not my daughter but I gave her all my love and knew that the other mum would be doing the same. But when father-of-three Richard Mason found out he had been infertile all along, he lashed out at his adulterous we, launched legal action, and demanded his money back. Its not surprising two of his sons no longer speak to him its a quandary why the third is still bothering.  Parenthood - biological or adoptive - demands that you put someone s needs before your own. It applies equally to mums and dads. And in his rage, Richard Mason has all but written off his children. As a co-founder of comparison site Moneysupermarket, he made poundm overnight when the firm floated in . That same year, he split up with his we Kate, who he had been married to for  years. They agreed a orce settlement of poundm, much of which was an advance payment for his childrens private school fees. According to reports, in the first years of their separation he paid her pound, a year in child maintenance. A nice wage for many, but a drop in the ocean for him - even assuming he never made a penny extra in interest or earnings, it represented just .% of his remaining wealth.  In  Richard was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, a disease which had led to the death of his sister. While fumbling to grasp his own mortality, he was given a second blow when the doctor said he was probably infertile, too. He texted his ex to askthe children, the oldest then aged  and twins aged , were his she assured him they were. At this stage a decent parent would ask themselves whether further questions would harm their children, who had already endured a orce. Not even the most mediocre of parents would feel their now-grown children would enjoy having old marital wounds reopened. Richard Mason, though, sought out the UK expert on paternity fraud and launched legal action. He did so even though his oldest son warned him it would mean they never spoke again.  Ive been the victim of adultery. Its horrendous, and betrayal hurts whether you find out at the time or a decade later. The first reaction is always to kick down doors, wail, and throw lawyers at the partner you now hate. But when you have children, your rage is qualied because you have to put them first. Or you should, unless youre Richard Mason and still fairly upset about the -odd % of your wealth which the law required you to spend on the family you used to have. . Instead he decided to settle some scores, not just with his ex but with her lover too.  So he launched a bid for some of his poundm back, and got pound,. But it still wasnt enough. He disbelieved his wes denials, so told their oldest son he was infertile even before it had been confirmed. The son confronted his mum, who confessed to an affair. Richards opinion about who was the biggest victim is clear. I was just thinking, s*** my le is ruined... Im just a guy who was there when they were brought up. He now refers to the boys, in conversations with others, as the sons I thought were mine. He plans to tell his -year-old mother with Alzheimers that she no longer has grandchildren. He believes birthday parties, graduations, and his own grandchildren have been stolen. Yet this man is the only dad they know. He was there at their births, and throughout their childhood. And what happened is neither their, nor even their mothers, fault.  There was no paternity fraud, because there was no intent to deceive. If Richard didnt know he was infertile theres no way his we could have done - there was no con, no scam, no cuckold duped into raising another mans children. At the absolute worst, she may have been uncertain - but as the affair was not discovered, and the marriage survived, she presumably took the view that mentioning it would have been horribly damaging for their children. Too late now. Its been mentioned all over the newspapers by an angry man trying to humiliate his ex-we and flush out her lover. Richard continues his obsession with parenthood equating to money, saying he believes the genetic parent has never paid a penny towards his sons.The latest news is that he is threatening to write a book which will be littered with clues as to the mans identity, which it appears he has suspicions of but is wary of stating as bluntly as he does his financial calculations.Would he sue the biological father,he could  We shall have to hold our breath, wont we.  In interviews Richard has said: I still think of them as my boys... and I miss them so much. Yet his actions are those of an angry sparrow whos found three cuckoos in his nest. You cannot love your children, but count them in pounds and pence. You cannot put their needs before yours, while exposing their very conception to national media scrutiny. You cannot possibly risk your child never speaking to you again,it can be avoided. But the fact Richard Mason got cashback on his hurt is not enough: now he wants to haul his family into the court of public opinion, where he can count on a gammon-faced jury to denounce a scheming female who somehow analysed his sperm years before the doctors did.

Dominic Hilton, , came out as gay to his family when he was  and says he had no doubt he would one day marry a man.  Between the ages of  and , he even worked as an escort before happily settling down with long-term boyfriends as a self-confessed serial monogamist. But after splitting with his most recent ex on Christmas Day in , he decided to make a New Years resolution and become celibate for . Now, after a year without sex, he is ready to re-enter the dating world - but with one major dference. Dominic, who has appeared on Channel s Naked Attraction, claims he is looking exclusively for a woman as his coitus hiatus has permanently shted his sexual preference. The -year-old mental health worker, from Bournemouth, says he his not bisexual as he is no longer even slightly attracted men. He even claims whereas before he was quite camp he is now always in tracksuits.   After splitting with his ex, Dominic made a resolution to spend  celibate in order to discover a little more about himself. The -year-old, who has had between  and  male sexual partners, says he had never gone very long without sex and wanted to explore le without the distraction. Dominic said: Sex is always something I enjoyed, but this past year, that sexual attraction to men has just gone. If you’d have asked me in the pasta person can change their sexuality, I’d have said no – but I’m living proof that you can. It was a gradual thing – not like someone flicked a switch and I was straight – but now I am actively seeking a girl to settle down with. I’ve had sex with men, but not women, so want to find an open-minded girl I can lose my virginity to.   Dominic says he had a couple of casual flings with girls before he came out to his parents, but he has only ever dated men since. A serial monogamist, he says he preferred long-term relationships to playing the field and has had four serious relationships that have lasted around two years. Whenever he did find himself single, Dominic said he would try anything and everything to find love again, even appearing on Channel ’s Naked Attraction, where contestants judge would-be suitors by what they look like in the buff. I’d grown up not especially confident with my own body, but I eventually reached a point where I thought, ‘What the hell ’ and decided to apply for Naked Attraction, he said. I’d recommend absolutely anybody do it, it was a real laugh – though it is dficult to explain to girls now that I’m looking to date a woman.   Describing his decision to give up sex, Dominic said: To get over someone, a lot of people go and get under someone , but I didn’t want to do that. I started reading up on celibacy and saw people talk about how it had helped their self-esteem, lessened their anxieties, given them more energy and generally taught them more about who they were. At that point, I was still feeling down about my break up, so I just wanted to do something to make me happy. I never imagined celibacy would change my le as much as it has. At first, Dominic did not t tell his friends or family what he had planned, only sharing the news with them around three months in. He added: A lot of my friends found it funny. I remember one saying, ‘You’ll never do it.’ But the longer it went on, the more determined I was. Dominic admits he found the first couple of months tough - but he stayed resolute. And, after a while, the urge began to wane. Freed from the anxieties of dating, he found he had more time to focus on himself.  It was really liberating not having anything to commit to, he said. Taking myself away from all that meant that the only person I needed approval from was me. There was no worrying about what to wear, whether dates would go well and what it meantyou hadn’t heard from them. In the past, I struggled with anxiety, which was what inspired me to go into mental health work, but being celibate meant I wasn’t looking to impress anyone – I was putting myself first and getting to know myself in a dferent way, which worked wonders for my anxiety. Dominic also found he also had far more energy than before. He added: I don’t knowit was all the pent-up testosterone, but I just felt like I had ten times more energy. The most profound change, though, happened far more gradually. Throughout the year, he noticed he was becoming more and more interested in women until, at the end of , he realised he was no longer attracted to men. My male friend and I were on holiday in Alicante, Spain in October, and where I’d usually be chatting about guys we could see, andI thought they were attractive, I just couldn’t join in, he said. Then my friend turned to me and said, ‘You really are straight, aren’t you ’ I’d been wonderingperhaps I was bisexual, and attracted to both men and women, but now, I just don’t find men attractive anymore. I have no intention of sleeping with a man again. Telling everyone I was straight was like coming out all over again, but my loved ones were supportive and just want me to be happy. Now Dominic said everything down to his dress sense and mannerisms have completely changed. He added: Before, I was quite camp, whereas I’m not now. Growing up, I loved dressing in makeup like Boy George, but these days, I’m always in tracksuits. As  drew to an end, Dominic began thinking about rejoining the dating world and downloaded Tinder, where users can swipe yes or no to profiles based on a selection of photos. But, unlike before, he began searching for a woman. He describes his type as pierced, tattooed, edgy girls but also places great importance on finding someone with an open mind. So far he has found telling women that he previously identied as gay can be tricky. It can really shut down a conversation. Though nobody has said anything outrightly rude, they just stop talking, which I almost hate more as it leaves you feeling dismissed and ignored, he said. I told one girl, and she ended up blocking me an hour before we were due to meet which was hurtful. A lot of people don’t understand it, and think that I am gay but this is a phase. I have no doubt that I am straight though. As for taking a break from sex - he thinks more people should try it. He said: I would recommend celibacy to anyone feeling a little lost in le. Evenyou don’t go a whole year, just take some time and focus on yourself – you may be surprised at what you learn.

South West Water said it was the biggest it had ever found and it would take about eight weeks to remove it. The firms director of wastewater said he was thankful it was found in good time with no risk to bathing waters.  Andrew Roantree said the discovery showed fatbergs were not only found in the UKs biggest cities, but right here in our coastal towns. Fatbergs form when people put things such as fat, wet wipes, sanitary towels, nappies and condoms, down sinks and toilets. A m-long fatberg weighing  tonnes was famously found blocking a Victorian-era sewer in east London in  and took nine weeks to remove.  A chunk of it subsequently went on show at the Museum of London and was hailed for increasing visitor numbers. Sewer workers discovered the fatberg in Sidmouth in December but they will not find its exact size or weight until they start to remove it. Work is due to start on February .

He asked the charity what they wanted and the answer was a hot tub the largest hot tub in the country – a high tech anti-gravity pound million hydrotherapy pool for those suffering from MS, strokes, Parkinson’s and ME.   And Peters familys lives have all changed forever.All three of his children – Helen, Sharon and Anthony – now have new mortgage-free houses and brand new cars.His  grandchildren have or will have the same too - as will his three great-grandchildren and the one thats on the way. The lucky -year-old, who still does the lottery every week, said: “I used to go into shops and think it would be nice to have this and that, but now I can have what I want.” That includes a BMW i, an electric BMW i, Porsche Cayman in its own unique colour, a Bentley, and the last three Land Rover Defenders made .   Other purchases have included a pound, watch from Michael Spiers jewellers in Truro, a helicopter trip to the Cheltenham Gold Cup and two static caravans kept at his beloved Butlins in Minehead. But he ensures he keeps himself grounded, saying “I still own the house on Trelanderand would go back in a shot – I loved living there.” It was May , , when Peter Congdon checked his Wednesday Lotto ticket on Teletext as usual.“I’ve got pound,” he thought. “Oh no, it’s not...” Shocked, he walked to his daughter’s house ten doors down from him who double-checked the ticket - and it was certainly a lot more than pound. Peter had won just over pound. million.   The multi-millionaire said: “I couldn’t believe it then and I still can’t really believe it now.” The pool hes funding for the Merlin MS Centre will open in February.It will prove a leline for many and Peter’s kindness has even brought some sufferers to tears, with one man looking forward for his first dip in water for  years. The building will be painted primrose with the flowers planted outside as they were Rosemary’s favourite. Peter and his family have raised thousands for Merlin over the years on top of his poundm donation.   This includes donating a brand new Land Rover as a raffle prize, holding bingo competitions and taking part in a parachute jump. But Peter still gets emails and letters from strangers begging for money three years after his win. Daughter Helen Venton said: “We had funny letters from the beginning – including one man who wanted a coffin for his own funeral. We received the first letter on the actual night of the win – a woman wanted help paying off her husband’s gambling debts.” They have also had requests from strangers askingPeter will pay for weddings. One came all the way from Australia, addressed to Peter Congdon, Lottery Winner, Truro, Cornwall.  But Helen said: “We’ve been on the other end, trying to find money for prom dresses, for example.” That’s why Peter now loans out his flashy cars for school proms, only asking for a donation to the MS Centre in exchange.It’s all about “little gestures”, he says.Those gestures include paying for Tregolls School’s fireworks display for the past three years and funding campaign leaflets for Melissa Mead, the Penryn mum who recently received the MBE for her work raising awareness of sepsis. How much is left of Peter’s cash then  “I’ve got enough for this week,” he said.  He’s made investments and put some of the money in property, owning three houses at Trelander and three at Hendra in Truro. The family say they also fall victim of rumour and gossip. One of Peter’s relatives was shopping for nappies in Tesco when she heard a woman saying: “You’d think she’d find somewhere better to shop.” Peter said: Camelot were great, offering us a financial adviser and which banks we should use. They also respond to the begging letterswe forward them.   Although his home is a lot bigger than his previous abode, Peters house is still a modest affair.The giant cheque with the full amount of pound,, sits next to photos of the announcement at The Alverton hotel as well as the winning balls in lottery champagne glasses. The pensioner said: I told my children, Im thinking of having a tattoo. Dont be silly, they told me. But hed already had it done and revealed his lucky numbers tattooed over his heart alongside a rose in memory of his late we Rosemary who never got to experience the familys riches.

He added: “So what, you’re too slow come hit me, hit me, lets see what happens. “Try me, go on one of yous touch me.”   Suddenly the sounds of a Taser gun can be heard as the man goes quiet.

The three-part ITV series, Manhunt, stars Martin Clunes as Scotland Yards DCI Colin Sutton, who led the investigation into paedophile Bellfields horric crimes. Bellfield is serving le sentences for murdering schoolgirl Milly Dowler, , and students Amelie Delagrange, , and Marsha McDonnell, , between  and . The rapist and triple murderer, now aged , was also convicted of trying to kill Kate Sheedy, then , when he ran over her as she crossed a road.   Manhunt details how DCI Sutton linked Delagranges murder in  to the murders of McDonnell in  and Dowler in . Mr Sutton, now retired, said this week that since the drama premiered on Sunday night three women have contacted him on Twitter claiming they were sexually assaulted by Bellfield. He said he has been in contact with the women and he has made arrangements to speak to those who want to be spoken to.   Mr Sutton told ITV News: I’ve had another three ladies who have come forward to me via Twitter to say I was attacked by Levi Bellfield and I never reported it to police, and I’ve made contact with them ... and I’ve made arrangements to speak to those who want to be spoken to and to try and help them. He added: It’s not a complete surprise, to be honest. I’ve been involved in documentaries about Bellfield before and had the same effect.  We just don’t know what the boundaries of this man’s offending were. Bellfield - dubbed the Bus Stop Killer and Bus Stop Stalker - was arrested in  and sentenced to le in  for the killings of Marsha and Amelie, who were both killed after getting off a bus.

Last month, was claimed in a council review that Bellfield was part of a paedophile gang that targeted at least  vulnerable girls.  At least one was lured to a “raping room” in his flat, it is claimed. A report, compiled by a senior social worker, claims the other six members of the gang are still at large. The report was prepared by Debbie Weissang, previously child sexual exploitation manager at Hillingdon Council in west London. Bellfield, who has converted to Islam in prison and now uses the name Yusuf Rahim, hunted victims in south-west London and Surrey. Detectives believe he targeted some of his victims because he had been turned down by attractive women.

Greggs’ vegan sausage roll was so popular it sold out within hours in some veggie hotspots. As McDonald’s, Pizza Hut, TGI Friday’s and others join in, meat-eater Laura Connor and vegetarian Amanda Evans give their verdicts on the latest plant-based offerings… TGI Friday’s vegan burger pound. Meat-eater: This “bleeding burger” is designed to mimic rare meat. It looks weird and tastes bland, and isn’t a patch on a succulent bloody steak. My mushroom, beetroot and coconut oil patty was pale, floppy and failed to bleed… the only thing that could possibly have made it exciting. Vegetarian: Possibly the worst burger I’ve had – and since becoming a vegetarian at age , I’ve had some corkers. I couldn’t finish it. It was far too chewy and felt too much like a real burger. At my restaurant, I was the first to try it as it had only been launched that morning, and, boy, did I feel like a guinea pig. It is supposedly a “bleeding” burger, but which vegan or vegetarian wants to see blood coming out of a burger   Aldi Rainbow vegetable stewMeat-eater: This has four of your five a day and is ready in minutes. But I found the chargrilled shyvegetables in a sugary tomato and lentil stew unsatisfactory and unpalatable. Don’t bother. Vegetarian: You’re getting much of your five a day in one hit, which is great, but the tomato and lentil stew the veg sits in is a bit of a let-down. Aldi could have done so much more with this dish.  Greggs vegan sausage rollMeat-eater: I have no idea why Piers Morgan felt the need to throw up after eating this – it’s yummy. The Quorn-filled puff pastry is melt-in-the-mouth and the spicy filling hits the spot, just like the meat version. Vegetarian: According to staff at Greggs, customers have been going “crazy” for the new, no-meat roll since they introduced it last Thursday. Mine was steaming hot and fresh out of the oven. I liked the taste, and the consistency was appealing. Now I know what all the hype is about with their  layers of puff pastry.  McDonald’s Happy Meal Veggie WrapMeat-eater: Their first-ever vegetarian wrap Happy Meal, made with two red pesto goujons, red onion and relish, is delicious and filling. With a similar texture and taste to McDonald’s chicken strips, the kids will never know it’s not meat. And, at  calories, it has  fewer calories than the crispy chicken wrap. Vegetarian: The new no-meat Happy Meal left me feeling anything but happy. For starters, mine came in a paper wrapping which said “Chicken Wrap” on it. Secondly, the vegetable goujon inside was really dry and bland.  MS Plant Kitchen vegan range Roast Aubergine with Herby Grains , No Chic’n Nuggetsand Chilli Non Carne  RiceMeat-eater: From the  items available in the Plant Kitchen vegan range, I chose the very tasty and light roast aubergine salad and the soya No Chic’n Nuggets, made with a gluten-free crumb. A bit pricier than McDonald’s, but worth it. Vegetarian: I plumped for the Chilli Non Carne  Rice. It packs a punch with flavour. MS have come up trumps. Pizza Hut Jack ’n’ Ch**se pound. Meat-eater: It’s made with BBQ Jackfruit, which is supposed to resemble pulled pork. It’s not as juicy as pork, but it’s definitely tasty. The dairy-free, coconut oil-based cheese is less convincing and slides off the plate as a sticky, sweaty residue. No thanks. Vegetarian: By far the highlight for me and simply delicious. Jackfruit is the non-meat alternative people are talking about right now and with this tasty topping it’s not hard to see why. The barbecue sauce gives it that extra kick.

Sarah Gaffney-Lang had brain surgery while awake after she suffered a huge seizure in her sleep and was diagnosed with a brain tumour. The -year-old, previously fit and healthy, was given the diagnosis in October . Two months later she had radical surgery whilst awake, followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy which doctors warned would likely leave her infertile. To give her a shot at being a mum, she had time for one round of egg freezing before beginning treatment. However, incredibly, she fell pregnant naturally just three months after finishing chemotherapy and is now expecting her first child with her commercial director husband Matt Lang, .   Due in March, Sarah, a freelance copywriter from Manchester, said: “Finding out I was pregnant was a huge surprise. I assumed kids would mean carefully deciding on the right time to use the eggs that had been frozen, so it’s amazing it happened naturally. “Throughout my treatment, I lived le only thinking one step ahead, but now I need to train myself to think more long term. “Though I was worried about how my body would cope with pregnancy, I’m as stable as I can be and now can’t wait to meet him or her.” Sarah, who married Matt in Manchester with just two guests - their witnesses - during her treatment in , told of how she’d had absolutely no symptoms in the lead up to her seizure. After a day out at York races in August  she was asleep in a hotel room when she had a huge seizure. She recalled: “I had a big seizure in my sleep. I don’t remember the exact moment it happened, all I remember is coming to feeling really frightened. “There were loads of people in the room including hotel staff and paramedics. “Matt was also there, and while I was lucky it hadn’t happened when I was on my own, it must have been really distressing for him to see.” Sarah was taken to a local hospital and examined, before she was referred to a neurologist at Salford Royal, closer to where she lived. There, she underwent a number of tests, including an MRI scan, which revealed that she had a brain tumour. Speaking of the October  diagnosis, she continued: “I was really fit and active, and so the thought of cancer – let alone a brain tumour – never crossed my mind. It was a complete bombshell. “Doctors couldn’t say much at first. All they knew was that I had a tumour. They needed to do more tests to determine exactly what kind, and exactly what we were dealing with.” Further investigations confirmed that Sarah had a grade two glioma - one of the most common types of brain tumour. It was located at the back of her right frontal lobe - the part of brain that controls cognitive skills - affecting the area responsible for movement in the left hand side of her body.  Sarah said: “My memory of the surgery is actually really clear. I was put to sleep whilst they made the incision, then woken back up. They needed me to be awake and alert so they could do tests and work out what would be affectedthey removed certain areas. “I was chatting away about really normal things – my holidays, what I was having for dinner – while a huge team operated on me. “At the time, I felt like I was on a treadmill, just looking ahead to the next step in my treatment and what to do to get better. It’s only now I look back and realise how surreal it all was.” Unfortunately, during the operation, doctors discovered the tumour was more dfuse - meaning it had threadlike tendrils making it more dficult to remove - than originally thought. Its precarious position meant removing it completely could pose too great a risk of paralysis, and so the surgery was abandoned. “I could hear them talking about the paralysis risk, which was really scary,” she said. “Because I knew all that was happening, though, I came back round already knowing and accepting that the surgery hadn’t been able to remove the tumour as we’d all hoped.” After three weeks in hospital recovering, Sarah was allowed home, before launching into the next phase of her treatment in February  – a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Just before beginning, she was allowed to freeze her eggs in an attempt to preserve her chances of having children, but, due to the urgent nature of her situation, there was only time for one shot. “With everything going on, my fertility hadn’t even entered my mind, so I’m really glad the doctors bought it up with me,” she said. “I’d always wanted kids so it would have been toughI’d lost my chance altogether.” Throughout her journey, she has been supported by the charity Trekstock, which helps young adults in their s and s affected by cancer. Praising them for all they’ve done for her in her hour of need, she said: “When you spend your le in hospital waiting rooms, you don’t see a huge amount of young people, so it was great to find Trekstock and a community of people just like me. “I’ve been to several meet-ups, and they’re so fantastic and informal. It just feels like a group of friends on a day out - there’s nothing forced about it. “Everyone I’ve met has been really excited for me and my baby too.” Now preparing for her miracle arrival in March, Sarah is currently finished with treatment, and continues to undergo regular MRI scans to monitor her progress. She said: “Now, I just want to put my all into being a mum.” "},{"url":null,"title":"el chapo assassin used soundproof","story":"NewsEl Chapo assassin used soundproof murder room with drain for messy executionsAntonio “Jaguar” Marrufo killed rivals for Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzmans Sinaloa cartel, a jury was toldShareCommentsByChris kitching:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsA former US military member, identied only as Ivan, who worked for Edgar Galvan, a court heard \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOne of El Chapos hitmen had a murder room that was built for messy executions, a prosecution witness at the drug kingpins trial has said. Witness Edgar Galvan claims assassin Antonio “Jaguar” Marrufo killed people in a soundproof room that sloped towards a drain in the floor to make it easier to clean up afterwards. Galvan, , claims he worked for Marrufo, who controlled the Mexican border city of Juarez for Joaquin El Chapo Guzmans Sinaloa cartel. He told jurors at the trial in New York that he was taken inside the killing room, adding: “In that house, no one comes out.   Galvan said of Marrufo: “He took me once to a house, where the floor was just white, tiled. “That’s where he killed people.” It was unclear where in Juarez the house was located or how many people were killed there. Galvan said the hitman told him the house was soundproofed so no noise comes out, and he saw a drainage outlet on the floor of the white room, the New York Post reported.   Galvan told jurors that he was a cab driver who got involved in drug trafficking when he started hanging out in clubs after his orce. He claims he met Marrufo at a club and within four years was receiving shipments of drugs and helping him smuggle AK- assault rles and other guns into Mexico from the US for cleaning Juarez of rival cartels. Cleaning, he said, meant to kill all of the people so El Chapo, , could seize control of the area and its border crossings. Galvan claims he twice obtained a gun in a murder plot for Marrufo but denies pulling the trigger himself. He said he once stored a .-calibre rle for the cartel.  A photo shown in court shows one of Galvans workers, a former US military member named only as Ivan, posing with the huge firearm inside a home. Galvan - who lived in El Paso, Texas, just across the border from Juarez - told jurors he had never met Guzman until he gave evidence on Monday, and had once heard his voice as Marrufo spoke to him on the phone. He said he last spoke to Marrufo in  when police in El Paso raided the home of a friend who was storing  AK-s, a grenade launcher, bulletproof vests and ammo for the cartel. Galvan admitted to charges of possessing of narcotics and firearms after his own arrest in . He has  years remaining on a -year sentence. Marrufo was arrested in  and is in jail in Mexico. Guzman has pleaded not guilty to charges including firearms possession, murder conspiracy and importing and distributing cocaine. The trial continues.

The -year-old, who shot to social media fame last year thanks to her eye-catching selfies, captioned the image: Broken my neck. She also suggested she wanted to see how many fans would pray well. Sahar, who uploaded the image on Christmas Day, later shared another strange snap showing her peering out from behind a pillar. In the picture, she can be seen with very thin, fake limbs, which have been edited so that they are wrapped around the white structure.   The Iranian star has been likened to Hollywood actress Angelina due to her angular cheekbones, nose and hollow cheeks in her selfies. After going viral, there were claims she had undergone  surgeries and lost  kilos to get her distinctive look and mimic her idol. She attracted a lot of criticism - with some people comparing the young womans looks to Tim Burtons Corpse Bride character. Others doubtedher looks were real, or the result of digital trickery. After causing a flurry of Internet speculation Sahar apparently confirmed she had undergone a number of cosmetic surgeries. But she insisted she never wanted to look like A-lister Angelina. Speaking to Russian website Sputnik News , she said that although she had had some plastic surgeries, including rhinoplasty, liposuction and cosmetic procedures to give her fuller lips, her spooky looks were mostly down to make-up prosthetics and Photoshop.She said: It is Photoshop and makeup. Every time I publish a photo I make my face more fun. It is my way of self-expression, a kind of art. My followers know that this is not my real face.I had no interest at all to be like Angelina Jolie , and I did not want to look like the character from Corpse Bride.I understand that I do have some similarities with them, but I am my own muse and I did not want to look like anyone.  That was not my aim. Sahar previously took to social media to reveal what she actually looks like - and it couldnt be more dferent from her artwork.

So should you worry about pleasing all of your guests This is the debate one bride-to-be has started online after revealing details of her wedding on Facebook. The unnamed woman shared that she and her partner are both mathematicians and so would be incorporating mathematical tidbits into their wedding day. And its fair to say people who read the post were less than impressed.   A screenshot of the Brides Facebook status was uploaded to a Reddit Bridezillas thread and hundreds of people have since read it and responded. It said: Since both I and [partners name] are mathematicians, our weddingwill be perfused with mathematical tidbits. For example, at the dinner, guests will be required to answer a mathematical question in order to find our where they sit. Every guest couple will be presented with a unique, bespoke question - its dficulty and subject matter drawn directly from what we know their mathematical background to be. She went on to explain that many of the guests there on the day would have a research-level mathematical background - and some of the questions had even been taken directly from their research papers.   Despite the clear level of effort shed gone to people thought it was a bad idea to make maths mandatory at a wedding. One person commented: Upon looking into my background, they would likely decide to just sit me at the kids table. Another wrote: Math-shaming. My immediate RSVP would be a no.   A third added: It does sound perfect for THEM but I would decline due to a very likely mathematically-induced anxiety attack. Not everyone thought it was a problem though. A dferent Reddit user posted: My moms a mathematician and while she had a Disney wedding, I could see her doing this with absolutely zero malicious intent or creating a situation where someone is embarrassed. These two people both LOVE math and want a math-themed wedding, I think youre just assuming the worst because most people are a******* and some people use their intelligence to belittle others.

Finding someone you want to marry and have children with can be even harder - there are so many things to consider. But according to one woman, theres a very simple reason as to why so many men are opting not to get married and would rather stay single. And Im sorry to tell you ladies, that this person thinks its all YOUR fault. American bogger Lori Alexander has shared a controversial new post on The Transformed We, in which she aims to advise people on marriage, raising children and homemaking.The mum-of-four, who recently sparked fury with a chart comparing working mothers and stay-at-home mothers, has claimed men no longer want to get married because women are not chaste and have no virtue. She writes: Many men no longer want to get married. There are few virtuous women who want to help their husbands anymore. There are few women who want to have children and be the ones home raising them.There are few who are covenant keepers and understand that love and marriage are commitments and have nothing whatsoever to do with emotions and feelings.  She goes on to explain how she sees examples of this all the time with her friends children - very few of which are getting married and many of whom are putting off having babies. Women scare men these days, she continues. They can marry these men, refuse to give them sex and use it as a manipulation tool to get what they want, orce them when they are unhappy and take half of the mens wealth and their children. Its not a good deal for men. The real problem, she says is that these days young women arent being taught biblical womanhood because it clashes with their feminist mindset. Instead of being lively and confident, she feels women should be meek and quiet, shamefaced, modest and chaste.  Lori claims thata godly man can find a virtuous woman who possesses these qualities then she will be worth more than rubies. She adds: Women need to begin attracting men again, not in a sexual, feminist way but in a chaste, godly way. They need to learn to live sacricial lives instead of selfish, self-centered lives. They must learn the joy and value in giving their lives away instead of getting. They must be taught the selflessness of bearing and raising children full time. The mum finishes her post with a warning to the Church, telling them to wake up before marriage is dead.

She couldnt work out who could actually wear the black dress, and joked it could get her arrested for public indecency.   She shared a photo of the dress on social media, writing: Who on earth is this made for    People who want to get arrested for public indecency   The fashion brands Black Extreme Thigh Split Panelled Plunge Bodycon Dress also comes in red and costs just pound. The photo on the website shows it is extremely short, but the model is a lot more covered up than poor Jessica. The online description reads: Add this killer mini to your LBD collection for your new Saturday night saviour. Featuring an extreme thigh split and a plunging neckline, style it with some strappy heels and an oversized biker jacket for a killer look.   Shes not the only one who had an online delivery nightmare recently, and one woman said her New Years Eve celebrations were ruined when the wrong dress arrived. Brittany Colley said she was left in tears when she opened her Pretty Little Thing package to see that the completely wrong item had been sent to her. The -year old had bought a last minute outfit the day before which was due to arrive at her house while she was at work. She said: I was crying my eyes out because I didnt have anything to wear and yeah it was nothing alike and so disgusting, like I couldnt even wear what they had sent me.

The animal was said to have been rejected by its mother but then adopted by locals who are now caring for it. A clip appears to show the animal gasping for breath, although some have questioned it authenticity.  A source said: Ever since the calf was born, the people have crowded to see the bizarre calf. They are now considering it to be a miracle of God and have started worshipping it. The cow had been discarded by its mother and the women are feeding the cow. The people think that worshipping the cow is going to bring luck and prosperity to the family of whoever worships it.  In a similar case last year, footage emerged of a goat giving birth to ‘half-pig half-human’ creature.There were shrieks of horror when one of the strange-looking animals emerged from the goat. The two infants and the mother goat all died, sparking fears that the creature was a cursed mutant devil that brought bad luck.  Dr Agapita Salces of the Institute of Animal Science of the University of the Philippines said the foetus appeared to have suffered a genetic mutation in the womb. He added: It is a possible case of genetic mutation.It is also possible that the mother contracted a disease called Rt Valley fever from mosquito bites and this caused the impaired development of the infant.

The series of operations for their separation has been dubbed “Operation Freedom” and they are being looked after by the Hungarian team of Action for Defenceless People Foundation. Rabeya and Rokayah arrived in the European country on Saturday for diagnostic and preparatory examinations needed for the final operation which plans to separate their skull.They will have special plastic surgery which involves the implantation of tissue expanders.  A spokesman for the Hungarian Action for Defenceless People Foundation said: The first step of the three-stage surgery series, the separation of the conjoined vascular system of the twins’ brains, was carried out successfully with a so-called endovascular method by Dr. Istvan Hudak, neurosurgeon, during two operations at Dhaka Medical College Department of Plastic Surgery and Neurosurgery in Bangladesh in February and August . The arrival of the twins to Hungary was preceded by serious consideration, which resulted in the conclusion that the procedure of the expander insertion must be carried out under the best conditions from the medical point of view, using the most effective tools and devices possible.  He added: The plastic surgical part of the operation is coordinated by Dr. Gergely Pataki, Hungarian plastic surgeon along with a team of plastic surgeons from Dhaka Medical College.The “major surgery” of the final separation of the brain and skull will be led by Dr. Andras Csokay PhD, neurosurgeon of the Foundation, and that must be prepared by thorough examinations. Surgeons had previously warned they would have to wait two years before making a final decision on going ahead with the risky procedure.  Parents Taslima Khatun Uno and Mohammed, both teachers, didn’t learn that the twins were conjoined until after their birth. They were delivered by caesarean and spent two weeks in intensive care. Taslima said: “For their future it’s necessary to separate the girls – they are not having a healthy le. “If I don’t separate them now maybe in future they will ask why I didn’t separate them ” "},{"url":null,"title":"blether dundee boss bob shankly motored to aberdeen to sign john scott","story":"Jocky Scott is, rightly, a legend at Dens Park.

The aim is to play football regularly with the goal of helping United reach the Premiership and hopefully secure a longer deal.#Neilson said: #Aidan is someone I know well. I paid money to take him to MK Dons and his first season was excellent.#It hasn#t worked for him under a new manager down there, but I see him as the type of creative player who can help us produce more in the final third of the park.#Another possible target is midfielder Ian Harkes, who was recently released by MLS side DC United, where he’s been a team-mate of Wayne Rooney.Harkes, , is the son of former USA international John and qualies to play in this country because he was born in England during his father’s time with Derby County.By next week they could also be joined by former Tangerines favourite Morgaro Gomis. The  Scottish Cup winner has been training with the squad since hisfrom a spell in the Middle East.Other than -year-old Gomis, the manager has refused to identy any potential signings until deals are complete.Nesbitt#s arrival will move striker Craig Curran closer to a switch to team up with his former boss, Jim McIntyre, at Dundee.The Liverpudlian has not been a regular starter since switching from Ross County in the summer and, while he’s in contention for a place tomorrow,United make the signings they want, he’s likely to be allowed to go.“There’s interest in quite a few of the players and, obviously, Jim’s got a big relationship with Craig and we’ll see how that goes in the next few weeks,” said Robbie.“I really like Craig, he’ll be involved with us tomorrow and ultimately time will tell.”A number of players have already been told they are no longer part of the plans. Until departures are confirmed, Robbie would not name names.It’s believed, though, that one of them is defender-cum-midfielder Adam Barton, while winger Yannick Loemba is another who’s not likely to be seen again in tangerine.Since Robbie took charge in October, former Jag Barton has had just  minutes of game time via two sub appearances.He’s set to move back to England where he’s spent most of his career.Loemba’s time on the pitch has been even more limited under the new boss and amounts to a four-minute appearance against Inverness in October.Like Barton, the Congolese-born Belgian passport holder only arrived in the summer. With signings set to continue, there will be more departures.“It’s like anything in football, we need to move people in and we need to move people out,” added Robbie."},{"url":null,"title":"im embarrassed dundees darren odea apologises for feigning injury","story":"Dundee centre-half Darren O#Dea has apologised to Livingston and Jack Hamilton after being banned for two games for feigning a blow to the face.Livi striker Hamilton was sent off after a tangle with O#Dea during the goalless draw, but the red card was downgraded to yellow after an appeal.Dundee had not appealed the simulation charge by Friday#s pm deadline.#In the heat of battle I#ve reacted in the wrong manner to gain an advantage,# O#Dea posted on Twitter.#I#m embarrassed by it as it#s not the example to set.#O#Dea will miss the Scottish Cup tie with Queen of the South and the Premiership visit to Hearts.TV footage appeared to show Hamilton pushing O#Dea in the arm before the Irishman went down clutching his face.That has led the Scottish FA to take action against O#Dea for simulation.With Livingston having made an appeal, -year-old forward Hamilton was able to take his place on the substitutes# bench again in Saturday#s - defeat by Aberdeen."},{"url":null,"title":"no sulking for ryan inniss as he plots dundee return","story":"Things might not have gone his way since joining on loan in the summer but Ryan Inniss isn’t the type to sulk as he bids for ato the Dundee starting XI.The Crystal Palace loanee has struggled for game-time since manager Jim McIntyre took over in October, featuring just once since the start of November.That’s led to some expecting his loan deal to end this month but, under Fa rules, having played for Palace at the start of the season, the -year-old can’t turn out for another club this campaign.Despite not enjoying the best start to le in Dundee, Inniss insists he’s at Dens to play and will do all he can to do that.He told the Tele: “I’m here till the end of the season, I’m here to stay and I feel part of it.“I’ve played a few games and I feel part of the unit here, so I want to stay until the end and, hopefully, we can fight our way out of the position we are in now.“I take it day by day.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"man knocked down new years","story":"NewsMan knocked down in New Years Day hit and run as police appeal for witnessesA man was knocked down with the driver of a vehicle failing to stop following the incident in Tarbolton.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN NewsPolice are appealing for witnesses following the incident\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man was knocked down after being the victim of a hit and run attack in Tarbolton.

Vanessa Good, who heads up her own independent firm based in the town’s Newmarket Street, admits travellers need “far more clarity” over Brexit. But she this week laughed off the notion that flights will be grounded – leaving sunseekers stranded – when Britain takes a step into the unknown. It comes as fears grow that a ‘no deal’ Brexit will spark chaos at Britain’s borders and lead to untold problems for travellers. Vanessa, , who bosses the Good Travel Company, said: “There’s no doubt people are on edge at the moment. “Our customers are still coming in to book holidays in the usual numbers, but there is understandable concern. “The problem is we’re seeing so much political scaremongering and it’s hugely unsettling at a time we need far more clarity.” Vanessa, whose firm employs seven across two sites and also specialises in currency exchange, insists her team is trying to issue a note of calm to holidaymakers. She said: “We have people flying out to EU destinations on March , which is the day after Brexit, and they’re perfectly relaxed about the situation. “Others are more concerned so we’ve seen some look to other destinations as a result. “After all, the world is a lot bigger than Europe, and there will definitely be a knock-on effect in that regard. “Market experts say a no-deal will have a negative impact on the pound, and that is obviously something that nobody wants to see. “But the idea that they start grounding flights and nobody can move anywhere seems a bit far fetched. “Uncertainty will always be the biggest crippler and that is the problem facing the industry just now. “But our message to people is to continue booking their holidays as before. “In reality, it is changes like the new EU visa coming into play in , which will cost around seven euros every three years, which will be the biggest dference.” An ABTA spokesperson said: “The European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, flights will still operate between the UK and EU. “ABTA is providing holidaymakers and travellers with advice about Brexit and travel, including on pet passports and driving licences, which can be found at abta brexit.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEuropean UnionAyrHolidaysAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13808455.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_shr_ayp_281218weight2.jpg","title":"woman lost weight after deciding","story":"NewsWoman lost weight after deciding to do something before it was out of controlThe -year-old has whittled herself down to  stone  pounds - after getting too close to the  stone barrier.ShareByStephen Houston:,  JAN NewsDeborah Biggar \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHer name is a headline writer’s dream. For Deborah Biggar has just got a whole chunk smaller. The -year-old has whittled herself down to  stone  pounds - after getting too close to the  stone barrier. Deborah, of Dalmellington, revealed a Multiple Sclerosis diagnosis meant she was put on steroids at age just . Even after the first round of steroids she put on two stone. And she said: “I realised I had to do something or my weight would soon be out of control.” She’d kept active as a community support officer and loved horse riding - but had to get out the saddle as her mobility reduced.   Deborah said: “Riding was something I absolutely loved, and also walking, and with this loss of regular activity, I was definitely going to be up against keeping the weight off.” She took the plunge and joined the Coylton branch of WW . She revealed: “I turned up alone and felt very apprehensive. “Due to my illness this wasn’t an easy thing for me to do, as I can be very self-conscious and don’t often go many places on my own, but I needn’t have worried.” Class wellness coach Kellie Brown and her team quickly put Deborah at ease, and she has now only missed one workshop since joining.   During her battle her weight has snowballed up and down as her medications changed. She said: “I am delighted with my weight loss so far as I am feeling much better, not just physically, but I think more importantly, mentally I am in a better place. Going out I do not feel as self-conscious and my confidence is now a lot better. “I went to my nephew’s wedding a happier and much more confident and content person, and looked forward to it, instead of dreading going. “This is all thanks to Kellie and the group I attend at Coylton and this time I will be continuing to attend workshops to help keep me on track.” She tracks calories with an online WW app as she trawls supermarket aisles.   Deborah said: “I love the fact there are so many zero smartpoint foods, and I eat out quite regularly. As long as I track everything and make sensible decisions, I can still lose weight no problem. I sometimes choose what I’m having before I go with the help of my app. I don’t have a sweet tooth so saying no to desserts and cakes is an easy decision for me.” Fatty foods like chips and fried meals have been swapped for fruit, veg, chicken and home-made soup. Trips out are now anxiety free. She revealed: “I am no longer thinking that people are thinking she is only using a stick or scooter because she is fat but they actually see I have a disability. “With my weight loss I am on the list for the Riding for the Disabled Association, and my fingers are crossed.” "},{"url":null,"title":"readers-photo","story":"This photo of Yarrow Kirk was sent in by BorderCamera Club member Aileen Allan.

He says one of his proudest achievements is seeing how the site has transformed the way it operates ndash and ensuring it becomes a green as it can.The -year-old, who lives in the town, said: ldquoTreating waste uses a lot of energy,you think about what we are dealing with and the dferent processes it has to go through you get an idea. Added to that this site operates round the clock every day, so it needs a lot of power.ldquoWe take our environmental responsibility very seriously here, even down to recycling items like cans and bottles and packaging in our kitchens.ldquoAnd one thing we have started doing is working with our neighbouring works to ensure that the sludge dry solids are as high as possible when they arrive at our site -ndash to save on energy use, reduce our carbon footprint and minimise vehicle movements.ldquoThings like this can make a real dference. The imported sludge is mixed with the on-site, indigenous sludge. This feeds the digestor which produces the gaswhich is the fuel for the  kW capacity CHP.ldquoWe are very green-aware here and proud of what has been achieved, so much so I have made signs reminding us of how self-sufficient the site is.ldquoI also thought it would be a good idea to let people in the town and the many people who visit here know about our achievements and it was decided a plaque highlighting how energy efficient we are would be a good way to let people know.Another addition to the site is a collection of items that have been put down toilets which enter the sewer network in the town these include a number of rubber ducks,  teeth, plastic toy figures, tennis balls, a dogrsquos chewy toy and ious sized toy cars.Fudge said: ldquoWhether these things have been put down accidentally or not they can block our drains and do real damage to the network. So we do urge folk to be careful what goes down their toilets and sinks.ldquoBut it is baby wipes which are our biggest headache these days, the number of items put into the sewer is unbelievable.ldquoThey do not break up ndash where do people think they go  They just clog up our machines and causes blockages that can lead to flooding and bursts.ldquoOne of my biggest hopes for the new year is for more people to get the message that they have to be more careful what they put down their loos and sinks, be that baby wipes or sanitary products or fats and oils and grease.More than  of Scottish Waterrsquos water and wastewater treatment works are either self-sufficient or partly sufficient in their power requirements, leading to lower operating costs and a more sustainable business.Galashiels is one of the top five that offset most of the sitersquos use as well as being able to export to the gridndash others include Glencorse Water Treatment Works, near Edinburgh and Loch Turret Water Treatment Works in Perth and Kinross.Simon Parsons, Scottish Waters director of strategic customer service planning, said: ldquoTo keep the cost of our services as low as possible it is essential we develop our approach to energy management and continue to reduce our carbon footprint.ldquoWhere appropriate, like at Galashiels, wersquore exploring opportunities to export energy to the National Grid, showing that itrsquos possible to maximise the economic advantages of Scotland water resources in the spirit of a Hydro Nation and contribute to national renewable energy targets.ldquoScottish Water is committed to continuing to reduce its energy bill and further increase renewable generation ndash and Galashiels is a wonderful example of what can be achieved.Three years ago Borders College in Galashiels became the first organisation in the UK to benefit from a waste water heat recovery system, installed in partnership between Scottish Water Horizons and Shark Energy.It extracts the natural warmth contained in waste water in the sewer and transfers the heat to the clean side of the heating system via a heat exchange mechanism. The recovered heat is then amplied via pumps to generate appropriate temperatures for use in buildings.The heat produced is being sold to Borders College producing savings in energy, costs and carbon emissions. The system now provides around  per cent of the heat needed by the Galashiels campus.Earlier this year Scottish Water achieved a major energy milestone when it was announced the amount of renewable energy the company generates and facilitates is now more than double its electricity consumption. It now generates and hosts  Gigawatt hourper annum of renewable energy - enough to power more than , homes for a year."},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-woman-loses-six-stone-at-slimming-club","story":"A GALASHIELS woman who lost a staggering six dress sizes is encouraging people to join her in dropping the pounds.Jacqui Porteous decided  was her year to lose weight and has so far managed to sht a whopping six stone after signing up to her local Slimming Word class in Galashiels.Jacqui said: ldquoI joined Slimming World after I saw photo of myself that made me realise how overweight I was, as well as how much my health was deteriorating.

herself as she sat down on the frontbench.Ms Perryrsquos comments came as Shadow Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy minister Laura Pidcock raised the issue of household debt, arguing it was at its ldquohighest ever level.In response, Ms Perry branded the TUCrsquos research ldquodiscredited and then went on to claim the Government introduced the National Minimum Wage before later amending this to Living Wage.Speaking during Commons BEISquestions, Ms Pidcock said: ldquoNew research from the TUC said household debt is at its highest ever level, with average debt per household now over pound,. Itrsquos blatantly obvious what the cause is, itrsquos years of austerity and wage stagnation. Millions of workers are now reliant on borrowing, making up for low wages by increasing their debt.ldquoNot for holidays or luxuries but for example using credit cards for everyday essentials like nappies and food, which is so stressful.ldquoCan the minister please explain what the Government is doing to address this crisis and why those on the benches opposite refuse to join the Labour Party in advocating a real minimum wage of at least pound an hour and ato serious collective bargaining for workers in the UK.Ms Perry replied: ldquoI heard the news reports of this particular analysis, I also heard that it had been entirely discredited because it includes student debt which is not something that accrues to every household and actuallyyou strip that out the rate of accrual of household ndash would she like to listen rather than chunter, Irsquoll carry on ndashyou actually look at that stripping out student debt which does not accrue to every household, then you see that the growth of consumer credit has actually slowed.ldquoAnd once again I am very proud to stand up here and represent the Government that finally did what her Government which had  years to not do, which was to introduce a National Minimum Wage and ensure that it goes up well ahead of inflation.Raising a point of order following the question session, Ms Pidcock pointed out the error, stating: ldquoThe Minister of state under her breath mentioned the Living Wage which of course in practice there is no such thing, but of course the minister could correct the record that it was indeed the Labour Party which introduced the Minimum Wage in  which her party strongly opposed.Ms Perry responded: ldquoMr Speaker, sorry Irsquom blaming the excitement, of course Irsquom happy to correct the record. Shersquos absolutely correct the Labour Party introduced the National Minimum Wage.ldquoIt was quite clear that that was inadequate for many people on the lowest incomes particularly women who were underpaid which is why we introduced the National Living Wage, something I wish she would support..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Minister says sorry after claiming Tories introduced the National Minimum Wage"},{"url":null,"title":"the 21st centurys final teenage year","story":"Last year the rout of retail continued.

curriculums independent of each other.A recent inspection by Education Scotland found a gap in the literacy and numeracy performance of children coming into P.The new school will follow a single

part were in favour of the proposal, with  per cent against it.And it was revealed that while the parent council of the infant school was for the merger, the same body from the primary school had

We now look forward to the merriment of Hogmanay! These days in between, traditionally known as the Daft Days, are my favourite of Yule time.Yet not so long ago the most popular focus of festivity was neither Christmas nor even Hogmanay, it was Handsel Monday.It fell upon the first Monday after New Year, although there was some dispute as to the exact Monday it should be celebrated, for some measured the date by the old calendar.This was the case for the country folk in East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire as it was then known. So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made. Mothers and fathers hugged tightly their grown children as they prepared to set off back to their employment. Old and new friends from near and far, who had come to share the day, parted to their duties.They would have to wait another year for the next Handsel Monday gathering. Who knows what fortune and fate would have in store before that time:ldquoFor freends were met whom morrows gales\"Wad waft apart les course on\"Anither year, and maybe neer\"Again while times flood roars on,\"Might they eer meet, or even greet,\"This fickly warls shores on,\"Tho here this day!And yet it was to be Handsel Monday itself whose fate was sealed, as it faded in importance compared to Hogmanay and its traditions of gt giving and family time overtaken by Christmas.It has became part of our Auld Lang Syne, yet its spirit is perhaps now spread over a thankfully longer time of winter festivity.Happy New Year, when it comes.With thanks to Electric Scotland website for the copy of the poem."},{"url":null,"title":"man-caused-disturbance-at-tranent-opticians","story":"Paul Donaghue behaved in a threatening manner and repeatedly shouted and swore at MontgomeryOptometrists on the townrsquos Bridge Street.Donaghue, of Main Street, then began throwing papers around the shop and refused to leave the premises when asked to do so by staff.The -year-old also stole a toy from the Tranent Paper Shop and a quantity of foodfrom a nearby Greggs shop.All the offences took place on November .Donaghue then told police officers his name was James Davidson in an attempt to evade arrest and he was prosecuted for perverting the course of justice.He also pleaded guilty to being in possession of a screwdriver on the same day.Donaghue appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court,where sentence was deferred for reports to next month."},{"url":null,"title":"new-council-houses-planned-for-ormiston","story":"Proposals submitted by East Lothian Council for  new homes in the village will be scrutinised by its planning department.The site, which would be made up of one, two and three-bedroom properties, is off Tynemount Road and forms part of a wider development of the area which includes  new homes by developer Walker Homes.The development would consist of four one-bedroom ground-floor cottages four one-bedroom upper-floor cottages six two-bedroom ground-floor cottages six two-bedroom upper-floor cottages  three-bedroom end-terraced houses five three-bedroom mid-terraced houses one two-bedroom bungalow and one three-bedroom bungalow.A council spokesman said the local authority was investing pound million in new council housing over the next five years.He added: ldquoThis development would provide a mix of dferent house styles, providing high-quality accommodation for families and iniduals, contributing to the outcomes set out in our local housing strategy by increasing the supply of affordable housing.ldquoWhile a small number of the new properties may be made available to a housing trust for rental opportunities, the majority of the new homes built will be offered as council housing.ldquoFollowing a number of applications for market housing on the site this detailed application is for the development of affordable housing on the site.Scott Gillies, chairman of the villagersquos community council, welcomed the potential of council houses being built.He said: ldquoWithout a doubt it is welcome."},{"url":null,"title":"unique-new-features-for-new-elphinstone-playpark","story":"Pupils at Elphinstone Primary School were given a choice of three potential options for a replacement playpark on the villagersquos Buxley Road.A vote was taken, with an option chosen to create a playpark with two features which will be unique to East Lothian.The first of those is made up of three D hexagon structures which have foot and hand-holds and are designed for climbing on.The second is a raised disc which youngsters can run on.The rest of the park is made up of familiar playpark favourites, including swings, a slide, seesaw, flying fox and climbing net.Elphinstone Community Association has been busy working with East Lothian Council on the project for nearly a year.Now they are hopeful the playpark, which it is estimated will cost about pound,, could be in place in the spring.Stuart MacKenzie, chairman of the villagersquos community association, said: ldquoI think it is fantastic.

The storyteller smiled and nodded: ldquoYes we all have dreams of being rich, but rich in what  Rich in love and happiness, or rich in money and things ldquoItrsquos the same, said one child. ldquoI donrsquot think it is, said another, looking at the storyteller. ldquoIs it ldquoThat is a good question, replied the storyteller, ldquofor sure having too little money is not a good thing. And the world is an unfair place where those who have too much money and too many things keep it to themselves, so those who have too little money never get their fair share, even though there is sufficient for everyone to have enough.ldquoSo I want to be one of those that has too much! declared one member of the class, to laughter.ldquoAndso would you share what you have with others who do not have enough  asked the storyteller.The child paused for a moment for thought: ldquoMaybe some of it.Other children voiced dferent opinions. ldquoIrsquod keep it all, ldquoIrsquod share it, ldquoIrsquod give some to my family and friends.It created some discussion amongst the children.The teacher was going to ask the children to be quiet and listen to the storyteller, but he indicated he was happy with what was happening.ldquoBut then yoursquod end up being poor again, said one. ldquoNo, Irsquod not give it all away.ldquoBut the whole point of being rich is that you can do what you want.ldquoWell, it also means you can help other people.The storyteller listened to the debate for a minute or two, then he beat his drum to regain the childrenrsquos attention.ldquoAnd so, for most here, money will be your dream. I understand that. Nobody wants to be poor. But lots of money is not really your dream.A chorus of: ldquoYes it is!ldquoNo, replied the storyteller, ldquomoney is not your dream, it is what you spend it on, what it might make possible for you that you do not have now, that would be your dream. That is what you must think of before you set out on your quest.ldquoBecauseyou pick the apple of your dreams, but have no dreams for your le, then you will still be poor, evenyou have all the money in the world.ldquoThatrsquos just stupid, said one boy. The teacher was quick to remind him not to be rude, but the storyteller asked him: ldquoWhat is stupid ldquoWhat yoursquove just said, you canrsquot be pooryou are rich, that doesnrsquot make sense. Thatrsquos what I meant is stupid.The storyteller smiled. ldquoPerhaps you are right, but do you think sometimes people can also be poor in things that money canrsquot buy There was silence for a moment. Then a girl said: ldquoYou mean people can be poor in dreams for their le The storyteller smiled and nodded.ldquoPrecisely, said the storyteller. ldquoThe whole issue of getting rich has stopped us thinking about what our dreams actually are.ldquoI want to be a dancer, said one child. ldquoI want to drive fast cars, said another.ldquoI still want to be rich so I donrsquot have to do anything and just play computer games.ldquoI want to make the computer games, said his friend. ldquoYeah, me too, agreed his pal.ldquoI want to be the President! another said.ldquoI just want to be happy!The storyteller beat his drum again.ldquoAnd so before you set off on your quest you must think about your dreams. And let me tell you that dreams can be shared too.ldquoHowrsquod you do that  he was asked.The storyteller thought for a moment: ldquoWell, for some their dream may be to save an animal that is in danger of being extinct.ldquoOr save the planet, called out another.ldquoThatrsquos why I want to be President.ldquoSo I want you to think about your dreams, and once you have you got your dreams you are ready for your quest into the forest, said the storyteller.The children assembled their thoughts and soon everyone had a collection of dreams to take with them to the apple tree.ldquoThere is one more thing I forgot to tell you, said the storyteller. ldquoItrsquos an important piece of information. You see, when you finally get to the clearing you must be very careful, for wrapped around the base of the ancient apple tree there is a ferocious dragon.ldquoIt sleeps, but very lightly. It will wake when you approach the tree. It will hear you no matter how quiet. It will hear your heartbeat. And there is no place to hide in the clearing. The moment you approach the tree, the dragon will pounce on you.ldquoCan the dragon fly  asked one.ldquoYes.ldquoAnd breathe fire ldquoYes.There were murmurings.ldquoAnd so, the storyteller continued, ldquoyou must decide how you will overcome and defeat the dragon. It is there to stop you reaching the apple of your dreams.Some of the children came up with immediate ideas:ldquoIrsquod run as fast as I could in zig zags.ldquoIrsquod distract the dragon.ldquoIrsquod shoot the dragon with a gun.ldquoIrsquod make a giant kite and fly to the apple.ldquoIrsquod take some friends and feed them to the dragon while I get the apple, then dream my friends back again.There were many solutions and the storyteller listened to them with interest. Each child came up with a dferent strategy.The storyteller nodded, explaining the powers of the dragon that it couldnrsquot be killed by bullets or blades or fire, that it was faster than lightning and once it had heard you and seen you it would go for you.ldquoKnowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams They all said yes, refining their ideas.And so once the children had come up with their final strategy, the storyteller asked them to think about what they might need to take with them to defeat the dragon. They will have to carry these things through the forest, or perhaps collect them on the way.Then the storyteller set the children the task of drawing the things they would need and then the dragon and apple tree. In drawing the apple they would have to decide what the apple of their dreams would look like.When this was all done, the children settled down to hear who had the right answer.ldquoI have looked at all the ideas, said the storyteller. ldquoWhat I must say is that le is unfair and so is this quest. For some, the journey through the forest will be longer than others. The dragon will be more dficult to defeat for some than others, as its mood changes. But you have all come up with the same answer, and so you are all right.There were howls of protest.ldquoNo, we didnrsquot we all have dferent answers!The storyteller beat his drum again to calm the children.ldquoWell yes, you all have dferent ideas on how to defeat the dragon and reach the apple, that is true. But you all have the same answer to the most important question.ldquoWhatrsquos that  the children asked.ldquoWell, said the storyteller, ldquoI had told you how fierce and dreadful the dragon could be. And then I asked youknowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams.ldquoAnd you all said yes, yoursquod try to reach your dreams, even though you had a big fight on your hands.ldquoThat, I believe, is the right answer. You may have dferent ideas on how to get that apple, but yoursquore all right because each of you will have to fight the dragon in a dferent way. The most important thing is your determination to get to that apple.ldquoWhatafter all that we fail  asked one child.ldquoYou might, said the storyteller, ldquobut on your journey to your dreams you may find a new path that leads to another ancient tree without a dragon.ldquoTherersquos another magic apple tree without a dragon !ldquoPerhaps, perhaps not. But the only way to find out is set off on the journey with determination in your heart. You might realise on the journey that your dreams are easier to reach than you had thought, or it could be the other way round.ldquoBut the most important thing is to have your dreams and find ways to reach them.The storyteller finished his session. He left the children with their dreams and their strategy to reach them.Happy New Year and good luck in defeating your dragon, and reaching your apple."},{"url":null,"title":"salon-owner-astonished-as-sign-to-be-torn-down","story":"Anna Mather moved her business from grade C listed premises in Gford into a grade B listed building on Haddington High Street last year.The switch has allowed her successful hair stylist team, who were named Scotlandrsquos Hair and Beauty Salon of the Year, to take on larger premises as they moved into the converted George Hotel building in the centre of town.But Ms Mather was stunned when East Lothian Council planners wrote to her to say that her shop sign, which is the same as the one she had at Gford, would be forcibly removed in a few weeksrsquo time.Ms Mather said: ldquoI contacted planners about the sign when we moved in and was told that, because it is plastic, it is the wrong material for the building, even though the shops across the road use the same type of signs.ldquoWe had gone to great s to ensure it was mounted properly to avoid having to screw it into the wall of the building and it is the same as we had at our previous salon.ldquoI appreciate it is a grade B listed building and am happy to meet requirements but when I asked for advice about what materials I could use they said they could not tell me.ldquoI have to apply for planning permission but, without knowing the material I can use, it will just be rejected and cost us money.ldquoNow they have written to say they are coming to forcibly remove the sign on January  and will charge us for the work.ldquoWe are a new business in the town and cannot afford to have these types of expensive bills.

for energy and clean growth Claire Perry was met by cries from the Opposition benches following her comments at the despatch box, but swtly corrected herself as she sat down on the frontbench.Ms Perryrsquos comments came as Shadow Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy minister Laura Pidcock raised the issue of household debt, arguing it was at its ldquohighest ever level.In response, Ms Perry branded the TUCrsquos research ldquodiscredited and then went on to claim the Government introduced the National Minimum Wage before later amending this to Living Wage.Speaking during Commons BEISquestions, Ms Pidcock said: ldquoNew research from the TUC said household debt is at its highest ever level, with average debt per household now over pound,. Itrsquos blatantly obvious what the cause is, itrsquos years of austerity and wage stagnation. Millions of workers are now reliant on borrowing, making up for low wages by increasing their debt.ldquoNot for holidays or luxuries but for example using credit cards for everyday essentials like nappies and food, which is so stressful.ldquoCan the minister please explain what the Government is doing to address this crisis and why those on the benches opposite refuse to join the Labour Party in advocating a real minimum wage of at least pound an hour and ato serious collective bargaining for workers in the UK.Ms Perry replied: ldquoI heard the news reports of this particular analysis, I also heard that it had been entirely discredited because it includes student debt which is not something that accrues to every household and actuallyyou strip that out the rate of accrual of household ndash would she like to listen rather than chunter, Irsquoll carry on ndashyou actually look at that stripping out student debt which does not accrue to every household, then you see that the growth of consumer credit has actually slowed.ldquoAnd once again I am very proud to stand up here and represent the Government that finally did what her Government which had  years to not do, which was to introduce a National Minimum Wage and ensure that it goes up well ahead of inflation.Raising a point of order following the question session, Ms Pidcock pointed out the error, stating: ldquoThe Minister of state under her breath mentioned the Living Wage which of course in practice there is no such thing, but of course the minister could correct the record that it was indeed the Labour Party which introduced the Minimum Wage in  which her party strongly opposed.Ms Perry responded: ldquoMr Speaker, sorry Irsquom blaming the excitement, of course Irsquom happy to correct the record.

Like the Ides of March, Britains fate must be sealed on Brexit day in only  weeks time.Will May finally win parliamentary support for her Withdrawal Deal  Will she be ousted in a cabinet coup  Will there be a repeat referendum  Will Britain end up revoking Article   These are the options, broadly speaking. About the only thing that seems pretty certain to me is that there will be no General Election and no ldquoNo Deal Brexit. I simply cannot see parliament or the country accepting the chaos, cost and potential suffering of crashing out of the European Union without any negotiated settlement.True, planes wouldnt fall out of the skies and trade would continue, somehow, but the disruption would create enormous stress. There is a strong possibility of food shortages, and people with medical conditions would suffer needless anxiety over medicine supplies. The fact that the Government is preparing to put the army on the streets and ports testies to the risk of civil disturbance. There would be a hard border in Northern Ireland overnight and a resumption of sectarian tensions. Small firms would go bust and big firms would leave.So, I am confident that MPs and ministers will prevent this happening,necessary by removing Theresa May and forming the equivalent of a wartime coalition. Working back from that the most probable outcomes look like: Revoking Article  or Mays Withdrawal Deal. And, it will be Labour, not Theresa May, the Tory Brexiters or the DUP, who decides which.Brexiters hate the Withdrawal Deal, which they think chains Britain to the EU, and Jeremy Corbyn does too ndash and for rather similar reasons. He thinks the state aid rules would prevent a Labour government nationalising the utility companies, and also believes that a permanent backstop would give Britain ldquono say on any future trade deals. Mays Withdrawal Deal should therefore be defeated by around - votes.Corbyn will then finally table that motion of no confidence in the government which he delayed in December. May will assuredly win that vote, because the last thing Tory MPs and the DUP want is general election, a Corbyn government and an even worse deal. May will now have won confidence votes from her own MPs and from the House of Commons. That will make her immovable ndash at least for the time being.Armed with this she willto Brussels and stage another televised spat with Jean-Claude Juncker. The  will probably have something  up their sleeves . Perhaps Michel Barnier will propose amending the Political Declaration to include a -month limit to the Irish backstop. This was dropped from the final draft of the December communique.The  could also extend the transition period making a commitment that negotiations must be concluded by March . This is already in the Political Declaration, but it could be built into a firm commitment and subject to independent arbitration. The Irish backstop would thus become a last resort and triggered only in the event of a total breakdown of time-limited trade negotiations.This will be the moment of truth for Labour, as Theresa May brings her amended deal back to the Commons in February. The hardline Brexiteers and the DUP will not be persuaded because the legally-binding Irish backstop will still be there in the Withdrawal Agreement. The future will be in Labourrsquos hands. Many pro-Europeans tell me that Corbyn will at this point ldquopivot to a referendum, voting down the Withdrawal Deal a second time, and backing a cross-party amendment for a Peoples Vote.But while he doesnt accept Mays Withdrawal Deal, still less Norway Plus, nor does Corbyn favour remaining in the European Union. Before Christmas, he caused widespread dismay among pro-Europeans by confirming that, evenhe were to win a general election, Labour would still be committed to Britainrsquos departure from the European Union.The Labour leaders instinct will surely be to secure concessions from Theresa May on the future trade negotiations. A closer alignment with the single market and a permanent customs deal, is what he wants. To get her business through, she would surely end up agreeing. Deal done. Britain leaves as planned. Pro-European Labour MPs would rebel, but that would be unlikely to scupper the governments pro-Withdrawal majority.Alternatively,Jeremy Corbyn stands firm and pivots to a referendum, there will be unprecedented turmoil in parliament, not least over what the question should be. Theresa May will stand down and there will be a political vacuum. As the clock ticks down to Brexit day, a new parliamentary party could emerge: the Europe Party, uniting all the pro-Remain MPs, and dedicated to a second referendum. The choice for voters would be Revoking Article  or No Deal. Mayrsquos deal, it seems to me, would be a dead duck by this stage.By Revoking Article  Britain would retain its opt-outs from the euro and its budget rebate and there would be no disruption of trade. It would be asBrexit never happened. Brussels would happily delay Article  for a referendum. However, this referendum would be like an offer voters canrsquot refuse, because MPs in the ldquoRemaniac Coalitionwould have to resign en massethe country opted for No Deal.It would be terrible campaign, exactly three years after the original referendum, with the far right raging about immigration. It would take years, decades for the bad will to subside. But faced with the prospect of a chaotic No DealI suspect voters would back Revoke. There is nothing undemocratic in having a final say. Parliament has failed to find a credible formula for leaving the EU. The only way end this agony and confusion is for Britain to accept that Brexit is just too costly, too dficult, too unpredictable and too all-consuming. The message would be: For Gods sake, lets just stop this madness and get our lives back."},{"url":null,"title":"Today   s feminist activists are wrong to exclude men","story":"Anne Widdicombe might have dismissed it as trivial and whingeing ndash and some #MeTooers undoubtedly deserve that label ndash but the culture of sexual harassment and abuse it calls out is far from unimportant. Equally crucial are other issues that have vexed women for decades,not centuries, among them equality of pay, professional respect and opportunity.So far, so reasonable. Yet, when I heard Mary Robinson, former President of Ireland, talking last week about Mothers of Invention, a podcast she has set up that focusses exclusively on womenrsquos efforts to address climate change, my heart did a double skip: one for delight, two for despair. Delight that women are getting involved directly in trying to help reduce our carbon footprint, without a doubt the most urgent of the worldrsquos ails, but despair at Robinsonrsquos smug assumption that ldquoitrsquos women who change behaviour, in the family and the community.Letrsquos put aside for a moment the fact that, as Robinson reveals in her recent book, Climate Justice, her own awareness of environmental calamity dawned on her like a Damascene conversion astonishingly late in the day. What sets my teeth on edge is the sanctimonious way in which women are increasingly frequently being portrayed ndash mostly by other women. Itrsquos asthere is a collective halo that needs constant polishing, lest it lose its lustre. Indeed, it seems you cannot these days be a female in a position of influence or authority without feeling the urge ndash or the pressure ndash to add a stone to the cairn of womenrsquos rights, entitlements and endeavours.Donrsquot misunderstand me. I am an old-style feminist, and decry utterly the unfair, oppressive and sometimes iniquitous treatment of women in our and other societies. Men have an awful lot to answer for, today and in the past. But I get decidedly uneasy at the perceptual ide that appears to be widening between the sexes. Climate change, said Robinson, is ldquoman-made, and she enjoys using the term, even though admitting it embraces men and women. But apart from this deliberate provocation, is she really correct in assuming that women change attitudes more widely than men Maybe it depends on what sort of country yoursquore living in. When I look around the UK, I donrsquot recognise that stark distinction. Plenty of men seem to be trying to bring about green change, ethical enlightenment, societal improvement, better childcare and education, and are working towards this alongside women. Sometimes, for heavenrsquos sake, they are even taking the lead.Meanwhile, children in two-parent families are open to influences from both parents. While women still tend to spend more time with their young, this does not necessarily equate to a more lasting influence on their behaviour or outlook. The other day my husbandrsquos granddaughter rushed to interrupt her mother who was on the phone to announce that Liverpool had just scored a fourth goal against Newcastle ndash whose influence was that We are going through a phase where almost every interview with a woman politician or banker, entrepreneur or artist, includes the obligatory question about #MeToo, in the same way that every American is asked their opinion of Trump. And while it obviously takes women at the top to help bring about change for those lower down the ladder ndash or in the community at large ndash it is surely not a sacred obligation placed upon each of them. To assume that is to be sexist and discriminatory. Itrsquos certainly not an expectation placed upon men.Yet to listen to some womenrsquos outrage, yoursquod think therersquos a contract, signed at birth, that insists women pay especial attention to female issues eventhere are things that interest them more. Florence Nightingale and Elsie Inglis personally helped save hundreds of lives, and their influence rippled down the decades to the benefit of all, women as much as men. Yet their initial impulse was not to improve things for their own kind, but to help wounded soldiers and the sick and dying. In other words, to improve the conditions of humanity as a whole, not one gender or the other.Of course splinter groups and special interest parties can make things change ndash just look at Dr Inglisrsquos formidable all-women hospitals. There is a galvanising power and collective spirit in female solidarity that nobody can deny. So letrsquos hear it for women tackling climate change. And for men too.In these unsettling and perilous times we surely need to remember that we are all just people. Our identity is not primarily male or female, trans, intersex, other, or whatever label fits. We are simply and essentially human, with all the complexities of personality, type, and biases that entails.

The Morandi Bridge fell in to a river in August, killing  people and crippling the local economy. Italy has been engulfed by a scandal over under-maintenance every since.The RAC Foundation is not saying that there are similarly dangerous structures on Scottish or UK highways. But it did say the maintenance backlog included checks on post-tensioned or PT bridges using similar technology to the Morandi.These PT bridges require intrusive inspections that can cost pound,. Almost a third of the  PT bridges managed by Britainrsquos councils have not had this test carried out in the last  years, despite requiring it.The latest study also found that some , bridges in the worst condition have been categorised as ldquosubstandard, meaning they are unable to carry the heaviest vehicles. That includes  bridges in Scotland.RAC Foundationrsquos Mr Gooding stressed that many of the these structures were old stone rural bridges, but weight restrictions came with costs.He said: ldquoAncient bridges on rural back roads might not be the highest priority for repair, but the risk we run is that substandard structures on some roads result in heavier vehicles having to make y detours.Bill Barker, secretary of SCOTS, the body that represents council road engineers, stressed that substandard bridges were not unsafe. Some  per cent of council bridges are subject to such weight restrictions and some  are scheduled to be upgraded over the next five years.Mr Barker said: ldquoThe design le of a modern bridge is  years - and many Councils have ldquoheritage structures - many of Thomas Telford bridges, built in the early s are still carrying traffic.He added: ldquoThe recent history of ever deeper cuts to Council funding will obviously have affected bridge maintenance as it has other infrastructure maintenance. However, each council will have had to make current decisions against ahistory of previous decisions. Those decisions affect current condition.Only  bridges on trunk roads managed by the Scottish Government are substandard, about one per cent of the total. Some remote highways still have stone-built crossings, such as the listed th century Aray bridge on the A near Inveraray."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit-has-strengthened-case-for-scottish-independence-says-nicola-sturgeon","story":"The First Minister said Scotlands interests are being \"completely ignored and sidelined\" and that what has happened in the last two years has reinforced the case for it to leave the UK.:Nicola Sturgeon raises expectations of second vote on Scottish independenceMs Sturgeon would not be drawn on timings around an independence referendum, saying she would wait until this phase of the Brexit process concludes.However she said there is a mandate to have an independence referendum within this term of the Holyrood parliament and that \"there is every right on the Scottish Government to fulfil that mandate\".Speaking on BBC Good Morning Scotland, she said: \"Everything that has happened over the past couple of years, from Scotland facing exit from the EU against our will to every reasonable attempt at compromise to protect Scotlands interests by the Scottish Government being spurned, to the powers of the Scottish Parliament being eroded, to the UK Government even taking the Scottish Government to court, all of that has strengthened and reinforced the case for Scotland to be independent, because these are not just academic arguments, all of this will have a material impact on Scotlands economy and well-being for decades to come.\"She added: \"The case for independence is materially strengthened from an already strong base in  because of all of the experience of Scotland in the last two years.\"We were told in  that it was voting for independence that would put in peril our membership of the European Union.\"Because we didnt vote for independence, we now not just find ourselves facing exit, the voice and the interests of Scotland are being completely ignored and sidelined.\":Poll: Clear majority of Scots say independence better than Brexit. @NicolaSturgeon \"The case for independence is materially strengthened from an already strong base in  because of all of the experience of Scotland in the last two years.\" pic yoVgmtsqPrime Minister Theresa May has warned that the UK will be in \"uncharted territory\"her deal is rejected in next weeks crunch vote. expected on January .Ms Sturgeon said there is \"clearly no majority\" to crash out of the EU without a deal and that holding another referendum on the issue should be the alternative.She said: \"I hope the meaningful vote does go ahead next week so that MPs can once and for all say that they dont support the Withdrawal Agreement, and then the House of Commons can coalesce behind the alternative, and in my view that alternative now should be to have another EU referendum.\"I think we will need to see the Withdrawal Agreement voted on in order for MPs to coalesce behind an alternative.\"I dont take for granted that there is a majority for that, but the SNP will be part of building that majority andwe can get Labour to finally come off the fence then we will be closer to building that majority.\"Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said there is no appetite among the people of Scotland for another independence referendum.He said: \"One of the experiences of Brexit has been just how dficult and painful it can be to break away from a union, even one that has been place for just  years.\"A union that has been in place for  years would, in my view, cause considerable economic disruption and there is no appetite from the people of Scotland for it.\"So I think the First Minister should take the earliest opportunity to rule out a second independence referendum.\"Scottish Conservative deputy leader Jackson Carlaw said: \"Today Scots are heading back to work at the beginning of a new year, but Nicola Sturgeon is stuck in the past.\"As at the start of , , , and  her priority is to rerun the referendum of .

It defines the phenomenon as ldquoactions that interfere with a womanrsquos reproductive intentions and any actions that pressurise a woman into initiating or terminating pregnancy.Primarily carried out by intimate partners, it can also be perpetrated by the wider family and in organised crime, with young people and ethnic minorities particularly vulnerable.Actions include emotional blackmail, threats of violence, pressure to continue or end apregnancy or to not use certain types of contraception.It also includes ldquocontraceptive sabotage, such as a male partner ly saying they have had a vasectomy, piercing condoms before use, or ldquostealthing, where a condom is covertly removed during sex.Some women may not have insight into their relationship, especiallythere is no physical or sexual violence, as they may become inured to the control being exerted on them.Describing how it could manest, Mr Rowlands said: ldquoI think it is like a spectrum, at the worst extreme end there probably is violence and extreme things going on like food deprivation, on the other end itrsquos really just a kind of psychologically controlling atmosphere ndash keeping tabs on everything the woman is doing, maybe being restrictive over when she goes out.However, Mr Rowlands said that, for many women, the issue was not being raised during consultations. He said there were no UK guidelines or advice for health professionals, the majority of whom ldquowere not terribly aware and would not be thinking about raising this.Health professionals who were conscious of it were responding on an inidual basis to inidual patients, he said.The report is calling for screening to take place in maternity, sexual and reproductive health and abortion services and GP surgeries, with a set of questions already devised.Professionals should be alert to its possibility.

Millport has been judged Hidden Scotlandrsquos most beautul town and its Newton Beach one of Keep Scotland Beautulrsquos best beaches since, with its gleaming toilets helping clinch the awards.Yet despite the stellar work being done by Cumbrae lsquoCludgie Cleanerrsquo Suki McGregor, who not only ensures the facilities are kept pristine but promotes the island in YouTube videos too, the group has turned to crowdfunding in a bid to raise the pound, needed for its survival. Running toilets is an expensive business, you see.But is it an expensive business that the public should pay for from the good of its heart through donations of time or money, or should our publicly funded bodies continue to foot the bill  A decade on from the advent of former prime minister David Cameronrsquos Age of Austerity, we all know money is tight, but Irsquom still willing to argue itrsquos the latter.It goes without saying that the loss of public toilets sends a negative message to the visitors our rural communities depend on in order to thrive. Itrsquos one thing throwing money at advertising campaigns whose romanticised vision of our hills, glens, food and drink is designed to lure tourists in, butthey canrsquot access even the most basic of services once they get here theyrsquore hardly likely to give us a glowing review.Andwelcoming holiday-makers isnrsquot your thing, think on this: without easy access to a public loo many elderly members of our communities, whose social interactions have already been curtailed by the automation of pension payments, the closure of local banks and the soaring cost of a cup of tea, may well give up on venturing down the town altogether. Consigning the elderly or infirm to their homes rather than finding ways of ensuring they can remain a part of the community is hardly the mark of a civilised society.And that, really, is the crux: far from being a simple inconvenience, the loss of public lavatories serves as a reminder of just how uncivilised our society has become. From streets smeared with dog dirt to towns left without libraries, the symptoms are everywhere. The narrative might be that by closing toilets councils are cutting back on a service they are not legally obliged to provide, but the wider story is that after a decadersquos worth of austerity-led budget cuts we have been reduced to accepting the budget version of civic le.The latest manestation is the introduction of fees for school music tuition, a move that is to be derided not just because it separates out the rich from the poor but because it implies that only the former are deserving of enriching experiences. In West Lothian alone, , school kids have dropped out of music lessons since an annual fee of pound was introduced. If that isnrsquot a wake-up call that austerity isnrsquot working, what is On its website the Cumbrae Community Development Company states that ldquoa community that cares about its public toilets sends out a strong message about the type of community it is. Our communities keep sending that message, about their toilets and so much more. Itrsquos time that those in power started to listen."},{"url":null,"title":"is-jermain-defoe-past-it-heres-what-the-stats-say","story":"Celtic have already brought in Oliver Burke and Timothy Weah on loan and are seriously interested in Ivorian striker Vakoun Issouf Bayo. At the other side of Glasgow, Rangers have signed Kilmarnockrsquos Jordan Jones and Dundeersquos Glen Kamara on pre-contracts and have brought in Steven Davis and Jermain Defoe to help with their title tilt this season.:Write off a silverware hungry Jermain Defoe at your peril, says Rangers boss Steven GerrardDefoersquos move has been arguably the most eye-catching signing in the Premiership so far in January and has sparked debate over whether or not the -year-old still has what it takes to compete at this level. Wersquove decided to take a look at the Englishmanrsquos stats to see exactly what Rangers fans can expect from their new man.Defoe has always been seen as a natural goalscorer and with  goals in the English Premier League itrsquos not hard to see why. The ex-Spurs striker is the seventh-highest goalscorer in the competitionrsquos history and has spent almost the entirety of his career in Englandrsquos top flight.The graphic above charts Defoersquos goals per  minutes in league football since the   season and the results make for impressive reading. Even during the forwardrsquos worst season in front of goal, in  , he was still averaging . goals per  mins, or around a goal every four gamesyoursquod prefer. This is hardly prolic, of course, but it isnrsquot a poorin such a demanding league.:The Bulletin: Gerrard Further signings depend on moving players on | Hibernian keen on Lewis MorganPerhaps unsurprisingly, Defoersquos best goalscoring campaign came in the   season when he was playing for MLS side Toronto but of the  seasons hersquos spent in Englandrsquos top flight, Defoe has averaged more than a goal every two games on seven occasions. Even as recently as  , the forward was scoring . goals per  - a figure not to be snfed at.By analysing Defoersquos scoring rate over the last  seasons, we can see that there are peaks and troughs but - much to the encouragement of Rangers fans - there is no sustained period of clear decline. Yes, Defoersquos goalscoring rate has dropped in the last two seasons but there are a couple of mitigating factors here. Firstly, that during   Defoe was tasked with banging in the goals for a truly dreadful Sunderland side that looked destined for relegation from the opening day. And secondly, that last season at Bournemouth he was a bit-part player, often coming off the bench and rarely given a run in Eddie Howersquos starting XI.If we take Defoersquos average goals per  minutes over the last three seasons as a representative sample, the figure we arrive at is .. Itrsquos important to point out that these are goals scored in the English Premier League, where the standard is higher than the Scottish Premiership, yet even going by these numbers it appears Defoe will have plenty to offer to Rangers during his time at Ibrox.:Rangers boss Steven Gerrard calls for respect to be shown towards referees after Old Firm fall outA more in-depth look at Defoersquos numbers reveals that the veteran strikerrsquos role has been changing in recent seasons. Where Defoe has traditionally been characterised as a goalscorer, we can see that as age catches up with the -year-old, his style of play has evolved.We can see that Defoersquos goalscoring has dropped signicantly - particularly last season when he wasnrsquot featuring regularly for Bournemouth - but other aspects of his game have actually improved in recent campaigns. While the English forward is scoring fewer goals and hitting fewer shots, his accuracy has increased to the point where the majority of his efforts on goal are on target.Interestingly, Defoersquos expected goalshas remained fairly consistent during this time, implying that hersquos still being given the same number and quality of goalscoring opportunities during any given match, but hersquos converting fewer of them. This may be slightly worrying for Rangers supporters, but they can take heart from the fact that Defoersquos team play has improved over the same period. The number of key passes - passes that lead directly to a shot - that Defoe averages more than doubled last season and the number of touches that hersquos taking in the opposition box has also risen.Defoersquos dribbling has suffered at the same time, however, with the number of attempted dribbles per  minutes dropping from . to . and with good reason in  , around % of the forwardrsquos dribbles were successful, but that figure plummeted to % last season.All in all, then, it looks as though Defoe still has plenty to offer and should prove to be an important player for Rangers during the second half of the season. Gerrard has already asserted that Defoe is ldquoa very young -year-old and that the striker ldquohas a shape to die for in terms of how he looks after himself in response to questions about age creeping up on the forward. The stats suggest that, naturally for a player Defoersquos age, there has been a drop-off in some aspects of his game, but his goalscoring record throughout his career suggests that he wonrsquot struggle to find the net this season. Whether or not Defoe has what it takes to make it in Scotland remains to be seen but there are plenty of reasons for the Rangers support to be optimistic about his arrival."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-to-close-brexit-debate-next-week-in-last-ditch-bid-to-rally-mps","story":"However, a key bone of contention is likely to be at what point MPs hear of the fresh concession expected from Brussels.The Prime Ministerrsquos spokesman indicated that any new assurances would come before the vote, rather than before the start of the debate, which takes place tomorrow and which will be opened by Stephen Barclay, the Brexit Secretary.AskedMPs would have a period of time to debate Brusselsrsquo expected new offer, he replied: ldquoI would anticipate that would be the case, yes.Read more: MPs call on Theresa May to rule out no-deal Brexit as she seek fresh guarantees from BrusselsHowever, politicians from all sides are likely to be very unhappy at the prospect of resuming their debate for four days only to learn about any new concession on the final day of debate and just hours before the vote.Earlier, Leo Varadkar, the Irish Prime Minister, said the EU was \"happy to give\" the UK fresh assurances over the Northern Irish backstop, declaring: \"We dont want to trap the UK into anything.\"Speaking to the , the Taoiseach said there was currently \"close contact between the UK and EU institutions on whether a further set of written guarantees, explanations and assurances could make a dference\".He went on: \"Bear in mind, a lot of the opposition to the Withdrawal Agreement and the backstop might be based on suppositions and misunderstandings about our intent as a European Union.\"We dont want to trap the UK into anything we want to get on to the talks about the future relationship right away.

He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.*WHEN the grey dawn broke over Normandy on June , , Don Mason had already made the first of his two contributions to the momentous events of D-Day. The young airman was part of the six-man crew of a modied Stirling bomber that had dropped  paratroops and their equipment at Ranville under cover of darkness. Heading for home, the Stirling came under fire from anti-aircraft guns on the French coast but ed unscathed to its base at Fairford in Gloucestershire. In the early evening the same crew were back over Normandy, this time towing a glider with more troops destined for the original dropping zone ndash and by this stage, almost  hours after the start of the Allies seaborne invasion, the full enormity of Operation Overlord was clear to see. \"It looked like a scene out of a nightmare,\" Don now recalls.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.\"We had been in No.  Group Bomber Command,\" says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. \"The whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.\"He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. \"We had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogether... it required a lot of dferent techniques.\"And it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore youd got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.\"There developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.\"On one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnt just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.\"That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.\"Obviously we knew something was happening,\" Don says, \"because we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werent aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.\"The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. \"Before that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.\"Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: \"One thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!\"Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Dons chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as \"Piccadilly Circus\" ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.\"We were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place,\" he explains. \"It was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.\"Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. \"They all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.\"In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. \"He released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one,\" says Don.\"There was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnt a great deal of resistance.\"It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crew-mates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: \"The Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.\"You couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnt want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.\"Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  \"Well, everybodys scared ndash I dont care what anyone says,\" he replies. \"If youre not scared you dont perform, but its discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .\"This is rude, I know, but its what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Its a matter of accepting whats going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job youre supposed to do.\"Its not a question of bravery. Im very suspicious when people say, Oh, youre a brave man, or Youve got a lot of courage. You react to circumstances. Its a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.\"And I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when youve got a unorm on and youre acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.\"So Im very suspicious about bravery. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I dont think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I dont know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.\"Don can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.\"I fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhams Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating,\" Don says. \"He had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a mans wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.\"But the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thats what I did.\"He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash \"I went to Arnhem five times during that debacle,\" says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until .He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crew-mates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.\"Although our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand,\" says Don. \"In  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnt got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hed said, Id love to see my old mate again. So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.\"Now you cant explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Its what they call camaraderie. Im still in touch with his family.\"As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash \"theres no doubt about that\". But he adds: \"I regret to say I dont think weve learned any lessons. I dont think we should be doing what were doing now [in Iraq].\"As I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Its not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Its a sad reflection on society, I feel.\"We ought to be very thankful that were free, because thats what it was about. We should remember that this country wouldnt be freeit had been overrun by Nazi Germany.\"It was all for a cause. People may say, Oh, thats patriotic nonsense. But it isnt.\"* This is a slightly edited version of an interview first published in the John OGroat Journal of June , .Tuesday  Jan  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"More festive frustration for Wick Academy as Formartine snatch victory in stoppage time","story":"Wick Academy  Formartine United Formartine United took advantage of a late red card to Danny Mackay to hit an injury-time winner and consign Academy to a second defeat over the festive period.The Scorries struggled to create any clear chances but defended resolutely and the game appeared to be drting towards a goalless draw before Graeme Rodgerrsquos late strike.Manager Tom McKenna made two enforced changes to his side, with Ross Allan and Andrew Hardwick replaced by Gordon MacNab and Craig Gunn. Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

More information is given on the Scottish Government#s website, here.Publishing the payment schedule, rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing said: “As we approach the commencement of the New Year, I want to provide farmers, crofters and other rural businesses with as much clarity and certainty as possible.“I am therefore confirming that we intend to keep to the proposed CAP payment timetable published in our stabilisation plan, which outlines when farmers and crofters can expect to receive their CAP entitlements.“By doing this, we are offering clarity and certainty over when payments will be made, demonstrating stability in our payment system, while enabling farmers and crofters the opportunity to plan ahead accordingly.”The president of the Scottish farmers union, NFU Scotland, Andrew McCornick said the timetable will be valued by farmers and crofters, particularly following a tough year for agriculture in Scotland.Mr McCornick: “Confirmation that balance payments for Pillar  schemes will start in March, and payments for coupled support and LFASS starting a month later, will allow many businesses to now plan their cash flows on that basis.#Many farmers are extremely reliant on these scheme payments and their timing so the payment calendar will allow farmers and crofters to carefully plan for the year ahead. Any delay in the timetable with an important scheme like LFASS, would merit Scottish Government considering another loan scheme as a contingency, as it has previously.“Successive loan schemes have been invaluable in addressing cash flow concerns but the continued need for loan schemes demonstrates that confidence in the SGRPID system to deliver prompt payments in the future is still an issue. The move from loan schemes to direct payments and other schemes meeting set payment deadlines will build trust within the sector in the post-Brexit era and aid the organisation and planning of farm businesses in uncertain times.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They’re all numbers, my lot. I’m a complete anomaly. I’m a words person.”Shakespeare, poetry, Ted Talks, and over the phone too she’s a wizard wordsmith, but ask her about insider trading, stocks and shares and hedge funds and she’s stymied. No matter because what she CAN do is act, and it all adds up in her latest role in ITV’s Cleaning Up, in which she stars opposite Sheridan Smith as a pair of down-on-their-luck cleaners who find an ingenious,illegal, way of playing the system. The result is a darkly amusing tale of have-nots at the bottom of the social pile fighting back, using the same methods as the have-it-alls they clean up after in Canary Wharf, a tale about modern Britain with zero hours contracts and with strong female leads. Cleaning Up, written by newcomer Mark Marlow, and directed by Lewis Arnold Humans, Broadchurch, Misfits, Banana centres on the friendship between Anouka’s character Jess and Sam, played by Sheridan Smith. The actors hit it off at the audition, lending an ease and authenticity to their performances.“Sam and Jess have grown up together and Jess is the voice of reason, someone who thinks before she does, which Sam doesn’t, so they’re a good match. Jess tries to keep her out of trouble.”It’s not easy to stay out of trouble when you’re hard up and the pair are tempted to take a gamble, much like the financiers in the shiny offices the invisible army cleans overnight. “It’s about who deserves to get away with stuff,” says Anouka. “Being the underdog you feel you’ve got to look out for yourself andyou’re living hand to mouth, one mistake has massive repercussions. Seeing people get away with it, you’d feel like, ‘why shouldn’t I ’” “It puts the spotlight on the everyday people, the ones working hard to pay their bills, not living the high le, which is most of the country. It’s good to see people like that fighting back.”“I think a lot of people will just love Cleaning Up. When I watched it I was thinking about all the people I know and thinking ‘my dad will love this’ and that it really is one of those shows you will sit down and watch with your family, it’s brilliant.”Anouka is no stranger to cleaning up from when she worked in pubs and cafes to supplement her acting income, starting out. Last year was the first she’s made a living through acting alone.“When I was starting out there were times when I had three jobs. If I wasn’t auditioning or learning lines I was always working. I would wake up and go shoe shining, then in the afternoon work in a pub or cafe, then in the evening in a call centre, so it’s quite full on. There’s no chill time. That’s what you see in Cleaning Up, that these characters are always working and never get to relax.”Surprisingly, the bar work or call centre jobs are not the ones that come to mind when Anouka recalls her worst ever job.“Oh God, I was a children’s entertainer when I was at drama school,” she says, still scarred. “I did parties and face painting and that was fine, but it was before I had satnav on my phone and I’d get completely lost trying to find the houses so I’d be late. And I’d look ridiculous, in a yellow car carrying a red suitcase wearing green dungarees or a tutu and having to run into petrol stations to ask directions. Then turning up in tears because I was late and ruining their day.” The children’s “No, the parents, oh my god. The children don’t care, they don’t know you’re late. They were all fine. But the parents were so stressed, and I just wanted to burst into tears but you can’t come in dressed as a clown and cry. It was so stressful I had to stop.” Anouka has been making a name for herself on stage and screen, with the airing of last year’s psychological thriller Trauma, for ITV, with John Simm and Adrian Lester and The Donmar Warehouse’s All-Female Shakespeare Trilogy in , as well as cult hit Chewing Gum in .This last year has been busy for the  Screen International Star of Tomorrow, working on three productions, two theatre and one film. She took the lead as Queen Margaret at the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester, a composite of Shakespeare’s lines for Margaret of Anjou, a character he gave more words than any other, including Cleopatra and Rosalind, across four history plays. This production saw Anouka reassert Margaret as warrior queen, cutting a swathe through patriarchal power struggles in a re-telling of the Wars of the Roses, and at the same time waging a contemporary war on the historic gender imbalance in Shakespeare performance. Earlier last year she went forward in time to a dystopian world where blood quality can decide your credit rating in The Phlebotomist, and as well as Cleaning Up, she made the film, Fisherman’s Friends. Starring Tuppence Middleton and James Purefoy, it’s a feelgood tale of Cornish fisherman who land a record deal singing sea shanties, due out in March. She’s a familiar face north of the Border too, having won a Fringe First for her one-woman show Chef at the Traverse in  and the film of Donmar Warehouse’s Julius Caesar was up for best feature at the Edinburgh International Film Festival. “Incredible,” says Anouka, “considering it’s a live theatre recording. But Phyllida [Lloyd, the director], is also a film director so she knows what she’s doing. It’s quite special.”Born and raised in Greater London, Anouka is the middle of three children to a Jamaican father and Trinidadian mother. An athlete, she ran for Kent but got the acting bug at school and won a scholarship to the National Youth Theatre while at sixth form college in Lewisham.“Everyone there was going ‘yeah, I’m gonna be an actor, I’m going to drama school’ and I was ‘going to drama school  What’s going on ‘ere ’ Then after that I was like, “Oh, OK, I’m going to do this, it isn’t just a hobby, this is what I want to do.’” Guildford School of Acting followed and from there to the RSC, making her debut in  in Margaret Atwood’s Penelopiad. More theatre followed then TV with parts in Lucky Man and Doctor Who, before she landed the role in Trauma, ITV’S follow up to Doctor Foster, requiring her to learn how to rock climb. On stage, the Donmar Warehouse set her star rising too. Set in a women’s prison, the Trilogy of Julius Caesar, Henry IV and The Tempest, prompted Lloyd to hire an all-female ensemble cast of all ethnicities and ages to re-invigorate the Bard. Within a decade from first working in theatre Anouka was playing traditional male leads Hotspur, Ariel and Marc Anthony delivering the “Friends, Romans, countrymen…” speech.“It’s funny because I never liked Shakespeare when I was younger,” she says. ”But when I left drama school I got an interview with the RSC, ended up being there for two years and fell in love with it. And Shakespeare was where people started doing colour-blind casting. Everyone does Shakespeare at some point in this country and we need to look at why those plays should still be done, why they are relevant. So many seem quite modern in their themes – in a scary way I guess it’s history repeating itself.”She might be a words woman but Anouka likes a piece of the action too, and she played Hotspur as a kickboxer, preparing for the part by studying videos of Olympic boxing champion Nicola Adams, and training hard. “I grew up watching boxing with my dad, but they were big heavyweight guys, so I watched Nicola Adams, hours and hours of videos, how she trained. She even copied the Muhammad Ali shuffle. It was great fun, a great way to keep fit and I’d like to do it again. But I never sparred, not that, no-one’s coming near my face!” She laughs.Anouka writes and performs her own poetry, some of it published in her collection Eggs on Toast, and admits to sometimes finding it easier to express herself through poetry than through acting. She would love to combine theatre and poetry, her two loves, into a lyrical theatre piece, at the same time as popularising poetry by making it ‘less stuffy’. “With acting I find it often much harder to express what you want to say because you have less control over what’s going on. I started writing poetry a long time ago because I could use it to have my own voice, whereas in acting, obviously you try to take work that you think is good and represents you, but you don’t always have that luxury. So poetry is a way of being creative and having an outlet when you are not working in something that’s creatively interesting or fulfilling. And between jobs, I always have to do something that’s creative.”It was to her poetry she turned when she was invited to do a Ted Talk last year, reciting a poem she wrote that was inspired by Maya Angelou.“I’ve always thought of Ted Talks as being very intellectual, where you have to have a great invention or know about a particular topic so I wasn’t sure whether I deserved to be doing it or what I should do, but I thought what an honour! And I decided to speak from my experience, so it was ‘Being Black, being a Woman, being ‘Other’ and hopefully that strikes a chord with others, everyone who has felt Other.” And it felt natural to put poetry in there.” Anouka went on to talk about her crowdfunding a screening of Black Panther, the  black superhero film now tipped for an Oscar, for kids in her local area of Peckham because she thought it was an important film for them to see, a film that reflected the ‘other’ and underscored the belief that everyone was entitled to fulfilment and a voice no matter their creed, sexuality, culture or gender. “I couldn’t believe how much we raised. So much more than I expected that I’ve got a bit of money left over. We extended the screening so many more kids got to see it and I’ve given money to charities who work with young people, but I really want to do another film screening. That film was such a special thing, so it’s hard to know what the next film to do that for would be. But I’ll definitely do it again.” As for ersity, Anouka feels inspired by the changes she sees in the acting world, citing Sophie Okonedo, who recently won an Evening Standard Best Actress Award for her performance with Ralph Fiennes in Antony and Cleopatra. “She works in film, TV and theatre, which is a dream of mine. And she was in Undercover with Adrian Lester, who is a legend.”It was Lester who presented Anouka with the Ian Charleston Commendation Award for Shakespeare for Under s and having followed his career ever since, she was delighted to play his daughter in Trauma.“I think things are changing, definitely on stage particularly, it’s going in the right direction, but you can always do more. I think theatre is ahead of TV and film in this country, but I see it improving and more exciting stuff coming out.” “Queen Margaret was an example of that. Rather than just re-telling Shakespeare, it changed the lens we’re looking through, so it was all through Queen Margaret’s eyes.”Having played three of Shakespeare’s great male roles Anouka would love to take on more. “God there are so many. Loads of good ones!” she says and laughs. “I’d do LOADS of them! I’ve said before I’ve wanted to play Hamlet. Obviously it was written as a male role, but I see the character, not as a male character, but as a young adult, not quite knowing how to deal with grief and finding out about relationships, romance, all of these things coming in at once. It very much feels like showing somebody turning into an adult, and it’s something I would love to do before I get too old.”Anouka doesn’t talk about her age in a bid not to be tied down to age specic roles, witness her convincing teenager in Trauma. Similarly, she doesn’t talk about who she shares her south-east London flat or le with, apart from rescue dog Evie, who is possibly half Yorkie half Bichon Frise, “I’ve never seen another dog like her, so we’re waiting for a DNA test, just to see,” she laughs.As someone who has been in Doctor Who twice, Anouka has nothing but praise for Jodie Whittaker’s take on the Time Lord. “I wasn’t the right age for it when it came back – it was my little sister that watched it, but then I was in it and I thought gosh, it’s brilliant, are they all like this  And it’s not just brilliant entertainment, but important to watch, like the Rosa Parks episode. School children should all have to watch that episode, it was a great history lesson.”“And it’s important when you’re growing up to see things reflecting of your le, someone who maybe looks a bit like you, and more and more we need someone to do exactly this, be bold like Doctor Who and then the impact is going to be enormous. You realise how little it happens, because when it does, you see the impact. Cleaning Up’s like that, full of women leads, and you just don’t see that.” Next up, Anouka is in the new Idris Elba comedy, Turn Up Charlie, a series of eight half hour episodes for Netflix. She plays a DJ who is an arch rival to Elba’s character, a failing DJ working as a nanny to an out of control -year-old. “It’s nice to be doing comedy. Cleaning Up has humour in it but it’s lighthearted and heartwarming and sometimes dark, rather than actively trying to make you laugh. But this is more of a comedy and it’s out next year, so that’ll be good. Often people don’t think of me for comedy because I’ve done a lot of Shakespeare on stage and stuff, but I like it. I’d like to do more.” And since she’s as much about words as action, we’ll give the final one to Anouka and the call to action with which she ended her Ted Talk and summed up her attitude to inclusivity and embracing the Other in all of us: “When you get that chance, that opportunity, that seat at the table, get creative. And remember to pull up another seat for the next person.” @JanetChristieCleaning Up begins on Wednesday \u2028 January, ITV, pm©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4852804.1546945424!/image/image.jpg","title":"cameron wyllie is difference between private and state schools 3 200 per pupil","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...State education needs radical changes that will cost more money, but it will be worth it in the long run, writes Cameron Wyllie.Sorry, teachers, but it’s time to change our schools.I started teaching in  which now seems as foreign a time in education asI were, at , a Dickensian schoolmaster, bearing my cane and my mortar board while boys chanted Latin verses and dreamt of scoring sixes. In these, getting on for , years, Scottish teachers have been battered by change and so much of it doesn’t seem to have done any good. The one thing that is very much better is the quality of teachers themselves –we all think back to the past, so many of our teachers were truly terrible, making the ones that were good shine out like diamonds.All this change – to policy, philosophy, curriculum, guidance, structure, the exams – good grief, it’s been exhausting, and I speak as someone who taught his entire career in the independent sector and was therefore a bit shielded from it all. Note I say “independent” rather than “private”. Make the analogy with hospitals – in a private hospital more or less the same thing happens as in an NHS hospital – the private room will have nicer lighting and the food will be better and the treatment more immediate but you are really there for the same reason. With schools – and this in increasingly true – independent education is actually offering a dferent product. Yes, the facilities might be better, the class sizessmaller etc but the actual process is also dferent.: Cameron Wyllie: Face the facts, some kids are just smarter than othersSo, sorry, colleagues, but I think it’s time for radical change in Scottish schools, because things as they stand aren’t very good. They are all right. They are not disastrous. But, as the papers have been full of recently, the stresses and strains on these bright, committed and well-qualied teachers are taking their toll, with record numbers of people leaving the profession.Everyone hoped that when the Scottish Government rightly made education their priority and John Swinney was appointed as Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills things might perk up but so far, not much has happened. I don’t believe that the Government’s laudable aim of closing the poverty-related attainment gap can happen as things stand without a national conversation on education which actually consults with pupils, parents and teachers, and with my usual modesty, I’m going to make an early intervention in that conversation.What gives me the right  I have never taught in a state school apart from one glorious teaching practice in  for three weeks at James Gillespie’s which was scarcely a sink school either now or then, having at that point just stopped being a private school itself. I am not what you would call an ‘educationalist’, and I am not an academic I am really a retired schoolteacher who has passed his entire career in two excellent private schools.However, I am a taxpayer, and on that basis I should be able to talk about anything my tax is being spent on. Given that Scotland still holds on to the shreds of a proud educational history, this golden time in Scotland’s past which still comes up in conversations with people from other countries who say “of course, Scottish education is so good” when there is increasingly scant evidence of that, there is a public duty as a citizen to be concerned about education.: Cameron Wyllie: Education isn’t all about intelligenceIndependent education costs money, of course – while many schools have generous bursarial schemes, most people who send their kids to independent education are shelling out vast lumps of their taxed salaries. At the school I last worked at, the average family was paying about £, a year for their son or daughter’s education. However, state education is not, of course, free. The average expenditure on a secondary pupil in Scotland is now £, a year.So what I would like to do in my next few articles, is examine the ways in which I think state education could be improved, and I am going to try to do that through the lens of the education system I have worked in while at the same time keeping a close eye on budget. That said, I do not believe that very signicant changes can be made to education in Scotland without there being greater expenditure on it, and I think that,the public were convinced that such changes would benefit the school population of Scotland and its economy, it’s a charge they would be willing to pay.I think a very strong argument can be made thatthere were radical changes made to Scottish education now, the budget would reap the benefits in later years through reduction in expenditure in health, in social security and in criminal justice.There are three broad areas I would like to suggest are ripe for change. I accept fully that such root changes could not be quietly phased in – it would be necessary for them all to happen simultaneously and probably to begin for a generation of pupils as they embark on formal education.These three aspects are firstly, the way that our schools are structured, which I believe needs to be changed so that our young people are offered a much more erse range of educational options secondly, the curriculum they are offered, which similarly needs to be a great deal more flexible and much less bound to academic qualications and the route to university, and finally, ‘ethos’ – that rather evanescent and dficult work which headteachers bang on about endlessly and which really means some combination of any school’s ‘mission’ – how it goes about providing an environment in which the students can learn including pastoral care and discipline.Teachers –they have time to read these pieces in between marking, preparing, teaching, form-filling, CPDand collapsing from stress – will reasonably sigh with disbelief that someone sitting on the retirement thronecan suggest such wholesale changes. But something big needs to happen in Scottish schools, something positive, child-centred and actually about education, and it needs to happen soon.Cameron Wyllie, a retired headteacher, publishes a blog called A House in Joppa.

That will now happen. “As I reflect on the last dficult months, I am mindful of three things. “First, that this process was completely unnecessary. Over the last year my legal team repeatedly offered the Scottish Government legal arbitration to resolve any complaints, and to establish the illegality of this process, without the need for such a damaging and expensive case to come to Court. “To my great regret, all such proposals were rejected, leaving me with no choice but to bring this matter to the Court of Session. “As a result, Leslie Evans, the Permanent Secretary, has wasted huge amounts of public money in an incompetent attempt to enforce an unlawful process.“Now, having incurred those costs to the public purse, she has collapsed the case prior to a full hearing. “Secondly, the Scottish Government’s conduct in this case as an institution has unquestionably lacked candour. “Officials repeatedly failed to disclose documents to the Court which were of central importance. Those documents ultimately made clear the apparent bias and procedural unfairness which has only now been admitted. “As a former First Minister, I find that conduct entirely unworthy. Those documents remain confidential as part of the court process, for now. “But in my view they reveal a clear and obvious breach of the principles of fairness and natural justice.“It is a matter of great personal sadness that I have had to bring the Scottish Government to court simply to ensure that those within it are acting fairly, honestly and with due regard for the law. “Thirdly, I want to record my profound unease about the systematic leaking of this matter, from wherever that occurred. “Any complaints process requires to be confidential in order to be fair to those making complaints, and fair to those about whom complaints are made. “In the leaking of those details to the media, rights of privacy and confidentiality have been blatantly disregarded. “That was done deliberately, and to inflict the maximum damage to my reputation. “It included the leaking of detailed complaints to a tabloid newspaper, complaints which I emphatically dispute. “It included also the briefing of the supposed advice of the Lord Advocate to the press. “That breaches a fundamental constitutional principle - that of the independence of the criminal justice system from political interference. “From the outset, I have argued both that the decision made by the Permanent Secretary was unfair, biased and unlawful and that I have never engaged in any criminality. “The first point has now been established.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland. We are simply collateral damage,\" he said. The South Down MP also said these and other public statements from Tory MPs highlight the importance of the backstop. \"It is our only insurance policy against a hard border in Ireland and comments such as Priti Patel’s will only serve to reinforce the determination of those of us who are saying that the backstop is the bottom line.

We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27509  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinI remain optimistic because Ireland is changing.

A people’s parliament for a revolutionary generation. The coming year is an opportunity to rebuild that culture of change and a parliament that serves the people and not vested interests. Sinn Féin will stand with the people on the streets and stand up for them in the Dáil because the housing and health crises can and must be ended.The policies of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael created and sustained the health and housing crises. As waiting lists grow and the number of patients on trollies hit record highs, the Taoiseach points the finger of blame at doctors and nurses who take Christmas leave. His response to rising evictions and homelessness is to defend the Vulture Funds and give tax breaks to landlords.The Taoiseach and Fine Gael are supported in all of this by Mícheál Martin and the supply and confidence trick.Regardless of what choice the British government makes on Brexit, it cannot be allowed to damage Irish interests, our economy, our agreements or the rights of citizens. This is one issue that unites the majority of parties North and South. We will continue to stand up in the interest of all Ireland. Early in January I will travel to Brussels to continue our engagements with European leaders.An Executive in the North should be in place delivering for all in the community, growing the economy, standing up to destructive Tory policies, and representing the majority view on Brexit. Instead we have witnessed daily at an inquiry the corruption of governance that led to the RHI scandal.No government could sustain the abuse of power and intolerance displayed by the DUP. All the while the Irish and British governments looked on and refused to act. It is a disgrace that the institutions of the north are not up and running.We had a deal with the DUP leadership that would have reinstated the Institutions. The DUP walked away. The two governments promised a new talks process. Ten months on there has been no talks and no process. There has been nothing constructive from the two governments. That is not good enough.Every day that the Executive is suspended undermines the political institutions. Every refusal to recognise rights undermines the political process. The threat to impose Brexit undermines the democratic process.The DUP know that their deal with the Tories will end. They also know that the refusal of rights is not compatible with equality and power-sharing government. They should also know that there is no good or positive Brexit for the north.Sinn Féin is ready for talks, to establish a new Executive working in genuine power-sharing, and operating to the highest standards of governance. A new Executive must include new ways of working, be inclusive of all parties and respect the rights of all the people.The DUP knows what needs to be done. Theresa May knows what needs to be done. It will require leadership that has been absent to date.The two governments have indulged the DUP at the cost of the political process. The two governments know what must be done to form a new Executive in the north. The current do-nothing approach is running out of road.The majority of parties share a common approach to Brexit and to the rights of citizens, and are committed to working together to build a new Executive.The two governments must convene talks and make clear the agreements and rights of citizens will be at the core of a new Executive.The Irish Government cannot look on as spectators. They cannot stand idly by while the DUP and British government shred the agreements. The agreements are the people’s agreements. The people voted for them. The Taoiseach said that the people of the north will not be left behind again. The government must plan for a successful talks process and also have a backup plan.They must also begin preparations for Irish Unity. There is no contradiction in seeking the establishment of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and fulfilling its promise of a unity referendum. The time is right to hold an informed and respectful conversation and referendum on our shared long term future as a united people and a united Ireland. No government should try and stle that debate or call for it to be suspended.I remain optimistic because Ireland is changing. I believe that we have the policies and plans to tackle the housing and health care crises. The debate on Irish unity is under way, and we will have elections and the opportunity for people to have their say. The choice is simple, continue with the failing policies of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil or plot a new course for a new and united Ireland.I look forward to the new year and the continued challenges and opportunities of a changing Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27510  ","story":"Civil Rights marchers attacked at Burntollet Bridge.

I had received other such callsfrom Jer over the years but I was never available to join him, untilthis year, so I called my friend and comrade Larry OToole and we metJer in Gaffneys in Fairview in the aptly named snug The OfficersMess. It was an unforgettable afternoon with Jer. He had been very ill in hospitalnot long before and while he was in great form, both Larry and I feltthat this was almost like a goodbye. Little did we think that lessthan a month later Jer would be gone from us. He died on StStephen’s Day. November. And as always his conversation ranged widely - from thefamous ambush in West Cork to Dalymount stadium and his beloved Bohs,from the streets of the North Inner City with the Dublin Brigade inthe s - and indeed the s - to the Dubs winning four in a rowin , from the docks of our city to the plains of the AmericanWest, from a Dublin stage to a Hollywood set. Jer did entrances and exits well,befitting a man of the stage, and even the shortest of time in hiscompany was entertaining. He knew the power of words and versestripped easily from his tongue. His accent was deep and Dublin, aswas everything about him, the historic Dublin of the working class,locked out in , rising up in , resilient and proud of itsheritage of struggle. In his day Jer was an IrishRepublican Army Volunteer and a political prisoner. He was asocialist republican through and through in the tradition of JamesConnolly and in the style of his idol Jim Larkin. He embodied Larkinon many occasions and at many events. He was always available to do aturn for The Cause - be it trade union, republican or internationalsolidarity.  We asked him to read theProclamation at the Dublin Sinn Féin Easter commemoration inGlasnevin in  and he proudly obliged. Previously at many of ourEaster commemorations over the years he had read James ConnollysFinal Statement to his Court Martial to great and stirring effectoutside the GPO. In  he performed Larkin with us at thestatue in O’Connell Street to begin the Centenary of the Lockout,and again at the Liberty Hall conference organised by Sinn Féinearly that year. A more poignant memory is of Jeras Wolfe Tone at the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in , bicentenary of theUnited Irish Rising. He was accompanied by a group of pike men andwomen, among them his son Diarmuid who died so tragically later thatyear in a fire in Glasgow, after a Celtic game which father and sonhad attended. Leaving the stadium that day, Jer saw his son for thelast time. The loss of Diarmuid was a terrible tragedy for Jer andhis partner Eithne, who died in December , a further loss fromwhich Jer never recovered. Among Jers talents was as adesigner of banners, which he produced with Eithne, and many of whichcan still be seen at trade union rallies. He championed the use ofthe original green, silver and gold Starry Plough as designed for theIrish Citizen Army and flown in Dublin at Easter , and, thanks inlarge part to Jer, it is now widely seen and recognised. It wasplaced on permanent display in the Oak Room of the Mansion House forthe first time, when as Ardmhéara I accepted it as a presentationfrom the Dublin Council of Trade Unions. And it was in the Oak Room,under the Starry Plough, that we gathered on  January to pay tributeto Jer with a night of eulogies, music and song. In October  Jer joined us forSpraoi ar an Sráid, the Moore Street Party that I organised asArdmhéara, in support of the campaign to save the  battlefieldsite. As always, he was proud and glad to answer the call. Once againthat day he passionately declaimed the words of the Frenchrevolutionary Camile Desmoulins, as quoted by Connolly and Larkin: \"The great are not great. Thegreat only appear great because we are on our knees. Let us arise!\" Many hundreds of people attendedJer’s funeral on  January. His coffin was draped in the StarryPlough and passed his North Strand home on the way to the church in aprocession which included some of his finest banners. The attendancewas a cross-section of the republican left, in all its ersity, aswell as people from the theatre, the trade union movement and hismany friends and neighbours. Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonaldattended, as did Gerry Adams. In a tribute Mary Lou said: \"Ní bheidh a leithéid arís ann agus mara dúirt Jer féin go  minic an Phoblacht abú.\"Deepest sympathy is extended to Jer’s daughters Noraand Clare and to all his extended family.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27512  ","story":"The attack at Burntollet Bridge. Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonIt is a scandal that still fty years after political extremists beat civil rights marchers from Belfast to Derry off the roads in opposition to a rights based society,a new generation of political unionists now continues to oppose the development of a rights based society and proper power sharing.Peoples Democracyemerged as one of the constituent parts of the wider Civil Rights Movementin the north of Ireland during the late s.It was a collective of radical students influenced like the rest of the emergent CRM by global events and motivated by a resolve to bring an end to the injustices of the then unionist state.Inspired by the political example of the Selma to Montgomery march organised by the American CRM, the PD and notably without the approval of the wider CRM, decided to march from Belfast to Derry in a highly symbolic protest against the denial of democratic and civil rights in the north.The march began on st January and eventually arrived in Derry on Saturday th January .  But, not before it was violently confronted by unionist extremists, supported by members of the B-Specials state militia, as it passed through Antrim town and Randalstown in South Antrim, and then most notoriously at Burntollet Bridge, outside Claudy and finally again at Irish Street in Derry, before finally arriving at the citys Guildhall.and Brackareilly, near Maghera.Where the route of the march was blocked by unionists, local people provided transport to the next clear point on the journey.Among the numbers to join and support the marchers as it passed through South Antrim and South Derry were local republicans, including IRA volunteers and members of the then Republican Clubs local Hibernians, social democrats, as well as other progressive minded people, who recognised the importance of the march, and respected those participating. The Long March to Derry as it came to be known made its own historic contribution to the demise of the old unionist regime in the north of Ireland.So to mark this landmark event, fty years on from the actual date of the ambush on the marchers at Burntollet, Sinn Féin in my South Antrim constituency organised an evening of reminiscence and political discussion, compered by the author and Sinn Féins former Director of Publicity, Danny Morrison.A specially produced video by Noel and Noel Óg Maguire was shown, sharing local peoples eye witness accounts and recollections of what happened in Antrim, Randalstown, Toome, and also at Burntollet.Civil rights veterans, and former Sinn Féin MLAs, Mary Nelis and Mitchel Mc Laughlin, and myself then participated in a  discussion.That reviewed the pre-civil rights period, how the CRM came into existence, and how the civil rights era gave way to the political conflict, leading up to the peace process, and the present day political situation.It was an excellent event, with an audience spanning three or four generations from South Antrim and South Derry.Some present were reconnecting with historical events which they helped shape, and which in turn shaped them: others were of an age to draw parallels between their own contemporary experiences of rights denied today with the denial of rights fty years ago.What the Long March to Derry in , and the sequence of other events of that same year, climaxing with the pogroms of August , brought sharply into focus was that partition remained the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society: and, that the denial of civil rights in the north was, and remains inisible from the denial of Irish national independence. Following the RUC assault on the civil rights marchers in Duke Street, Derry, on th October , the Long March to Derry again exposed for a world audience the institutionalised sectrarianism of the northern state, and extent of unionist opposition to the equality and rights agenda.Nothing would ever be the same again.It took a further thirty years before the Good Friday Agreementdrew a line under the use of political violence provided the political architecture of the Irish peace process and, established in legislation equality and human rights for all citizens in many ways the GFA addressed what the CRM did not resolve.It gave expression with an internationally binding treaty to the crux of the CRM agenda, by establishing the bench marks of equality, rights, and respect for all citizens.It became our societys road map away from the legacy of political violence towards the achievement of a rights based society, with parity of esteem, mutual respect and anti-sectarianism, at its core.Both the British and Irish governments have failed to fully implement the GFA.Just as the unionist state in  opposed the CRM, signicant sections of political unionism have pushed back against the GFA since .It is a scandal that still fty years after political extremists beat civil rights marchers from Belfast to Derry off the roads in opposition to a rights based society,  a new generation of political unionists now continues to oppose the development of a rights based society and proper power sharing.And, that is the fundamental reason why the democratic political institutions in the north remain suspended and why the GFA faces its greatest ever threat.Make no mistake, there is a deep systemic crisis in the north of Ireland.Now that crisis is deepening with the onset of the Brexit catastrophe.Brexit has swept away all of the previously established assumptions about the constitutional, political and economic status quo in Ireland north and south.A solution to the depth of this crisis will only be found through negotiation and decisive political leadership, which commands the authority to make and keep agreements, and embrace and deliver change.Those who marched from Belfast to Derry fty years ago this week were a microcosm of the wider CRM.They were students and others, including, republicans, social democrats, communists, socialists, trade unionists, and labour members. They were from dferent religious back grounds, and none.The timeless lesson of the CRM which applies to our current situation is that the type of progressive alliances which stood up for rights in  are still required today in .We need progressive and democratic alliances to defend the GFA to stand up against the scourge of Brexit to achieve a Bill of Rights and, secure the fundamental language, legacy, marriage, and womens health rights which are enjoyed where in Ireland and Britain.The British and Irish governments should not make the mistake of underestimating the momentum for change which exists, or the expectations of nationalist and other sections of progressive opinion.We have come full circle. The extremists within political unionism must not be allowed to hold back change.The days of second class citizenship are over.The post civil rights generations will never again be pushed to the back of the bus.Fundamental change in relations between Ireland and Britain is now unavoidable.Importantly, progressive and democratic alliances will also be required to persuade and convince a majority as to the desirability and achievability of an agreed, constitutional Irish national democracy, which guarantees a future for all our people based upon rights, respect and reconciliation.A year of new challenges lies ahead in .Those aspiring for maximum change must remain focussed upon the bigger picture. There can be room for complacency. The momentum for change must not relax. needs to be a year of more and louder voices, greater advocacy, and increased popular mobilisation for democratic rights and change.Let us all ensure that  echoes to the clarion call of those iconic words...We shall overcome.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8761357.1546951720!/image/image.jpg","title":"sinn fein mla conor murphy slammed over ni centenary remarks","story":"A Sinn Fein MLA has been accused of #cranking up sectarian ision# after he said the anniversary of the creation of Northern Ireland is #nothing to celebrate#.It comes after a DUP proposal for Mid and East Antrim Council to mark the centenary of the formation of the Province in .Sinn Feins Conor MurphyThe motion, due to be put forward at the council’s monthly meeting last night, has been described by Sinn Fein’s Conor Murphy as “an attempt to rewrite the history of the brutality and repression created by partition”.Branding NI “the Orange state”, the Newry and Armagh MLA added: “It is outrageous and typical of unionist-dominated councils where other perspectives and experiences are either ignored or treated with contempt.“The arrogance and misrule that characterised the post-partition Unionist government is alive and well in the ongoing denial of rights to some citizens and visible in motions like this brought before unionist-dominated councils.”But Alderman Gregg McKeen, who seconded the motion and is the DUP’s group leader on the council, said he wanted any event which marked the creation of NI to be “inclusive”.He told the News Letter: “From sporting achievements, to industry, tourism and entertainment, Northern Ireland has a wealth of people and places that have put this country on the map.

Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups.

We were found wanting and the players know that.#The only thing I will take from that is that it had reinforced in my own mind some of the players who are stepping up and others we will have to review.#Antrim actually hit the first point of the game through Paddy McBride in the opening minute, but they were to be swamped at the other end with the points flowing for Armagh before a stray Colm Fleming kick-out gave Ryan McShane a gt of a goal to move Armagh - to - ahead on  minutes.Their second major arrived a minute later, this time from a Jamie Clarke penalty after another stray pass resulted in Rory Grugan being hauled back in the area.By the time McBride added to the Antrim tally on  minutes, the game was gone as Clarke and man-of-the-match Stefan Campbell caused havoc at the other end with Armagh leading - to - at the half.McGeeney#s charges did appear to take their foot off the gas a little in the second half, but it was hard to blame them as the game became rather pedestrian.Credit to the hosts who kept plugging away with Niall Delargy and McBride leading the way in attack and they did grab a consolation goal through Eoghan McCabe with the last act of the game, but this was a rare blemish for Armagh who were worthy winners.“It’s the old adage of goals win games and once you concede two in three minutes it#s massive,” Harbinson added.“Armagh#s tackling was very good too and I thought maybe in the second half we were blown up for some easier stuff, but that#s the inconsistencies.“Armagh showed the desire of getting men forward and breaking lines, but we were just a bit slow in doing that.“It#s disappointing because the boys are working really hard and we know they are. We made eight changes from last week against Monaghan because we#re using the McKenna Cup to look at players, although some were enforced on us through injury. When you make all those changes, you run the risk against a very good team of being exposed and that#s what#s happened.”ANTRIM: C Fleming P Brannigan, R Johnston, A Sweeney P Finnegan, D Lynch, P Gallagher M Sweeney, E Walsh M McCarry, M Fitzpatrick, C DuffinK Quinn , E McCabe , P McBride .

Arlene Foster’s erstwhile photo companion has been busying himself of late on the Kilcooley bonfire in Bangor, which he’s determined to ensure is the biggest and the best in Are Wee Country.First up, Squinter’s not sure what Science Dee is a Bachelor of Honours in – the UDA man doesn’t say. But from the tweets about the appliance of structural engineering science to the massive edice, it might appear that it is in that field of endeavour that he excelled at university. We might be tempted to speculate on what university handed the qualication over to him, given the quality of the spelling on his Twitter account, but let’s stick to the matter in hand.On Thursday, as the bonfire crept out of the North Down troposphere and into the stratosphere, Dee gave vent to the vaunting pride that’s filling his barrel chest as the race for the title of Biggest Boney came down to the final furlong: “Kilcooley Bonfire, Well on its way to be Ulster Biggest . A Military Operation, being constructed by Structural Engineers for safety.” Across the Pravince, men of substance nodded slowly and gravely and gave thanks that the health and safety of the children of the large estate is in such professional hands. Next day the Kilcooley boney fell down.AUGUSTAN open letter from Emma Little Pengelly, DUP South Belfast MP, on the Glidergate scandal#Thank you for giving me space in your paper to lay out my position on the Woodstock Road Glider stop, erroneously referred to by some as the ‘Short Strand’ Glider stop, among them the people who designed and built the Glider system and the people closest to it.It has been alleged that I have never before shown an interest in bus stops.. Nothing could be further from the truth. At university I was a founder member of the ‘Campaign to Save Ulster Bus Stops’ and I wrote a very well-received pamphlet which I distributed to membersentitled ‘Classic Bus Stops of Markethill and Richhill – Ulster’s Hidden History’. Furthermore, I have on occasion been on a bus, although admittedly not for a while. That the Glider stop I referred to is near the Short Strand is not in question, but since when did geographical proximity have anything to do with naming things  The Donegal Celtic football club on the Suffolk Road is not in Donegal. The Dublin Road is not in Dublin. Even the Woodstock Road is not in Woodstock, which most people are unaware of . So calling the stop Short Strand because it is near the Short Strand makes zero sense and is in fact potentially confusing. What is this place coming to when routes can’t be changed or amended just because they are traditional  SEPTEMBERSCOTLAND’S Shame, it’s called – the ,lb gorilla in the Holyrood Parliament that nobody wants to speak about. Many and frequent are the manestations of anti-Catholic sentiment at the very core of Scottish society, but the antics this week of a senior Labour Party official at the party conference in Liverpool has seen the issue reach a wider audience and that may make it rather more dficult for it to remain a dirty secret. Speaking from the , Scotsman Andy Kerr, Chairman of the Labour Party’s ruling National Executive Committee, invited a woman to speak and then added: “Did you cross yourself there  In that case I might not.” Not surprisingly, the ‘joke’ went down like a fart in a space suit as Andy obviously forgot that he wasn’t speaking before a select audience in Glasgow. The apology wasn’t long coming “unreservedly” with Andy adding: “I was trying to be lighthearted but what I said was ill-judged and wrong.” Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said: “People from all parties and none will be appalled by this and by the casual dismissal of concerns.” Much as Squinter cheered Ruth’s decisive intervention, he must reluctantly point out that her party has blotted its copybook in the recent past when it comes to the matter of Catholics in Scotland. Last year a Conservative member of Stirling Council was readmitted to the party after being suspended for posting anti-Catholic comments online. Alastair Majury tweeted: “Why is the Catholic Church against birth control  Because they#ll run out of children to molest.”Of course, had Andy Kerr made a religiously loaded remark like the one he did about Catholics about, say, Muslims, or Jews, he wouldn’t have seen the end of the day. But in situ he remains, at the very heart of a party currently struggling with allegations of anti-Semitism which so far have not been solid enough to see any heads roll. The Zionist lobby which is after Jeremy Corbyn’s head would surely have claimed their first victory had this remark been aimed in the direction of Judaism. Perhaps you’ll remember that in July the Orange Order called off a parade in Glasgow. They called it off rather than obey a direction not to walk past a Catholic church where at a previous Orange Order march a priest had been spat at and struck with a baton by parade followers. Now the socialists have joined the KKK. Jings, crivvens, help m’boab!OCTOBERWHAT IS THE BACKSTOP The factsAn insurance policydesigned to avoid a hard border in the event that a customs agreement cannot be agreed by the end of the transition period . If no agreement is reached, the EU wants to see the north remaining in the Single Market and Customs Union until London comes up with a solution. Under pressure from hardliners, British Prime Minister Theresa May wants the backstop done away with or, at the very least, subject to a time limit.The loyal Ulster factsKeeping the Pravince in the Single Market and Customs Union while the rest of the UK leaves is an existential threat to the future of Are Wee Country and the DUP is battling to “save the union”. The party is clear that there can be no ergence within the UK, except on things that it wants to erge on, gyeh morrage and abortion, for instance. A DUP source has promised to up the pressure on the Tory government: “We are going to squeeze their balls until their ears bleed.”Promises, promises# NOVEMBERWhich brings us to James McClean. Again. Since last year’s Remembrance Day festival the Derry native and Republic of Ireland international has switched clubs from West Brom to Stoke. In order to keep their fans informed ahead of the annual wearing of the poppy football shirts across the English leagues, the club issued a brief statement outlining the player’s historical stance and confirming that he wouldn’t be sporting a poppy on his shirt this year either.Despite the fact that nothing had changed – other than the name of the club at the top of the press release – the statement sent the Pravince’s media to DefCon , just as it has since the day and hour James spoke his first words on the topic, occasioning the familiar angry social media blast from Ulster’s stout yeomanry. There’s a delicious and very fitting circularity in this local saga:just as nothing has changed in relation to James McClean and the poppy, nothing has changed in Ulster’s attitude to it.DECEMBERA BURNING question finally gets its answer. No, it’s not about Brexit, or world hunger, or famine or plague. It’s simply this: what do you call this item pictured below left  You may never have given the matter any thought, but Squinter has, because, well# because that’s the kind of guy he is. Fact of the matter is that you’re very unlikely ever to ask for one because  out of every thousand of these things sold are simply lted by the customer and brought to the counter or check-out without a word. If you have a shopping list it will simply say ‘milk’ and everyone knows exactly how large or how small their milk requirements are.But every time Squinter buys one he asks himself why he doesn’t have a clue what it’s called and, further,a tourist asked him what it was he wouldn’t be able to answer. So, enough being enough, Squinter put the question to Twitter – and back came around  replies, some of them fairly sensible, some#. Quart.. Barrackbuster.. Big milk.. Flagon Jar.. Green milk..

I think it’s those kind of assurances we are happy to give.”The concept of the backstop – an agreement governing the customs status of the Ireland Northern Ireland border in the event that Britain and the EU cannot agree a long-term relationship by the end of  – has been the main sticking point preventing Mrs May’s Withdrawal Agreement from being passed by Parliament.It is opposed by a hardline group of MPs from her own Tory Party, as well as their Democratic Unionist Party allies.On Monday, Brussels said the agreed Brexit deal was “the best and the only deal possible” and the European Commission was focused on watching what happened in the vote.Without some activity from Brussels, Mrs May is expected to lose the so-called meaningful vote on January , which was postponed in December when it became clear that the Government would be defeated.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Stephen Barclay played down reports that the Government was talking to the EU about delaying Brexit French Europe minister Nathalie Loiseau said that the Withdrawal Agreement would not be renegotiated.Askedthere was a new way the EU could prove to British MPs that it does not want to use the backstop, Ms Loiseau said: “We have said it repeatedly. The president said it at the end of the previous European council.“Indeed, we all want to have a fruitful, profitable relationship with the United Kingdom in the future. So the backstop is just a last resort solution.”Pressed on whether there would be new assurances, Ms Loiseau said: “These are political assurances. But there is nothing more that we can do.“The Withdrawal Agreement is indeed a good agreement, both for the UK and for the European Union. We should stick to it.”Brexiteer former Brexit secretary David Davis dismissed the Taoiseach’s comments, saying that the EU would come back to the table to renegotiate the Brexit dealthe UK “holds fast” as the deadline for leaving approaches.He told BBC Radio ’s Today programme that the EU was “testing the mettle of the British Government”.He continued: “The simple truth is that they will hold fast to their line – this is the traditional approach of the European Commission, the European Union – they will hold fast to their line to the last possible minute and then,we hold fast to our line, then they will actually come back and renegotiate.”He added thatthat occurred we should demand legal assurances and “some sort of undertaking on a free trade deal”, saying: “This will get very, very sticky, very close to the end, that is what will happen.“And we need to work out what is negotiable and what isn’t.”But Mr Barclay, who took on the Brexit role after the resignation of Mr Davis’s successor, Dominic Raab, said the comment “reflects what PM has been saying for some time – that the deal she has negotiated is in the interests of both the EU and the UK”.He went on to deny reports that Article  could be extended, saying it would “generate some very practical issues”, Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay has said.He told Today that he had not had any talks with the EU “in terms of an extension”, the day after Digital Minister Margot James suggested that Brexit could be delayed in order to avoid a no-deal scenario.Mr Barclay said: “It’s not a unilateral decision for the UK. That is not a decision the UK Government could take, it would require the consent of all  member states.“It would also generate some very practical issues, for example EU parliamentary elections at the end of May.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Theresa Villiers said a drinks reception inside Number  had not persuaded her to vote for Mrs May’s deal There was no sign of a breakthrough among MPs who have vowed to vote against the Prime Minister’s deal as they left Downing Street following a drinks reception for Tory MPs on Monday evening.Conservative former Cabinet minister and Brexiteer Theresa Villiers said the evening “hasn’t changed my view” and that she would still not be supporting the agreement.Another reception will be held on Wednesday as part of Mrs May’s charm offensive.And more than  MPs who signed a letter to the PM urging her to rule out a no-deal Brexit have been invited to meet her at Downing Street on Tuesday."},{"url":null,"title":"meet the brexitbashing twitter account followed by leo varadkar","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Receiving the MBE is just totally surreal.ldquoIrsquom overwhelmed the work I do in safeguarding children and women has been recognised by the Queen.Sheila started to work as a front line practitioner in the field of social work  years ago. Today, she is Social Work Manager for the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust.She is also the chairperson of the South Eastern Area Domestic and Sexual Violence Abuse Partnership, a multi-disciplinary and inter-agency made up of voluntary and statutory community groups like Sure Start, Womenrsquos Aid and PSNI.Sheila said social workers were used to being on the receiving end of unwarranted bad publicity, but were expected by society to protect vulnerable children.She said: ldquoI first began to understand domestic violence when I became a social worker. I quickly realised it was prevalent in a lot of families.ldquoThankfully, society is beginning to talk about it more. ldquoWe need to continue to talk about it because it is so dficult for anyone living with domestic violence to tell their story and it is extremely dficult for children.ldquoThey are scared to speak out because they remain afraid of what might happen to themthey told an outside organisation. Sometimes, their silence is due to them feeling ashamed or even responsible for the abuse they are dealing with.Sheila understood quite early in le about the effects of trauma. Her elder brother, Eugene, disappeared on New Yearrsquos Day  when Sheila was in her early teens.His three children came to live with her family and she saw how her own mother and father were able to make their lives as normal as possible which led to some healing for all of them.The tragedy was the inspiration behind a play called, The Ferryman which debuted in London recently.ldquoMy role is tough, she explains, ldquobut social workers are our own support network. We meet with a lot of anger and abuse. It can be challenging but it can also be rewarding. Many people do come back to us to say thank you or, they will say to us that wersquove helped to turn their le around. That is said to us more frequently than anything . Thatrsquos what keeps us doing the job. We are the source from which change is possible. Everyone has the potential to change and I see it played out time and time again.It is evident that Sheila is dedicated to the families she protects. She said: ldquoDomestic violence is quite prevalent in Northern Ireland. One in six women and one in nine men will live with it including their children some time in their le.ldquoPolice are called to an incident every  minutes. Curiously, it is this time of year that sees a spike in those figures. Christmas Day and New Yearrsquos Day will see the highest numbers of women and children call the police for help.ldquoAnd, I do think the timing of this MBE from the Queen will only serve to raise awareness of this issue. And might even help someone who is suffering abuse to pick up the phone and ask for help.Sheila advises that anyone who wishes to make a call should contact   , which is completely confidential. It is available to all men and women affected by domestic and sexual violence..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Call for upgrade at Ardglass harbour  ","story":"THE need for major improvements at Ardglass harbour to allow signicantly larger vessels to enter the port has been highlighted by former South Down MP Margaret Ritchie.Her comments come after last monthrsquos annual EU Fisheries Council meeting in Brussels which determines how much fish can be landed at the local port and at the neighbouring harbours of Kilkeel and Portavogie.EU chiefs have decided to reduce prawn quotas by just over % to ensure the species ldquostays within sustainable levels, while the herring quota has been reduced by %.The Fisheries Council also determines how many days boats can put to sea, but the December meeting will have been the last UK fishermen were represented at ahead of the Brexit at the end of March.Welcoming some of the outcomes from the Brussels negotiations, Miss Ritchie has urged British and Irish governments to resolve what she described as ldquooutstanding problems in the fisheries sector to build the economies at the three Co Down fishing ports.She explained that the Fisheries Council consists of EU Fisheries Ministers who decide on the annual quota allocations for range of species mdash including prawns and white fish mdash which are the main staple of Northern Ireland fishermen.Miss Ritchie said she was concerned there has been a slight decrease in the amount of prawns which can be landed locally, after a series of successive quota increases over recent years.ldquoIt is important that the British Government has realistic proposals capable of implementation in place to safeguard and grow our local industry, said Ms Ritchie.ldquoThere are also other fishing issues that require resolution as they present ongoing challenges to the catching and processing sectors. They include the Voisinage Agreement with the Irish Government to allow Co Down fishermen to resume fishing in Irish Sea waters. There is also the need for improvements to harbour infrastructure at Ardglass and Kilkeel to allow larger boats to land fish.Miss Ritchie said the prawn quota reduction was more to do with the species being exempted from so-called discard ban.She added: ldquoIt is vitally important that our local fishing industry in the catching and processing sectors is allowed to continue to grow and develop.ldquoThe Government needs to continue with a positive working relationship with the industry to allow the economic sectors in Ardglass and Kilkeel to be nurtured to ensure existing jobs are sustained and new employment opportunities are realised.Mr Alan McCulla, chief executive of the Anglo-North Irish Fish Producers Organisation Sea Source, believes the outcome of the annual negotiation on catch quotas ldquoputs Northern Irelandrsquos fishermen in a good starting position for the next phase in our relationship with the EU.He said the agreements reached at the Fisheries Council meeting offered ldquosome positives and some negatives for the Irish Sea, with the December negotiations described by the Department of Agriculture Environment and Rural Affairsas ldquoone of the most dficult councils in recent years.A spokesperson for the government department said it was vitally important to ensure that sufficient quota was obtained for all Irish Sea fish species to enable them to land all the fish they catch from the start of the New Year, particularly whiting which is a by-catch in the prawn fishery.ldquoThe EU Commission initially proposed an Irish Sea whiting quota of  tonnes but this was successfully negotiated up by % to  tonnes, with agreement to carry out a further review of the quota in the new year.The government department spokesperson said the deal ldquoensures that there are now workable solutions to alleviate the pressure for fishermen while preventing fish from being wastefully discarded unnecessarily..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan tree voted top in NI  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN Forest Parkrsquos giant redwood is celebrating being voted Northern Irelandrsquos Tree of the Year in the Woodland Trustrsquos search for the countryrsquos best-loved tree.The stunning redwood mdash or multi-stemmed giant sequoia to be precise mdash finished second in the  UK final.Everyone associated with the Forest Service, the people of Castlewellan and ious groups helping with ambitious regeneration proposals at the stunning forest park, are delighted with the majestic treersquos success in the regional heat.The giant redwood stands within the walled garden at the forest park and at over  years old has seen centuries come and go.

The Hoops raced into a - first half lead with goals from Stephen Galbraithand Sean McMahon before Jordan McCoubrey delivered the coup de grace in the th minute to finally kill off a game Olympic outfit.Celtic looked the more composed and inventive side from the off and an understrength Olympic struggled to create anything of note. The Hoops seized the lead with only six and a half minutes gone and never looked back.Chris Mullan, who was like a fleet-footed gazelle down the left flank and just missed out on the man of the match award, sped past his marker on the edge of the box.His stinging shot that looked destined for the bottom corner of the net was parried out by an alert Ryan Connollly, but Galbraith was hovering around the six-yard box and was perfectly placed to steer the ball home.Less than two minutes later Mullan dipped his shoulder again and cut inside Jack Roddy before striking the base of the post with a fierce shot.Olympic steadfastly refused to buckle and with  minutes gone were unlucky not to equalise when Aaron McCaffrey, their most potent player in attack, was unable to take advantage in a rare moment of panic in the Celtic box.Celtic went back on the attack and with  minutes gone taskmaster Jordan Curran teamed up with Mullan to create an opening for Sean McMahon, but he fired wide.Back at the other end, the dangerous McCaffrey got in behind Conor Doherty, but his delightfully flighted cross missed by everyone in the box.With  minutes gone Rottweiler Curran blocked an Olympic attempt to send Rhys Patterson clear. The ball flew off his shin and into the path of the willing Sean McMahon who raced away from Michael Rice and Darryl Russell, but with only Connolly to beat, his cheeky, dinked effort grazed the crossbar on the way to safety.A minute later another mazy Mullan run ended with the wing wizard crossing for McMahon, but this seasonrsquos top scorer had his audacious effort blocked on the six yard box with Celtic claiming a penalty.The second goal wasnrsquot long in coming and with  minutes gone a Mullan cross was deftly headed home by Doherty, who had been given the freedom of the box. Three minutes later Galbraith made it - when his low corner evaded Connolly at his near post and ended up in the net.Celtic continued their dominance after the break with Mullan and McMahon dovetailing perfectly for Curran, but his shot went well over the top. With  minutes gone McMahon decided to go it alone, but he was well off target as Olympic backed off him.Olympic tried desperately to get things moving, but it just wasnrsquot their day and with  minutes played Russell did exceptionally well to prevent Galbraith from making it - with a last-gasp tackle.The fourth goal was just around the corner and with  minutes gone Andy Baggley headed the ball into the path of prodigy Jordan McCoubrey, who looked suspiciously offside. The teenage terrier didnrsquot hang around as Olympic had pushed up and he raced cleat to beat Connolly all ends up.If anything, Celtic could have won by an even bigger margin and Connolly saved brilliantly in the th minute to deny Baggley a fth Celtic goal.Celtic Bhoys: Nathan Curran, Shaun Megahey, Conor Doherty, Matthew Carson, Mikey Rice, Jordan Curran, Terence Bell, Ricky Kerr, Stephen Galbraith, Sean McMahon, Chris Mullan.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

The alarm was raised by her friends, and they, together with members of the public and a Penarth RNLI volunteer, helped to keep her safe before the leboat was launched.A throw line was used to reach the casualty, and lejackets were obtained from the leboat station.The ywoman was struggling to hold on, and with high spring tides the RNLI crew member entered the water to fit her lejacket and support her, knowing that the leboat crew had been paged and were on their way.The D-class leboat was launched quickly, and brought the casualty and the Penarth crew member safely back to the station.A medical check was carried out on both, and although cold and wet they were deemed fit and well.Jason Dunlop, Penarth RNLI Leboat Operations Manager paid tribute to all those involved: \"With such a high tide, in darkness and in cold water, the casualty could have easily drted out of sight. By hanging on as she did and with the support of everyone involved the rescue was affected quickly and safely.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Itrsquos blatantly obvious what the cause is, itrsquos years of austerity and wage stagnation. Millions of workers are now reliant on borrowing, making up for low wages by increasing their debt.ldquoNot for holidays or luxuries but for example using credit cards for everyday essentials like nappies and food, which is so stressful.ldquoCan the minister please explain what the Government is doing to address this crisis and why those on the benches opposite refuse to join the Labour Party in advocating a real minimum wage of at least pound an hour and ato serious collective bargaining for workers in the UK.Ms Perry replied: ldquoI heard the news reports of this particular analysis, I also heard that it had been entirely discredited because it includes student debt which is not something that accrues to every household and actuallyyou strip that out the rate of accrual of household ndash would she like to listen rather than chunter, Irsquoll carry on ndashyou actually look at that stripping out student debt which does not accrue to every household, then you see that the growth of consumer credit has actually slowed.ldquoAnd once again I am very proud to stand up here and represent the Government that finally did what her Government which had  years to not do, which was to introduce a National Minimum Wage and ensure that it goes up well ahead of inflation.Raising a point of order following the question session, Ms Pidcock pointed out the error, stating: ldquoThe Minister of state under her breath mentioned the Living Wage which of course in practice there is no such thing, but of course the minister could correct the record that it was indeed the Labour Party which introduced the Minimum Wage in  which her party strongly opposed.Ms Perry responded: ldquoMr Speaker, sorry Irsquom blaming the excitement, of course Irsquom happy to correct the record. Shersquos absolutely correct the Labour Party introduced the National Minimum Wage.ldquoIt was quite clear that that was inadequate for many people on the lowest incomes particularly women who were underpaid which is why we introduced the National Living Wage, something I wish she would support..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Minister says sorry after claiming Tories introduced the National Minimum Wage article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Some of the major deals completing last year included PwC’s move to Merchant Square, the Northern Ireland Civil Service at  Lanyon Place and Allstate at Mays Meadow. “During an unsettling period of political uncertainty, the local office market is an indicator of the health of the Northern Ireland economy, with the professional services and technology sectors in particular leading the way,” Brian Lavery, managing director at CBRE said. “Currently we only have around , sq ft of grade A office space available fragmented across a number of buildings underpinning the need for more investment in this space. “Alongside this office space growth, we are also seeing the green shoots of demand for residential living in the city centre. We believe this is the trend to track in  and beyond as investors across the UK and globally continue to look for opportunities in this area. “However, on a more positive note, we are seeing strong interest from a wide spectrum of investors for office investments in Belfast which is being driven by growing rents and demand, combined with limited supply of high-quality accommodation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/34453454454.jpg","title":"supporting belfast start ups on the rise","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business The UK’s digital tech sector has attracted more capital than any other European country and Belfast has established itself as a key hub, writes Roisin Byrne, business director, Hays Northern Ireland The  Tech Nation report makes it clear that digital tech makes an essential contribution to our local economy with clusters and start-ups forming primarily around AI , machine learning, cyber security and big data industries. The Belfast start-up community ecosystem is alive and well and has carved out a reputation in the wider tech community for having good access to talent, funding and transport links. It also benefits from great workspaces such as Ormeau Baths, Farset Labs and the Innovation Centre at Catalyst Inc. Indeed, the city is bubbling with entrepreneurial talent as demonstrated by the large number of start-ups which have launched in the last two years. Belfast boasts a disproportionate number of the UK’s high growth firms and it is estimated that the local ecosystem now supports around , jobs. Hays has worked with a number of these start-ups as they have scaled up operations – firms such as Analytics Engines, Uleska and Vox to name a few. As part of our commitment to the sector we’ve also taken space in Ormeau Baths which has become an epicentre for tech meet-ups, hackathons and pitch events. It’s also a campus for early stage and growth stage start-ups to network, share experience and build scalable, globally focussed businesses. In its first year, % of companies based in Ormeau Baths grew their teams and revenues, and raised over £m in venture funding. We’ve also launched a new national initiative called Super Connect delivered by Empact Ventures which aims to help tech start-ups and scale-ups to explore collaboration with large organisations and funding providers through a series of venture labs and pitch days. The initiative brings together corporates, SMEs, angel investors, venture capitalists, grant providers, loan funds and crowdfunding s to explore supporting these start-ups and scale-ups. Details can be found at www.superconnectseries. In an increasingly competitive marketplace Hays sees real value in the innovative ideas start-ups are using to network and build traction and as they scale up to the next stage we are providing material support and employer value branding to help them attract the talent they need.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
