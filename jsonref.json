I have considered the documents entitled \u0027Instrument Relating To The Agreement On The Withdrawal Of The United Kingdom Of Great Britain And Northern Ireland From The European Union And The European Atomic Energy Community\u0027 (the \u0027Joint Instrument\u0027) and the Declaration By Her Majesty\u0027s Government Of The United Kingdom Of Great Britain And Northern Ireland Concerning The Northern Ireland Protocol (the \u0027Unilateral Declaration\u0027), which were concluded with the EU late last night.2. As the preamble states, the Joint Instrument is an instrument relating to the Withdrawal Agreement which was made in connection with its conclusion and is accepted by both parties. Therefore, pursuant to the principle set out in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which is widely accepted as reflecting customary international law, the Joint Instrument has binding legal effect as a document that is to be taken as an authentic interpretation of the Withdrawal Agreement. 3. The Unilateral Declaration sets out the United Kingdom\u0027s position on the Withdrawal Agreement and the Joint Instrument. A unilateral declaration by one party to a bilateral agreement constitutes an authentic interpretation of the treaty if it is accepted by the other party. While it is not an agreed document, it too has legal status as an interpretative document, and will be lodged with the depositary of the Withdrawal Agreement and form part of the context of the treaty in accordance with the principle set out in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention.Joint Instrument 4. The Joint Instrument essentially puts the commitments in the letter from Presidents Tusk and Juncker of 14 January 2019 into a legally binding form and provides, in addition, useful clarifications, amplifications of existing obligations and some new obligations, which in certain significant respects would facilitate the effective enforcement of the UK\u0027s rights in the event of a breach of the good faith and best endeavours obligations by the EU.    Attorney General Geoffrey Cox today published his Legal Opinion on Joint Instrument and Unilateral Declaration concerning the Withdrawal Agreement          Geoffrey Cox\u0027s advice will be key in determining whether Tory Brexiteers and the DUP back her new deal5. For example, paragraph 4 provides that \u0027a systematic refusal to take into consideration adverse proposals or interests\u0027 would constitute a breach of the best endeavours and good faith duties in Article 2(1) of the Protocol and Article 5 of the Withdrawal Agreement respectively. Paragraph 5 creates a new emphasis on the diligent prosecution of the negotiations of a subsequent agreement to replace the Protocol (in whole or in part) by providing that they should be treated as a priority and that if the agreement, which paragraph 11 stipulates may be a stand-alone agreement, has not been concluded within one year of the United Kingdom\u0027s withdrawal, efforts must be \u0027redoubled\u0027. Paragraph 6 binds the EU and the United Kingdom to specific operational commitments to fulfil the duty \u0027to working speedily on a subsequent agreement that establishes by 31 December 2020 alternative arrangements, so that the backstop will not need to be triggered.\u0027 6. These include establishing \u0027immediately following the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement, a negotiating track for replacing the customs and regulatory alignment in goods elements of the Protocol with alternative arrangements\u0027, which requires consideration of \u0027comprehensive customs cooperation arrangements, facilitative arrangements and technologies.\u0027 By paragraph 10, the alternative arrangements which supersede the Protocol \u0027are not required to replicate its provisions in any respect.\u0027 7. In my view, these provisions of the Joint Instrument extend beyond mere interpretation of the Withdrawal Agreement and represent materially new legal obligations and commitments, which amplify its existing terms and make time of the essence in replacing the backstop. Therefore, provided the United Kingdom can clearly demonstrate in practice that it is effectively organised and prepared to maintain the urgent pace of negotiations that they imply, the EU could not fail to match it without being at risk of breaching the best endeavours obligation. 8. Furthermore, given the legally binding acceptance that the provisions of the Protocol need not be replicated and the connected heavy emphasis on alternative arrangements, including the discrete negotiating track for their use in replacing the regulatory and customs alignment elements of the Protocol, it would be unconscionable and a potential breach of the duties of good faith and best endeavours were the EU to decline to adopt any practicable alternative arrangements of the type described if they helped to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and did not require it to make unreasonable adjustments of its interests. 9. By paragraph 12, the parties expressly agree that if the UK could demonstrate the EU was acting with the objective of applying the Protocol indefinitely, the EU could not dispute that its actions breached the duty of good faith. For this purpose, in the light of paragraph 4, it would, in my view, be sufficient to show a pattern of unjustified delay by the EU, having regard to the urgency agreed to be necessary by the parties, to raise a prima facie case of breach. It also confirms that a breach of these obligations is arbitrable under the dispute resolution provisions of the Withdrawal Agreement. If a party wishes to make such an allegation, paragraph 13 now provides for an obligatory exchange of written reasoned justifications of their position. If the arbitration tribunal upholds the complaint, and the recalcitrant party does not comply with its ruling, the other may unilaterally take proportionate counter-measures, which may (pursuant to Article 178(2) of the Withdrawal Agreement) include suspension of all or parts of the Protocol, including the backstop, until there is satisfactory compliance. The confirmation that the obligations under the Protocol are indeed arbitrable and subject to the counter-measures available to the United Kingdom is another welcome clarification. 10. In the light of these clarificatory provisions of the Joint Instrument, it is instructive to revisit Article 20 of the Protocol. This provision allows termination by mutual consent when, in the view of both Parties, the Protocol is in whole or in part \u0027no longer necessary\u0027 to achieve the objectives set out in Article 1.3. In my Advice of 13 November 2018, I considered that the better view was that the obligations under this Article were arbitrable. In my view, in the event of a prolonged suspension of parts of the Protocol\u0027s provisions that has not been lifted because of the compliance of the EU, but the functions of which had been secured by other measures, it would be possible to contend to the arbitration tribunal effectively that the inaction of the EU meant that those provisions were plainly no longer necessary and that a refusal to consent to that proposition by the EU was unjustified. In those circumstances, it is arguable that the United Kingdom could secure the termination of the relevant obligations under the Protocol.Unilateral Declaration 11. The Unilateral Declaration recalls the agreement between the United Kingdom and the EU expressed in Article 1(4) of the Protocol that the objective of the Withdrawal Agreement is not to establish a permanent relationship between the EU and the United Kingdom and that the provisions of the Protocol are, therefore, intended to apply only temporarily, taking into account the commitments of the Parties in Article 2(1) of the Protocol to use their best endeavours to conclude, by 31 December 2020, an agreement which supersedes the Protocol in whole or in part. 12. The function of the Unilateral Declaration is to record the United Kingdom\u0027s position that, if it were not possible to conclude a subsequent agreement to replace the Protocol because of a breach by the EU of its duty of good faith under Article 5 of the Withdrawal Agreement, it would be entitled to take Page 3 of 3 measures to disapply the provisions of the Protocol in accordance with the Withdrawal Agreement\u0027s dispute resolution procedures and Article 20 to which I have referred. 13. This Unilateral Declaration, to which I understand the EU has agreed it will not object, further confirms the advice I have given at paragraphs 4-10 above. 14. For these reasons, there is no doubt, in my view, that the clarifications and amplified obligations contained in the Joint Instrument and the Declaration provide a substantive and binding reinforcement of the legal rights available to the United Kingdom in the event that the EU were to fail in its duties of good faith and best endeavours. Conclusion 15.  In my letter of 13 November 2018, I advised that the Protocol would endure indefinitely in international law and could not be brought to an end in the absence of a subsequent agreement. This would remain the case even if parties were still negotiating many years later, and even if the parties believed that talks have clearly broken down and there was no prospect of a future relationship agreement. 16. I also advised that in the specific case that situation was due to the EU\u0027s want of good faith and best endeavours, because of the difficulties of proof and the egregious nature of the conduct that would be required to establish a breach by the EU of those obligations, it would be highly unlikely that the United Kingdom could take advantage of the remedies available to it for such a breach under the Withdrawal Agreement.  17. I now consider that the legally binding provisions of the Joint Instrument and the content of the Unilateral Declaration reduce the risk that the United Kingdom could be indefinitely and involuntarily detained within the Protocol\u0027s provisions at least in so far as that situation had been brought about by the bad faith or want of best endeavours of the EU. 18. It may be thought that if both parties deploy a sincere desire to reach agreement and the necessary diligence, flexibility and goodwill implied by the amplified duties set out in the Joint Instrument, it is highly unlikely that a satisfactory subsequent agreement to replace the Protocol will not be concluded. But as I have previously advised, that is a political judgment, which, given the mutual incentives of the parties and the available options and competing risks, I remain strongly of the view it is right to make.19. However, the legal risk remains unchanged that if through no such demonstrable failure of either party, but simply because of intractable differences, that situation does arise, the United Kingdom would have, at least while the fundamental circumstances remained the same, no internationally lawful means of exiting the Protocol\u0027s arrangements, save by agreement.\u0027          But, in a damning assessment of the text, Mr Cox said the legal risk of Britain trapped \u0027remains unchanged\u0027 and that the new concessions only \u0027reduce\u0027 the risk Britain could be trapped in the backstop \u0027indefinitely and involuntarily\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Moggys hilarious reaction turns puma bounding TV screen","story":"    The cute house cat sits licking its paws without realising what is on the television behind it \u0027Her arm is in pretty bad shape:\u0027 Arizona zoo worker\u0027s 911...People are getting high off \u0027Catnip Cocktail\u0027 and behaving...Share this articleThe ginger tabby\u0027s hilarious reaction was caught on camera at an unknown location.But the two members of the cat family do not commonly cross paths in the outside world.  Pumas, also known as cougars and mountain lions, are found in Central and South America but prefer to live in isolated areas.

not without controversy.As a supremely well-off backbencher he showed his eye for the minutiae of his work when, in 2016, he tried - and failed - to claim 49p on expenses for a pint of milk.Later that year he found himself in political hot water when he was forced by the standards watchdog to apologise to the Commons after forgetting to declare £400,000 of earnings.He had referred himself to the Standards Committee the previous October, saying he had forgotten to make the declaration because he had been working in Mauritius and \u0027failed to give this matter the due thought and priority it

Video still: EPAThe second House of Commons defeat of the withdrawal agreement, this time complete with clarifications, assurances, guarantees and declarations, arrived on Tuesday night accompanied by the now familiar braying tones of the Speaker John Bercow. “So the Nos have it, the Nos have it!” he roared at 7.25pm in a packed chamber.At least Bercow, a sometimes controversial figure cheerfully loathed by his former Conservative Party colleagues, seems to be enjoying all this. Not many others are. The margin of defeat was considerably less that the whopping 230 votes by which UK prime minister Theresa May’s previous attempt to pass the agreement went under at the start of January.But not even as miserable a political figure as Mrs May could claim that the 149-vote loss in parliament – in a vote which she touted as the most important in decades – was anything other than a crushing defeat. In any normal polity, Mrs May would now have to resign. No, in any normal polity, she would have resigned a long time ago.But, as has been frequently pointed out hereabouts and elsewhere, the strange political otherworld that is Brexit Britain does not observe the normal laws of political gravity. Or indeed of mortality – do not be surprised if Mrs May seeks to resurrect the corpse of the deal and strap it upright on its horse like a parliamentary El Cid to frighten the Brexiteers into backing the deal as the only way out of the EU.Who knows? Predictions eventually make fools of us all, but British politics in the age of Brexit takes the hazards of trying to figure out the likely course of current and political events to a whole new level. So what happens now? The British Parliament will vote on Wednesday on whether to rule out a no-deal outcome – though to give effect to this would require other actions by government and parliament to bring this about. That is expected to pass by a large majority.Seek an extensionThen on Thursday on a motion to seek an extension of the article 50 mechanism, postponing the date of Brexit from March 29th to . . . well, to whenever. An extension would have to be agreed unanimously by the 27 other leaders of the EU at next week’s summit in Brussels, but, once requested by the UK, there seems little doubt that it would be granted. Nobody, outside of a small group of hardline Brexiteers in the House of Commons, wants to prompt a crash-out for which nobody (including the Irish Government) is prepared. So there will almost certainly be an extension.The question will be, I think, how long will it last – and what is it for. The EU side appears to be done with these negotiations. Jean-Claude Juncker was unequivocal in Strasbourg in Monday night, and conversations with senior sources in Dublin and Brussels confirm that settled view. The sense among people in Government and the EU institutions who spoke privately that they have reached the end with Mrs May was everywhere on Tuesday.That Mrs May would agree a deal with the EU without having secured the agreement of her own attorney general – whose advice would always prove decisive – was the cause of reactions ranging from disbelief to despair to something near an exasperated amusement. The EU was always afraid it would make its concession to Mrs May on her assurances that she could pass the deal, but she would be unable to keep her part of the deal.It has now had that experience twice. It is very unlikely to try it a third time. That means that for the EU side, an extension – for two or three months, sources say, and no more – serves two purposes. Firstly, it is to let the British see if they can figure out what it is they want. The convulsions and convolutions of the withdrawal treaty are themselves an attempt to reconcile the British desire to leave the rules of the customs union and the single market while maintaining some of their advantages – chief among them the absence of a hard border in Ireland. They may have to choose between a hard Brexit and the Border.That process may require a general election, or a second referendum. An extension will provide space for that process.Prepare properlyThe second purpose of an extension to article 50 is to allow everyone to prepare properly for a no-deal Brexit. Irish parliamentary preparations have proceeded at a breakneck pace in recent weeks, but the truth is nobody is ready for the practicalities, and Ireland has a lot more to prepare for than anyone else.In the wake of Mrs May’s defeat this week, we are likely to see a huge intensification in no-deal preparations. That will inevitably include preparations to protect the single market and the customs union in Ireland – the polite term for figuring out what to do about the Border.The Irish Government’s position that it will not partake in any preparations that might require border infrastructure will not remain tenable for much longer. During a recent visit by European Commission officials to discuss no-deal preparations, I understand there was a good deal of eyebrow-raising at the Irish unwillingness to engage on matters relating to the Border. Brussels is very unlikely to adopt the “ah sure, you’re grand” approach for much longer.As Westminster lurches deeper into drama and crisis, the quotidian demands of Government loom in Dublin. On Wednesday the British will publish proposed plans for the Border, and the tariffs that will be levied in the event of a no-deal. Detailed contingency plans for the Border may be the next headache for the Irish Government."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3822930.1552391080!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ira claims responsibility for explosives posted to british sites","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe group claims it posted five devices to addresses in Britain, however only four have been discovered. Photograph. Robert PerryEPAA group calling itself the IRA has claimed responsibility for the incendiary devices sent to three London transport hubs and a Glasgow university last week.It also claimed a total of five devices were sent and now a search is underway for the claimed fifth, and unaccounted for, device.Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan said he was “deeply concerned” that Irish paramilitaries claimed they were behind the attacks.“This was a reckless and cowardly attack on the entire community. I condemn in the strongest possible terms the people who carried out this act,” he said.“We must work together to reject those isolated groups who would discard the accomplishments of the peace process for all communities on these islands for their own narrow objectives. Their futile agenda will not succeed.“I spoke to the Home Secretary yesterday and conveyed my utter disgust at these actions. They are the actions of those who are without any vision for a peaceful future on Northern Ireland.“I also reaffirmed to the Home Secretary our deep commitment to working closely with our colleagues in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom. ”The London politan Police has confirmed a call, during which a recognised dissident republican codeword was used, was made to a newspaper on Monday.The caller to the Irish News in Belfast claimed responsibility for the three devices on behalf of the IRA.Following that call, the London Met has also said the devices were similar to others used by dissidents in the past.However, while it had been actively exploring dissidents as suspects for the attacks before the call of responsibility, it would also keep an open mind on other lines of inquiry.“The claim was received on Monday, March 11th, by a media outlet in Northern Ireland using a recognised codeword. The claim was allegedly made on behalf of the ‘IRA’,” the London Met said.“The investigations into these devices continue and relevant enquiries are being made in relation to the claim that has been made.“Given the packages received last week bore similarities to devices sent in the past which were linked to dissident groups associated with Northern Ireland-related terrorism, officers were already looking at this as a line of enquiry. However, we continue to keep an open mind and enquiries continue.“We are also aware that those claiming responsibility have indicated five devices were sent. At this time, only four devices have been recovered.”The London Met added it had already given extensive security advice around suspicious packages to the business community and others. And now this advice had been reiterated in light of the claim of responsibility suggesting one device has yet to be found.The three small devices found on Tuesday in London appeared designed to catch fire rather than explode. They were sent to Waterloo rail station and buildings on the Heathrow and London City airport campuses.The package sent to the Compass Centre offices at Heathrow was opened, causing the A4 envelope the device was in to catch fire. However, the other two London packages were not opened.The following day, last Wednesday, at Glasgow University in Scotland buildings were evacuated after a device, which was immediately directly linked to three devices in London, was discovered in the college’s mail room. It was not opened and there were no injuries.Dissident republicans and the Provisional IRA before them have used explosive and incendiary devices to cause damage and disruption for years. Gardaí and the UK authorities immediately suspected last week’s attacks were the work of the New IRA."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3823507.1552422390!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish delight in cromwell win at cheltenham but avoid brexit donkey derby","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Espoir D’Allen ridden by Mark Walsh races to victory during the Champion Hurdle Challenge at Cheltenham. Photograph: Michael SteeleGetty ImagesIreland rarely delights in a Cromwell victory, but this win at Cheltenham was sweet, particularly when there was little to cheer about Brexit at a certain parliament down the road.The Irish came out on top on the first day of jump racing’s answer to the Olympics with four winners in seven races. They were led by Co Meath trainer Gavin Cromwell’s shock but resounding victory with Espoir D’Allen in a sensational Champion Hurdle, the highlight of the opening day and arguably the festival.It was only horse racing, not the donkey derby at Westminster, that anybody wanted to talk about.“Oh listen, I’m taking the week off. Thanks!” said Limerick racehorse owner JP McManus, waving The  away when asked if he was watching the latest developments around Brexit.“Yeah, I don’t get involved in that. See you later!” said former Liverpool and England footballer Jamie Redknapp, walking away when asked the same question in the winners’ enclosure.Luckily, there was plenty else to discuss with the racing.Cromwell’s successIt was a fairy-tale win for Cromwell, the soft-spoken farrier who was visibly stunned by his first victory in the Champion Hurdle.“I am just lost for words – just brilliant, unbelievable,” said Cromwell.It came after another McManus-owned runner Buveur D’Air – bidding for a hat-trick of successive victories in the race – fell at the third fence, sending gasps echoing around Prestbury Park.McManus may not have his hat-trick with Buveur D’Air but he had a triple with Espoir D’Allen.“Listen, any time you win the Champion Hurdle you are happy. You can’t be too fussy,” he said.There was nothing cavalier about Cromwell’s own commentary around the stunning victory. Of jockey Mark Walsh’s ride, the taciturn trainer thought briefly and then said: “Perfection.”He promised to return to defend the title: “I don’t think there is anywhere higher you can go,” he said.A dramatic day of racingStratospheric Irish spirits were set early.Ruby Walsh, Cheltenham’s most successful jockey, banished the ghosts of last year’s injury-marred festival with victory on Klassical Dream in the opening Supreme Novice’s Hurdle. It brought Willie Mullins his 62nd Cheltenham winner, another record for the Carlow-based trainer, and shouts of “Go on the Rubes!”“Sure what else would you do?” said Walsh when asked if he liked the love shown by the large Cheltenham crowd. “You’d spend the other 300 days of the year looking around with no one looking at you.”The Kildare man, just off his 59th Cheltenham winner, admitted that he and Mullins did not have a raft of “odds-on shots” this year but loads of “inidual chances” that are “not all going to click”.He was right. There were more gasps on a dramatic day of racing when Walsh suffered a nightmare fall at the last while leading on Benie Des Dieux in the Mares’ Hurdle.Irish morale was lifted again when Rachael Blackmore landed her first Cheltenham Festival winner on A Plus Tard in the Novices’ Handicap Chase. The crowd lapped it up as she stood and jabbed the air afterwards.Elsewhere, at the end of an eventful day of racing, Dublin punters John Mulligan, Dave Chapman and Paul Griffith toasted Espoir D’Air’s 16-1 victory and other wins as they contemplated whether they would return to Cheltenham if Brexit meant fewer Irish horses travelling next year.“If you don’t have that competition between the Irish and the UK horses, then absolutely you would have to think about whether you would come or not,” said Mulligan.“The standard of racing would drop,” added Griffith.Brian Carey from Co Clare, down €70 with “not one winner” on the first day, struggled to figure out why his Irish favourites had failed to “get up that hill” but would not dream of betting on Brexit.“No, no, no,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3822947.1552421053!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit explained what has just happened and what happens next","story":"European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has warned the UK there will be no third negotiation after Theresa May clinched legally binding Brexit assurances with the European Union.

Photograph: Patrick SeegerEPASpecifically, the measures tried to address concerns relating to the Irish border backstop, the guarantee that there will be no hard border. The Brexiteer group of MPs and the DUP have argued that the backstop provisions in the withdrawal agreement could see the UK “trapped” – stuck in a trading arrangement that they don’t want with the EU in the long term. The latest agreement between the EU and UK underlined that both sides would make every effort to avoid using the backstop – and to find a way out of it quickly if it is used. The UK also gave its interpretation of an arbitration system, designed to solve rows in relation to the backstop, arguing that this gives it further reassurance.However the deal started to unravel early on Tuesday. UK attorney general Geoffrey Cox announced that earlier legal advice he had given – that the UK risked being trapped in the backstop arrangements – remained unchanged, even if the risk of this happening was now less than previously. By lunchtime the indications were that both the Brexiteer European Research Group and the DUP both felt the deal did not deliver what they were looking for. Most of the ERG and the DUP voted against the deal, which went down by a large majority of 149 votes.Why has the backstop become such a big deal?Because it cuts to the heart of the Brexit argument and pushes the UK to define what it wants life after Brexit to look like – something UK politics is finding very hard to do. And because the DUP have the whip hand in the House of Commons, supporting Theresa May’s government. To ensure there would be no hard Irish border – one where checks on goods movements are needed – the withdrawal agreement includes the backstop as an insurance policy, something which would apply unless and until some other way to avoid a hard border was found. This would be achieved by the UK staying in a basic customs unions with the EU and Northern Ireland following all of the EU’s customs and regulatory rules. In this way no checks would be needed at the Irish Border and limited checks would be needed on goods, food and animals crossing the Irish Sea. So what happened on Monday night?Following weeks of negotiation, Theresa May’s dash to Strasbourg produced three items.The first was what is called an instrument, a document which sits alongside the withdrawal agreement and gives an agreed interpretation of it. It underlines the commitment of both sides to try to avoid using the backstop by reaching a new trade deal and also to examine other technological alternatives. Progress would be reviewed regularly every six months under a process in the agreement. It includes reference to both sides making “ best endeavours” to avoid the backstop. It says that if the EU was found to have acted in bad faith by a joint arbitration agreement, the UK could “suspend” the backstop for a period.The second change was in the political declaration, a document accompanying the withdrawal agreement outlining how both sides see the future relationship working. It also underlines the commitment to work quickly on a new trade deal and look at alternatives to the backstop.What does it mean?It would give the UK more assurance that the EU side will do all it can to avoid using the backstop – certainly in the long term. And it did underline how the UK feels the arbitration mechanism could be used, if the talks do break down. However it would not give the UK a unilateral exit route from the backstop. It could not decide itself simply to abandon it – it would have to use the mechanisms in the agreement. This is more or less what the UK attorney general concluded. He said that what was agreed in Strasbourg does “ reduce the risk” of the UK being “indefinitely and involuntarily detained” within the backstop provisions, at least in so far as this was due to bad faith by the EU or lack of engagement by it in seeking alternatives. However, crucially, his original legal advice was unchanged, which was that the UK could end up with no way out of the backstop agreement. This undermined the chances of the vote passing. However the AG told the Commons that this was a political decision, as opposed to a strictly legal one. What does the ‘meaningful vote’ mean?The decision by MPs to reject the agreement again leads to new uncertainty. The scale of the defeat means it is unlikely the Commons would ever pass the deal in its current form – and the EU has said no further changes are on the table. The Commons need to approve a withdrawal agrement if the UK is to leave the EU in an orderly fashion and enter the transition period, which would avoid the chaos of a no-deal exit and the threat to the UK – and Irish – economies. Irish business will watch tomorrow in particular for details of UK plans for how tariffs would apply after a no-deal Brexit, a key issue for exporters and importers.Theresa May said she would stick to her promise, in the event of rejection, to allow MPs to vote on Wednesday on whether or not they supported a no-deal exit and – if they rejected a no-deal – to vote on Thursday on whether they wanted an extension to the Article 50 exit period. They could well vote against a no-deal and for an extension. But as the EU side has to agree to an extension and it will want some reason to do so, it is hard to predict what would happen. A number of senior EU figures, including chief negotiator Michel Barnier and European Council president Donald Tusk were last night warning that no-deal risks were increasing.Discussions could move to the EU summit on March 21st-22nd, just a week before Brexit. An extension might be agreed to allow more time to talk or to give more time to prepare for a no-deal. But as the rest of the EU has not formally discussed this, it is not clear exactly what attitude it will take. Beyond that it is unclear whether the prime minister could retain the support of her party, or there might even be a UK general election. There is support in the House of Commons for a softer Brexit – involving closer trading links with the EU – and speculation that MPs may try to grab control of the agenda to force events in this direction.However the rejection by MPs of the agreement also puts the risk of a no-deal exit back on the table. By severing trading links between the EU and UK overnight this would lead to disruption and significant economic risk for the UK – and for Ireland . So there will be considerable drama around Wednesday’s vote. It remains the case that to avoid a no-deal exit, something has to be agreed between the two sides and politically supported in the UK. Theresa May made this very point in her brief speech after the deal. It is the default option and a way to avoid it has still to be found.

Photogrpah:  EPAMPs have overwhelmingly rejected the British Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal in the House of Commons.A vote on her latest proposals agreed in Strasbourg on Monday night were resoundingly rejected in a vote after 7pm on Tuesday.The deal was rejected by 391 votes to 242. That was less than the record 230-vote margin she suffered in January, but still a resounding repudiation of two years of painstaking work. With the deal all but dead, Parliament will probably vote to postpone Brexit this week, and lawmakers - including some of May’s own Cabinet - will likely try to maneuver to force the government to rip up its Brexit plans and start again.Mrs May said afterwards she was still passionate about delivering on the result of the Brexit referendum and wanted to do so in an orderly way.She that the choices facing the UK were “unenviable”, but because of the rejection of her deal, “they are choices that must be faced”.She added that she “profoundly regrets the decision this House has taken tonight”.  “I continue to believe that by far the best outcome is the UK leaves the European Union in orderly fashion with a deal. “And that the deal we have negotiated is the best and indeed only deal available.”The House of Commons’ second rejection of the EU-UK Brexit deal has “significantly increased” the risk of a damaging “no-deal” orce, a spokesman for European Council President Donald Tusk said. “We regret the outcome of tonight’s vote,” the spokesman said. “On the EU side, we have done all that is possible to reach an agreement ... it is difficult to see what more we can do.” “With only 17 days left to 29th March, today’s vote has significantly increased the likelihood of a ‘no-deal’ Brexit ... Should there be a UK reasoned request for an extension, the EU27 will consider it and decide by unanimity.” The rejection was expected after leading Tory Eurosceptics and the DUP said earlier they would vote against her agreement.The DUP had said in a statement that the British prime minister had not achieved sufficient progress in her Brexit negotiations “at this time” but that it was still possible to reach a deal with further talks.The so-called “Star Chamber” of lawyers convened by the Leave-backing European Research Group found that agreements reached by Mrs May in 11th-hour talks in Strasbourg do not deliver the legally-binding changes the Commons has demanded.Their judgment came after British attorney general Geoffrey Cox told MPs that the changes “reduce the risk” that the UK could be trapped indefinitely in the backstop, but do not remove it altogether.Mr Cox said that “the legal risk remains unchanged” of the UK being unable to leave the backstop without EU agreement.Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Cox had confirmed that “no significant changes” had been secured in two months of negotiations and the Government’s strategy was “in tatters”.Speaking in the House of Commons on Tuesday, Mrs May defended her plan as a good deal compared to a series of unattractive alternatives. “If this vote is not passed tonight, if this deal is not passed, then Brexit could be lost,” a hoarse-voiced Mrs May said. Mrs May said seeking an extension to the Brexit negotiating period would hand control of the process to the EU. Now that Mrs May’s deal has been rejected, MPs will be given the opportunity on Wednesday to vote on whether to leave without a deal and on Thursday on whether seek a delay to Brexit.“It would not change the debate or the questions that need to be settled - it would merely pass control to the European Union,” Mrs May told parliament of a possible extension. “They would decide how long an extension to offer, meaning we may not get what we ask for, they could even impose conditions on an extension. That could mean moving to a Brexit that does not meet the expectations of those who voted to leave or even moving to a second referendum.”Charles Walker, vice-chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs, had warned that defeat in the second “meaningful vote” on the withdrawal agreement on Tuesday evening would lead to a general election.Mrs May’s deal was rejected by 230 votes in a Commons ballot in January.Mr Walker told BBC Radio 4’s World At One: “If it doesn’t go through tonight, as sure as night follows day, there will be a general election within a matter of days or weeks.“It is not sustainable, the current situation in parliament.”Mr Cox’s advice was issued the morning after Mrs May’s dash to Strasbourg to finalise a deal with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker which she said would reassure MPs that the backstop arrangements to avoid a hard border in Ireland after Brexit would not become permanent.The pair agreed a “joint instrument” setting out the legally-binding nature of their promises to seek alternative arrangements to avoid the need for a backstop, as well as a “supplement” to November’s political declaration making clear that they will seek swiftly to seal a deal on their new trade and security relationship.Alongside these documents was a “unilateral declaration by the UK” which sets out “sovereign action” by which Britain could seek to have the backstop removed if the EU acted in bad faith.On a day of high drama in Westminster, the cabinet gave its backing to the package at its weekly meeting chaired by the prime minister at 10 Downing Street.Mrs May said passing the vote would allow the country to move on to a brighter future, while the alternative was uncertainty with no guarantee of what happens next.Before heading to the Commons to address Tory MPs and make a statement to the House, she concluded the meeting by saying: “Today is the day. Let’s get this done.”But momentum seemed to be shifting against the prime minister, as Mr Cox released his advice.He said that the documents agreed in Strasbourg “reduce the risk that the United Kingdom could be indefinitely and involuntarily detained” in the backstop if the EU fails to show good faith in negotiating a trade deal to replace it.But he warned that the question of whether a satisfactory agreement on a future UKEU relationship can be reached remains “a political judgment”.And he said “the legal risk remains unchanged” that if no such agreement can be reached due to “intractable differences”, the UK would have “no internationally lawful means” of leaving the backstop without EU agreement.In a statement to the Commons, Mr Cox told MPs: “There is no ultimate unilateral right out of this arrangement. The risk of that continues.“But the question is whether it is a likelihood, politically.”Moments later, the Star Chamber issued its opinion: “Yesterday’s documents considered inidually and collectively do not deliver ‘legally binding changes’ to the WA or to the (backstop) Protocol.“They fail to fulfil the commitment made by government to the House in response to the Brady amendment ‘to obtain legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement’.”Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said on Tuesday morning the agreement reached between the UK and the EU on Monday night is “positive” and “does not undermine the backstop”.Speaking in Government buildings, Mr Varadkar said the outcome was “positive”.“I hope and trust that the withdrawal agreement will now be endorsed by the House of Commons”, Mr Varadkar told reporters at an 8am press conference in Government Buildings.At a late-night joint press conference with Mr Juncker on Monday, Mrs May said she “passionately believed” that three new documents provided the legal assurances critics of her stance had called for.“Now is the time to come together to back this improved Brexit deal and to deliver on the instruction of the British people,” she said.Mr Juncker warned that if MPs voted down the deal a second time, “there will be no third chance”. And he said that any extension of the two-year article 50 negotiation process could not go beyond May 23rd unless the UK took part in European Parliament elections beginning that day.If the package passes the Commons, leaders of the 27 remaining EU states will be asked to endorse the new documents at a scheduled European Council summit in Brussels on March 21st-22nd, before the final step of ratification by the European Parliament.– AgenciesDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

At this time, only four devices have been recovered.When the suspicious packages were reported to the policeExtensive advice has already been issued to relevant businesses and sectors to be vigilant for and report suspicious packages to police.

The attaché allegedly treated him like a “personal slave” who was “on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week”.It emerged yesterday during proceedings at the Central London Employment Tribunal that he also allegedly offered Mr Ahmed a £50,000 bribe to drop the unfair dismissal case against him in a bid to “buy his silence”.Mr Ahmed, a 79-year-old British citizen of Somali heritage, was sacked from the Embassy in 2013.He wished to bring his case to tribunal years ago, however it was halted for more than a year until a Court of Appeal ruling in a 2015 which meant that embassies could not claim diplomatic immunity against staff bringing legal actions. The landmark ruling meant that Mr Ahmed was able to proceed with his case.Details of the Mr Ahmed’s allegations have now been heard for the first time as his case against the Qatari embassy and Mr Al-Ansari continued.Mr Ahmed, claims he suffered racist and ageist discrimination which he claimed left him feeling like he was “in prison. As well as alleging that he was repeatedly called “old man”, “dog” and “dirty one” and \u0027abd\u0027 in Arabic - which translates as “black slave” - he claims that he was physically attacked twice between 2007 and 2013.The pensioner\u0027s claim form, seen by The , also details the allegation that he was offered a bung to drop his case.“I had no intention though of returning to my job and didn’t take the offer because I wanted justice rather than have my silence bought,” Mr Ahmed claimed.The court heard that he worked at the Mayfair embassy in between 2004 until 2013. His contract details his job title as ‘night security officer’ and working hours from 4pm until 9.30am from Monday to Friday.However Mr Al-Ansari, made a “personal arrangement” with him involving paying him lump cash sums of cash and tips in exchange for carrying out favours such as running errands.He claimed he would often instruct him to “keep the change” from £20 and £50 notes for buying lunch and lump payments totalling between £800 to £1,000 a month. He added that over the course of his employment he gave Mr Ahmed around £10,000.Edward Kemp, for Mr Ahmed, said that there were no bank accounts and no audit trail “Those payments were never made and that’s the truth.” He added that that the “private arrangement” was merely a smokescreen to cover up the truth of the relationship” that Mr Ahmed was his “personal slave”.Mr Ahmed’s claim was delayed while the courts ruled on whether the staff of foreign embassies were entitled to employment rights. In 2017 the Supreme Court ruled that it was incompatible with European human rights law for embassies to claim immunity from employment laws.Mr Al-Ansari and the Qatari Embassy deny all the allegations.

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightThe star of the event – hinted at in the invitation –\u0026nbspis going to be Apple\u0027s brand new subscriptions service. It will be something like Netflix or Amazon Prime, offering you films and TV for a monthly cost.Plenty of the actual shows and films that are coming to this have been leaked in some form, since Apple has had to work with the notoriously chatty entertainment industry. It has meant the process has been a lot less secretive than normal, and there have been months of rumours.Apple confirms March event with TV service and news expectedNow those rumours are coming to a head, and the event will see the launch of that service. It\u0027s likely to come with some exclusive and original content at launch, as well as a range of films and TV by other companies.As well as streaming videos, Apple is rumoured to be offering a news and magazine subscription service. It appears that people will be able to sign up on their iPad or their computer, and then receive regular issues.Apple already offered this kind of service, when the iPad\u0026nbspfirst came out – a feature called Newsstand allowed people to sign up for magazines and pay for them\u0026nbspthrough Apple. And it has been rolling out subscriptions more generally, encouraging app makers to make their products available through regular payments.But the new version is expected to receive new features, as well as more attention.This event has repeatedly been said to be a services one, and they are likely to be the star of the show. But there could be some hardware, if only in service of the software.If that happens, it\u0027s most likely to be an iPad. It makes perfect sense as a way to show off video and magazines from the new subscription services, and the updates do tend to come in March.The new iPad\u0026nbspupdate isn\u0027t expected to be a drastic rethink, and indeed will keep familiar features that disappeared from the iPad Pro, such as the headphone jack and the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. But it will probably get the usual changes, like faster processor and better cameras.Ever since they were released, rumours have swirled about an update to the AirPods. And it might finally be coming – soon, if not at this event.Suggested new features for the new earphones have been various: better Bluetooth technologies, improved batteries, always-on Hey Siri and maybe even breakthrough features like health monitoring through your ears.Rumours have suggested that Apple could actually release the earphones and the case separately. So Apple could choose to only launch the new wireless charging box at the event, and then update the earphones later this year.AirPower\u0026nbspwas first mentioned in 2017 – and hasn\u0027t really been heard from since. It was meant to be a charging mat that would allow users to wirelessly power their iPhones, Apple Watches and AirPods all at once, but technical issues appear to have delayed its release.Now would be as good a time as any for it to arrive, if Apple has fixed those problems, or to at least make some mention of where it is. It would also slot in nicely with the new AirPods, since the wireless charging case was always intended to work with AirPower.It\u0027s unlikely that there\u0027ll be much other hardware, and there almost certainly won\u0027t be anything major like a new iPhone.Apple could offer an updated colour for the iPhone XR, for instance, or new bands for the Apple Watch. But those products, and every other, are likely to have their own events and will be held back from this one to avoid them overshadowing it.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Not long after he became children’s minister in January 2018, Mr\u0026nbspZahawi announced the appointment of a private company called Spectra First to\u0026nbspget more than 50 businesses to provide work-based opportunities to young people leaving the care system, including every government department.The competition to say the stupidest thing about Brexit has been wonDiary: Slick work brings in the cash for Tory MP Nadhim ZahawiNeigh way! MP Nadhim Zahawi apologises for stables expense claims“My diary secretary here is brilliant, I would hire her in a heartbeat,” Mr Zahawi says of one of his own hires. He has, since this interview took place, made her a permanent member of staff.\u0026nbsp“All they need is an opportunity in life. You just have to think about these kids in the round. You have to think about their life and their experiences slightly different to, dare I say it, our kids.”Mr Zahawi could not have had a more different start. He arrived in the UK at the age of nine,\u0026nbspthe child of Kurdish parents fleeing the war in Iraq. His first school was Holland Park, a comprehensive in west London. He later moved to Ibstock Place, a private school, and King’s College School, at the time an\u0026nbspindependent school for boys in Wimbledon.\u0026nbspHe won a place at University College London to study chemical engineering, but quickly showed an interest in businesses and started a property company after graduating. In business, he is best known for YouGov, the polling company he co-founded in a garden shed in 2000. He remained its chief executive until 2010, when he was elected to parliament.He gave up several additional business interests when he was\u0026nbspmade education minister in a cabinet reshuffle\u0026nbspin January 2018, including a £350,000-a-year, part-time job at Gulf Keystone, an oil company, and a 50 per cent stake in Zahawi and Zahawi, a firm he founded with his wife Lana in 2010.\u0026nbspBut Mr Zahawi\u0026nbspstill remembers how difficult it was to arrive in the country as a young boy, with no way to communicate.\u0026nbsp“You’re wrenched away from your friends and you come to a new country, you have to start all over again,” he says. “I sat at the back of the class, I didn’t want to get laughed at, trying to string the words together to make a sentence.”Language, he quickly understood, would be the key to moving ahead. “I worked out very quickly that if you communicate well, doors open for you,” he says.\u0026nbspI ask him whether he feels young people from Syria and Afghanistan trying to get to this country in search of a better life should be given the same opportunity. He explains that his family went through the weren’t asylum seekers, but\u0026nbspapplied for settled status through the immigration system to\u0026nbspset up a business in the UK. He believed that people who work hard should be allowed to come to the UK.\u0026nbsp“We’ve got a rigorous immigration system to do that,” he says. “We’ll be able to decide our own immigration policy post-Brexit. For genuine asylum seekers we should be welcoming.”Mr\u0026nbspZahawi backed leaving the European Union. “Brexit appeals to me for no other reason than I thought we could reform within the EU, but when that became undeliverable for David Cameron I reluctantly backed Brexit because I thought the direction of travel for the EU is not right for us.”He says he doesn’t believe the German people have bought into the so-called transfer union, in which wealth within the EU ends up supporting weaker southern economies. He also believes Britons\u0026nbspwould never back the idea of a European army, an idea loathed by Brexiteers, but also seen as highly unlikely: “We’re better off exiting and wishing them luck in their endeavours but securing a trade deal so that we have access to the single market.”He never set out to be a politician. But a chance encounter at university piqued his interest.\u0026nbsp“At the University College of London union, on the first week at university, there was a bloke handing out the Socialist Worker\u0026nbspoutside. It was thin and small and I politely declined his offer at which point he was so aggressive, I thought I would go and find out about what the other side thinks,” he remembers.He was elected Conservative councillor in Putney in 1994, where he remained until 2006. In the interim, he helped run Jeffrey Archer’s unsuccessful campaign for Mayor of London in 1998. He was selected by the local Conservative association for the safe Tory seat of Stratford-on-Avon in 2010 and was re-elected in 2015\u0026nbspand 2017.\u0026nbspAs a member of parliament, Mr Zahawi has voted for reducing the rate of corporation tax and against an amendment in parliament on homes under a certain rent limit being “fit for human habitation”, notable because he is reported to have spent £25m\u0026nbspbuying property around London for buy-to-let and commercial use.\u0026nbspHis success in property has come later in life. After university, Mr Zahawi started an estate agency, but the business suffered when the property market entered a downturn in the Eighties. Mr Zahawi and his business partners were forced to liquidate.“The lesson there was that you don’t know how hard it is to make money unless you lose money,” he says. “It’s well worth all of us remembering in politics that every morning, millions of people get up and start a business or work in a small business and we have to make sure we deliver for them. It really does matter\u0026nbspthat what we do here does not hurt them and their prospects.”Small businesses are expected to be hit hardest by the UK’s decision to leave the EU. Surveys show many businesses have already been affected. Business investment fell for four consecutive quarters in 2018 for the first time since the financial crisis, according to the ONS.\u0026nbspEighty per cent of businesses considered Brexit uncertainty to have already had a negative impact on their investment decisions, according to a survey conducted in October 2018 by the Confederation of British Industry. Falling numbers of migrants have created a squeeze among employers, with the manufacturing industry in particular facing the biggest worker shortage in 30 years, according to the British Chambers of Commerce.Are we heading for a softer Brexit next week?What exactly will be better for small businesses after Brexit? Mr Zahawi doesn’t pause for breath: “One, we’ll be able to trade with the rest of the world. Two, we should be able to trade healthily with Europe and continue to have that trade. And three we’ll have our own policies on immigration or any other issues delivered in the UK.”Despite the challenges of his work, Mr Zahawi says he pinches himself every morning to think that he has ended up where he has. “Look at me today, a boy born in Baghdad, now a member of parliament for Shakespeare and a minister in Her Majesty’s government,” he says. “This country is an amazing country, it really is.”We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write. That’s why, in an era of political lies and Brexit bias, more readers are turning to an independent source.

In 2008, he joined Lehman Brothers on an industrial placement as part of his degree at the University of Bath. Within three months, global financial markets had spiralled into meltdown leading to the collapse of the fourth largest investment bank in the US, and battering swathes of other financial institutions beyond recognition.Tens of thousands of people lost their jobs and the global economy crumbled. Reflecting on that time, the now 30-year-old understands that he was much more fortunate than some of his older colleagues. As a bright-eyed graduate he was swiftly snapped up by one of the global investment banks that had emerged from the crash bruised but still breathing. He stayed with that organisation until 2012, when he took five months off to go travelling.“I was completely uninspired,” Rocha-Thomas, who now lives in Cambridge, says of his former employer. “The IT team I was part of was so far removed from any kind of purpose,” he adds. So when he got back to the UK, he decided to join The App Business, a start-up which helps large companies build mobile apps. At the time the company\u0026nbsphad 20 employees. In the seven years that Rocha-Thomas has been there, the workforce has ballooned to almost 200 and he feel like he\u0027s been instrumental in driving that expansion. He says it\u0027s been incredibly rewarding and has given him an immense sense of purpose.Rocha-Thomas\u0027 story is becoming increasingly common. Although graduate schemes at banks, consultancies and accounting firms for years represented a well-trodden path for many bright youngsters leaving top universities, signs have emerged that even some of the most prestigious employers are starting to lose their shine.How Lehman Brothers caused \u0027the worst financial crisis in history\u0027According to a study published last year by High Flyers, a market research company which specialises in student and graduate recruitment, employers in eight out of 13\u0026nbspkey industries and employment areas hired fewer graduates in 2017 than the year before, with the biggest drops in recruitment at the top accounting and professional services firms, and banking and financial companies.Just 9.6 per cent of all graduates surveyed applied for roles in investment banking, which represented the lowest proportion since 2009 when banks halted graduate recruitment in the wake of the global financial crisis. And over the past year, that trend is expected to have continued.\u0026nbspWhile some of the move is likely to have been driven by companies cutting their recruitment budget in the face of Brexit uncertainty and other economic pressures, experts say that increased competition from booming tech companies and entrepreneurial start-ups is also to blame.Created with Sketch.

Start-ups are tapping into this sentiment by offering professional newbies the opportunity to have an impact from the get go – something that would ordinarily be unthinkable in a large multinational.Gian Power worked at Deutsche Bank and PwC after graduating from Aston Business School in 2014. He quit big corporate life in 2017 to set up his own company called The Lion\u0027s Club, which brings together motivational speakers on subjects around well-being, work-life-balance, and overcoming challenges to reach your full personal and professional potential.Gian PowerYouTube)“When working at PwC, my hours were long and I spent most weekends studying. It was a sacrifice I chose to make but it was hard to find time to explore my own interests and purpose,” he says. “I wanted to be my own boss, I wanted to craft a life that makes me happy and allows me to do things that bring me happiness.”Edwin Lee\u0027s experience echoes this. He interned at RBC Capital Markets before joining JP Morgan full time in 2006 in New York, and rising to the position of managing director. At the end of 2017 he resigned and joined a friend who was setting up his own company,\u0026nbspCastle Ridge Asset Management,\u0026nbspthat uses investment strategies informed by artificial intelligence.He tells The Independent that, particularly during his final few years at the Wall Street stalwart, work-life balance became “a serious issue”.“I ran the corporate trading desk which meant I was at work before the markets opened and didn\u0027t leave until the bankers were done,” he says. Lee often worked more than 15 hours a day and if calls weren\u0027t taking over his weekends and evenings then travel to London, Hong Kong and Tokyo often was. His wife had just given birth to their daughter and he felt like he was not seeing her grow up. “It had to change”.Of his current job he says that it was a “once in a lifetime opportunity” and that the autonomy was a considerable incentive. “It would be our team and our firm to build exactly as we like.”Already back in 2014, McGraw-Hill Education commissioned a survey of hundreds of US graduates which found that 73 per cent prioritised finding a job that they enjoy over one that pays well. And almost half of respondents said that they would favour a career that is beneficial to society.iStock)Lovell Corporation, a Canadian marketing company that focuses on connecting businesses with young professionals, published a research report in 2017 based on a survey of 2,000 young people, that found Generation Z – or those born between the mid-1990s and early 2000s – to be a generation of “change-makers”. These are the young people currently entering the workforce.The top career choice for that demographic in the survey was entrepreneur, with a large proportion also citing the not-for-profit sector as their top pick.“These statistics demonstrate the inclination of younger workers to seek meaningful work that fulfils their personal goals and creates impact,” the study concluded.Gian Power on meditation and motivation in the face of family tragedyOther studies have shown that the generation of people entering today\u0027s workforce is also more sensitive to issues around ersity and inclusion, and that those people are increasingly looking for a company that reflects those qualities.\u0026nbspScores of banks, professional service firms and consultancies are still marred by a reputation of being dominated by white men, and progress towards a more erse workforce is proving sluggish. Gender pay gaps are stubborn and that\u0027s spoiling the appetite of not just young women.Speaking recently at Goldman Sachs Asset Management\u0027s annual Future Leaders Conference, Ruwan Weerasekera, the chief operating officer at Softbank Investment Advisers, the manager of the massive Saudi-Japanese backed technology fund, said that almost everyone working at his company was previously at Deutsche Bank, UBS or Goldman Sachs.Softbank attracts talent, he said, by being erse, forward looking and representing an “intersection between finance and technology”. Many of the firms his company invests in are focused on social responsibility, which he says is also a big driver for a heterogeneous pool of potential hires, and is likely one of the reasons why his current employer is the only place he has worked where “white men are in the minority”.\u0026nbspDoing well by doing goodSo what are large institutions, like investment banks, doing to combat the start-up-driven brain drain? Kathleen Hughes, a partner at Goldman Sachs, tells The Independent that her firm has recognised and acknowledged the need for change to address the priorities of the next generation.“Around 60 per cent of Goldman Sachs\u0027 workforce is millennial and they have very particular values. As they start their career, they will value things like giving back and making an impact,” she says, adding that this is something Goldman has started tapping into.When Crystelle\u0026nbspPereira\u0026nbspfirst joined Goldman Sachs she felt like she was competing in \u0027both a marathon and a sprint\u0027In recent years, Goldman launched what it calls the Analyst Impact Fund which provides an annual opportunity for the most junior workers to pitch their cases to invest in non-profit organisations they deem to be most worthy. A sizeable grant from the firm is then allocated to the winning organisation. “Giving back is important,” says Hughes, “and that\u0027s what we\u0027re addressing.”Acknowledging issues around work-life-balance and presenteeism is also high up on Hughes\u0027 list of priorities. She says that technology has represented a sea-change for the better in that flexible working is now an integral part of company culture.And the initiatives seem to be resonating where it matters. Arianna Roccio, a recent graduate who has been at Goldman Sachs for three years, says that flexibility has evolved dramatically even in the short time that she has been at the company. “It\u0027s not really about face time in the way you might think,” she says.propsects to entice employees\u0026nbsp(Getty)Crystelle Pereira, another recent graduate who works at Goldman, says that when she first joined she felt like she was competing in “both a marathon and a sprint”. Since then, however, the dialogue between graduates and their managers has improved, “especially around the importance of balance and downtime”.Other banks have also implemented measures to sweeten career prospects for potential employees and tune into the zeitgeist.\u0026nbspChuck Teixeira, chief administrative officer and head of transformation at HSBC\u0027s global banking and markets ision, tells The Independent that his company has had to “completely change our approach”.Forget Brexit. We might be approaching another global recessionCould a no-deal Brexit hit the economy sooner than we think?Political tensions in Europe could lead to a serious economic slowdownHe says that they\u0027ve recently launched internship and graduate programmes, in which new professionals are introduced to careers in data science and engineering – areas not traditionally associated with banking.“To attract talent to these programmes, we have had to get on campus face-to-face, run meet-ups and hackathons where engineers and data scientists work together to rapidly prototype products,” he explains. “We realise that HSBC is not front-of-mind for these capabilities so we are reaching out to the global market and positioning ourselves differently, including targeting talent in other industries,” he adds.\u0026nbspFkexible working needs to be intergal to company culture (GettyiStock)Will Rocha-Thomas, who these days serves on his company\u0027s team that is responsible for hiring and retaining talent, is also encouraged by the progress. But he says that large firms still have their work cut out for them, and it\u0027s not always straightforward for the entrepreneurial start-ups either.Finally, he says that another simple thing that many large and small firms are still getting wrong, is that they are not taking action in response to feedback.\u0026nbsp“This sounds obvious but it’s a struggle for many big, centralised companies where making a simple change is a huge endeavour,” he says. “When people feel unhappy about something, and feel like there’s nothing they can do to change it – even if they give honest feedback – they generally quit,” he adds.Former JP Morgan managing director Edwin Lee agrees. While he admits that there are a lot of things\u0026nbsplarge institutions are able to do to improve the satisfaction and work-life balance of staff, the shift has to first occur in the fundamental, cultural DNA of the firm. Only then can practical changes be implemented. And that\u0027s where he sees the hurdle.He says that measures like paid leave, flexible working arrangements, sabbaticals or even mobility opportunities – that are frequently a given at start-ups and newer tech companies – are still often at odds with managers\u0027 immediate objectives. Those, in turn, often centre around short-term goals and the next earnings report.So perhaps the first step is to simply expand the horizon: teach managers that change happens gradually and that the long-term satisfaction of employees is as critical to the long-term health of the firm as the next quarter\u0027s profit is. Delving into the unknown is always scary, but once you\u0027re in, the opportunities might just surprise you positively.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The pound slipped to $1.30 and €1.16 after Mr Cox released his legal assessment ahead of an appearance in parliament.The falls more than erased previous gains made by the British currency on Monday after Ms May claimed to have secured “legally binding” assurances from the EU that that the backstop could not continue indefinitely.Sterling had rallied towards a 22-month high of\u0026nbsp€1.18 on Monday night,\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspapproached the $1.33 mark against\u0026nbspthe dollar.But Mr Cox’s statement that the UK would still need EU agreement to be released from\u0026nbspthe backstop triggered\u0026nbspa sharp sell-off of the pound.In his official legal advice, Mr Cox wrote that if both sides deploy ”the necessary diligence, flexibility and goodwill” that both sides are now legally bound to show, it would be “highly unlikely” that the backstop would come into play. But he went on: “However, the legal risk remains unchanged that if through no such demonstrable failure of either party, but simply because of intractable differences, that situation does arise, the United Kingdom would have, at least while the fundamental circumstances remained the same, no internationally lawful means of exiting the Protocol’s arrangements, save by agreement.”The advice makes it extremely unlikely that Ms May’s Brexit deal will be voted through by MPs, and means leaving the EU with no deal would remain a possibility.Crashing out of the EU with no deal would likely cause a significant reduction in the purchasing power of the pound as investors become more pessimistic about the future of the UK economy.We’ll tell you what’s true.

IAG insisted that the change was not related to Brexit.Ryanair said the resolutions have been passed by the board and they will come into effect on the day that UK nationals no longer qualify as EU residents.Ryanair pushes button on plan to disenfranchise UK shareholdersIn a statement to the stock market, the company said: “These resolutions will remain in place until the board determines that the ownership and control of the company is no longer such that there is any risk to the airline licences held by the company’s subsidiaries.”Shares in Ryanair fell 2.4 per cent on Monday to €11.86.Ryanair boss Michael O\u0027Leary has been vocal about his fears over a hard Brexit. Last week he called Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn “idiots” over their approach to the issue.The chief executive who has led Ryanair from a small and struggling Irish regional airline to the biggest budget carrier in Europe\u0026nbsppredicted that parliament would “fudge their way into approving Theresa May’s deal”.\u0026nbspSpeaking in Brussels, he told The Independent: “That’s probably the best short-term outcome, in that the can would be kicked down the road for another 21 months to December 2020.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

The company continues its shift to towards online-only sales, but now says it won\u0027t close as many stores as originally thought.\u0026nbspThe $35,000 base Model 3 will still be available, but the company is raising prices by 3 per cent on all other models.\u0026nbspIn a Monday filing with government regulators, Tesla now says it closed 10 per cent of its stores, but a few of those will now remain open. Another 20 per cent are being evaluated and some could remain open.\u0026nbspThe company gave no numbers, but said it would close only about half the stores that it had intended to. It has 378 stores and service centres worldwide and about 100 stores in the US.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch. Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.“As a result of keeping significantly more stores open, Tesla will need to raise vehicle prices by about 3 percent on average worldwide,” a company\u0027s statement said. “We will only close about half as many stores, but the cost savings are therefore only about half.”\u0026nbspRemaining stores could have fewer workers, but will have vehicles available for test drives and a small inventory in case people want to buy immediately, the statement said.\u0026nbspThe company also announced on Monday that it has purchased car-hauling trucks and trailers from a California company in a stock deal worth about $14.2m. Tesla paid for the purchase with about 50,000 previously authorised shares. Tesla wants to increase its vehicle transportation capacity and cut delivery times.\u0026nbspThe reversal shows that Tesla had second thoughts about shuttering the stores and whether buyers would make such a large purchase without a test drive. The company says it still plans to offer buyers the ability to return purchased vehicles at no cost after a seven-day or 1,000 mile test drive.\u0026nbspGartner analyst Michael Ramsey called the move “startling” and said it undermines the credibility of Mr Musk and Tesla\u0027s management.\u0026nbsp“How else can you view it except to see it as a remarkable example of lack of foresight or planning?” Mr Ramsey asked. “It\u0027s almost as if the decision was announced and made without any analysis of what the outcome would be.”\u0026nbspMr Musk probably realised that he was locked into long-term leases on the stores that he would have to pay regardless of whether they were closed, Mr Ramsey said.\u0026nbspThe move made no sense to begin with because Tesla had spent millions fighting in courts and state legislatures trying to change laws that prevented companies from selling vehicles at their own stores, Ramsey said.\u0026nbspTesla starts taking orders for Model 3 electric carBut he also said the move to close 10 per cent of stores and evaluate others is the right thing to do, and said most retail companies do that all of the time.\u0026nbspMessages were left Monday seeking comment from a Tesla spokesman.\u0026nbspShares of Tesla edged up less than 1 per cent in trading early Monday.\u0026nbspIn announcing the move on 28 February, chief executive Elon Musk said it was necessary to cut costs in order to profitably sell the mass-market version of the Model 3 sedan for $35,000. That\u0027s a price point needed to reach more consumers and generate the sales that the company needs to survive, Mr Musk has said.\u0026nbspBefore the announcement, the cheapest Model 3 started at $42,900.\u0026nbsp“This is the only way to achieve the savings for this car and be financially sustainable,” Mr Musk told reporters during a conference call announcing the change. “It is excruciatingly difficult to make this car for $35,000 and be financially sustainable.”\u0026nbspElon Musk branded \u0027a liar\u0027 by investor as US regulators seeks to oust Tesla bossOn 28 February, the company said shifting totally to online sales would allow it to lower all vehicle prices by 6 per cent, on average, including its higher-end Model S and Model X.\u0026nbspAt the time, Mr Musk also walked back the company\u0027s guidance that it would be profitable in all future quarters, saying it would post a loss in the first quarter of this year.\u0026nbspAll other major car manufacturers rely on vast dealer networks, but Mr Musk co-founded Tesla in 2003 in an effort to shake up the industry, starting with a focus entirely on a fleet of cars powered by electricity instead of petrol.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

If you’re a creator of comic books featuring the adventures of super-powered, costumed heroes, that might be a difficult rule of thumb to apply. But perhaps not for Tom King. In Mister Miracle, from DC Comics, King and artist Mitch Gerads have created one of the most critically acclaimed graphic novels of the last year, and for the Washington-based writer, he drew on experiences that not a lot of other creators working in the field today have access to.King, 40, who was born in California, spent several years as a counter-terrorism officer for the CIA, working out in the field in Iraq and Afghanistan. It’s fascinating to think about what King saw and did, and how that later informed his writing. Obviously, I suggest, if he tells me too much about it he’ll have to kill me.\u0026nbspHe’s heard that one before, of course, probably more times than he can count. “No,” he says, with what feels like an oft-trodden out reply, “if I tell you too much about it, they’ll have to kill me.”Born to a film-writer mother in Southern California, King developed a love of storytelling and an understanding of narrative from an early age. During the 1990s he interned at the offices of the two big comics publishers, Marvel and DC. His ambition, though, was to become a lawyer\u0026nbspand he graduated from Columbia University in the year 2000, intending to follow this path. He started working for the Justice Department.And then came 11 September. Like everyone else in America, King was appalled and shocked and numbed. But he also knew he wanted to do something in response. So he went on to the CIA website and discovered that they were recruiting.“They were looking to bring in a new generation of operatives to serve in this new world,” he says. “They wanted people who were good at connecting the dots. I went in maybe hoping to get a job as an information guy, I took the psych tests, and ended up as an operations officer.”Created with Sketch.Mister Miracle: The critically acclaimed graphic novel in pictures Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Photos by DC ComicsPhotos by DC ComicsKing worked out in the field in Afghanistan and Iraq for seven years, and the exact nature of his work out there is necessarily vague. When his wife fell pregnant with their first son (they have three children now) he knew he had a difficult decision to make.“The part of the job I loved was being overseas, out in the war zone, as bizarre as that might sound,” he says. “But I knew I didn’t want to do that and have a family. I didn’t want to be away from my wife and kid for a year at a time.”Returning to the US, King didn’t resume his plan to become a lawyer but instead turned to his first love, writing. But he wasn’t back in the world of comic books just yet… or at least, not quite. King wrote a prose novel, but about superheroes. A Once-Crowded Sky was published in 2012, to good notices. Writing about superheroes had regalvanised his love of comics\u0026nbspand opened the door for him to work at DC.His first gig was a series about Dick Grayson, the original Batman side-kick Robin who grew up and adopted a new persona, Nightwing. Co-written with Tim Seeley with art by Mikel Jannen, the series was the first time that King was able to draw on his CIA past, as the character quit the superhero business to become a spy.That led to more work, and to the series that first brought King to wider notice – and his first collaboration with Mitch Gerads, his Mister Miracle co-creator. Published in late 2015, The Sheriff of Babylon was a critically-acclaimed crime series about a San Diego cop who becomes a military consultant in Iraq\u0026nbspand has to solve the murder of a young local police trainee.More work followed, with King getting to write characters both classic and obscure, from Batman to the Omega Men for DC, and the Vision (the character played by Paul Bettany in The Avengers movies) for Marvel.Which led to King and Gerads working together again on what has become one of the most well-received comic books in recent years, earning plaudits from mainstream reviewers and publications especially… Mister Miracle.Mister Miracle is a character who was first introduced in 1971, created by the towering genius that was Jack Kirby for DC comics. Real name Scott Free (ouch. But it was the 1970s, and King and Gerads do a fine job of contextualising that), Mister Miracle is billed as a “super escape artist”, Houdini in a cape and mask and yellow, green and red livery. He’s always been one of those B-List characters, except to the most devoted fans, in terms of recognisability.But in an age where, thanks to the big comics companies mining their intellectual properties and breathing fresh life and mainstream appeal into characters formerly known only to the cognoscenti – s of the Galaxy, anyone? Ant-Man? Black Panther? Aquaman? Suicide Squad? – even the non-rabid comics fan seems more willing to accept stories featuring characters who aren’t Superman, Batman, Captain America or Spider-Man.DC cancels comic where Jesus learns from superhero after backlash Still, a super escape artist in a garish costume. Possibly limited scope there for anything beyond a series of set-piece daring feats, you might think. Which is possibly why Mister Miracle won so much praise by being one of the most literary and absorbing stories released by DC in some years.It opens with a shocking image… the titular character slumped on his bathroom floor, wrists cut and bleeding out over the tiles. Yes, it begins with a superhero attempting to commit suicide.“Scott Free can escape from anything,” says King. “So we thought… he’s going to keep pushing it, trying to escape from more and more difficult situations. And eventually he thinks, can I escape from death?”King and Gerads had wanted to work on another big series after the Sheriff of Babylon, and initially they pitched an idea for a Batman comic but focussing on two big villains, the Joker and the Riddler. However, the characters were already earmarked for a storyline in the main Batman comic, so it was vetoed. DC, however, threw them another option.Gerads says, “I got a call from Tom and he told me that we couldn’t do the Batman story. He said what would your second choice be, and straight away I said Mister Miracle.” Gerads pauses. “That’s absolutely true. And Tom said, well, that’s what they’ve offered us. And he sent me the pitch and the first line was, ‘Mister Miracle attempts suicide’.”Starting from that dark place, the story then expands out into an exploration of, really, the anxieties of living in the modern era. Scott Free is married to the unlikely-named Big Barda, and they are attempting to navigate the mores of family life in present-day Los Angeles. But Scott and Barda are also not of this Earth.Original Mister Miracle creator Jack Kirby dreamed up for DC comics in the 1970s a series of books that became known as the Fourth World, existing within the normal DC continuity of Batman and Wonder Woman, but also slightly apart from it. It focussed on two worlds, New Genesis, where the benevolent New Gods lived, and Apokolips, brutal realm of the tyrannical Darkseid. New Genesis and Apokolips are perpetually at war, and in a bid to broker peace, their rulers Darkseid and the Highfather agree to swap infant sons. Scott Free is the child of New Genesis, brought up in the hellish Apokolips, where he learns his craft and meets Barda, one of the fearsome Female Furies. Together they escape, and make a new life on Earth, but are called back into the war, which is where we find them in this story.Mister Miracle was originally released as a 12-issue monthly series, and has just now been collected into a single volume. But it was always meant to be read as a graphic novel. King says, “It’s like a Dickens novel, which were originally serialised. It’s meant to be read as one story.” He pauses. “Not that I’m comparing myself to Dickens, obviously.”The story is a mix of domestic life and the horrors of war. In one memorable scene, Scott and Barda fight their way over several pages through the terrors of Apokolips, holding a conversation as they do about redecorating their condo flat, building up to the tender moment – delivered as each character despatches bad guys in a sequence that looks like a platform video game – that Barda reveals she is pregnant.Mister Miracle is a very personal book for both King and Gerads. The sheer exhausting nature of war comes across in several scenes, obviously drawn from King’s experiences. And Gerads’ son was born right in the middle of him working on the series, adding extra dimension to the point where Barda gives birth.Gerads has also done artwork for Batman (DC Comics)It should be noted that comics are a very collaborative medium, and King and Gerads worked closely on the distinctive look of the story. The trend in comics these days is for big, break-out images, kaleidoscopic panels, imaginative layouts. With Mister Miracle, the team went for a nine-panel grid, most closely associated with the classic of the genre from 30 years ago, Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons’ Watchmen.That’s perhaps informed the mainstream success of Mister Miracle. It might be an odd thing to say, but reading comics is a learned skill, and not everybody gets on with the medium. A strict page design allows for easier digesting of the narrative. Gerads says, “Some people in comics think doing a grid like this must be very constricting for the artist, but that’s not the case. The magic with this is that you know exactly how the reader is going to read your page.”King likens it to “almost like three Charlie Brown cartoons on each page, three panels each, and everybody knows how to read those”.Aside from being a meditation on war and a domestic drama with dialogue that would satisfy any Netflix drama binge-watcher, there’s also a bigger storyline at play in Mister Miracle. To wit, is any of it actually happening? Is it all, in fact, the dream of a superhero who’s lying on his bathroom floor, his life slowly ebbing away?“Living life is full of ambiguities,” says King, perhaps a little ambiguously himself.Gerads is more forthcoming, and points out that Scott Free is in every single scene in the story. “We never leave Scott’s side in the entire book, we go on this ride with Scott through the story. Perhaps by the end Scott realises that it doesn’t matter if it’s real or not, because one way or another this is what he’s lived through.”It was announced last year that one of DC’s next big movie projects will be based on the New Gods world, with Ava DuVernay (A Wrinkle In Time) lined up to direct. Rumours emerged in the last few weeks that Scott Free and Big Barda will actually form the central focus of the movie. Whether it will end up as an adaptation of this story, neither King nor Gerads could say, but if it does it could end up DC’s most interesting movie yet.King and Gerads are hatching another collaboration for DC, which they aren’t at liberty to discuss (though King drops the hint that there’s a clue within Mister Miracle as to what that might be) and in the meantime, King is writing for the publisher Heroes in Crisis, which deals with the post-traumatic stress disorder that could actually affect superheroes given the ongoing violence and battles they deal with on a daily basis.Does he find writing about the things he’s seen and experience during his time with the CIA cathartic? Or is it painful? Perhaps a bit of both, he says.“I think me writing about war has been more necessary than anything else,” he says. “War and the damage that war does has formed the basis for a lot of my work. I write to give my kids a better life and the best thing for me has been to draw on what I’ve done. But I think I might be ready to talk about something else, now.”Mister Miracle by Tom King and Mitch Gerads is out now and\u0026nbsppublished by DC Comics.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The pound slipped to $1.30 and €1.16 after Mr Cox released his legal assessment ahead of an appearance in parliament.The falls more than erased previous gains made by the British currency on Monday after Ms May claimed to have secured “legally binding” assurances from the EU that that the backstop could not continue indefinitely.Sterling had rallied towards a 22-month high of\u0026nbsp€1.18 on Monday night,\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspapproached the $1.33 mark against\u0026nbspthe dollar.But Mr Cox’s statement that the UK would still need EU agreement to be released from\u0026nbspthe backstop triggered\u0026nbspa sharp sell-off of the pound.In his official legal advice, Mr Cox wrote that if both sides deploy ”the necessary diligence, flexibility and goodwill” that both sides are now legally bound to show, it would be “highly unlikely” that the backstop would come into play. But he went on: “However, the legal risk remains unchanged that if through no such demonstrable failure of either party, but simply because of intractable differences, that situation does arise, the United Kingdom would have, at least while the fundamental circumstances remained the same, no internationally lawful means of exiting the Protocol’s arrangements, save by agreement.”The advice makes it extremely unlikely that Ms May’s Brexit deal will be voted through by MPs, and means leaving the EU with no deal would remain a possibility.Crashing out of the EU with no deal would likely cause a significant reduction in the purchasing power of the pound as investors become more pessimistic about the future of the UK economy.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The explicit standardisation of commodity codes and tariffs associated with trade deals have little relevance to holidaymakers.”The EU says: “If you fall ill or have an accident during a visit to another EU country, as an EU citizen you have the right to receive the necessary public healthcare in any EU country under the same conditions as people in the host country.” The EHIC also works in Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein.

Buried in a document called Beyond the Horizon: The Future of UK Aviation, the government says “the UK will not fall below current standards of protection when we leave the EU”814 Entry regulations to the European UnionFrom 11pm GMT on 29 March 2019, UK travellers will become “third-country nationals” when travelling to Schengen countries and subject to the standard rules of admission for citizens of nations such as the US, Japan and Australia. That means there must be at least 90 days (roughly three months) left on your passport beyond your intended date of departure.914 Online registration prior to travel – ETIASFrom 2021, non-EU nationals who do not require a visa to enter the Schengen area – including British travellers – will need to request prior authorisation to visit Schengen countries.A large number of travel providers – even including National Express coaches – have added “Brexit clauses” to their terms and conditions. These generally specify that they will not be liable for “consequential losses” as a result of Brexit-related issues1114 ‘Fast track’ lanes for passport control entering EU countriesBritish passport holders will not be able to use them, and must join the queue for third-country nationals.The ferry industry insists vessels will continue to sail. The UK Chamber of Shipping says: “Unlike the carriage of cargo, trade deals do not have a significant effect on the cruise and passenger ferry industry. The explicit standardisation of commodity codes and tariffs associated with trade deals have little relevance to holidaymakers.”The EU says: “If you fall ill or have an accident during a visit to another EU country, as an EU citizen you have the right to receive the necessary public healthcare in any EU country under the same conditions as people in the host country.” The EHIC also works in Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. From 30 March 2019, the law banning mobile phone firms from charging extra for calls and data in Europe will cease, though operators have yet to set out exactly what will replace it. In theory, mobile phone firms can impose whatever fees they think the market will bear.“Consequently, with effect from hard Brexit day, UK nationals will not be permitted to acquire ordinary shares in the company,” Ryanair said.It comes after IAG, which owns British Airways, Aer Lingus and Vueling, also placed a limit on non-EU shareholders. IAG insisted that the change was not related to Brexit.Ryanair said the resolutions have been passed by the board and they will come into effect on the day that UK nationals no longer qualify as EU residents.Ryanair pushes button on plan to disenfranchise UK shareholdersIn a statement to the stock market, the company said: “These resolutions will remain in place until the board determines that the ownership and control of the company is no longer such that there is any risk to the airline licences held by the company’s subsidiaries.”Shares in Ryanair fell 2.4 per cent on Monday to €11.86.Ryanair boss Michael O\u0027Leary has been vocal about his fears over a hard Brexit. Last week he called Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn “idiots” over their approach to the issue.The chief executive who has led Ryanair from a small and struggling Irish regional airline to the biggest budget carrier in Europe\u0026nbsppredicted that parliament would “fudge their way into approving Theresa May’s deal”.\u0026nbspSpeaking in Brussels, he told The Independent: “That’s probably the best short-term outcome, in that the can would be kicked down the road for another 21 months to December 2020.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

The animal, which died when it was about seven-years-old, is one of the best preserved mammoths known to science. The team extracted tissue samples from the animal’s bone marrow and muscle, which they described as “well preserved”. They then began searching for cell nuclei remains. In total, 88 nucleus-like structures were collected from the muscle sample.Created with Sketch.Woolly mammoth found in Siberia to be displayed in Tokyo Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A 39,000-year-old female woolly mammoth, which was found frozen in Siberia, Russia arrives at an exhibition hall in Yokohama, south of TokyoThe snout of a 39,000-year-old female Woolly mammoth, which was found frozen in Siberia, Russia.

The team said following the procedure a “pronucleus-like structure budded from the injected … mammoth nucleus”.They also found possible signs of repair to damaged mammoth DNA.Despite the successes, the scientists did not observe the further cell ision necessary to create a viable egg, “possibly due to the extensive DNA damage in the transferred nuclei”.This marks a “significant step toward bringing mammoths back from the dead”, researcher Kei Miyamoto, one of the study’s authors told Japan’s Nikkei news outlet.“We want to move our study forward to the stage of cell ision,” he added, but acknowledged “we still have a long way to go”.Woolly mammoth DNA found in illegal ivory samples seized in CambodiaLast woolly mammoths on Earth ‘killed off by lack of water’Farmer digs up 15,000-year-old woolly mammoth in fieldMost mammoth populations died out between 14,000 and 10,000 years ago. The last mainland population existed in the Kyttyk\u0026nbsppeninsula of Siberia until 9,650 years ago.But the species survived for another 5,000 years on Siberian islands, which became cut off from the mainland by retreating ice following the last ice age. The last known population remained on Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean until 4,000 years ago – well beyond the dawn of human civilisation, but finally becoming extinct around the time of the construction of the pyramids of Giza in Egypt. There is no scientific consensus on the chief cause for the creatures’ demise, but climate change significantly reduced habitable parts of the globe for mammoths, and they were also hunted by humans.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The company continues its shift to towards online-only sales, but now says it won\u0027t close as many stores as originally thought.\u0026nbspThe $35,000 base Model 3 will still be available, but the company is raising prices by 3 per cent on all other models.\u0026nbspIn a Monday filing with government regulators, Tesla now says it closed 10 per cent of its stores, but a few of those will now remain open. Another 20 per cent are being evaluated and some could remain open.\u0026nbspThe company gave no numbers, but said it would close only about half the stores that it had intended to. It has 378 stores and service centres worldwide and about 100 stores in the US.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch. Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.“As a result of keeping significantly more stores open, Tesla will need to raise vehicle prices by about 3 percent on average worldwide,” a company\u0027s statement said. “We will only close about half as many stores, but the cost savings are therefore only about half.”\u0026nbspRemaining stores could have fewer workers, but will have vehicles available for test drives and a small inventory in case people want to buy immediately, the statement said.\u0026nbspThe company also announced on Monday that it has purchased car-hauling trucks and trailers from a California company in a stock deal worth about $14.2m. Tesla paid for the purchase with about 50,000 previously authorised shares. Tesla wants to increase its vehicle transportation capacity and cut delivery times.\u0026nbspThe reversal shows that Tesla had second thoughts about shuttering the stores and whether buyers would make such a large purchase without a test drive. The company says it still plans to offer buyers the ability to return purchased vehicles at no cost after a seven-day or 1,000 mile test drive.\u0026nbspGartner analyst Michael Ramsey called the move “startling” and said it undermines the credibility of Mr Musk and Tesla\u0027s management.\u0026nbsp“How else can you view it except to see it as a remarkable example of lack of foresight or planning?” Mr Ramsey asked. “It\u0027s almost as if the decision was announced and made without any analysis of what the outcome would be.”\u0026nbspMr Musk probably realised that he was locked into long-term leases on the stores that he would have to pay regardless of whether they were closed, Mr Ramsey said.\u0026nbspThe move made no sense to begin with because Tesla had spent millions fighting in courts and state legislatures trying to change laws that prevented companies from selling vehicles at their own stores, Ramsey said.\u0026nbspTesla starts taking orders for Model 3 electric carBut he also said the move to close 10 per cent of stores and evaluate others is the right thing to do, and said most retail companies do that all of the time.\u0026nbspMessages were left Monday seeking comment from a Tesla spokesman.\u0026nbspShares of Tesla edged up less than 1 per cent in trading early Monday.\u0026nbspIn announcing the move on 28 February, chief executive Elon Musk said it was necessary to cut costs in order to profitably sell the mass-market version of the Model 3 sedan for $35,000. That\u0027s a price point needed to reach more consumers and generate the sales that the company needs to survive, Mr Musk has said.\u0026nbspBefore the announcement, the cheapest Model 3 started at $42,900.\u0026nbsp“This is the only way to achieve the savings for this car and be financially sustainable,” Mr Musk told reporters during a conference call announcing the change. “It is excruciatingly difficult to make this car for $35,000 and be financially sustainable.”\u0026nbspElon Musk branded \u0027a liar\u0027 by investor as US regulators seeks to oust Tesla bossOn 28 February, the company said shifting totally to online sales would allow it to lower all vehicle prices by 6 per cent, on average, including its higher-end Model S and Model X.\u0026nbspAt the time, Mr Musk also walked back the company\u0027s guidance that it would be profitable in all future quarters, saying it would post a loss in the first quarter of this year.\u0026nbspAll other major car manufacturers rely on vast dealer networks, but Mr Musk co-founded Tesla in 2003 in an effort to shake up the industry, starting with a focus entirely on a fleet of cars powered by electricity instead of petrol.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

If there is a solution to the current impasse it can only be found in London,” he told reporters in Brussels.Michel Barnier, the European Commission’s chief negotiator, issued a similar statement, saying that “the EU has done everything it can to help get the withdrawal agreement over the line” and that “the impasse can only be solved in the UK”.The spokesperson for Mr Tusk said the bloc\u0026nbspregretted the outcome of this evening’s vote and that it was “disappointed that the UK government has been unable to ensure a majority for the withdrawal agreement agreed by both parties in November”.Why might the UK have to take part in European elections this May?The Government was defeated by\u0026nbsp391 to 242 after opposition parties again teamed up with Tory rebels to reject the plan\u0026nbsp– a huge margin that was slightly down on the previous record defeat. The defeat is still the third largest for a government in British history, however.The EU response recalls a warning given by European Commission president Jean-Claude\u0026nbspJuncker\u0026nbspon Monday, ahead of the vote. Mr\u0026nbspJuncker\u0026nbspsaid there would be “no third chances” for Britain and that there would be no further talks were the withdrawal agreement to be defeated on Tuesday.As European Council president, Donald Tusk speaks on behalf of member states – who Britain will need to convince if it decides it wants to extend Article 50.The spokesperson for Mr Tusk addressed the possibility of an Article 50 delay, warning that member states would expect “a credible justification for a possible extension and its duration”. He added that “the smooth functioning of the EU institutions will be to be ensured” – a possible reference to upcoming European Parliament elections in May, which the UK may have to participate in.Barnier said Brussels had done all it could to pass the deal\u0026nbsp(Reuters)“With only 17 days left to 29 March, today’s vote has significantly increased the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit. We will continue our no-deal preparations and ensure that we will be ready if such a scenario arises,” he said.“The EU for its part continues to stand by the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop, which serves to prevent a hard border in Ireland and preserve the integrity of the single market unless and until alternative arrangements can be found.”Created with Sketch.

This is, as has been widely stated, wrong, and her tweet has been deleted, but there is another side to the story which is more favourable to McVey.First, though, the actual facts. As things stand the UK and Denmark have an absolute exemption from the obligation to join the euro. This was the famous “opt-out” from the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, which set in train the long process towards adopting the euro across much (though even now not all) of\u0026nbspthe EU. All the other member states of the EU in 1992 have now adopted the single currency some members that joined after 1992 and after the first wave of euro nations abolished their currencies in 1999\u0026nbsphave also adopted the euro – Slovenia in 2007, followed by Cyprus and Malta in 2008, Slovakia in 2009, Estonia in 2011, Latvia in 2014 and Lithuania in 2015.Altogether 19 of the 28 member states are members of the euro, including all of the largest economies except the UK. It has made trade and cross-border movements of money much smoother and made international pricing of goods and services more transparent, reducing business costs and adding modestly to economic growth.\u0026nbspHowever, despite this, others countries have not joined the euro, despite this being a formal accession treaty obligation once certain criteria are met. For example, Sweden, which joined in 1995, still retains its krona and shows little inclination\u0026nbspto adopt the euro nor, it seems,\u0026nbspare the European Commission and European Central Bank pushing the point.Should we purchase euros for a trip to Italy in April?By contrast other, weaker economies that might wish to ditch their own currencies in favour of the euro are not yet qualified to do so. The experience of Greece, which was allowed to join the currency probably before its economy was strong enough, has been instructive.\u0026nbspAs well as the UK and Denmark, other EU members still outside include Poland, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Romania and Bulgaria.The problems with the single currency are well publicised, and have caused real economic harm and human misery among those countries that have\u0026nbspendured years of austerity to try and make themselves more competitive, andor pay for the banking rescues required after the financial crisis.\u0026nbspThat is why richer countries – which would be expected to bankroll the system – are wary of joining. The Greek example is why some weaker countries are also cautious about the disciplines imposed by the system, and why the richer countries are also disinclined to hurry them into the arrangement.\u0026nbspPresident Macron’s proposal for a “fiscal” union to complement the monetary union – effectively moving some macroeconomic decisions on overall levels of taxes, public spending and borrowing to the European level – have been rejected by Germany, which usually pays the bills (Finland and the Netherlands also chip in). So this inherently unstable system seems set to continue on its present basis.Whether the UK would be allowed its euro opt-out if it rejoined the EU in a few years’ time is impossible to predict,\u0026nbspbut it would not necessarily be granted.Where\u0026nbspMcVey and her cited journalist have a point is that the euro was originally regarded as essential to ensure a “level playing field” under the single market. Countries, in other words, cannot gain an “unfair” advantage by devaluing or “manipulating” their currency as a way out of their uncompetitiveness (usually stemming from poor productivity, high wages and too much debt).That logic applies as much today and in the 2020s as is it did in 1992. There may come a point when the political pressure on non-euro members to join the currency – whatever the legal formalities – would become so intense as to be unbearable. In that sense non-euro members states are always at long-term risk of being pushed towards the euro – but Denmark and the UK do have that strong international treaty protection in the final analysis.Equally, it is true that the euro might fragment long before such pressures on members to join\u0026nbspre-emerge. It seemed perfectly possible that it would collapse a few years ago. Today the precarious Italian public finances and banking system represent a mortal danger to the euro system, as the Italian economy is far bigger than Greece, and “too big to save”.\u0026nbspSo, in the end, Esther McVey and her critics might both be proved equally wrong.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

Just like the referendum there are strongly held and equally legitimate views on both sides.For that reason, I can confirm that this will be a free vote on this side of the House.Ms May said she had personally struggled with this choice but the best way to leave the EU was in an orderly way with a deal.She confirmed that the motion would say parliament declines to approve leaving the European Union without a Brexit deal on March 29, and notes that leaving without a deal remains the default in UK and EU law unless this House and the EU ratify an agreement.If MPs reject no-deal, as many expect,\u0026nbspa third vote will follow on Thursday on whether to authorise Ms May to demand\u0026nbspan extension of the two-year Article 50\u0026nbspprocess.Labour accused her of putting party management above the public interest by allowing her MPs\u0026nbspthe freedom to back a no-deal exit.A Labour spokesperson said: Allowing a free vote on no deal shows Theresa May has given up any pretence of leading the country.Once again, she’s putting her party’s interests ahead of the public interest.It comes as the prime minister\u0027s Brexit strategy was dealt a devastating blow by\u0026nbspMPs, who voted by 391 to 242 against the deal, despite an eleventh-hour assurance from European Commission chief\u0026nbspJean-Claude Juncker in Strasbourg\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspthe UK cannot be trapped in the controversial backstop arrangement indefinitely.Although\u0026nbsptonight\u0027s defeat was a reduction on the\u0026nbsprecord 230-vote loss in the\u0026nbspfirst meaningful vote\u0026nbspin January, Ms May is running out of time to find a solution with\u0026nbspjust 17 days to go until Brexit day on March 29.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Different countries hold their votes on slightly different days, as suits them.Why might the UK have to take part?The EU treaties are very clear: every EU member state has to hold European parliament elections, because the union’s citizens have an inalienable right to be represented at an EU level. If the UK hasn’t left by the end of May, it would still be an EU member state, and have to take part.The legal text of the Lisbon Treaty says that “in each member state, members of the European parliament shall be elected as representatives of the citizens of the union”. It’s pretty unambiguous.Couldn’t the UK just not hold the elections since we’re leaving?There isn’t any legal basis on which a member state could decide not to take part in elections – there’s no specific opt-out for countries undergoing Article 50.The general view is that there is no legal way for Britain to avoid the elections. The UK’s own Electoral Commission has set aside a contingency fund in case it needs to hold the elections, and it says it has “assumed that, should the elections go ahead in the UK, polling day would be Thursday 23 May”.Other member states including Belgium and Finland have also asked British nationals living in their territory to register – just in case they have to take place.Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, agrees. He said himself in a letter on Tuesday: “I would like to stress that the United Kingdom’s withdrawal should be complete before the European elections that will take place between 23-26 March this year. If the United Kingdom has not left the European Union by then, it will be legally required to hold these elections, in line with the rights and obligations of all member states as set out in the treaties.”What would happen if the UK just didn’t take part and everyone turned a blind eye?The EU is based on rules, and those rules are governed by an independent court – the European Court of Justice. It would be extremely unlikely to turn a blind eye, especially if confronted with a legal challenge.Given the weight of legal evidence that Britain must take part – and our ided political system – there would almost certainly be a legal challenge. Even if nobody from the UK mounted a challenge, other groups across the EU could use the argument to challenge the results of the European elections.Given the European Commission is selected based on the results of the European elections, the consequences could be significant – undermining the mandate for the Commission to pass laws.\u0026nbspWhy does holding the elections cause complications?The UK’s seats in the European parliament have already been split up amongst the other member states, so it\u0026nbspreally needs to know whether Britain is taking part before the seats are allocated.If the UK left part-way through a parliamentary term there would also be the question of what to do with missing seats. Does the parliament just have a hole in it for just under five years until the next round of votes? Do the countries hold by-elections? Because different answers to these questions benefit different people, they will be difficult and isive to solve.\u0026nbspWhat’s the political backdrop to this?Aside from the practical reasons, there are also political reasons why the UK isn’t really wanted in these elections. The focus of this round of elections is expected to be stemming the tide of populism in Europe. Some polls suggest populist parties could win a third of seats.As one of the biggest member states, the UK returns a lot of MEPs\u0026nbsp– and it mostly returns them to the populist groups. Ukip\u0026nbspwon the 2014 elections in the UK and provides the bulk of members to the anti-EU EFFD group, while even the Conservatives sit in the hard-right ECR group, away from the European mainstream.Donald Trump’s former adviser Steve Bannon has said he wants to unite populist forces across the EU, and British MEPs\u0026nbsp– who are also more Atlantacist than their continental cousins –\u0026nbspcould give him the numbers to make a go of it.Are British parties prepared for the elections?\u0026nbspSome parties, such as the Liberal Democrats and SNP, have already selected candidates lists, based on the possibility that there might be elections. Former Ukip leader Nigel Farage has also set up a new Brexit party to stand in the elections and keep his platform in the European parliament – from where he attacks the EU and British government. Other parties – including Labour and the Tories – haven’t picked candidates – yet.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

India’s trade and commerce bureaucracy is the most mercantilist and outright protectionist in the world.”His article came as Theresa May rushed to Strasbourg on Monday to agree “legally binding” assurances with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker.Created with Sketch.

And authoritarians around the world would like nothing more than a fully disembowelled West, no longer confident of what it actually stands for any more.”Mr Rudd called on Britain to “use this critical fortnight to start turning all this around”.“For Britain’s economic self-interest, as well as the wider political interests of the western community of nations, Britain should remain in the EU,” he said.He urged Labour and Conservative Remainers to unite to delay Brexit beyond 29 March, and said they should then support a second referendum to offer Britain “a clear, informed choice between two tangible, concrete proposals: either voting for Theresa May’s deal, or for Britain to remain in the Union”.We’ll tell you what’s true.

These are unprecedented times. Judging things on past norms is no longer the case.The prime minister is having to navigate a very, very difficult course through the unique set of circumstances we are being presented with.Chuka Umunna, who quit Labour to form The Independent group of breakaway MPs, said the jury\u0027s out on whether the vote made a second referendum result more likely.He told BBC News: Ultimately with gridlock in this place continuing it\u0027s hard to see how you resolve the gridlock without referring it back to the people.London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: I welcome tonight\u0027s vote to reject the Government\u0027s bad Brexit deal.The Prime Minister needs to put our city and our country first, and withdraw Article 50. It\u0027s time to give the British public the final say on Brexit.Here is Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s full response to the prime minister this evening.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“The government has been defeated again by an enormous majority and it must accept its deal is clearly dead and does not have the support of this House.\u0026nbsp“No Deal must be taken off the table. We’ve said that before and we’ll say that again.\u0026nbsp“The House has got to come together with a proposal that could be negotiated. The Labour Party will put forward that proposal again.\u0026nbsp“The Prime Minister is threatening us all with the danger of No Deal, knowing full well the damage it will do to the British economy.\u0026nbsp“The Prime Minister has run down the clock and the clock has been run out on her. It’s time that we have a General Election and the people can choose who their government should be.”\u0026nbspHere is the prime minister\u0027s full response to her loss in the House of Commons this evening\u0026nbspOn a point of order, Mr Speaker,I profoundly regret the decision that this House has taken tonight.I continue to believe that by far the best outcome is that the UK leaves the EU in an orderly fashion with a deal, and that the deal we have negotiated is the best and indeed the only deal available.Mr Speaker, I would like to set out briefly how the Government means to proceed.Two weeks ago, I made a series of commitments from this despatch box regarding the steps we would take in the event that this House rejected the deal on offer. I stand by those commitments in full.Therefore, tonight we will table a motion for debate tomorrow to test whether the House supports leaving the European Union without a deal on 29th March.The Leader of the House will shortly make an emergency business statement confirming the change to tomorrow’s business.This is an issue of grave importance for the future of our country.\u0026nbsp Just like the referendum, there are strongly held and equally legitimate views on both sides.For that reason, I can confirm that this will be a free vote on this side of the House.I have personally struggled with this choice as I am sure many other Honourable Members will.\u0026nbsp I am passionate about delivering the result of the referendum.\u0026nbsp But I equally passionately believe that the best way to do that is to leave in an orderly way with a deal and I still believe there is a majority in the House for that course of action.\u0026nbsp And I am conscious also of my duties as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of the potential damage to the Union that leaving without a deal could do when one part of our country is without devolved governance.I can therefore confirm that the motion will read:“That this House declines to approve leaving the European Union without a Withdrawal Agreement and a Framework on the Future Relationship on 29 March 2019 and notes that leaving without a deal remains the default in UK and EU law unless this House and the EU ratify an agreement.”I will return to the House to open the debate tomorrow and to take interventions from Honourable Members.\u0026nbsp And to ensure the House is fully informed in making this historic decision, the Government will tomorrow publish information on essential policies which would need to be put in place if we were to leave without a deal. These will cover our approach to tariffs and the Northern Ireland border, among other matters.If the House votes to leave without a deal on 29 March, it will be the policy of the Government to implement that decision.If the House declines to approve leaving without a deal on 29 March, the Government will, following that vote, bring forward a motion on Thursday on whether Parliament wants to seek an extension to article 50.If the House votes for an extension, the Government will seek to agree that extension with the EU and bring forward the necessary legislation to change the exit date commensurate with that extension.But let me be clear. Voting against leaving without a deal and for an extension does not solve the problems we face.The EU will want to know what use we mean to make of such an extension.This House will have to answer that question.\u0026nbsp Does it wish to revoke Article 50?\u0026nbsp Does it want to hold a second referendum?\u0026nbsp Or does it want to leave with a deal but not this deal?These are unenviable choices, but thanks to the decision the House has made this evening they must now be faced.Jeremy Corbyn says the government has been defeated by an enormous majority - and the government\u0027s deal is clearly dead.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe says the House has to come together around a proposal - and Labour will continue to put forward its plans.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe says we should have a general election.\u0026nbspTheresa May says tomorrow MPs will be allowed a free vote on a no-deal scenario. She says voting against this does not solve the problems the country faces, she says.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIf the\u0026nbspCommons\u0026nbspdeclines to approve a no-deal Brexit, a vote on extending\u0026nbspArticle 50 will take place on Thursday.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBREAKING - the result are in. Theresa May has lost the vote by 391- 242\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThis a loss of 149 - the third biggest defeat on record.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHer deal was crushed by 230 votes in January - the biggest defeat in parliamentary history.\u0026nbspTory former Cabinet minister Theresa Villiers said she would also vote against the deal.She told the Press Association: I voted against this deal two months ago because it was a bad deal, and it still is.Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is now speaking in the chamber as the debate on May\u0027s deal comes to a close. He says the deal is an abject failure and will not deliver frictionless trade.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSir Keir says it is a sorry outcome after two years of negotiations.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspI could not have possibly seen the scale of the calamity upon us now.\u0026nbspConservative former minister Sir Edward Leigh\u0026nbsptells MPs in the Commons: I appeal to fellow\u0026nbspBrexiteers - you may not like the deal, it\u0027s not perfect, but it delivers Brexit\u0026nbspand let\u0027s go for it.\u0026nbspPlease allow a moment for the liveblog to loadWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.After losing the vote in January, Ms May said she would head back to Brussels with the aim of reopening the withdrawal agreement, and securing legally binding changes to the Northern Irish backstop. So far, she has failed on both counts, with the EU 27 united in resistance to such efforts.\u0026nbspUnless the prime minister secures last-minute concessions this weekend, in an eleventh-hour dash to Brussels, many in Westminster expect the second “meaningful vote” to be resoundingly defeated too.\u0026nbspBritain does not want a long delay to Brexit saga, poll showsHowever, if parliament springs a surprise and her deal passes on Tuesday, Brexit will be secured – although\u0026nbspMs May would probably have to request a short extension to the Article 50 timeframe so that\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspcan\u0026nbspdebate and vote on key pieces of legislation that are required to be in place for exit day.\u0026nbspAssuming the prime minister does not win the day, the scale of defeat will be key.If it is similar\u0026nbspto January, it could be fatal for Ms May, who will undoubtedly face claims\u0026nbspthat she has wasted precious time in the last two months. Her deal will be considered dead.In this case, the prime minister would probably be out of options, and will be under considerable pressure to go down a softer Brexit route. This would risk\u0026nbspa potential\u0026nbspsplit in\u0026nbspher party while she seeks a majority for an alternative deal and effectively forms a parliamentary alliance\u0026nbspwith Jeremy Corbyn.Created with Sketch.

This would almost certainly require a short delay to the Brexit process.Mr Corbyn may also decide the time is opportune –\u0026nbspif Ms May loses badly –\u0026nbspto put down a second no-confidence motion in the government in an effort to force a general election, though\u0026nbspit still does not appear the Labour leader has the numbers in the Commons to win such a vote. \u0026nbspHe has also committed his party to backing an\u0026nbspamendment\u0026nbspon a second referendum, so this could also be the week in which MPs finally test whether there\u0026nbspis a majority for such a path. The consensus is that there is not, and it may be that proponents of a further public vote on Brexit do not test the Commons just yet.Votes on no-deal and Article 50 extensionCrucially, if the prime minister loses the “meaningful vote” on her deal, she has vowed to hold two further votes this week: one on a no-deal Brexit (due to take place on Wednesday), and a second an approving an extension to Article 50 and delaying Britain’s exit from the EU (Thursday). This is where there might be fireworks.EU accused of ‘playing games’ in last-ditch Brexit negotiationsBanks ‘broke agreement to suspend Brexit campaigning’ after Cox murderCorbyn tells May second defeat for her deal is ‘the end of the road’EU says Britain can leave backstop but Northern Ireland must stayPound falls after May warns of ‘moment of crisis’ over BrexitIt has been clear for some\u0026nbsptime that there is no majority in the House of Commons for a disorderly (or “cliff-edge”)\u0026nbspbreak from the bloc. As such, it is likely that MPs will vote to take a no-deal departure off the table.The following day there will be a vote on extending Article 50, and it is anticipated\u0026nbspthere will be a majority for this course of action.Ultimately, it is up to the EU 27 whether to grant any extension: if they agree,\u0026nbspterms and conditions might easily be attached. They could, for example, demand a lengthy extension rather than the\u0026nbsptwo-month period preferred at Westminster.Ms May will have to decide whether or not to give her own MPs\u0026nbspa free vote on the contentious issue of the no-deal scenario. It is an incredibly isive topic among Conservatives, and throughout the negotiations,\u0026nbspthe prime minister has deployed the threat of a no-deal outcome. \u0026nbspIf the prime minister decides not\u0026nbspto give Tory\u0026nbspMPs a free\u0026nbspvote, and whips them\u0026nbspto keep no deal on the table, it could easily lead to a significant number of ministerial resignations from the Remain-leaning figures at the top of government who would probably rebel.\u0026nbspAs the prime minister herself said, reject the deal and “no-one knows what will happen”\u0026nbspbut what we do know is that\u0026nbspMs May is about to enter one of the most dangerous weeks of her time in office.\u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

Some Turkish and US intelligence officials, as well as US lawmakers, believe the killing could only have been ordered by powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.The Saudi authorities, who launched an investigation,\u0026nbsphave repeatedly denied the prince’s involvement and instead have said\u0026nbsprogue Saudi officials were behind the gruesome death.Created with Sketch.

I want to help others who faced the same problems as me. When you make calls against the government you need help,” he added.\u0026nbspThe royal rebel is part of a wing of the royal family that has clashed with Mohammed bin Salman. He\u0026nbspsaid his own father and sister remain under house arrest in the country.Flight returns to airport after woman leaves her baby in the terminalSecurity concerns as Jared Kushner goes rogue in Saudi ArabiaTrump nominees for Saudi and Iraq ambassadors face grillingGoogle refuses to remove Saudi govt app that lets men track womenSaudi Arabia prepares to prosecute women’s rights activistsPrince Khaled\u0026nbsphad previously revealed to The Independent that he believes the Saudi authorities had planned to kidnap him just 10 days before Khashoggi disappeared in October. \u0026nbspIn eerily similar circumstances, the prince, whose mother is Egyptian,\u0026nbspclaimed he was promised a “large cheque” and millions of dollars if he agreed to fly to Egypt to meet regime officials at the Saudi consulate in Cairo.The prince refused, believing it to be a ruse to lure him back to Saudi Arabia, as part of an escalating crackdown orchestrated by Mohammed bin\u0026nbspSalman to silence his critics.Saudi Arabia, under the de facto leadership of Mohammed bin\u0026nbspSalman, has faced\u0026nbspmounting\u0026nbspinternational criticism for its rights record amid accusations it had\u0026nbsprepeatedly drugged and extradited regime critics, including princes,\u0026nbspback to the country.\u0026nbspIn January a group of British MPs\u0026nbspcalled for access to a group of a dozen women’s rights activists who were arrested and reportedly tortured. They remain in captivity.\u0026nbspThis is despite the fact that Mohammed bin\u0026nbspSalman has launched a high profile reform drive, including scrapping a controversial\u0026nbspdriving ban on female citizens.\u0026nbspApart from pushing for regime change in Saudi Arabia, Prince\u0026nbspKhaled\u0026nbspaims to support citizens who have fled injustice, torture and harm in Saudi Arabia, by helping them seek asylum in Germany and other European countries.\u0026nbspHe has now teamed up with Saudi activists across Europe\u0026nbspand enlisted the support of immigration lawyers and translators in Germany to create the\u0026nbspnetwork.It also hopes to cooperate with international media to highlight alleged attacks against Saudi citizens and will establish a commission to lobby for the release of those unjustly arrested within Saudi Arabia.\u0026nbsp“I am so far the only royal family member in this movement but I hope others will join me. Jamal Khashoggi is one of thousands\u0026nbspof citizens who have been killed unjustly. We want to rise up against his injustice to save the country from collapse,” he added.Prominent Saudi regime critic Abdul-Aziz Amoud, who has been based in Dublin since 2014,\u0026nbspjoined the movement after setting up an initiative in Ireland to protect vulnerable Saudi women fleeing abusive families in the country, where they are subject to controlling male\u0026nbspship laws.“The most important role of Saudi opposition outside of the country is to help others. And one of the most effective ways to make changes is through international pressure and helping asylum seekers,” he told The Independent.\u0026nbspI am so far the only royal family member in this movement but I hope others will join me“Women in particular are super-vulnerable. The Saudi authorities have repeatedly used their embassies to work against people, even in the case of domestic issues like Rahaf.” \u0026nbspEssen-based legal translator Dr Abdel-Salam Ismail is\u0026nbspamong those who will be a part of the team helping Saudis seek asylum.“Khaled has taken a very important step to break with the royal family in order to restore democratic freedom to the people of Saudi Arabia,” he told The Independent.\u0026nbsp“We will not only be engaging lawyers who are specialised in asylum cases but employing people to take care of things like bringing family members over and integration including applying for schools,” Dr Ismail said.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

And he has consistently pointed out that the original dream that gave rise to it is under threat.It is exactly 30 years since Sir Tim submitted a paper to his colleagues at CERN, suggesting a way of sharing data across networks,\u0026nbspunder the title “Information Management: A Proposal”. The humble title belies the importance of what was contained inside, which included a complete sketch for the networked information system that would on to become the internet\u0026nbspwe know today.That would take some time, however. It would take a year-and-a-half for the name “WorldWideWeb” to be proposed, and it would take many months before the public could actually access a public version of the web even then, it didn’t look anything like the rudimentary graphical pages we associate with the early internet, let alone the huge and complex system you and your computer have navigated to get to this article.That modern web has brought with it a series of technologies that would have seemed impossible and unimaginable at the time the web was first being proposed:\u0026nbspinstant streaming of just about any film you would like to watch and\u0026nbspinternet connections inside of fridges. But it has also brought with it threats, some of which could undermine the very fabric of the web itself.In 2017, when the web turned 28, Sir Tim laid out what he saw as the three challenges that threatened it. All of them are at least as pressing then as they were two years ago, and some were eerily prescient about the ways the web would develop.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightThe first warning was that “we’ve lost control of our personal data”. He noted that many websites run on a business model that lets users have free content in exchange for their personal data, which allows them to harvest vast amounts of personal information, which in turn can make the internet a dangerous place to retain any kind of privacy or to discuss important but sensitive topics.Inventor of World Wide Web calls for crackdown on fake newsSince Sir Tim wrote that message, the world was rocked by the Cambridge Analytica scandal and a whole host of other revelations about the amount of data being collected on private people and how it is being used.The second challenge he noted was that it is “too easy for misinformation to spread on the web”. Noting that “most people find news and information on the web through just a handful of social media sites and search engines”, he described how websites spreading hoaxes, and false stories can do so relatively easily, and that the system can be gamed to spread that even more quickly.Third, he said that online political advertising “needs transparency and understanding”. Such advertising is become incredibly sophisticated, he noted, and when combined with the vast amount of data companies like Facebook are tracking can make it very easy to manipulate those people who see it.The scandal over political advertising in events such as the 2016 election and the Brexit vote is still continuing, and campaigners still criticise the relatively limited transparency that has been introduced on platforms that claim to be looking to limit it.A year later, in 2018, he shared another set of challenges, which largely related to the fact that the world has crossed over the point where more people use the web than don’t. That brings a whole host of questions of access and openness, he suggested.The threats that are posed to the web still very much exist, he noted. “But I remain committed to making sure the web is a free, open, creative space — for everyone,” he wrote last year.By closing the digital ide and helping people get online, stopping the control of the web lying with a small number of very big companies, and by making the discussion around the future of the web more erse, he claimed those threats could be avoided.Sir Tim has been consistent in arguing that the web is really a communal endeavour – and calling on that community to help save it from the threats it is facing.“I may have invented the web, but all of you have helped to create what it is today,” he wrote in 2017. “All the blogs, posts, tweets, photos, videos, applications, web pages and more represent the contributions of millions of you around the world building our online community.”That was a vision that was present in the original proposals for the world wide web, begun 30 years ago today. There, Sir Tim described a vision of CERN staff on the web\u0026nbspas “several thousand people, many of them very creative, all working toward common goals”.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightIn his letter, Sir Tim said it would be “defeatist and unimaginative” to assume that the web could not be changed for the better given how far it has come in its first 30 years, but urged governments, organisations and the public to work together to improve the current system and make it available to everyone.“If we give up on building a better web now, then the web will not have failed us – we will have failed the web,” he said.Man who created the internet’s warnings about its futureHe outlined what he called three sources of dysfunction that must be addressed – “deliberate, malicious intent, such as state-sponsored hacking and attacks, criminal behaviour, and online harassment” “system design” which has created “perverse incentives where user value is sacrificed, such as ad-based revenue models that commercially reward clickbait” and the “viral spread of misinformation”.He also called for a response to the “unintended negative consequences” of the web, which he said had led to “the outraged and polarised tone and quality of online discourse”.The letter says: “While the first category is impossible to eradicate completely, we can create both laws and code to minimise this behaviour, just as we have always done offline.“The second category requires us to redesign systems in a way that change incentives. And the final category calls for research to understand existing systems and model possible new ones or tweak those we already have.”A global debate is currently taking place over the need for increased regulation of online spaces, with the UK Government expected to publish a White Paper on the issue in the near future.The World Wide Web Foundation is currently developing what it calls a Contract for the Web, which aims to ensure access to the internet is recognised as a human right and is built for the public good.“You can’t just blame one government, one social network or the human spirit. Simplistic narratives risk exhausting our energy as we chase the symptoms of these problems instead of focusing on their root causes. To get this right, we will need to come together as a global web community,” he said.Sir Tim said the Foundation was working with governments and other organisations on building the contract, but called on politicians and wider society to do more to help build a better web and ensure the contract was not a “list of quick fixes”.“Governments must translate laws and regulations for the digital age. They must ensure markets remain competitive, innovative and open. And they have a responsibility to protect people’s rights and freedoms online,” he said.“We need open web champions within government – civil servants and elected officials who will take action when private sector interests threaten the public good and who will stand up to protect the open web.“Companies must do more to ensure their pursuit of short-term profit is not at the expense of human rights, democracy, scientific fact or public safety. Platforms and products must be designed with privacy, ersity and security in mind.“And most important of all, citizens must hold companies and governments accountable for the commitments they make, and demand that both respect the web as a global community with citizens at its heart.“If we don’t elect politicians who defend a free and open web, if we don’t do our part to foster constructive healthy conversations online, if we continue to click consent without demanding our data rights be respected, we walk away from our responsibility to put these issues on the priority agenda of our governments.”Sir Tim, who is due to appear at the Science Museum on Tuesday as part of the web’s anniversary celebrations, concludes by labelling the need to get the rest of the world online as “urgent”.“The fight for the web is one of the most important causes of our time. Today, half of the world is online. It is more urgent than ever to ensure the other half are not left behind offline, and that everyone contributes to a web that drives equality, opportunity and creativity,” he said.“The web is for everyone and collectively we hold the power to change it. It won’t be easy. But if we dream a little and work a lot, we can get the web we want.”Additional reporting by Press AssociationBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The EU knows those Cabinet rebels will help vote down No Deal.Tory Nick Boles is conspiring with Corbyn over his disastrous “Norway Plus” idea — the worst possible option.Remainer Lords are trying AGAIN to force the Government into a permanent restrictive customs union with Brussels.Most appallingly, ex-Attorney General Dominic Grieve is openly colluding with the French to postpone Brexit for  months, long enough for a second referendum. If MPs vote to delay on March , Theresa May will be virtually powerless to refuse France’s demands. Why does Grieve still have the Tory whip And yet some Brexiteer MPs still think it’s safe to vote down the deal next Tuesday. That the law’s on their side. That we will still leave, but with No Deal.We would love to be proved wrong — but they seem dangerously delusional.Reject the deal, and a non-Brexit they will regret forever and which will destroy their party seems vastly more likely.Brexiteers will have made the biggest gamble of their lives and lost.THE Sun has always liked Prince Harry. But he needs to remember who he is — and stop talking out of his backside.It is not the job of the Royals, living an immensely privileged le on taxpayers’ money and goodwill, to preach vacuous politics to children.We don’t know, though we can guess, where Harry gets hollow profundities such as “every blade of grass, ray of sun and raindrop is crucial to our survival”. But at least that does no actual harm.Unlike telling kids the media “distorts the truth”, “tries to manipulate the power of positive thinking” and should be ignored. Or to imply the young generation are morally superior to those who, for example, fought the war or suffered the bleak economic hardships since.If he wants to be a social justice warrior regurgitating fashionable conspiracy theories and hippie banalities, so be it.But we can’t help feeling Harry and Meghan are riding for a fall.LABOUR, to its shame, is finally being investigated for illegal anti-Jewish racism by the very equalities body it once set up.Only the BNP merited a similar probe.The Equality and Human Rights ­Commission suspects Corbyn’s mob “discriminated against people because of ethnicity and religious beliefs”.Decent members will be horried, says Labour MP Ruth Smeeth.Indeed they will.

The EU thinks, with justication, that MPs won’t allow No Deal so it feels under no pressure to make signicant concessions.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, is telling the UK thatit doesn’t like the backstop, it can have a Northern Ireland-only version of it — which the UK has already rejected. One minister fully briefed on the negotiations tells me: “We’re at ‘what the hell do we do ’ time.”But without a change to the backstop, Theresa May’s deal is going down to another heavy defeat on Tuesday.That won’t be the end of the matter, though. For the very next day Parliament will vote against leaving on March  with No Deal. Parliament will then almost certainly vote to request an extension to Article , the two-year process for leaving the EU.At this moment, the UK would be in the EU’s hands. As one weary No source admits: “They’d be in a position of being able to dictate terms.”It would be up to the EU to decide whether to grant an extension, how long it would be for and what conditions would be attached to it. How humiliating: This country’s future would be being determined in Brussels, not Westminster.The EU would almost certainly grant an extension. But what terms it would come with remains to be seen.What should worry those MPs who are voting against Mrs May’s deal because it is not a clean enough Brexit, is what Parliament would do with this extension. I understand that unless the Government indicates that it will allow the Commons to vote on ious Brexit options, an amendment will be tacked on to the extension vote to ensure that “indicative votes” are held.These votes would be on March  and the Commons would move to bind the Government to negotiate what it wants it to.Ministers would have to report back regularly to the Commons on the progress they are making. Mrs May might be in office, but she would not be in power. It is inevitable that the Brexit the Commons would mandate would be softer than Mrs May’s deal.So why, then, are so many Brexiteers not voting for her deal  Well, the problem is that many of them regard it as so flawed that they have no desire to rescue it. They would, in the words of one Cabinet minister: “Rather their hands be clean of all this.”But this isn’t PRACTICAL POLITICS. If Brexiteers won’t back Mrs May’s deal, then Brexit is ONLY GOING TO GET SOFTER.Is there any hope of avoiding this crisis  Today, it looks unlikely. But the DUP does want a deal.While they won’t accept the backstop as it currently is and were, in the words of one source, “not entirely happy” with the proposal Geoffrey Cox took to Brussels, they are eager for an agreement.If progress on the backstop was combined with a commitment from Mrs May that she would step down before phase two of the negotiations, then the deal might pass.I understand that a leading Brexiteer backbencher conveyed this message to influential figures in the Government this week. One normally loyal minister tells me: “If there’s nothing , that is the thing that has to work.”One outcome next week would avoid a crisis: Some progress on the backstop, Mrs May’s deal passing and a new PM coming in to do the next phase of the negotiations. All other roads lead to crisis.But right now, that is where we are headed.LABOUR will, officially, back a second referendum next week.But with as many as  Labour MPs opposed to the idea, it isn’t going to pass the Commons.Jeremy Corbyn has never been enthusiastic about a second referendum – he only backed one to prevent more defections to The Independent Group of MPs.Once he has gone through the motions of supporting one, he will feel free to pivot to other options.This was demonstrated by the fact he had a meeting with the Norway Plus group of MPs this week, who want the UK to stay in the EU single market.A soft Brexit has an obvious appeal for Corbyn. It would offer a solution to the issue while splitting the Tory Party.IT is now looking increasingly likely that the UK won’t be able to get anything on the backstop.“The EU are just not budging,” one of those intimately involved in the negotiations tells me.Bringing back a pretty much unchanged deal for a vote on Tuesday would lead to a heavy defeat for the Government, and probably by a three-figure margin.But there is another option being discussed in government. Gavin Barwell, the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, told ministers this week that one option was to bring to the Commons the proposal that the UK has taken to Brussels. The idea would then be to try to win a vote on that, to prove to the EU that such a change would get the deal through.Right now, one Downing Street source says, there is a “chicken and egg problem” as the EU doesn’t think that what the UK is proposing would get the deal through the Commons, and so doesn’t see the point in engaging with it.Some in government think that doing this would offer a way out of the votes on No Deal and an extension that threaten to create the bitterest Tory split yet over Europe.This strategy is not without risks. It isn’t certain that the Government would win this vote. There is also a danger that holding a vote on a proposal that has been rejected by the EU would end up looking absurd.But walking into a vote knowing that you are going to lose heavily is rarely a sensible governing strategy.ON Wednesday, Alan Duncan urged the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, to have the Government whip against No DealMrs May’s deal is defeated next week.Duncan warned of an eruption from the “moderate” wing of the partythis didn’t happen. Barwell pointed out that Leave ministers have accepted a lot of compromises over the past few years.The exchange demonstrated how dficult the next week will be for the Tories. The votes that would follow Mrs May’s deal failing would make every previous Tory argument over Europe look like small beer.I understand the Government is looking to contain the row through a motion that would say the UK would not leave on March  without a deal, but would try to make clear that it was still an option after that.AS Mrs May was saying there was “no direct correlation between certain crimes and police numbers”, a leaflet from the Tories’ mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey was dropping on London doormats declaring thatthe party took City Hall they would hire , more police “Helping to bring an end to rising crime”.This pledge shows the position the Government has got itself into is politically preposterous.What is needed is more police to deal with the current crisis, then action to stop children from being drawn into these gangs.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But some MPs have at least behaved with honour.Our Government of Remainers negotiated ineptly. The EU, meanwhile, focused solely on ­forcing us to vote again. It has soured relations for a generation.Remainer MPs have been a disgrace, initially promising to respect the referendum then plotting to reverse it, openly colluding with Brussels against Britain.And next week comes the killer blow.Remainers from the Cabinet down will vote to end any chance of No Deal and to postpone Brexit, perhaps long enough for a second referendum — apparently unaware of the electoral catastropheThe rogue Speaker Bercow will help.Backbench Brexiteers, by contrast, stuck both to the logic of the Brexit result — leaving the single market, customs union and ECJ control — and the repeated promises politicians made toWe admire that. We are as angry as they are at all the rest. But there is only one way now to prevail over them and begin to honour those .million votes:To back the one imperfect deal that at least secures Brexit before it’s too late.All other roads lead to political disaster.LABOUR’S hypocrisy on kne crime stinks.It voted against new Asbo-style curbs by the Home Secretary on young thugs suspected of carrying weapons. Except they were first suggested by the police and Labour Mayor Sadiq Khan.Corbyn’s Marxist mob seem to believe their only role is to brainlessly obstruct any Tory measure whatever its merits.It is mind-boggling to think this shambolic Cabinet is still better than one with Corbyn as PM and Diane Abbott Home Secretary.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are almost there.”And he’s right.In the sneering words of ex-Whitehall panjandrum John Kerr, who devised the Hotel Calornia-style check-out-but-never-leave rules for Brexit, Britain has “come to heel”.Whatever emerges from the ashes of this week’s Commons votes, nothing can conceal the humiliation this country has suffered under Theresa May’s lock-jawed leadership.The PM has tarnished one of the jewels in the British crown — respect for this once-great nation in the eyes of the world.Thanks to her, a clutch of faceless EU bureaucrats and their feckless Tory allies have shredded the UK’s reputation for statesmanship and cool diplomacy. Great Britain — the world’s fth-largest economy, nuclear power and permanent member of the UN Security Council — has been reduced to an object of international pity.Allies across the Commonwealth, America and even our erstwhile EU partnersare embarrassed to watch a great democracy grovelling before the unelected Burghers of Brussels.EvenAttorney General Geoffrey Cox s today with his famous cod-piece bulging, it’s lose-lose for Brexit.He might persuade enough Tory MPs to vote Mrs May’s botched and rebadged Chequers Deal through Parliament. But it will be at enormous cost.Barring an unlikely last- minute face-saver, Remainers have won this battle and the .million people who voted for Brexit have been comprehensively whipped.We can blame conspirators such as Tony Blair and ex-Chancellor George Osborne. We can point the finger at the BBC, Whitehall and a clutch of Cabinet plotters.We can blame the Brexiteers themselves for tripping over while stabbing each other in the back.And we can certainly blame Phil Hammond for blocking preparations for No Deal — our sole trump card in Brexit negotiations.But in the end, responsibility for this carnage lies with Mrs May. Indeed, thanks to her, Spreadsheet Phil can now bribe MPs with the £billion he saved by selling us down the river.If his chicanery succeeds, there is a remote chance Parliament will support Chequers and sign up to Brino — Brexit In Name Only. It will be a sour “victory”.History might be kind to Mrs May’s decency and her sense of public duty. But it will not ignore the catastrophic blunders which risk condemning this country to permanent vassal status.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt correctly warns Europe has just as much to lose. “This is a moment of change in our relationship between the UK and the EU and history will judge both sides very badlywe get this wrong,” he says.“We want to remain the best of friends. That means getting this agreement through in a way that doesn’t poison our relations for many years to come.”Stubborn as she is, Mrs May must know her days as PM are numbered.Losing three babies in quick succession is an unimaginable tragedy in any circumstances.In Shamima Begum’s case it underlines the recklessness of bringing children into the world of terrorist anarchy. Nothing Home Secretary Sajid Javid could have done in the few weeks since she emerged in public is likely to have saved her innocent child.The responsibility lies entirely with Shamima and her jihadi husband, Dutchman Yago Riedijk.There is no chance of her surviving what threatens to be disastrous spring council elections.Certainly there is no question of leading the Government into the next round of EU negotiations, still less risk another general election meltdown.Countless Tory supporters will risk letting Jeremy Corbyn in rather than vote for another May-led government.There is a deal to be had with pro-Brexit MPs who are threatening to inflict a final defeat on Chequers tomorrow.The consequences are unpredictable.If she promises to go by mid-summer, they will vote for her deal. If that works, she will at least be able to claim victory of a kind.It’s a long shot.

Ethiopian Airlines disaster.One plane was on its way to Gatwick and the other to Birmingham when they were seen heading back.The CAA said Turkish Airlines turned its planes back so they wouldnt get stuck in the UK, unable to take off again after a safety directive.The airline itself said it was grounding its entire fleet until the uncertainty affecting safety is cleared and flights across Europe

Europe, budget airline Norwegian announced that it was grounding its fleet  Max  planes.In a day of travel chaos:German transport minister Andreas Scheuer said  “until all doubts are cleared up, I have ordered that German airspace be closed for the Boeing  Max with immediate effect.The Irish Aviation Authority added: The IAAs decision has been made taking account of the unprecedented loss of two Boeing  MAX in recent months.The UK ban means none of the planes will be able to travel in and out of the UK or fly over its air space.TUI, which has five of the planes, said it would use a dferent model to get passengers to their destinations.Brian Strutton, general secretary of pilots union Balpa, welcomed the ban saying: Safety must come first.It is too early to know the cause of the latest crash and it is vital that air accident investigators carry out a thorough investigation to identy the cause so that measures to prevent future accidents can be put in place.The  Max  has also been grounded in China, Australia, South Korea, Singapore, Indonesia, Morocco, Mongolia, Malaysia, Poland and Oman.But US authorities said they would not be taking any decision until they have seen

don’t want Albert Einstein to be my pilot.A spokesperson for the CAA said: “Our thoughts go out to everyone affected by the tragic accident in Ethiopia yesterday.There are currently five Boeing  Max  aircraft registered and operational in the United Kingdom. A sixth aircraft is due to enter operation later this week.The US Federal Aviation Administrationis responsible for certying all Boeing  Max  models and it is the European Aviation Safety Agencythat validates this certication across the EU, including the UK.The UK Civil Aviation Authority is liaising very closely with the EASA as the facts of this incident are established.EASA said: As a precautionary measure, EASA has published today an Airworthiness Directive, suspending all flight operations of all Boeing Model - MAX and - MAX aeroplanes in Europe.The accident investigation is led by the Ethiopian Authorities with the support of the National Transportation Safety Board, as the aircraft was designed and built in the United States.EASA has offered their assistance in supporting the accident investigation.TUI has the only five  Max  aircraft operated by a UK-based airline and was due to begin flying a sixth later this week.They said in a statement: Any customers due to fly home today on a  MAX  from their holiday will be flown back on another aircraft.Customers due to travel in the coming days will also travel on holiday as planned on other aircraft.Norwegian Airlines has  in its fleet and serves London Gatwick, Manchester and Edinburgh.They confirmed they had suspended flights of the aircraft in accordance with the CAAs instruction and apologised for the inconvenience to passengers.Worried holidaymakers had taken to social media to express their fears over using the planes to fly in and out of Britain.Michael Bibby said: TUI need to ground the death plane until Boeing provide a proper fix!While Lucy Barcoo asked TUI: Can you please tell me which type of aircraft my flight home from Ibiza will be on please  Very concerned about the Boeing  Max.Kenneth Bird tweeted: Hi there @TUIUKcares @TUIUK @TUIGroup how come you haven’t grounded your Boeing  Max s  They fly over my house!

These include a fat embolism, when fat enters the bloodstream and blocks a blood vessel.In the lungs, for example, it blocks oxygen from entering the bloodstream, while in the brain it can cause a stroke – both can be fatal.Cheap overseas clinics are contributing to a rise in deaths from having the procedure, Prof Frame, a senior consultant surgeon at Springfield Hospital, Chelmsford, said.Last year a survey of  surgeons from across the world found  patients had died from a condition called a fat embolism - where the injected fat travels to other parts of the body that it shouldnt.Most of these deaths appear to have been caused by inappropriately qualied practitioners working in non-approved facilities, including homes and garages, he added.Other post-surgery problems, such as gangrene and sepsis, can also be fatal.Sarah Hemingway, representing Elite Aftercare at the inquest, told how the firm does not directly employ the surgeons themselves, and has no formal contract with the hospital involved in the surgery.But Mr Paige explained how the companys website claims to employ the best surgeons and nurses for procedures.The inquest also heard how Ms Cambridge had been asked to fill in a patient information anaesthesia form prior to travelling for the surgery, but no direct contact was made between Elite Aftercare and her GP.A provisional post-mortem examination had previously revealed that the mum died from a fat embolism caused by a cosmetic surgical procedure.It had been reported that the beautician had been paranoid about having excess stomach weight from having children, and opted for the butt lt procedure, which involves the reshaping of the buttocks by transferring fat from other areas including the stomach and back.Reports in the aftermath of her death told how Ms Cambridge had three heart attacks during the operation, which took place on August  last year.Patients make appointments at a UK office before travelling to Turkey for the surgery.The clinic’s website claims: “Elite Aftercare aims to provide a UK standard of care.”One reality star who had surgery there said last year: “It’s not a dodgy back street clinic.“I weighed up whether to have my nose job in the UK or over there and chose Turkey.“They’re constantly checking you’re all OK. They’re not going to discharge youthey don’t think you’re fit to leave the hospital. I was fine.”During Tuesdays hearing, the coroner suggested that a three-day inquest into her death would take place in early July, focusing on the contact between Ms Cambridge and Elite Aftercare, any pre-assessments done prior to the treatment, and the procedure itself.The controversial Brazilian butt lt, made famous by US reality TV star Kim Kardashian, involves taking fat from the waist or stomach and inserting it in the buttocks.The operation takes between one and two hours and involves a tiny cannula being inserted into a mm hole to extract fat.The fat is then puried and re-injected into the buttocks.According to Elite Aftercares website, Towie stars Lauren Goodger and Amber Dowding and Geordie Shore’s Chloe Ferry, have had procedures there.Former Spurs footballer Jamie OHara also had liposuction at the same Izmir clinic last year after piling on the pounds by scoffing junk food on Celebrity Big Brother."},{"url":null,"title":"luckiest woman world buys wins 30 lottery tickets","story":"Deborah Brown from Richmond, Virginia, said she first bought  tickets with the combination --- at a petrol station.But she then started seeing the same four digits throughout the day - so tested her luck further by buying another ten tickets at the same location, NBC reports.Virginia’s Pick  game lets players choose a single, four-digit number between  and .A winning number is then picked twice a day, and anyone carrying a ticket bearing that number nets them , .On the night of February , each of Browns  plays won the top prize in the draw, netting her , .I nearly had a heart attack, Brown said, according to a statement from Virginia Lottery.The odds of matching all four numbers in order are  in ,, the agency said.Brown has said she has no immediate plans for her winnings, but may renovate her home.John Hagerty, a spokesman for Virginia Lottery, said buying more than one ticket with the same series of numbers does not improve the chance of winning because only one series can win in each drawing.He added that it was unusual, but not unprecedented, that Ms Brown had picked the same combination for all her tickets.“In general, people who buy multiple tickets will spread the numbers around,” he said.“But we do see people buy multiple tickets with the same numbers in order to increase that prize.“And sometimes it works."},{"url":null,"title":"bullied pupil cries classmates surprise gift tennessee","story":"Azrael Robinson, , from Tennessee, US, was given a new pair of trainers by his friends in recognition of his selfless behaviour towards others.The teenager, who attends LaVergne High School, had previously been bullied at another school.In the viral clip, Azrael starts to sob when he unwraps and opens the box to reveal an expensive pair of Nike shoes.Two of his pals had presented him with the generous gt along with some cash and new clothes to say thank you for his kindness towards his fellow classmates.One of the pupil’s sister posted the video of the moment online.She wrote: “Today, my little sister sent me a video of what they did for one of their classmates, that’s having a hard time.“They all got together and bought him some shoes, and also donated clothes to this kid. ‘This video is so emotional  filled with love.“You just never know what kids go through, but it’s kids like them, that gives us hope.”The boy’s teacher Sonji Newman spoke to TODAY about Azrael’s kindness towards others.She said: “If they don’t understand something, he’s the first one to help.“If anything is dropped in the classroom, he’s the first one to pick it up.“If a student is down, he’s the first one to say everything is going to be okay.“They just wanted to give to him to make him feel better about himself.

The Prime Minister spent part of Monday afternoon in the sanctuary of Westminster Abbey attending a service to mark Commonwealth Day. Back in No, officials were hastily drawing-up plans to fly her to Strasbourg for emergency negotiations with EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.   At RAF Northolt in north-west London, troops were preparing a BAe plane from NoSquadron, The Queen’s Flight, for imminent departure. Swept from the Abbey in her armoured Jaguar XJL and escorted by four motorcycle outriders, diabetic Mrs May could have been forgiven for reaching for the stash of Jelly Babies and other sweets stuffed into the back pocket of a front seat of the bomb-proof limousine, stored there to boost her blood sugar levels. After a quick change of clothes in No, the PM’s blue-light convoy raced through the capital’s windy streets on its -mile journey along the A to Northolt where, on the runway, her jet was ready for the -mile sortie to the French border city. Less than an hour later, the Tory chief was meeting Mr Juncker to sign off what Mrs May hoped would be the clinching revision to get her deal through Parliament. At pm, her de facto deputy David Lidington stood at the Commons Despatch Box to tell MPs legally binding changes to the Withdrawal Agreement had been won. Back in Strasbourg, weary Mrs May - her voice struggling as it did during the run-up to her disastrous  party conference speech - and Mr Juncker sat behind a desk to face the Press and deliver the fruits of their negotiating teams’ labours.   “Today we have secured legal changes,” claimed the PM, whose original pact suffered a crushing -vote defeat in January. “Now is the time to come together, to back this improved Brexit deal, and to deliver on the instruction of the British people.” Insisting the revision was final, exasperated Mr Juncker added: “There will be no new negotiations. It is this.” Mrs May was whisked back to the airport and ed to London, steeling herself for the dficult day ahead. At .am she held her daily meeting with her closest advisers. Thirty minutes later, the European Research Group’s eight lawyers began poring over the new deal to decidethey could back it. Meanwhile, Mrs May hosted the weekly meeting of her top ministers in Downing Street from .am. “Cabinet gave its backing to the agreement and stressed the huge importance of the meaningful vote passing this evening,” the PM’s spokesman said later.   Mrs May thanked Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox for their hard work, closing the meeting of senior ministers by saying, ominously: “Today is the day.” But any hope she may have had of unlikely victory was extinguished at am when Mr Cox dropped a bombshell on the PM’s chances of success. The celebrated QC’s three-page legal advice to Mrs May contained  paragraphs. The final one drove a stake into the heart of her revamped pact. According to the Attorney’s letter, the “legal risk” of the UK being unable to leave the Irish Backstop - designed to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republicthe UK and EU cannot agree terms of a future trade deal - “remains unchanged”. Half an hour later, Mrs May appeared before her harshest Brexit critics - the Conservatives’  Backbench Committee. Flanked by her bodyguards, the PM walked a gauntlet of journalists before entering the Attlee Room at Portcullis House.   Inside the secret meeting, she pleaded with Tory MPs not to torpedo her deal. One backbencher cheered Mrs May, telling her: “You haven’t quite pulled a rabbit out of the hat, but you’ve pulled out a hamster and that’s good enough for me.” Building up the sense of theatre, MP George Freeman said later: “You can hear the collective sound of collective pennies dropping as to just how serious this is.” Ministers also attempted to put a positive spin on the PM’s chances. Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd said: “I think she’ll win tonight. I think we’ll all win tonight.” Askedhe thought the deal would get through, Environment Secretary Michael Gove said simply: “Yes.” At the same time, Brexit Secretary Mr Barclay was being grilled by the Commons Brexit Committee, admitting the UK’s departure could be delayed beyond March . “There may be the need for a technical extension,” he confessed.

Today, her voice crumbled again - but this time her problem was a backstop that was far too sturdy. The PMs most loyal supporter, her husband, watched every croaking, gasping minute of the Prime Minister’s speech as she tried to defend the meagre concessions she had dragged home from Strasbourg. Sitting in the public gallery, Philip May winced with every cracked word and grinned when she managed enough breath to heave an attack at an opposition MP.   Tory MP Charlie Elphicke told Mrs May earlier in the day that her new deal wasn’t so much a “rabbit out of the hat” as it was a hamster. As she stood rasping at the despatch box, she sounded rather like she had swallowed that hamster and it was trying to claw its way out again. It came to ‘Quiet Man’ Iain Duncan Smith to mount a rescue attempt for the Prime Minister’s vocal chords. The Brexiteer leaned over from his back-bench seat on a mission of mercy, delivering a much needed Strepsil. But it didn’t much matter by that point. A much louder man had already sealed her fate.   Earlier Geoffrey Cox, the government’s booming-voiced lawyer, did his usual Gandalf impression as he outlined his legal opinion of the new concessions. But he couldn’t bring himself to say the risk of the Northern Ireland backstop becoming permanent had gone - only that it had been “reduced.” Nothing had changed. And one by one, MPs told Tory Gandalf: “This shall not pass!” One Number  aide was overheard complaining that the Prime Minister had been “Cox-blocked”. And as Theresa May drove back to Downing Street in the dramatically pouring rain, she couldn’t escape the sense that her Brexit plan had ended not with a bang, but with a whisper.

For that reason, I can confirm that this will be a free vote on this side of the House. I have personally struggled with this choice as I am sure many other Honourable Members will. I am passionate about delivering the result of the referendum.But I equally passionately believe that the best way to do that is to leave in an orderly way with a deal and I still believe there is a majority in the House for that course of action.And I am conscious also of my duties as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of the potential damage to the Union that leaving without a deal could do when one part of our country is without devolved governance. I can therefore confirm that the motion will read: #xCThat this House declines to approve leaving the European Union without a Withdrawal Agreement and a Framework on the Future Relationship on  March  and notes that leaving without a deal remains the default in UK and EU law unless this House and the EU raty an agreement.#xD :KEY EVENTTheresa May LOSES Brexit vote sparking new crisis as MPs reject her dealBritain was plunged into fresh crisis tonight as MPs crushed Theresa May#xs Brexit deal just  days before we leave the EU.The House of Commons rejected PM#xs plan by  for a second time,  days after it suffered the biggest defeat in history.Read the full story here:Ben GlazeAs MPs make their final speeches this is the mood in the Commons...Twenty minutes from the vote and the Commons benches are far from packed.

However in our view sufficient progress has not been achieved at this time.Having carefully considered the published material as well as measuring what has been achieved against our own fundamental tests, namely the impact of the backstop on the constitutional and economic integrity of the Union of the United Kingdom, it is clear that the risks remain that the UK would be unable to lawfully exit the backstop were it to be activated.The Attorney General#xs legal advice is clear in his last paragraph #xCthe legal risk remains unchanged thatthrough no such demonstrable failure of either party, but simply because of intractable dferences, that situation does arise, the United Kingdom would have, at least while the fundamental circumstances remained the same, no internationally lawful means of exiting the protocol#xs arrangements , save by agreement.#xDWe want to see a deal which works for every part of the United Kingdom.

They will debate delaying Brexit andwe should rule out leaving with No Deal. The now very fluid situation could also see MPs rule out leaving the EU at all or agree to hold a second referendum. This is the guide for what could happen in the next few days as British politics enters its most unpredictable period in living memory.  MPs tomorrow will debate scrapping the chance of a no-deal Brexit. Under plans outlined by the Prime Minister on February , the Commons will have the option to vote on removing the possibility of the UK quitting the EU without an agreement. Theresa May controversially confirmed it will be a free vote to avoid a slew of Tory resignations. Businesses, experts and campaigners have repeatedly warned of a chaotic, economic doomsdayBritain was to plunge from the bloc minus a orce deal and transition period.Lorries could be stacked on roads leading to Channel ports, supermarket shelves may be emptied and vital medicine supplies might be disrupted, according to worst-case scenarios.But Theresa May has so far kept the option on the table, believing it is a key negotiating tactic.However, despite her desperation to preserve the possibility, there is no majority in Parliament for a no-deal departure.   If it comes to a vote tomorrow night MPs are likely to deliver a resounding “No” to no-deal. Only a hardcore rump of Tories and some DUP MPs believe a no-deal - where the UK reverts to World Trade Organisation rules, raising the prospect of tarfs on a host of products - could be good for the country. Will Brexit be delayed  A vote on delaying Brexit is due to take place Thursday - and could finally dash the hopes of Leave supporters who were promised the UK would cease to be a member of the EU at pm on March . MPs are set to be given the chance to delay Article  - the formal mechanism for leaving the bloc - under plans unveiled in the Commons. The PM has always been adamant the UK will leave on March  - two years after formally triggering Article  - so any delay would be a severe humiliation. It would also fuel suspicions the UK will never leave - overturning the “will of the people”.   A short delay could happen regardless because evenMrs May manages to force through a deal at a third attempt, there maybe too little time left to pass the Withdrawal Agreement Bill through the Commons and Lords before scheduled departure day. The Government must table an amendable motion within seven sitting days of last night’s defeat - so by next Thursday. Experts say this means the PM will have lost control of the process, with Parliament in pole position to decide what happens next. However, the law of the land states the UK leaves the EU on March . That can only be stopped by changing the law - and time is running out. If the UK wants a delay, it has to ask for one from Brussels. The PM is due at a crunch summit in the city next Thursday where leaders could thrash out plans for a delay - or offer her another revision. The EU is likely to grant an extension of no more than two months - any longer, and the UK would be required to take part in EU Parliament elections. Will there be a general election  Mrs May is said to favour a general election over a second referendum, but neither option appeals to the premier.She is scarred by her disastrous  campaign where she was unable to resist a -point poll lead over Labour and triggered an unnecessary snap election, surrendering the Conservatives’ majority just two years after it was won by David Cameron. The PM’s “strong and stable” slogan backfired as Labour surged in the election day run-in, with Jeremy Corbyn resurrecting his leadership and performing much better than expected.  However, some polls in recent weeks have given the Tories a -point lead and Mrs May might fancy her chances of ballot box redemption. But the uncomfortable truth for the PM - and all MPs - is a new election could leave the parliamentary arithmetic largely unchanged: the Tories could still be the biggest party but wield no overall majority, and many Conservative MPs could still oppose Mrs May’s Withdrawal Agreement, The PM could find herself back at square one. Will there be a second referendum  Campaigners for another EU vote are biding their time before tabling an amendment demanding a re-run of the hugely isive  referendum. They want to exploit their “moment of maximum opportunity”, which may now be very near. Supporters of another vote claim voters should have the chance to back the PM’s deal or opt to Remain after all. But critics say the public has already decided to Leave, with ,, people backing Brexit and ,, wanting to stay in the EU - a majority of ,, to quit. Mrs May is dead against another EU referendum - and being forced to accept one may prove fatal to her premiership. Mr Corbyn has pledged to throw Labour’s weight behind a “People’s Vote”. But suspicions linger that he favours withdrawal - and the party leader continues to face anger over his apparent lack of enthusiasm for the EU during the  referendum campaign. Can May survive  Under normal circumstances, a PM who suffered a -vote defeat - the biggest ever in parliamentary history - on such an important motion as January’s meaningful vote would be expected to resign. But these are very far from normal times and Mrs May shrugged off the reverse and vowed to try again. Members of her own party tried and failed to oust her in December by tabling a vote of no confidence. She survived the vote by  votes to  - meaning more than third of her MPs wanted to topple her.   The victory - however hollow - meant Mrs May cannot face a fresh attempt to remove her as leader for another  months. In January, her Government survived a no-confidence vote by  votes to  after rebel Tory MPs and the DUP backed the Government just  hours after they combined to crush her original Brexit plan.Labour can table as many no-confidence votes as it likes, but Tories and the DUP are likely to continue to support Mrs Mays administration because they fear handing power to Mr Corbyn - and losing a confidence to vote would trigger a general election.

But the Government’s top legal advisor dealt a fatal blow to the Prime Minister’s hopes ofgetting her deal through when he said that the latest version would not allow the UK to leave the backstop unilaterally. On Tuesday night she was defeated by  votes - almost  votes less than in January suggesting some MPs were won over. But it just wasnt enough.In January Theresa May vowed to win “not a further exchange of letters, but a signicant and legally binding change to the withdrawal agreement.”Mrs May dashed to Strasbourg on Monday to finalise a deal with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker which she said would deliver legally-binding reassurances for MPs to ensure the Irish backstop cannot be permanent. Eurosceptics fear that the Irish backstop, as written, could keep the UK trapped in a partial union with Europe permanently.  And Mr Cox was not able to categorically allay those fears. What was agreed in Strasbourg   On Monday Theresa May dashed to Strasbourg to finalise a deal with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker which she said would deliver “legally-binding” reassurances for MPs to ensure the Irish backstop cannot be permanent. Jean-Claude Junker and Theresa May agreed a “joint instrument” setting out the legally-binding nature of their promises to seek alternative arrangements to avoid the need for a backstop. The pair also signed up to a “supplement” to November’s Political Declaration making clear that they will seek swtly to seal a deal on their new trade and security relationship. Alongside these documents was a “unilateral declaration by the UK”on the temporary nature of the backstop, which will sit alongside the Withdrawal Agreement. This says that it isthe UK’s understandingthatthe EU doesn’t keep up its end of the bargain in the future relationship negotiations, Britain can pull out of the backstop on its own. It’s unclearthis will be enough to satisfy Geoffrey Cox that the UK can leave unilaterally.What does the Attorney General advise   The Attorney said that the documents agreed in Strasbourg “reduce the risk that the United Kingdom could be indefinitely and involuntarily detained” in the backstopthe EU fails to show good faith in negotiating a trade deal to replace it. But he warned that the question of whether a satisfactory agreement on a future UK EU relationship can be reached remains “a political judgment”. And he said “the legal risk remains unchanged” thatno such agreement can be reached due to “intractable dferences”, the UK would have “no internationally lawful means” of leaving the backstop without EU agreement. In a statement to the Commons, Mr Cox told MPs: “There is no ultimate unilateral right out of this arrangement. The risk of that continues. “But the question is whether it is a likelihood, politically.” Can the UK pull out of the backstop unilaterally   This has been the biggest sticking point for Brexiteers who demanded a way for the UK to leave the backstop without permission from the EU. Or they demanded a time limit. But both of these ideas were rejected by the EU who said that the backstop, which is a form of insurance policy, could not have a time limit - nor could one side  Today the Attorney General said he had never claimed there was an ultimate unilateral right out of this arrangement. He said: The question is whether there is a likelihood, politically... What this document does is address the risk that we could be kept in the backstop by the bad faith and deliberate manipulation of the EU.He continued: It would be a good thingwe could hear from the Labour Party occasionally more than just political shenanigans but some sincere engagement with the real issues this Withdrawal Agreement now raises.What do others say    European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said this is it. No more negotiating. He tweeted after meeting Theresa May: Our agreement provides meaningful clarications and legal guarantees to the Withdrawal Agreement and backstop.The choice is clear, he wrote. It is this deal, or Brexit may not happen at all. Lets bring the UKs withdrawal to an orderly end. We owe it to history.Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Cox had confirmed that no signicant changes had been secured in two months of negotiations and the Governments strategy was in tatters. The Eurosceptic European Research Groups Star Chamber set up to analyse the changes issued its opinion. It said: Yesterdays documents considered inidually and collectively do not deliver legally binding changes to the WA or to theProtocol. They fail to fulfil the commitment made by Government to the House in response to the Brady amendment to obtain legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement. Crucially, sitting on the  alongside six Tory MPs and an independent QC was Nigel Dodds, Westminster leader of the Democratic Unionist Party. In a statement the DUP indicated it would not support the deal, saying: We recognise that the Prime Minister has made limited progress in her discussions with the European Union. However in our view sufficient progress has not been achieved at this time.

A Brexit deal was agreed between the UK and the EU, but it was voted down in the House of Commons. So with time running out, plans are being put into action in case a deal doesnt happen. The government has published  technical notices outlining the practical effects of No Deal - from driving licences to cats. Meanwhile ministers have , troops held at readiness, could call up Army reserves and declare martial law. Ministers could quit in protestNo Deal happens while supermarkets and hospitals are stockpiling food and medicine. If theres no arrangement in time, well lose  international trade deals in a blink, shed access to EU criminal databases and troops couldto the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.   A lot of the effects are on business. UK farmers face a nine-month wait for approval to export organic goods to the EU. Fishermen could be blocked from EU waters. And manufacturers fear their supply chains drying up. But businesses are not what whove written this guide for. Instead we have tried to establish  ways No Deal Brexit will affect you, the reader and your everyday le. Of course, these are worst case scenarios. Theyre not exhaustive. They may never happen. But youd better wise up...   What is a No Deal Brexit  No Deal is the default optionMPs, the EU and the UK government cant agree a Brexit Withdrawal Agreement by  March . The -page deal on the table will ensure businesses arent cut off by continuing rules in a transition period until December . But it comes at a cost - a backstop that could trap the UK in an EU customs union from . That means MPs have opposed it. Leaving with no deal will mean falling back on World Trade Organisation trade tarfs - increasing the price of imports and exports - and could leave legal black holes where EU law stood before. The UK government has been ramping up preparations for no deal since the beginning of summer . MPs believe they can find a way to block No Deal through Parliament - including by delaying the March  date - butthey dont its still the default option at pm on March .  More than , troops are being held at readiness in case there is a disastrous no-deal Brexit. Army reserves are also legally able to be called upthere is civil unrest, while councils are braced for possible runs on banks, fuel and food. Local Resilience Forums are reporting back to Whitehall and expect several months of disruptionthere is no deal. The government has plans in case it needs to impose martial law - military law - and curfews to restore order. Cabinet minister Matt Hancock admitted the plans existed but insisted the government was not specically looking at martial law and it was not the focus of our attention.  At the moment, British citizens can enter Schengen area countries with a valid passport eventhey only have a day left before they expire. But in a no deal Brexit, after  March  you may not be able to travel to these countriesyou have less than six months left on your passport. The government is advising travellers to renew any passports older than nine years and six months. . Usually this means renewing six months before your passport expires. Butyour passport had more than  years validity, youll have to renew earlier, because the extra months on top of  years dont count. The following are members of the Schengen Agreement: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.  There is a huge surge in red tape for pet owners who want to take their beloved animals abroad. Currently dogs , cats and ferrets can travel anywhere in the EU as long as they have a pet passport. The main requirement is that three weeks before the first visit, owners must go to the vet to have their pet vaccinated against rabies and microchipped. But in the worst case no-deal Brexit, pet owners must visit a vet at least four months before taking their pet the EU. And because talks are ongoing, that means youd better book in now. ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\" The animal must have a rabies vaccination followed by a blood test at least  days later, to prove the vaccination worked. Pet owners must then wait at least three months before visiting the vet to obtain a health certicate. But this cannot be done more than  days before the date the holiday starts.  Food is being stockpiled forwe crash out of the EU without a deal, and ministers have promised an adequate supply. But thats not the same as having the range of food we do now. Leaked plans in December warned Brits could have to y their diet. And in January, big names KFC, Pret, Lidl, Co-Op, MS, Waitrose, Sainsburys, Asda and McDonalds signed a damning letter warning food supplies could run short because of disruptions to the supply chain. They wrote in a joint letter to MPs: Our ability to mitigate these risks is limited. As prudent businesses we are stockpiling where possible, but all frozen and chilled storage is already being used and there is very little general warehousing space available in the UK. They added: Retailers typically store no more than two weeks inventory and it becomes dficult to restock storesthe supply chain is disrupted.  A string of firms have either moved jobs out of the UK or are threatening to do so in a no-deal situation. Airbus, which employs , people in the UK with around , more jobs in supply chains, warned it may move where. Car plants are moving forward standard shutdowns to be around Brexit in case there are supply chain issues. And critics fear new investment will not come the UKs way, hitting jobs in generations to come.  Major motorways in the South of England are set for serious disruption in case of a no-deal Brexit. From early  the Mwill be closed as needed from junctions -, with a contraflow of both directions on the opposite side, so it can be used as a lorry parkthere is gridlock at Dover. A backup lorry park will be in place at Manston Airport. The M in Kent is also expected to be used as a holding area for lorries. And a similar fate could befall a -mile stretch of the M towards Southampton.  The International Air Transport Associationwarn up to million plane tickets could be cancelledthere is no deal. Currently it is not known exactly which tickets could be hit, or how passengers would find outthey are at risk. The situation arose because in a no deal, there will be no automatic legal basis for flights between the EU and UK after pm on  March . Under a pact struck between the UK and EU in December, basic connectivity will be maintained for a -month periodtheres No Deal. But according to the IATA - which represents  airlines including British Airways - that only means maintaining the number of flights in . It does not allow an increase in services - yet tickets have already been sold based on a predicted increase. Talks are ongoing, but Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, previously warned flights could be groundedgoodwill fails.  Currently a UK driving licence is the only thing visitors need to get behind the wheel on the continent. But under a no-deal Brexit, you should get an International Driving Permit. The pound. documents were due to be sold at , post offices from February. Before they were sold at fewer than . The number of permits issued would have to soar from , a year to million. Meanwhile you will also be forced to apply for a green card to prove you have the right car insurance. The certicates are free of charge and available from insurance companies. But the government warns firms may increase administration fees in order to cope with the extra bureaucracy. Those who forget their green cards would be forced to buy expensive frontier insurance in the country they are visiting. . Up to a million Brits may be forced to take a new driving test  British people driving in Europe could be forced to take a new driving testtheres a no deal Brexit. Up to a million Brits living in Europe were told to replace their driving licence with a local permit immediately. Guidance issued by the Department for Transport said: If you are aUKlicence holder living in theEUorEEAyou should exchange your UK driving licence for a local EU driving licence before  March . From that date, in the event that there is noEUExit deal, you may have to pass a driving test in theEU country you live in to be able to carry on driving there.  More than million EU citizens living in the UK will have less concrete rights to stay. Whether theres a Brexit deal or not, EU citizens can stay in Britainthey register for settled status with the government. But the rules are stricter in a No Deal Brexit. In No Deal, only EU citizens arriving before  March can apply, not those arriving by December . The deadline to apply will be  December , instead of  June there is a Brexit deal. And family members will only be able to join settled EU citizens in the UK before  March . As for the other way round - major EU nations have inidually said theyll allow UK ex-pats to stay, but this could y by country.  Pharmacists have requested special powers to ration medicinesthere is no Brexit deal. Under plans by the Healthcare Distribution Association, they would have special powers to y doctors prescriptions and offer something a drug is unavailable.  million packs of medicines are imported to the UK from the EU every month, and the NHS is preparing for a doomsday scenario to prevent supplies running dry. Government and NHS chiefs have set up a war room called the Operational Response Centre and industry firms are creating six-week stockpiles of medicine. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has chartered a plane to fly in short-shelf-le products, like isotopes for cancer treatment, from Maastricht. Insulin could also be stockpiled. Mr Hancock claimed hes become the biggest buyer of fridges in the world, after fitting out facilities for storage of the crucial drugs. NHS staff are being directed to urge patients not to stockpile medicines personally to avoid shortages throughout the system.  Mobile roaming charges face an immediate hikethere is a No Deal Brexit, the government has confirmed. Tory ministers are revoking the EU law which guarantees UK citizens pay the same for using their phone on the Continent as they do at home. That will leave mobile phone firms free to hike costs whenever they like after the UK leaves. Guaranteed free roaming launched across the EU just  months ago - and meant big savings. But that guarantee will be scrappedthere is no deal, thanks to an obscure law laid before Parliament.  Eurostar services could be suspended in a worst-case no deal Brexit. The government has told international train passengers - including the Eurostar - to make sure they have insurance and ticket terms and conditions that are sufficient to cover possible disruption. That implies passengers should buy FLEXIBLE tickets - not the fixed cheap ones that are popular for their low cost. The UK will need bilateral deals with France, Belgium and the Netherlands to ensure international trains keep running. Without such a deal, Britain has proposed recognising EU operator licences until March  to ensure services can continue. But this isnt guaranteed, and UK operators would have to reapply with the EU. The EU has agreed to keep permissions for services like the Channel Tunnel open for three monthsthere is No Deal, while a new agreement is negotiated. But there arent guarantees. Former Transport Secretary Andrew Adonis claimed the vital train link between Britain and Europe could be severed. . You might have to go through airport security twice  Air passengers changing flights in the EU may have to undergo two security screenings under a no-deal exit. Travellers boarding a plane in the UK to fly to a European airport, before changing flights for an onward destination, would be screened in Britain as they are now. But they might have to have a second check in the EU before getting their connecting flight. “Currently passengers flying from the UK and transferring at an EU airport for an onward flight do not have to be re-screened at that EU airport, because the UK applies, and exceeds, the EU baseline aviation security measures,” says a Department for Transport briefing note. “If there is no deal, and the EU decides not to recognise the UK aviation security system, then passengers and their luggage will have to be re-screened when changing flights in EU hub airports.” . You could be barred from using Netflix and Spoty on holiday  Britons could be barred from accessing their accounts for Netflix, Spoty and other online entertainment while travelling to EU statestheres a no-deal Brexit. Under the EU-wide portability regulation, which took force in April, citizens can access accounts set up and based in one country while visiting other member states. But a government technical notice said: The portability regulation will cease to apply to UK nationals when they travel to the EU. This means online content service providers will not be required or able to offer cross-border access to UK consumers under the EU Regulation. UK consumers may see restrictions to their online content services when they temporarily visit the EU. . If you live in Northern Ireland, you face electricity blackouts  Northern Ireland will be forced to take drastic measures to stop the lights going out. A worst-case No Deal Brexit would scupper the all-island electricity market shared by Northern Ireland and the Republic - leaving it without any legal basis. This would make both markets less efficient, with potential effects for producers and consumers on both sides of the border, the government warns. And it may be necessary to seek additional [legal] powers to preserve security of supply. To stop the lights going out, Northern Ireland would have to take more electricity from British power stations through an interconnector running under the Irish Sea. But Northern Irelands Transmission System Operator may need to rely on fall-back arrangements to ensure power keeps flowing, the government warns. That is why, eventheres a no deal, the government will take all possible measures to keep the all-island market running. There has been talk of barges in the Irish Sea. Dustin Benton of Green Alliance warned:Any emergency action to keep the lights on, both in Northern Ireland and across the rest of the UK, would likely be highly polluting and expensive. . You could be stranded on your package holiday  Package holidaymakers could be left with no legal protectionthe firm they booked with goes bust. Currently Brits have insolvency protectionthey book with a package holiday provider thats based anywhere in the EU. But in a No Deal Brexit, that protection would only applythe firms are targeting the UK market. That means those booking with, say, a cheaper Spanish firm online that has no UK presence could be unprotected. Eventhe UK government could act, in practice it will be much harder to take enforcement action against foreign firms because other countries will no longer recognise UK courts. . Youll lose rights to take action over dangerous products  Government documents reveal the same problem - UK courts not being recognised - will strip Brits of their consumer rights for EU goods bought online. Alex Neill of consumer group Which  warned: A no-deal Brexit would massively weaken peoples rights to take action when they purchase faulty or dangerous products from outside the UK. The Governments advice that we all become experts in international consumer law is hopelessly unrealistic. Securing a good deal with the EU is vital to ensure that Brexit doesnt result in a bonfire of consumer rights and protections.” . Your cigarette packets will change  Graphic warnings on cigarette packets will be replaced by Australian versions in a no-deal Brexit. And in some ways they are even more gruesome than the ones we have now. The grim pictures show a foot ridden with peripheral vascular disease, a clogged artery, a bleeding brain and high-resolution teeth stained black. The photos will be changed in a No Deal Brexit because the European Commission owns theon ones we currently use. That means the UK would be unable to use them after  March . . If youre going through a family breakdown, you could be trapped in limbo  Families who are midway through orce or child custody cases involving another EU country could find themselves trapped in limbo. If there’s a no deal Brexit, the UK will cease to be part of co-operation between EU family courts on  March . Instead the UK will fall back on legal conventions drawn up in The Hague. But these are complicated and do not cover every area of the law. The government has advised families with ongoing cases to seek legal advicethey will not finish by Brexit Day. A government technical note says: Broadly speaking, cases ongoing on exit day will continue to proceed under the current rules. However, we cannot guarantee that EU courts will follow the same principle, nor that EU courts will accept or recognise any judgments stemming from these cases.” . Your everyday medicines and perfumes could become more expensive  Currently, popular ingredients in cold medicines can usually be traded within the EU without a licence. In a no deal, a licence will be required to trade these so-called precursors. Sowe leave without a deal, firms who want to trade such chemicals with the EU will have to register with the Home Office, which can cost between pound and pound,. They will also need an import export license, which costs pound. Critics say this could push up prices for consumers in the shops. Similarly, cosmetics firms will be slapped with more red tape to prove their products are safe for human health. Currently they can use one legal “nominated person” to certy a product for the whole EU market. Butthere’s a no deal Brexit, UK checks won’t be recognised in the EU - and EU checks wont be recognised in the UK. That means two sets of checks. Labour MP Owen Smith claimed drug giants will look to pass on the costs. And finally... your regular caviar parties are doomed!  Caviar imports will be snarled up or stop completely in a No Deal Brexit. Sturgeon eggs join snowdrops, orchids and reptiles in endangered species that would need import and export permits to cross an EU border. Youd only be allowed to bring in g of caviar for personal use. A tragedy.

Attorney General Geoffrey Cox said that the legal position on the UK being able to leave the Irish backstop remains unchanged. It means that Mrs Mays deal is incredibly unlikely to pass when it goes for a vote in the House of Commons this evening. But this isnt the first time the top lawyer has put his foot in it, having once tried to claim p for milk and the money for the fridge to keep it in. Here is everything you need to know about the Attorney General. Who is Geoffrey Cox  Mr Cox, , was born in Wiltshire and before - and during - his political career he was a highly paid barrister - becoming a highly sought after QC. For years this made him one of the highest paid backbench MPs.   In  Mr Cox declared earnings of pound, from outside work. He was branded Tory Gandalf after speeches at Conservative conference last year on account of his soothing baritone. What is his role  Mr Cox is the Attorney General - meaning he is the governments top lawyer. It is one of the oldest positions in government, and historically the position used to represent the monarch in court. While this can still happen occasionally, with them appearing on behalf of the government, they are now head of the Government Legal Service.   But their most important job is providing legal advice to the Prime Minister and the Cabinet. In this role, he is supposed to put aside his political views and give legal advice without prejudice. What did his advice on Theresa Mays deal say  In a brutal opinion Geoffrey Cox left the PMs deal in tatters. Mr Cox agreed the deal “reduces the risk” that the UK will be trapped indefinitely in a clause called the Irish backstop. But in a bombshell letter he said that the legal risk remains unchanged that, without some kind of agreement, the UK has no internationally lawful means of quitting the backstop.   It comes despite Mrs May boasting an th hour deal with EU chiefs in Strasbourg last night had addressed Tory Brexiteers concerns. Addressing MPs today, Mr Cox insisted this is not a matter of law and MPs must back the deal - but the damage was done. Has he done anything controversial  Oh yes. In  he found the time to submit four separate claims for p bottles of milk, all of which were refused by the MPs expenses watchdog. The MP also claimed pound for a fridge, because he needed somewhere to keep his milk.

MILLION.The Edwardian home in Chiswick appears dirty, dusty and dilapidated in these photos. But the spacious property boasts five bedrooms and three reception rooms. There are , square feet of space. The home has period features, large windows, high ceilings and a decent-sized back garden.For the past  years it was owned by the same person, a retired railway engineer who passed away in , My London reports . And the house has been practically untouched during his ownership - giving the next owner the opportunity to put their personal stamp on it. Despite its rundown condition, the property has been put on the market for the sky-high sum. This is eight times the average house price in England and Wales and almost four times as much as a typical home in London.   Savills, which is marketing the property, estimates a poundmillion overhaul could transform it into a stunning modern home worth around pound.million. Euan Rollo, from Savills’ Chiswick branch, said: I’ve worked in [this business] for over a decade and I’ve never come across a home as unmodernised as [the one in] Airedale Avenue. It has to be one of the last remaining opportunities to redevelop a home in one of West London’s most desirable streets and since launching [on Saturday] we have already received signicant interest and enquiries.   It’s the type of home that could have widespread appeal but particularly with the family market, be it locals or those coming from Central London who are looking for a long-term home with the space theyc need that’s close to good schools and Chiswick’s lestyle offering. Savills estimates approximately  to  per cent of properties along the street have had basements or loft extensions. The house is being offered as a probate sale and the Land Registry does not keep records for sale prices in the s and s.  However, the average home in England in  cost around pound,. The current asking price for the unmodernised Chiswick home is , per cent more. A similar home on the street, which was extended and meticulously refurbished, was sold last year by Savills for a guide price of almost pound.million.  Mr Rollo believes, subject to planning,the buyer spent around poundmillion on a basement build, full internal refurbishment, wrap-around extension and loft conversion the home could be worth around pound. to pound.million. He added: Properties like this do not come up often. It was under the same ownership for  years and it’s incredibly exciting to be in a position to find a buyer who’ll take it into the next phase.

She arrived dressed for business in a purple Gucci shirt and Jigsaw trousers. In the Duchess first appearance since her show of unity with the Duchess of Sussex on Monday she wore Jigsaw trousers, in a nod to the fashion brand where she got her start as a buyer.

The royal pair greeted each other with a kiss on both cheeks as they arrived with their princes at the Commonwealth Day service yesterday held at Westminster Abbey.And the Fab Four put on a united front as they joined the Queen and other members of the Royal Family. According to body language expert and author Judi James although an air-kiss can be considered one of the most chilling greetings, it was not the case with mum-to-be Meghan and Kate. Here, she exclusively tellswhat the pairs body language is giving away about the way they feel. Kate and Meghan managed to pull a double air-kiss out of the bag to hopefully signal some open warmth and a suggestion that they really were pleased to see one another. An air-kiss can be one of the most chilling greetings when performed fashionista-stylebut with Kate instigating the kiss by stepping forward and leaning in there were subtle but telling after-touches from both women to make the greeting a little more meaningful. They lingered very slightly rather than springing apart and the arm-touches were prolonged, with Meghan even moving her hand slightly to make the gesture more emphatic.Meghan’s smile suggested genuine delight and happiness as she used very animated gestures to chat to Kate across their husbands and she used this same congruent-looking smile to chat to Prince Charles in a way that reminded us of their obvious closeness on her wedding day. While William and Harry applied a more cautious-looking approach to their body language rituals yesterday, echoing one another’s body language in a way that reminded us of their strong brotherly bonds while adopting a formal fig-leaf pose that can suggest a need for self-protection. As previously reported , the widely reported rt is claimed to have begun during a dress fitting for Princess Charlotte, where Meghan is said to have made the Duchess of Cambridge cry. However it recently emerged that Kate is reportedly throwing Meghan a second baby shower after missing out on the one in New York.The Duchess of Cambridge is said to be hosting the event in which Meghans glam squad and relatives will be on the guest list. Kate missed Meghans bash in the Big Apple. And it appears she is keen to get involved in celebrating the arrival of the new little royal, who will be a cousin to Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.A royal source told Us Weekly : “There is still going to be some sort of private baby-centric event for Meghan’s UK people, and Kate will host.“Her glam people and other relatives will be there.

Images of the majestic mammal , known as F_MU, were taken by British photographer Will Burrard-Lucas at a national park in Tsavo, Kenya.Full-time snapper Will, , took the shots shortly before the ft elephant - whose tusks were estimated to be up to ft ins in- died peacefully of natural causes at more than  years old. Will, from Beaconsfield, Bucks, said: Tsavo is home to some of the last remaining big tuskers - elephants with tusks weighing in excess of st lbs [lbs] on each side. It is thought there are less of  of these elephants left on earth, and almost half of them are in Tsavo. When I first saw her I was awestruck, for she had the most amazing tusks I had ever seen.   If I hadnt looked upon her with my own eyes, I might not have believed that such an elephant could exist in our world. If there were a Queen of Elephants, it would surely have been her. When we first caught a glimpse of her she looked skinny and old but she strode forward with stately grace. Her tusks were so long that they scraped the ground in front of her. She was like a relic from a bygone era. Will spent days searching for the elephant, as the national park area she called her home was the size of Switzerland.   His photos show her drinking at waterholes, eating acacia tree branches and striding towards the camera. Will was able to capture intimate shots from below using a specially-concealed remote controlled camera buggy known as a BeetleCam, which he developed in  to capture close-up photos of potentially-dangerous African wildle. His images, first taken in partnership with Tsavo Trust in August , have now been released for the first time as they are set to feature in new book Land of Giants which document his experiences in the conservation area. Will added: We had been looking for this elephant for several days, but finding her in a vast wilderness the size of Switzerland had proven dficult.   We spotted her from the air and we were converging on her position. I had a feeling of great excitement mixed with anxiety that she may yet evade us in the thick vegetation. But over the bushes I caught a glimpse of an elephants back, so when she stepped out into the open seconds later I was speechless.Find out more about the elephant here ."},{"url":null,"title":"reggae listeners more open minded","story":"NewsReggae-listeners more open minded to trying new foods, fashions and booksCatherine Loveday of Westminster University believes adults exposed to a wide array of music at a young age are more likely to try new thingsShareCommentsByEmma Elsworthy:,  MAR NewsHeavy metal and soul music are least likely to contribute to a willingness to participate in anything new\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAdults who listened to reggae and classical music as children are more likely to be open to trying new foods, sports, fashions and books as they grow up, a leading psychologist has claimed. Catherine Loveday of Westminster University in London came to the conclusion after studying the results of O’s research of , adults into the extent to which music affects behaviour later on in le. She suggests adults who are exposed to a wide array of music during their formative years end up with a greater desire to broaden their social and culinary boundaries. Heavy metal and soul music are least likely to contribute to a willingness to participate in anything new. The research found more than a quarter of those whose parents regularly listened to reggae were open to trying new things, compared to one fth of those who were exposed to classical music.   However, by contrast just four per cent of adults who listened to heavy metal and soul at a young age said they are now open to being adventurous and experimental. Prof. Loveday, a music psychologist, said: “Music is a very fundamental way for parents to connect with their children so it is not surprising that musical tastes get passed on. ‘’But it is interesting to think that listening habits might also nurture open-mindedness and flexibility, as well as a yearning for live music. “We have known for a while that exposing young children to lots of new foods will help them to develop a more adventurous palate and it looks like the same thing might be true of music”.   The study also found the age at which people experience their first live gig also has a big impact on their attitudes to new activities. Children who went to their first gig aged between four and six years old are much more open to trying new things nowthan those who attended a musical festival or concert over the age of  . They are also more likely to want to attend regular gigs as they get older, with four in fiveof those going to gigs before seven wishing they could attend live music at least once a month now. Conversely only a thirdof those who waited until they were over  are keen to regularly attend live music events. Further to impacts on behaviour, the research also revealed that continuing to listen to this wide breath of music as we get older increasingly has less of an impact on our characteristics. In fact, the research revealed that after , interests in hearing new music genres is on the decline. People are most receptive to dferent genres and sounds between the ages of  and , with nearly halfin that age group saying they are now very happy to listen to the same music as their parents, after which they become less inclined to listen to new music. Range of music listened to when younger also has an impact on the music you’re most likely to listen to in later le. Those who listened to a erse range of music growing up, are most likely to listen to hip hop, drum and bass and reggae.   Nina Bibby of O said: “Music connects us on an emotional level so it’s perhaps no surprise to see that the music we listen to growing up shapes our approach and attitude to other aspects of our le. “There’s nothing quite like live music to make you feel alive and we want to encourage people to seize the moment and breathe it all in. ‘’The research was carried out by OnePoll as part of O’s Live Experiences campaign, which encourages consumers to ‘Breathe It All In’ by seizing the moment to watch their favourite music, artist or band.Through Priority Tickets our customers have access to over , live shows in more than  venues across the UK so there’s no better time to explore exciting new live experiences.

Millions of people from around the world watched the heartbreaking footage as Snoop was abandoned on the streets of Stoke-on-Trent shortly before Christmas. The pooch was seen chasing his former owners car as they pulled off into the distance leaving him with just his bed. Celebrities including namesake rapper Snoop Dogg offered to rehome the Staffie but the RSPCA said the pooch was suffering from separation anxiety after being left in the street. The RSPCA has now revealed Snoop has found a loving new home in rural Herefordshire with Laurence Squire, StokeonTrentLive reports. Laurence said: He is a fantastic dog and he settled in straightaway. As soon as he came into the house for the first time, he jumped on the sofa and it was as though he decided that was the space for him. He loves to lie on the back of the sofa andI put the fire on he will curl up in front of it.He loves being warm andhe can find his way into a bedroom, you’ll find him under the duvet with his head on the pillow.  With Laurence working from home, Snoop is now free to roam around a large garden area and the surrounding fields. He has also become a regular in the village pub. RSPCA spokeswoman Rachel Butler has revealed Snoop is loving his new le having battled with separation anxiety after being abandoned. She said: When I visited Snoop in his new home, I could tell straight away that he was in the right place - he and Laurence already have a strong bond and Snoop absolutely dotes on him.  She continued: In the days after his abandonment, Snoop was incredibly nervous and anxious, which is no surprise after what happened to him. But staff at Gonsal Farm worked really hard in building up his confidence and it really paid off. The change in Snoop is massive and we at the RSPCA are so incredibly proud of him. His story put into the spotlight the very sad reality of abandonments, something which the RSPCA deals with every day. He was dumped at Christmas, a time of year which we spend with our loved ones, so for something so unloving to happen to him was heartbreaking. But the love and attention he is getting now from Laurence is wonderful. Snoop is living like a king.   The video, released on Christmas Eve, shows the Staffordshire Bull Terrier led out of a car at the side of the road. The footage then shows the man then running back to the car, which drives away, while the canine repeatedly jumps up at the vehicles window in distress. After the incident Snoop was taken to the RSPCA in Shropshire to be looked after. The investigation into Snoop’s abandonment is ongoing. Anyone who has any information about the incident should call the RSPCA’s appeals line on   .

However,you happen to heavily pregnant AND a bridesmaid, chances are youre going to stick out regardless of how much you try to be a wallflower.Not that thats stopped one bride from venting about a member of her bridal party whom she felt was showing off her baby bump in those all-important wedding photos. Now, the bridesmaid has got the hump at the bride, as SHE feels she was trying to be made look fat, rather than glowy and pregnant.   Honestly, its like a law of physics that every wedding has to come with a dollop of drama.Ranting on Reddit , the newlywed said: I got married three weeks ago and one of my bridesmaids is about  months pregnant .Kates belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. The problems occurred in the time between the ceremony and the reception. The bride explained they had a photographer booked to take a few hours worth of professional photos with just the wedding party. A few hours seems like a long time, but moving on...   In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress . I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone . I had to remind her a few more times before wed finished taking the wedding party photos. Fast forward to ing from her honeymoon, and the bride started to suspect Kate was not happy with her. We usually talk every couple of days, she added.   I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is p****d at me because I was trying to make her look fat, not pregnant during the photos. Now Im annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. A number of women whod been pregnant themselves came forward to defend Kate. As someone who was very recently pregnant, I can tell you I posed with my hand on my bump in every picture I took. I put my hand in my bump when I went out in public.  Because it sucks being giant, and yes, you want people to know you are pregnant and not just huge. Posing like that is not trying to make it into a maternity shoot, unless she pulled the camera person aside and asked to take pictures of herself with her bump. She was just trying to feel halfway decent about herself in the pictures. Another mum agreed, adding: Putting your hand on your bump just shows that its a bump instead of letting the bottom of the skirt just flow and risk looking like some giant chfon covered cow.It echoes all the unpleasant backlash Meghan Markle got - and still gets - for having the audacity to cradle her bump.Its a perfectly normal pose for mums-to-be, not a bid to be the centre of attention.

Heart-stopping footage shows the unattended three-year-old squatting down on the road, close to a petrol station. It is not clear what the young boy was doing alone in the road, but moments later an SUV driver does a U-turn in a bid to avoid the police and is seen running the tot down. The video from the city of Loudi in central China, shows the driver, who authorities say had spotted the police checkpoint further up the road and wanted to avoid revealing that his car lacked vehicle insurance and an annual inspection certicate, carry out the dangerous manoeuvre.   But the driver failed to notice the toddler on the ground and runs right over him, dragging him more than ft before the child appears again, seemingly unharmed. As the man drives away, the shocked boy stands up and walks off, presumably to find his parents, as a witness tries to stop the hit-and-run driver. Local police said the driver was stopped shortly after and only then realised he had run somebody over.   The boy suffered minor scratches to his face and right ear, they added, with the driver still understood to be under investigation. However, it is unclear whether he was detained.

As a result plenty of pundits are making the Gers favourites to progress on their own patch this evening.However, McInnes insists nothing has changed as Aberdeen look to move a step closer to winning the Scottish Cup for the first time since .The Dons gaffer said: “The Scottish Cup is important and over the history of the club we haven’t won it as many times as we would have liked.“As a club we have not won it for a long time. In my time here we have been close.“We have reached semi-finals and a final but for us to achieve what we set out to do we will have to beat a strong Rangers in Glasgow.“The intention is to win the cup and nothing has changed just because we got a really dficult draw against Rangers.“People think we have missed our chance by being the better team at Pittodrie and not winning.“Just because the game is in Glasgow nothing has changed for us.“It will be two good teams going head to head and our intention is to put Rangers out and get through.“I want to win the Scottish Cup – but I don’t get too dispirited when we don’t.“The intention is to keep on going. We want it to be this year, butit isn’t we will try to win it next year.“Myself and my players know what we want and we have to set about the task of going in and doing it and hopefully we can.”Aberdeen head for Govan this evening following Saturday’s - draw with Celtic at Parkhead. It was a resolute defensive display from the Dons against the Premiership champions.McInnes is hoping his charges can deliver another showing of that ilk and keep another clean sheet against Rangers.The importance of shutting out Steven Gerrard’s side doesn’t need to be emphasised.Both victories for the Reds against the Gers this season have come when they have kept clean sheets – - at Ibrox in the league in December and by the same score in October’s League Cup semi-final.McInnes added: “When you play against good teams who like to dominate the ball like Celtic and Rangers you have to be smart with your work. You can’t give them too much space to operate because good players like space.“Both Celtic and Rangers have got good players with a lot of pace who can punish you.“If we had even resources we could go and take Celtic on and play in a certain way. But we have to find other ways to get our results and win a cup competition.“This game will be similar where we need to pick and choose our fights, be good defensively as a team but also have the courage and confidence to go and play and create chances.“We have scored against Rangers in every game we’ve played them this season, but like Celtic they’re not easy to score against.“The defensive part of the game on Saturday was good and not many teams go to Parkhead and keep a clean sheet.“The last three times we’ve gone there we’ve won -, lost - and drew -.“There’s been nothing in those games and it shows with the right concentration and enough determination you can get the desired results.”McInnes is hopeful of having wingers Gary Mackay-Steven and Niall McGinn available tonight.Both missed Saturday’s draw with Celtic, Mackay-Steven with a calf knock and McGinn with a hip problem."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 01","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe conditions being endured by refugees on a remote Greek island might seem of little importance to folk living in Argyll, but Pam Gregory spends time helping make their lives easier.More volunteers are desperately needed to assist as conditions worsen during the winter and Samos Volunteers would love to hear from anyone with the inclination to help.Pam#s dedication and the support of the Craignish community deserve great credit.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes. A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal. The unfortunate Pupils# defender could only ert the ball into the empty net, with McLean waiting on a tap in. The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder. Hopefully this will not keep him out for too long.On Saturday February , Star have another important home game as they look to move off the bottom of the table when they take on Claremont AFC.

His work for that competition was recognised by the organisers when he was given a special award at Aviemore along with his friend Donnie MacKenzie of Lochaber.John helped reform Kilmory shinty club in the mid s along with Ian MacPhee, the late Kenny MacRae, Roddy Munro and Alex Campbell. He also served on their committee for many years.John had served as a policeman for a short time before working in the quarry at Furnace, then going on to be a very well-known driver with Gleaner Oils, which supported many of his shinty activities with young players in Argyll.John was a great organiser and acted as goal judge in a number of senior shinty finals including the Glasgow Celtic Society Cup and notably the Camanachd Cup Final in Inverness when Gordon MacIntyre of Oban Camanachd scored his famous winner at the Bught Park.John apparently retrieved the ball from the net and lobbed another onto the park for the re-start before presenting the goal-scoring ball to Gordon after the match.John is survived by his brother Jim who played for Glasgow Police and he was pre-deceased by his we Donella. As a couple they were permanent fixtures at most shinty events in Argyll and well beyond, particularly at events involving young players.Tribute reproduced courtesy of the Camanachd Association"},{"url":null,"title":"casa crew takes the plunge","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTo raise money for to make Heal Scotland a reality, Lilia Sinclair is encouraging everyone to join her to e into Loch Fyne.A dook is scheduled for Saturday March  # with a twist.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"bob sheilds make new recycling","story":"NewsBob Shields: Make new recycling system in South Ayrshire work for usNew leaflets needed to inform the publicShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAfter a first glance at last week’s report on noisy bin men – I had to check out my calendar to make sure I wasn’t getting a month ahead of myself. Let’s face it, stories about a Mr Paine and some broken glass usually appear on April . But no – it really was only March ! Mr Paine’s issue is the emptying of his street’s bottle bins at am. On the morning of his first collection, he mistook the noise of breaking glass for a robber breaking into his house. “I was terried,” he said. And then added, “This is noise pollution and most of the street must have been up.” Well, I too have suffered Mr Paine’s ‘noise pollution’ - perhaps an even noisier version. Chez Shields is no stranger to a well chilled Petit Chablis washing down the foie gras before Eastenders. In fact, I’ve been known to pop a second cork just to recover from Eastenders! Based on Mr Paine’s video recording, the noise made by the emptying of my bottle bin is right up there - somewhere between a small public house and a decent sized restaurant. Andit wakes up my neighbours – I couldn’t give a Chateau Le Clos! On my street’s first collection, I didn’t wake up thinking I was being burgled. House-breakers don’t usually make enough noise to get “most of the street up”. I seem to remember thinking, “That’ll be the bin men . . .” and going back to sleep. And on the  days a year that the glass bins are emptied in “quiet, residential Masonhill”, I respectfully suggest Mr Paine does the same. After all, we’re talking about saving the world here . . . not saving an hour’s kip! Greenhouse gas emissions are asphyxiating the planet. Plastic bags are strangling dolphins and milk bottle caps are choking sea birds. Our little Earth is throttling itself. To be honest, I’d rather be concentrating on ten decades of industrial pollution than Mr Paine’s ten minutes of noise pollution. And meanwhile, still in bin land, South Ayrshire Council is blaming the public for the latest waste collection problems. I can see the point they’re making – but the word “contamination” is a bit strong for Mrs McGuffie putting Tiddle’s empty Whiskas can in the paper and cardboard bin. And the new recycling system is a little too new for the “red tag” bin police to be targeting offenders. By refusing to lt certain bins – South Ayrshire Council is tempting fate. I’ve heard reports of some people using a neighbour’s bin when their own bin is full and red tagged. I’m also told there are increasing incidences of household waste being stuffed in the street bins reserved for pedestrian litter. And stuck in the middle are the bin men themselves. One told me “If we red tag a bin – we get **** from the householder. If we take back a contaminated bin, we get **** from our supervisors. Basically, were in the **** no matter what we do!” My dear old mum used to use a lovely phrase – “There’s a place for everything . . . .and everything in its place”. That’s exactly how SAC’s new recycling system meant to work. But it’s going to take a little time and a little patience – on both sides. The info leaflets sent out to explain the new system were largely ignored or discarded - most people didn’t understand them. But with the new bins now rolled out – a back-up leaflet might help. “You’ve got your new bins – now here’s how to use them”. Rubbishing the new rubbish system isn’t going to make it go away. It’s here – let’s get on with making it work for ourselves, our neighbours and our community.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrSouth Ayrshire CouncilEnvironment"},{"url":null,"title":"churches facing end era parish","story":"NewsChurches facing end of era as parish minister calls it a dayCrisis in Kirk conregationsShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email There’s no parish ministers round here, writes Edwin LawrenceThat’s the crisis facing Kirk congregations in Girvan and South Carrick. And it becomes reality with the imminent departure of Rev Richard Moffat from Girvan North Parish Church. The area – in the short term at least – will be dependent on the services of elderly retired ministers and lay readers. Mr Moffat has been a popular parish minister at Girvan North for five years. And he was due to become Moderator of the Presbytery of Ayr in April. But he is set to move to a new charge in Morayshire, to be closer to his daughter and her family. He will conduct his last Sunday service in Girvan North on March . Mr Moffat’s departure is the latest factor concentrating minds in the Church of Scotland. For Girvan South, linked with Barr and Dailly is currently without its minister. Popular Rev Ian McLachlan has been on sick leave for several months. And colleagues say he is unlikely toto full-time duties. Rev Stephen Ogston was parish minister at Ballantrae Colmonell from  until August, . But he moved on to Luce Valley Church, and no replacement has been found. The linked charge of Ballantrae St Colmon also takes in services at Barrhill and Glenapp. So communities right across Girvan and South Carrick no longer have a parish minister in their midst. And there is uncertaintly at how things will be resolved. One solution might be a union of the two Girvan churches. And that could leave Girvan North - with its -foot spire – as the last kirk in town. It would presumably also be used as a hub to minister to village churches. The Post understands there can be as few as six worshippers in Barr Parish Church on Sundays. This isn’t helped by Barr being last in the pecking order for services, after Girvan South and Dailly. So it’s virtually lunchtime before a Sunday service gets under way. A Presbytery of Ayr meeting was due in the Carrick Centre in Maybole on Tuesday this week.And the Post understands this will see Rev Ian Stirling Fisherton Kirkoswald appointed interim moderator at Girvan North. Locum minister will be retired minister Rev Edgar Ogston – father of Stephen – who livesin Girvan.The Post has spoken to kirk elders in Girvan who say they’re uncertain about the future. And a retired church minister suspects that the two Girvan churches will be required to amalgamate. He said: “Things are changing. We’ve been a clergy-centred church for  years. “But one positive thing we’re seeing is the rise of worship groups which are prompting people to think about their faith, without necessarily being preached at.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnChurch of ScotlandAyrMoffatGirvan"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"first minister must act over","story":"NewsFirst Minister must act over Tarbolton landfill, says MSPThe South of Scotland Tory MSP says he is hearing growing concerns from villagers about the condition of the site.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR NewsBrian Whittle MSP challenges the First Minister in the Scottish Parliament \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMore than eight months after Tarbolton Landfill’s owners entered liquidation, MSP Brian Whittle has challenged the First Minister to act, writes Edwin Lawrence. The South of Scotland Tory MSP says he is hearing growing concerns from villagers about the condition of the site. He said: “Since the landfill closed its gates, worries have been expressed about smells and also about contaminated water running off the site.” These would normally be dealt with by the site owner, so Mr Whittle took up the issue with both the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyand the Scottish Government. However, in the absence of a clear answer on ultimate responsibility, he decided to raise it at Holyrood, during First Minister’s questions. In response, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said:   “I am not able to give that information to Brian Whittle right now. “I undertake to raise the issue with the environment secretary and to come back to Brian Whittle as quickly as possible about our understanding of the lines of accountability and the action that the Scottish Government can take to try to reach a resolution of what certainly seems to be a deeply unsatisfactory situation. “I can understand that people in the local area will be very concerned about any prospect of contamination and it is absolutely necessary that all relevant agencies and organisations respond as quickly as possible.” Speaking afterwards, Brian Whittle MSP said: “The situation with the Tarbolton Landfill has been allowed to drag on for too long already. “Aside from the obvious concerns local residents have, it’s troubling that there doesn’t appear to be a clearly defined process for when the operator of a site like this is no longer able to carry out their duties to protect the surrounding environment. “I hope the First Minister will be able to provide some much needed clarity on this issue.” "},{"url":null,"title":"holiday beach made rubble","story":"NewsThe holiday beach made of rubbleSilver strand is lined with brickShareByStuart Wilson:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsNo sand castles - but they can be made from brick.

Derek added: “A lot of people don’t even know Prestwick has a beach and that’s something we want to change. “We want to boost the number of attractions at the prom but that has to start with a high standard of beach.” A council spokesman said: “Our beaches are important for the local environment so the Prestwick beach cleaning project is scheduled to take place each year to ensure rubble is removed before the main beach season. “This year work will start towards the end of March, subject to weather conditions. “We will continue to work closely with the local community councils, the Friends of Prestwick Seafront and other community partners so that the amenity beach looks its best for the busy season.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnPrestwickAyrAyr NewsSouth Ayrshire CouncilReligion"},{"url":null,"title":"look out sooty sweep heading","story":"NewsLook out, Sooty and Sweep are heading to AyrStage show insists laughs will come thick and fast at Ayr GaietyShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSooty is set to SWEEP into Ayr next month.

Council is to close two of its waste recycling bin lorry depots as part of its new budget.The plans will see council bin lorries being moved from Peebles and Duns and consolidated in Hawick and

lead to an increase in the waste disposal servicersquos carbon footprint.A council spokesperson said: ldquoA review of the waste collection service was considered by the council as part of its budget, and the decision was made to progress with operating the waste and recycling collection service out of two depots, Galashiels and Hawick, instead of the current four ndash Galashiels, Hawick, Duns and

efficient service, allowing the improved management, support and use of staff and fleet resources, and to address workload equality and inequality issues, deliver economy-of-scale efficiency savings, reduce need for and reliance on agency staff, enable more standardised operations and improve communications.ldquoAll changes are made and staff are supported in line with existing human resources

If we did not encourage change, we would still be living in caves.Mr Howardrsquos arguments have not swayed principal planning officer Carlos Clarke as he recommends that councillors reject the application and force him to cease trading from the premises.He writes: ldquoAspects of the development are acceptable, subject to conditions, particularly to rationalise the number and appearance of the ious small structures proposed.ldquoHowever, the joinerrsquos workshop and retail sales would be contrary to the local development plan, and this conflict is not overridden by other considerations.ldquoAs these elements form a signicant part of the development proposal, it would not be appropriate to delete them from a prospective consent by condition.ldquoUltimately, therefore, the application should be refused because of the proposed retail and joinerrsquos workshoprsquos conflicts with council planning policy.The proposed joinerrsquos workshop would be contrary to the local development plan in that there is inadequate justication for the proposed use on this site, which is not located within an allocated employment, mixed-use or redevelopment area, and would be potentially detrimental to the character and amenity of the surrounding area.ldquoThe proposed retail use would also be contrary to the local development plan in that the site is not within the town centre and it is not been demonstrated that there are no sequentially preferable sites closer to or within the town centre or that the proposed development would not detract from the vitality and viability of the town centre, and because the visual impact of the retail use proposed would be detrimental to the character of the surrounding area.ldquoOther material considerations do not outweigh this conflict."},{"url":null,"title":"readers-photo","story":"This photo, entitled lsquoRainy Days... rain drops and reflectionsrsquo was posted by BorderCamera Club member Hazel Dunbar.

After his first two space launch attempts ended in failure, it is no surprise that Elon Musk#s SpaceX recently took a dummy to the International Space Station.Solo ocean crossings in a sailing boat are another example of a sport that seems too risky to many.Free Solo tells of Honnold#s perfectionism but ultimately he relies on  practice, friction, magnesium carbonate chalk for his sweaty palms and his wits.Throughout the ascent, and the preamble which leads to it, including romance and his girlfriend#s struggle #to understand#, Honnold is filmed by his friends, some of whom cannot bear to watch the final solo.Extreme solo feats have existed as long as humans. The marathon developed in Ancient Greece as a solo running challenge and people still die in the st century emulating those barefoot warriors.Climbing and mountaineering has a long history of solo risk taking and many of its protagonists live relatively short lives.Some though, such as legendary Italian Walter Bonatti, were hard wired for solitary ascents. He shot to fame in the s with a solo ascent of a climb on the Dru, renamed the Bonatti Pillar, in the French alps.Bonatti finished his hard climbing career in  with a solo in winter of the north face of the Matterhorn for the centenary of that mountain#s first attempt. He passed away, aged , in bed.Up till Free Solo, many films about climbing have only been of real interest to climbers and have not made it into mainstream cinema.Using the latest techniques including drones, remote cameras, huge telephoto lenses on digital cameras from the valley floor and cameras wielded by dangling climbers has created a National Geographic movie which has transfixed audiences.Even climbers emerge after an-hour-and-a-half with sweaty palms after the glimpse into Honnold#s seemingly nihilistic world.A still of Alex Honnold during his climb.

Assuming Wednesdays vote happens as the Prime Minister promises, and parliament votes against a no deal, that should be the end of their dreams of a ldquoclean break WTO Brexit in two weeks. MPs surely have the power to prevent such an outcome. On Thursday,there hasnt been an election called, MPs should vote also for an extension of Article , and therefore put a brake on the UKs departure from the European Union.Since no one in their right mind believes there is any point in just having another three months of this neurotic indecision, the extension would have to be long enough for the UK to have a general election and come to some consensus on what leaving the EU means. Or whether to leave it at all. That would surely take a year at least. Probably two.Read more:Humiliated Theresa May suffers second Commons defeat as MPs reject Brexit dealThis would mean the UK paying many billions for the privilege of remaining, and having to elect MEPs to the European Parliament in May. That is a legal requirement for member states, and the UK would of course remain a full member of the EU pro tem. Such might be the sense of frustration and disillusion with Brexit, which is demonstrably a result of its advocates being unable to decide what it means, that this extension might turn into something rather more permanent.My own view is that it would probably lead to Britain parking itself in the European Economic Area ndash the so called Norway option. This means the UK would be out of the political institutions of the EU, and the Common Agricultural Policy, but remaining in the European Single Market. This is an unsatisfactory compromise, since the UK loses its voting rights in the Council of Ministers, but it is undoubtedly Brexit. It has been good enough for Norway since , and it may be the only compromise that works.But at this moment, in the backwash of todays astonishing events, rational thinking on Britains future relations with Europe is pretty well impossible. The government cannot govern, parliament cannot choose and Britains political parties are disintegrating. The Tory Party is irrevocably split in all but name, and Labour already has.It was left to the Attorney General, Sir Geoffrey Cox, to drive the last nail into the Prime Ministers coffin with his legal advice on her latest ldquobreakthrough. It was ldquobollocks he said ndash at least that was his Tweeted censure to the Channel  presenter Jon Snow, whod suggested that Sir Geoffrey had been bounced into changing his legal advice on the backstop. In fact, Cox hadnt changed his advice ndash at least not materially. His statement concluded that the UK, even under Mays new deal, could be trapped indefinitely in the customs union backstop, albeit that the risk of this had been reduced. If Brussels behaved in bad faith, Britain could legally cry foul.The Brexit Select Committee tried to make sense of this and ended up resorting to metaphysical speculation about the meaning of ldquobad faith. This is an existential question, essentially, and one that the philosopher Jean Paul Sartre wrestled with all his le. The Brexit Secretary, Stephen Barclay, who is no Sartre, said that Britain could claim bad faiththere was ldquounjustiable delay beyond the agreed timescale for negotiating the future trading relationship. This is supposed to be completed by December . But since no one ever took that date seriously, delaying beyond it could hardly be bad faith.Anyway, by definition the European Union always conducts its negotiations in good faith. If there is still no technical solution to avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland, how would a delay in the expiry of the backstop be in ldquobad faith. The benchmark is surely the Good Friday Agreement and the British governments commitment to it. If the only way of honouring that is for the UK to remain in a customs union and in regulatory alignment with the Single Market, then surely ldquogood faith would indicate that the backstop should be permanent..bc-player-iAIgYhFQ_default .vjs-tech .bc-player-iAIgYhFQ_default .vjs-playlist-description .vjs-big-play-button .vjs-mouse.vjs-playlist .vjs-playlist cite .vjs-mouse.vjs-playlist time cite.vjs-playlist-name .story-credits #liveMultiHide .vjs-dock-description .vjs-playlist-thumbnail  * Style the overlay *  * Hide the overlay * -countdown display: none-overlay display: none * Style the overlay * .vjs-overlay,.vjs-overlay.vjs-overlay-top position: absolutetop: pxleft: px.vjs-overlay p width: pxbackground-color: #color: #fffpadding: pxpadding-left: px !importantmargin: margin-left:  !importantmargin-bottom: border-radius: pxtext-align: left.popout-player position: relativewidth: pxmargin-bottom: pxtransition-property: alltransition-duration: mstransition-timing-: ease-in-out.bc-outer position: relative.bc-inner left: %top: %transform: translateposition: absolutewidth: pxheight: pxcolor: blackdisplay: blockbackground-color: whiteopacity: .font-family: VideoJStext-align: center.bc-inner:hover cursor: pointeropacity: ..bc-inner-font font-size: px width\"%\"data-account\"\"data-player\"iAIgYhFQ\"data-embed\"default\"data-popout\"\"data-autoplay\"\"data-multimedia-block\"\"data-video-id\"\"class\"video-js\"playsinlinedata-random-id\"\" mutedcontrolsTheresa May had made two fatal mistakes. She thought she could rely on a legal solution to what is essentially a political problem. Lawyers confine themselves to the very strict meaning of words. The Withdrawal Agreement is legally binding, therefore there was never any way ndash in codicils, declarations or addendums ndash to undo what was already set in legal stone.Her other mistake was to believe that she could keep her party united by placating the hard Brexiteers in William Rees-Moggs European Research Group. That was never going to work because they are essentially incorrigible. Like the followers of the Branch Davidian cult in Waco, Texas, they would happily go up in flames for their beliefs ndash and take the country with them.This is a cathartic moment. The government and parliament has had to face up to its collective inability to resolve the greatest crisis faced by Britain since the Second World War. There is no leadership, no constructive thinking. Just a vacuum where political leadership should be. This would be an ideal moment for a charismatic figure to seize the moment and lead the country out of its confusion and disarray.We dont do charismatic leaders anymore.

This underlines the importance of the value we place on meeting our environmental obligations as we plan and construct new infrastructure. This book, which provides valuable details on the archaeological finds, will be essential reading for everyone who has an interest in the North-East’s history.”Bruce Mann, Archaeologist for the council, explained: “This book provides more details on our fascinating discoveries from the archaeological works carried out on the AWPR site. For instance, a very unexpected discovery was the presence of Roman activity at Milltimber, likely dating from around   AD. Ninety bread ovens were uncovered, which were probably constructed by the Roman army at a time of invasion led by the Roman General Agricola. However, no evidence of an associated camp was found, which is unusual for these types of features. We can only speculate as to why the ovens were in this location.“Going back to the very earliest finds, there was also evidence of stone tool production dating between about , and , BC at Milltimber, a near unprecedented body of evidence which pushes back our understanding of human activity in north east Scotland by several thousand years.”Bruce continued:“Bronze Age activity was identied from Nether Beanshill in the form of a roundhouse and contemporary cremation complex dating from around , to , BC. The burial comprised of an urn in which the cremated remains of an inidual in their s had been placed. This urn was placed in a pit which was then marked by a horseshoe-shaped arrangement of timber posts. Two other similar burials were also uncovered.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Gillian Martinwith Emma Harper, who launched the public consultation exercise.\"   with Emma Harper, who launched the public consultation exercise.\"  Public urged to have a say on legislation viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"volunteers sought to help tree research","story":"An appeal has gone out to local nature lovers to help with a national science project which aims to monitor the health of the country#s trees.The Woodland Trust is on the look-out for volunteer tree health surveyors to support Observatree – a UK-wide partnership project that tracks tree pests and diseases across the UK.The trust is recruiting the volunteers, and will teach them how to identy threats such as ash dieback, acute oak decline and Asian longhorn beetle, before reporting to Forest Research.Since its launch in , the project has trained  volunteers, who have given more than , hours of their time and , site surveys have been conducted, of which more than , found a tree pest or disease.In Scotland only the central belt is currently well covered by volunteers but more are needed where – including the North-east.Charlotte Armitage, citizen science officer at the Woodland Trust, said that volunteers are a key part of the scheme.She continued: “Observatree volunteers are instrumental in tracking pests and diseases– they need strong tree ID skills and an enthusiasm for nature to drive investigations across the UK.“However, we still need more people to join our ranks.

We have been sharing information to help the sector prepare for that scenario.#However, Mr Carmichael is standing by his claims, saying behind the scenes analysis is a totally dferent level of depth than the full impact assessment expected to be done on such a massive change.He has branded conservative ministers #woefully irresponsible# for #failing to safeguard the sector from the impact of Brexit.#Speaking while making his claims, earlier in the week, prior to the response from DEFRA, Mr Carmichael said: #When Conservatives think of farmers, they think of the big landowners and the estates This [FOI] response shows that they have no interest in, or concern for, the hill farmers and crofters whose businesses are the backbone of so many of our remote rural communities.#To run their business, farmers need certainty. They need to know what funding is available, what standards must be met and what tarfs need to be paid.#It is therefore appalling that Conservative ministers have failed to conduct an impact assessment on the impact of Brexit on sheep farming. These ministers are woefully irresponsible. Farmers deserve better.#“Behind the scenes analysis falls well short of the in-depth impact assessment that farmers and crofters deserve. It is like not doing your homework, but trying to cover the fact by saying that you put together a mind map. Simply unacceptable. By the government’s own admission, they have done nothing, and know of no work to do an impact assessment on the industry.“They have let the industry, and our farming and crofting communities down.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He questioned Minister for Public Finance, Kate Forbes MSP, in the Scottish Parliament earlier this afternoon, Wednesday, asking how this shortfall squares with the government’s commitment to the principle of fair funding for our leline internal ferry services.According to the Orkney MSP, the minister responded by saying that the government recognise the challenges in running these ferry services and that they have been clear in their budget that adequate funding is to be delivered.Commenting after the exchange, Mr McArthur said: “We now know that the Scottish Government has cut funding for Orkney’s internal ferry services by £, compared to last year.  This has left a £.m shortfall in the Council’s budget for delivering these leline services.#It is baffling how Ministers think this approach is consistent with their commitment to the principle of fair ferry funding.  It certainly flies in the face of the will of parliament, which voted for the government to deliver on its earlier promises.“Meantime, the island communities that rely on these leline services are left picking up the tab, including a three per cent increase in fares this year.  Ministers may ‘recognise’ the challenges of running these services, but they also must recognise their obligations genuinely to provide adequate funding.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After all-male representation in the last two parliaments, however, it is good to see that Orkney’s next MSYPs will both be female,“I would also make a plea to all those eligible to vote in these elections to make sure they do so. Voting takes place between March  #  and anyone aged - can cast vote online using their young scot card number.“Meantime, I wish all six candidates the best of luck and hope they enjoy the campaign experience.

It’s interesting because, no matter where I go, these are the three predominant issues, and they are all related.”There are around  EIS members in Orkney.On Monday, EIS members voted to reject a new pay offer.According to Mr Ramsey, the next step will be to hold a ballot on industrial action, although the union remains open to further negotiation.“Assuming that our members decide to vote for a strike, there will be two or three weeks before that goes through,” the vice-president explained.“We intend to continue to negotiate. We realise that teachers don’t want to strike — they do not do this lightly. We have even made a decision not to strike during the SQA exams.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Voting against leaving without a deal and for an extension does not solve the problems we face.“The EU will want to know what use we mean to make of such an extension and this House will have to answer that question. Does it wish to revoke Article   Does it want to hold a second referendum  Or does it want to leave with a deal, but not this deal “These are unenviable choices. Thanks to the decision that the House has made this evening, they are choices that must now be faced.”An extension requires the unanimous agreement of all  remaining member states.Mr Juncker has warned that it cannot stretch beyond  May unless the UK takes part in the European Parliament elections starting on that date.Mrs May said that the choices facing the UK were “unenviable”, but because of the rejection of her deal “they are choices that must be faced”.Cabinet gave its approval to Mrs May’s package at an early-morning meeting in  Downing Street which ended with the PM telling colleagues: “Today is the day. Let’s get this done.”But the momentum moved sharply against the Prime Minister shortly afterwards, as Attorney General Geoffrey Cox released formal legal advice that the changes secured by Mrs May “reduce the risk” that the backstop will be permanent, but do not remove it altogether.The Star Chamber of lawyers convened by the Brexit-backing European Research Group declared that three new documents agreed in Strasbourg failed to deliver the legally-binding changes demanded by the Commons.And the Democratic Unionist Party - which props up Mrs May’s minority administration in the Commons - said its  MPs would vote against the latest deal as “sufficient progress has not been achieved at this time”.The Prime Minister, battling a croaky voice and with husband Philip watching from the Commons gallery, warned MPs that “Brexit could be lost”they gave her deal the thumbs-down again.But she met a wall of hostility from opposition parties, while only a handful of the  Tories who rebelled in January said they would switch sides to back her.Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said that “no signicant changes” had been secured in two months of negotiations and the Government’s strategy was “in tatters”.Brexit figurehead and former foreign secretary Boris Johnson told the Commons that Mrs May and Mr Cox had “sowed an apron of fig leaves that does nothing to conceal the embarrassment and indignity of the UK.”Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told the Commons: “After three months of running down the clock the Prime Minister has, despite very extensive delays, achieved not a single change to the Withdrawal Agreement.“Not one single word has changed. In terms of the substance, literally, nothing has changed.”Charles Walker, vice chairman of the  Committee of backbench Tory MPs, warned that defeat in the second “meaningful vote” on Tuesday evening would lead to a general election.He told BBC Radio ’s World At One: “If it doesn’t go through tonight, as sure as night follows day, there will be a general election within a matter of days or weeks.“It is not sustainable, the current situation in Parliament.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brian monteith the snp has no mandate for another independence referendum","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Nicola Sturgeon should test her party#s claim that Scots back another poll by putting it to the people, says Brian MonteithThere has been a lot of assertive talk in the last week from SNP politicians stating, asfact, that the Scottish Government has a mandate to call a second independence referendum.Figures such as MP Mhairi Black, George Kerevan, deputy leader Keith Brown and others were in the thick of making such claims, while the SNP’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, was challenged by Prime Minister Theresa May, who said there is no mandate.: SNP will launch Commons move for second indyrefBrexit goes aheadThis led the SNP to tweet on  March: “Theresa May tried to claim that Scotland has no mandate for a referendum on Scottish independence. FACT: Scotland has a mandate to pursue independence.” Ignoring the obvious hood that the SNP is not Scotland and cannot speak for it, it is important to establishthe Scottish people – whom the SNP says are sovereign – have authorised a second referendum in pursuit of independence. It will, after all, be upon the back of any such mandate that denial of the legal process of a Section  order from Westminster will be turned into the mother of all grievances.The chronology for the SNP claim starts six years ago when, in January , David Cameron promised a referendum on EU membershiphe were to command a majority following the  general election. As the Conservatives were in coalition with the Liberal Democrats, the party published in June  a private member’s Bill to emphasise its intentions. It passed its first and second readings in the Commons but was stopped in the House of Lords.When the  Scottish independence referendum came along the following year, there could be no doubt in anyone’s mind that a referendum to leave the EU could take place and that it would be possible for the UK to vote to leave. Nor could there be any doubt that it would be an issue for the UK to decide as the member state – and so Scottish voters might take a dferent view from the rest of the UK electorate.Indeed, so likely was this scenario to become reality that during the independence referendum the Scottish Government warned Scottish voters that remaining in the UK could mean Scotland would leave the EU against their will. It was also clear during that referendum that, were Scots to choose independence, Scotland would leave the EU the same day that it left the UK – which was being suggested by the SNP would take place before the next general election. By the SNP’s own words, it is beyond challenge that the “circumstances” of the  referendum were that the SNP was willing to take Scotland out of the EU as a price for achieving independence, and that, were Scotland to remain in the UK, it might still leave the EU later, irrespective of how Scots voted. Scots voted to stay with the UK.Once the Conservatives’  general election victory arrived, it was announced that the promised referendum would take place in June  and would be a UK-wide decision.Nicola Sturgeon, by then First Minister, had the opportunity to put at the centre of her May  Holyrood election campaign a promise to hold a second independence referendum. Instead she relegated the idea as a priority, burying it on page  with the caveat there would need to be “a signicant and material change in the circumstances that prevailed in , such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will”.The Scottish public was by then getting fed-up with Sturgeon’s fixation with holding a second referendum and in May  she lost the SNP’s overall majority. The unionist parties won . per cent of the constituency vote. Together this meanteven her caveat was rejected – she had no moral or legal claim and no public mandate to hold a referendum.The next month the UK voted to leave the EU, but a majority of Scots preferred that the UK should stay. This has been claimed ever since as a “material change” of circumstances that justies the SNP Government demanding the authority to call a second independence referendum. Only it is no such thing.As I have explained above, the possibility of the UK leaving the EU with the majority of Scots opposed was already well known and foreseen the fact that it materialised was not therefore a change – the circumstance had always been there. Furthermore, the SNP had advocated the very same outcome as the price of Scottish independence two years before . The following June, we then had the  general election, by which time Sturgeon had gone on, and on, and on about a second referendum. The result was her party lost . per cent of votes and  MPs. There could be no doubt that with some . per cent of votes going to unionist parties the Scottish public was in no mood for another referendum – be it about Scotland in the UK or the UK in the EU. It is said there is a mandate because the Scottish Parliament passed a motion in favour of being able to hold a referendum, but MSPs voting for their own policies does not make it a mandate from the Scottish people.There is a way round the claims and counter-claims about the existence of a mandate for a second independence referendum. All Sturgeon has to do is go to the country. She can call time on her minority administration and hold fresh parliamentary elections to show once and for all that the Scottish people will not put up with being “dragged” out of the EU. Every party will need to state, for the avoidance of doubt,they will subsequently vote in Holyrood to call a referendum.If Sturgeon is then able to form a new administration, with or without the support of the Greens, she will have an unimpeachable claim that a Section  order to hold a legal referendum should be granted. Westminster would find it dficult to deny one in such circumstances. If Sturgeon is defeated then a new administration could be formed – but without the prospect of a referendum dominating every issue to the detriment of Scotland’s governance.So, what’s it to be, First Minister  Will you put your faith in your fellow Scots to back you ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit sturgeon uses vote defeat to justify scottish independence push","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Nicola Sturgeon has declared Theresa May should #hang her head in shame# at tonight#s Brexit vote defeat as she used the momentous result to incite a fresh push for Scottish independence.The First Minister reiterated her calls for a second referendum on the UK leaving the European Union as she described the -vote defeat of Mrs May’s deal as “entirely predictable”.window.twttr : Brexit: Theresa May’s deal defeated in decisive voteIn an extended statement posted on Twitter, Ms Sturgeon said: “The Prime Minister and the UK Government should be hanging their heads in shame this evening.“Tonight’s outcome was entirely predictable, andthey had been prepared to listen at any stage and engage constructively instead of simply pandering to Brexit extremists, they could have avoided it.“Instead we now have a Government that has effectively ceased toand a country that remains poised on a clf edge.“Now that the Prime Minister’s deal has been resoundedly defeated for a second time, what is abundantly clear is that the UK Government and Parliament have been unable to turn the result of the  referendum into a workable or deliverable plan to leave the European Union.“The votes now scheduled for the coming days will give Parliament the chance to definitely reject the catastrophe of no-deal and to allow more time for a sensible way forward to be found - but the Prime Minister should definitively rule out no-deal, instead of offering a free vote on the issue.“Ruling out no-deal and extending Article  would stop the clock on Brexit and enable another referendum on EU membership to be held.“We will support any such referendum, provided it has the option to remain in the EU on the ballot paper.“Scotland’s needs and voice have been ignored by the UK Government throughout the Brexit process, and today a handful of DUP MPs held more sway over Scotland’s future than our own national Parliament - that demonstrates more clearly than ever that the case for Scotland becoming an independent country has never been stronger.“We will continue to stand up for Scotland and to reflect our nation’s overwhelming vote to remain in the EU.”Ian Blackford, the SNP Westminster leader, called the vote an “utter humiliation for the Prime Minister”.He said “we are now in a crisis”, adding: “We must tomorrow remove any prospect of no deal.

They were discovered by staff in a store at the Museum of Edinburgh, just a few hundred yards away from the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where Mary ruled for six years after ing from France in . The  documents, which are inidually dated, numbered and signed, relate to the rights of deacons and tradesmen in the city, the selling of meat at the Tolbooth and the making of salt in Newhaven.Early conservation work on the documents, which were recently discovered in the Museum of Edinburgh’s own storage facility off the Canongate, has revealed watermarks – one of a goat and another of a flower – which can only been seen when held up to light.It is thought the papers entered the archives of the local authority in the s, but were then “lost” before being rediscovered nearly a century later during conservation work. Intriguingly, some of the documents signed by Mary date from when she was still in France.Experts in the council’s museums and galleries service, which is responsible for the official archives of the city, said the recently unearthed documents revealed an “often overlooked “ aspect of her le.History curator Vicky Garrington said: “Together, the documents shed light on a key part of Scotland’s past. We all know the tragic story of Mary Queen of Scots, her eventful le and eventual execution in , but in these documents we see a dferent side to Mary.“Here, she can be seen carefully managing the everyday affairs of Edinburgh, both from France and Scotland. It’s fascinating to think of her reading through these official papers before carefully applying her signature.“They are staying in storage at the museum for now. But we hope to have them assessed by a conservator and for further research to be done on them by experts on Mary, after which we hope to exhibit them, which will be hugely exciting.”Museums and galleries manager Frank Little said: “We’re constantly reviewing, caring for and researching our collections, and look forward to sharing more of the city’s rich heritage with residents and visitors through our programme of exhibitions and online activities.” Council culture convener Donald Wilson said: “Our museums and galleries hold thousands of historic treasures, many of which are on display in our venues.

She will use the D scan to recreate St Margaret’s relic.“You can tell already she was very small, and that is normal for a woman of her era,” the final year degree student said. The expert team will also look for signs of disease such as gout or osteo-arthritis and may also be able to detect malnutrition as St Margaret was known for fasting for long periods as she prayed to God.But the other side of the research will look at the importance of relics. Ms Gill said: “Now that relics are less popular it is important that we understand why they hold an importance to the church and to worshippers. She was a great figure for Scotland and it is of national interest to find out more about \u2028her.”St Margaret established a ferry which was named after her to take pilgrims on their way to St Andrews from South to North Queensferry. After her death in  – days after the death of her husband Malcolm III – she was taken back to Dunfermline via the ferry and buried.After being made a saint by Pope Innocent IV, a shrine was built at Dunfermline where she laid intact until the th century when Mary, Queen of Scots asked for her head to be sent to her, to bring her help as she gave birth to her son who would become James VI. Her head was then taken to a Jesuit College in Douai, France, but was never seen again after the French Revolution.As the Reformation threatened to destroy Catholic churches and abbeys the rest of her body had been secreted away in the th century, ultimately being taken to Escorial Monastery by Philip II of Spain.It wasn’t until the th century that Bishop James Gillis of Edinburgh sought permission from Pope Pious IX for a relic to be brought to Scotland.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"storm gareth to batter scotland with 65mph winds until wednesday","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Storm Gareth is expected to continue to batter western Scotland until tomorrow with winds gusting up to mph.The weather front caused widespread travel disruption, with most CalMac ferries cancelled and ScotRail trains on some coastal lines halted.A Met Office yellow “be aware” severe weather warning is in force until pm on Wednesday.: Hour-by-hour forecast: This is when Storm Gareth will hit ScotlandCalMac cancelled sailings on all, but three of its  west coast passenger routes.Islands cut off included Arran, Cumbrae, Iona and Lismore.ScotRail trains between Kilwinning, Ardrossan and Largs were cancelled because of strong winds affecting the coastal line.Glasgow-Ayr trains were also hit by the weather.Four flood warnings were issued by the Scottish Environment Protection agency, covering Ayr to Troon on the Clyde coast and around the River Earn in Perthshire, including south of Crieff.The Met Office said: “A spell of strong west to north-westerly winds is expected to develop across the Hebrides on Tuesday afternoon, then south-west Scotland late on Tuesday evening, before extending across much of England and Wales through Wednesday.“Gusts of up to -mph are likely inland and mph along western coasts.“Winds will gradually ease during Wednesday afternoon.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

During a visit, I expected to find a hive of activity the roar and clang of big machines.But on Thursday of last week I found the whole site surprisingly quiet. This, I am told, is because most of the activity is now taking place onboard what KPL directors refer to as the OGW.“The rig is crawling with insurance people and regulators right now,” says one of the directors, Simon Russell, as he shows me round. “They are all signing off their bits and pieces before the rig gets the final piece of paper that says it’s good to go.”Every weld is being stress tested. Every item of equipment is being put through its paces.Before the rig can face the punishing swells of the north Atlantic, such attention to detail is a matter of le and death.There are also inquisitive guests onboard, doing a little window shopping. They’ve been helicoptered straight on to the rig, the property of US firm Diamond Offshore.

For non-petrol-heads that’s  Ferraris per engine. A top speed of eight knots is the result. Not bad for a structure that isn’t exactly designed to cut through the water. Stability is the name of game: even in the roughest seas the thrusters are meant to ensure that the rig doesn’t deviate by more than a metre from the drill point. West of Shetland, it may need every Newton of force those thrusters can provide. Once safely in place, the Ocean GreatWhite will be used by Siccar Point Energy and Shell UK to test for oil in an unexplored area of the seabed.“This is really cutting edge stuff,” enthuses Alasdair Ferguson, the other director in this   venture involving his own firm, Ferguson Transport and Shipping, and Simon’s LeithsLtd. “The rig can operate in , feet of water and drill a hole , feet deep.”In other words, that’s six miles into the earth’s crust. This is how far down we now have to go to get the black stuff. As the ‘Age of Oil’ wanes, rigs like the OGW could become the workhorses of the near future.However, the days of building giant concrete caissons to support them are long gone. Whatever finished products emerge from Kishorn in the next few years, another Ninian Central will not be among them. Deep water is where the action is – and that means floating oil rigs like the Ocean GreatWhite, a sixth-generation model designed specically to harvest the hard-to-reach hydrocarbons that now makes up much of what the UK still produces. Thankfully for Kishorn, that means west of Shetland.  According to Simon, this trend involves the “centre of gravity” shting away from Aberdeen and towards the west coast.KPL is ready and waiting for that trend to continue.“The same thing is happening with offshore wind,” says Simon. “If you look at the next round of Crown licenses you’ll see that most of them are here on the west coast.”“We want to create a multi-use facility,” adds Alasdair. “We want to build resilience into this facility so that it is not reliant on any one industry.”Offshore wind turbines need concrete caissons, albeit smaller than the Ninian Central’s. That’s another box ticked in favour of Kishorn.From about  metres away, the Ocean GreatWhite does indeed look like a floating hotel, to use Simon’s description. Unfortunately, this is as close as we are allowed to get. Obtaining insurance cover for non-crew is a minefield Diamond Offshore also doesn’t want any photographs taken of their cutting-edge equipment. So circling the rig aboard the ‘Infinity’ will have to do for us.Aside from ferrying crew to and from the Ocean GreatWhite, the ‘Infinity’ usually takes tourists out to St Kilda from the Stein jetty in Waternish. But that happens mostly in the summer.“We have been flat out doing this since the rig arrived,” says skipper Kenny Mackinnon.Regular work over the winter is good for those who don’t usually have it.In fact, the arrival of the OGW has been a boon for the area. Twelve locals have been taken on in ious positions. This is the direct benefit. There is a harder to quanty knock-on effect for local businesses in what Alasdair refers to as the “downstream supply chain”. Everything from additional bed nights to sandwiches bought in the nearest shops are covered by this concept. And there have been quite a few of those over the last six weeks.Food and lodgings for visiting crews and subcontracted workers might sound like small beer, however. But the temporary largesse created by the presence of the OGW could be the start of something much bigger.Nothing like the crazy days of the s and s, though, when a town of , people sprung up in accommodation blocks behind the dry dock. That kind of development, said Simon, will not happen again, partly because of the strain it would place on local infrastructure.  Instead, he envisions - people employed directly at the site.The prefabs of Kishorn’s heyday are long gone but the dry dock is still here, its original concrete floor as good as new, so I’m told. The faint imprint of the Ninian Central , once the biggest manmade object ever moved across the face of the Earth, is still visible a spectral impression of the past.KPL have more modest ambitions than trying to resurrect what was.Simon and Alasdair are building in small steps. They’re making progress, just at a slower pace than many would like to see.Further investment is required to speed things up. That, however, is based partly on more rigs using the yard. KPL have a few irons in the fire on that front, but nothing definite yet.“The revenue this will generate will enable us to extend one of the piers, out into the deeper water, so we can load and unload directly rather than having to ferry equipment and people back and forth,” says Alasdair.Just sixty metres from the shore Loch Kishorn reaches a depth of around  metres, easily enough to accommodate oil rigs which, it should be remembered, need taken apart when they’ve reached the end of their working lives. Decommissioning s is on the KPL menu too.If , jobs were a flash in the pan,  jobs might be the sustainable optimum. By definition, the slow build lasts longer than the quick buck.In this place of big numbers,  might be big enough."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1433384.jpg--.jpg?1549442071000\n","title":"cambridge house schoolfriends collaborate for charity single","story":"A BALLYMENA writer and his singer schoolfriend have teamed up to release a new single, the proceeds of which will be donated to a mental health charity.Daryl Ball and Marc Little both attended Cambridge House and both became involved in the arts in later le - but are now joining forces thanks to a chance encounter with a book.Daryl, who records as a solo artist as well as being a member of the Ballymena band Stripped, explained: An old schoolfriend Marc Little had a book of poetry published in .Its called Out Of Darkness and it was a very personal collection by Marc dealing with dficult yet common subjects like anxiety and depression.I bought a copy last year and really enjoyed his writing style as well as being very moved by the honesty in his poetry. “They inspired me to write a song on subject.I contacted Marc to ask would he mindI used words from two of his poems to create a new song.He was excited by the idea of working together and I agreed to send a rough demo to make sure he was happy with my treatment of it before proceeding.

It honours the UK’s solemn commitments in the Belfast Good Friday Agreement.“If we ever have to use that insurance policy, it cannot become a permanent arrangement and it is not a template for our future relationship.“The deal that MPs voted on in January was not strong enough in making that clear and legally-binding changes were needed to set that right. We have now agreed them.“The EU cannot act with the intent of applying the backstop indefinitely which can be challenged.“Now it is time to come together and back this improved deal.” Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the new agreements were an “unambiguous statement” of both sides’ “good faith and intentions” but also made it clear they did not undermine the principle of the backstop.“We have insisted that the Withdrawal Agreement could not be rewritten, and that the backstop arrangement, while intended to be temporary, must continue to apply unless and until it is replaced by future arrangements that can achieve the same objective, namely no hard border,” he said.“However, we have also said that we were prepared to offer guarantees and further reassurances and to the UK of our good faith and intentions – indeed we have offered such reassurances on many occasions.“The Instrument agreed yesterday puts those assurances on a legal footing and represents an unambiguous statement by both parties of what has been agreed. “It does not reopen the Withdrawal Agreement, or undermine the backstop or its application. “It says that we will work together, in good faith, in pursuit of a future relationship that ensures that the objectives of the Protocol, particularly the need to avoid a hard border, are met. “The documents agreed yesterday reiterate our wish to establish a future partnership with the UK that is as close as possible, and marks our commitment to ensure that negotiations on that future relationship can begin as soon as the UK leaves. “The instrument agreed sets out how we will go about this important work. “In many ways, Brexit has been a dark cloud over us for many months, and particularly the threat of no deal. A positive vote tonight can remove that cloud and restore confidence and optimism in Britain, Ireland and across the European Union. “We now need to see the Withdrawal Agreement ratied by Westminster and by the European Parliament without further delay, so that we can get on with the important work of building the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK, and between the UK and Ireland, post Brexit. “I know feel that for the remains of the day, we need to give MPs in Westminster the time and space to consider what#s now on the table.” All eyes now turn to UK Attorney General Geoffrey Cox who will later today give his considered assessment of whether what Mrs May has secured is legally binding. His response is expected to be key in deciding what way Brexit hardliners – notably Jacob Rees-Mogg’s ERG and the DUP – will vote this evening.

He closed it in  having found a daily two-hour wait on either side of the border checkpoints unmanageable.He said Brexit has already had an impact on northern trade, with the number of shoppers from across the border halving in the last year.“The fluctuation in Sterling is having a knock-on effect on people’s salaries so there are less coming south because it is costing them more,” he said.“We are all suffering to a degree. And certainly people are afraid – everyone is afraid. For the last six months business has been stagnant.”Green grocer Ronnie Duke has also done business in the town for the last three decades.He said northern trade has always been an important part of his livelihood.“We would have a lot of people from the north coming over to Ballyconnell,” he said.“Derrylin would consider Ballyconnell as one of the major towns in the area, so we would have a lot of footfall and a lot of business across the border. We would be dependent on the northern trade coming over.”Mr Duke, who owns Ronnies Fruit and Veg on main street, said local people were worried about reports of requiring green card insurance documents to drive on both sides of the border.“The concern with the border would be a lot of people talking about this green card and things like that – in case they may have to be stopped at the border and produce this green card,” he said.“At the moment at the border you can just drive through, there’s no restriction there whatsoever.“Putting up a hard border there would be a big problem for people who live in the area and it would affect the businesses in the area.”Retired Cavan County Council worker Phelim O’Rourke remembers the days when the Army used to patrol the frontier.“When the British soldiers were here and you were travelling north you were stopped and asked a lot of questions – where you were going, that kind of thing,” he said, standing beside a long unused customs station on the outskirts of town.“Thank be to God that has all stopped and I wouldn’t like to see that coming back.”“I hope this is not going to cause any trouble, with tourists or people going across doing their daily business.“I wouldn’t like to see the Troubles come back to the way they were before.”"},{"url":null,"title":"devastating blow for theresa mays brexit strategy as mps vote down her deal","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Voting against leaving without a deal and for an extension does not solve the problems we face.“The EU will want to know what use we mean to make of such an extension and this House will have to answer that question. Does it wish to revoke Article   Does it want to hold a second referendum  Or does it want to leave with a deal, but not this deal “These are unenviable choices. Thanks to the decision that the House has made this evening, they are choices that must now be faced.”An extension requires the unanimous agreement of all  remaining member states, and Mr Juncker has warned that it cannot stretch beyond May  unless the UK takes part in the European Parliament elections starting on that date.Following the vote, a spokesman for European Council president Donald Tusk said: “On the EU side we have done all that is possible to reach an agreement. Given the additional assurances provided by the EU in December, January and yesterday, it is dficult to see what more we can do. If there is a solution to the current impasse it can only be found in London.”The spokesman said that the EU stood by the Withdrawal Agreement reached in November.But he added: “With only  days left to March , today’s vote has signicantly increased the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit. We will continue our no-deal preparations and ensure that we will be readysuch a scenario arises.“Should there be a UK reasoned request for an extension, the EU will consider it and decide by unanimity. The EU will expect a credible justication for a possible extension and its duration.

Information minister Jorge Rodriguez appeared on national television to condemn “Guaido and his gang” for their alleged attempt to cut the power as a way of fomenting chaos and toppling President Nicolas Maduro.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Nicolas Maduro speaks to supporters during a government rally in Caracas Mr Rodriguez said the power grid had been almost completely restored and water service was also ing. More neighbourhoods of Caracas had power on Tuesday morning, but anecdotal reports indicated continuing outages for many Venezuelans, who were already suffering from hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicine.On Tuesday, long queues converged at springs in the mountains of Caracas to collect water in bottles because water pumps have been failing during the power outages. Venezuelans usually use debit cards to pay for food and other necessities since hyperinflation has rendered the national currency, the boli, nearly worthless, but the cards have not worked because of the blackouts, forcing people to scrounge for scarce cash and search for the few shops that were open.Schools and many businesses remained closed on Tuesday, and there were widespread reports of looting in the city of Maracaibo.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Residents scramble for water from an open pipe above the Guaire River Adding to tension over Venezuela’s fate, the last US diplomats in Venezuela prepared to head home as relations between Washington and Mr Maduro deteriorated further.US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said the US, which recognises Mr Guaido as Venezuela’s interim president, was withdrawing the remaining diplomats because their continued presence in Caracas had become a “constraint” on US policy as it campaigns to oust Mr Maduro.“We made the decision yesterday that it just was prudent to get these folks back,” Mr Pompeo added on Tuesday.“The situation there is deteriorating. The Maduro regime’s horric leadership over the last years has just made le there so dficult, it began to make it more dficult for the United States to take the actions that it needed to do to support the Venezuelan people. So we concluded this was simply the right step to take and this was the right time to take it.”The U.S. will withdraw all remaining personnel from @usembassyve this week. This decision reflects the deteriorating situation in #Venezuela as well as the conclusion that the presence of U.S. diplomatic staff at the embassy has become a constraint on U.S. policy.— Secretary PompeoMarch , The Venezuelan government early on Tuesday disputed Mr Pompeo’s account, saying it had instructed the diplomats to leave within  hours. Their presence “entails risks for the peace, integrity and stability of the country”, foreign minister Jorge Arreaza said.“These are the same officials that have systematically lied to the world about Venezuela’s reality and personally have directed fake, flag-waving operations to justy an intervention,” he said.US President Donald Trump has said “all options are on the table” in his administration’s support for Mr Guaido, who says Mr Maduro is an illegitimate leader and must resign so Venezuela can hold elections. Mr Maduro accuses Mr Guaido and the US of plotting an invasion.The government cut ties with the US in January over its recognition of Mr Guaido as Venezuela’s rightful leader. US officials said Mr Maduro had no authority to take such a step.Venezuela later retreated and allowed a skeleton staff to remain at the hilltop US embassy in Caracas as the two countries attempted to negotiate an agreement to allow some sort of representation."},{"url":null,"title":"derry store due open coming weeks creating 30","story":"Moran’s Retail, who have a new store opening on the Strand Road in the coming weeks, has begun a recruitment campaign to create  new jobs in the North West.The new posts are being created as part of a £.m regeneration drive across the business.Moran’s Retail has redeveloped all three of its stores in Derry, Coleraine and Ballykelly, as well as adding new products and services.The job creation drive will bring total employment at Moran’s Retail to  across all of its retail and catering operations.

The second half continued to be a feisty affair and a great spectacle for the neutral spectator.With the lowered sun in Ballynahinchrsquos eyes, Ballymena did the smart thing and constantly took the high router, creating numerous scoring opportunities for Ballymena.Unfortunately, for lsquoHinch, their lead didnrsquot last too long as Ballymena bounced back with another great counter-attacking goal to make it -.It was end-to-end stuff, like the first half, the best of the chances falling to Millar, McIlwaine and Campbell only to be denied by the hard-working Ballymena defence and lsquokeeper.Cards were shown to both sides with William Edgar, Andrew Mulholland and Tim Crean doing time on the sideline.Ballymena had decent short corner chances, but were closed down well by Ashley Brown, Rea Coffey and of course Aaron Donnell.lsquoHinch had a few shorts of their own, but couldnrsquot convert. With  minutes remaining on the clock, Ballynahinch patiently played the ball around the back, waiting for an opening.Ashley Brownrsquos pass then found the lurking Stuart Hunter in space. Hunter was able to pick out roaming right back Leslie Harrison, who pulled a perfect pass back into Millar and he made no mistake in finding the net.Ballynahinch could easily have sat back and closed up shop, but they pinned Ballymena into their own half with a series of concerted attacks.Congratulations to everyone involved with the Ballynahinch menrsquos team, especially the supporters who never miss a game.The celebrations were short-lived as Ballynahinch have a huge game this weekend when they face Portrush in Coleraine in the Irish Hockey Challenge semi-final at pm.Ballynahinch: Aaron Donnell, Rea Coffey, Andrew Mulholland , Ashley Brown, Leslie Harrison, Matthew Martin, Stuart Hunter, William Edgar,Tim Crean, Jason Campbell, Alex Millar, Andrew McIlwaine, Luke Curry, Micheal Carney, Josh Higginson, Steven Crean.Joint men of the match: Alex Millar and Rea Coffey.Ballynahinch Ballymena ULSTER INTER LEAGUE.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£2m tidal turbine providing energy spins in to action  ","story":"A poundm tidal turbine currently in Strangford Lough could provide electricity for between - homes, it has been revealed.The Scottish firm behind the innovative Subhub has said that energy produced from the fast-flowing lough could cost as low as p per kWH for local industrial load customers.However, the Subhub is not connected to the local electricity grid and is being tested for its environmental impact and maintenance needs.The distinctive yellow Subhub mdash which is roughly the size of of a bus mdash has been in Castleward Bay for the last six weeks.Easily seen from Portaferry, it was towed from Belfast Harbour and fixed into position within  hours on January .Jeremy Smith, managing director of QED Naval, said that Strangford Lough was chosen over the Orkneys for the Subhubrsquos final commissioning before being made available for the global market.Mr Smith explained: ldquoThe Subhub is a foundation structure for tidal turbines and provides a means of transporting and fixing tidal turbines to the sea bed.ldquoWe want to prove the environmental credentials of Subhub after developing it since .ldquoWe selected Strangford Lough as the commissioning site specically as it had the iants of conditions that Orkney hadnrsquot. The Orkneys was problematic as itrsquos a long way away.

Lyng took the resultant penalty, but it was saved by a combination of Karen Haughey and then Sara-Louise Carr in the last action of the half.The second period followed a similar trend as Clonduff dominated the third quarter, Sara-Louise Carr banging over her third point and Gribben, who was picking up so much ball around the middle third, putting four between them once more from a placed ball.Gailltiacuter took over from then on, but will rue near-misses with shots for goal from Jackman, Carroll and Fitzgerald.The latter reduced the margin to the minimum with three scores, the third from play in the th minute after wonderful work by Kate Lynch, but crucially Gribben responded with a fantastic conversion of a free outside the  after a heavy challenge on Megan OrsquoReilly.Lyng made it a one-point game once more from a free, but Clonduff defended resolutely to hold out.Clonduff: K Haughey, N OrsquoHagan, J Boden, S Murphy, C McGilligan, E Rafferty, F Carr , B Fitzpatrick, C Cowan, C Fitzpatrick, SL Carr , P Gribben , O Gribben, K McGilligan.

In fact, the South Eastern Trust has been concentrating for some time on trying to find suitable day surgical services which could be delivered in Downpatrick.Miss Ritchie said it appears ldquovery short sighted to relocate services from the Downe to other hospitals, suggesting the bedding down of eye surgery will result in the increased requirement for theatre access for ENT and other services.She added: ldquoAs the Downe has high level computerised technology theatres, it is important that full use is made of them to ensure continued local accessibility to day surgery services at the point of delivery.ldquoI have already written to the Trust urging that ENT surgical clinics are retained in the Downe Hospital.Also this week, Miss Ritchie has issued a fresh call for a permanent MRI scanner to be installed in Downpatrick.She said that for a number of years the local community has been involved in trying to secure a permanent scanner which health chiefs agree is a necessity.She added: ldquoI understand that the permanent facility is subject to a business case which needs a Minister in place to approve. Whilst the devolved institutions remain in cold storage, the approval of such a facility will probably take some time.ldquoIn the meantime, a mobile scanner has been located at the Downe for a limited period to deal with a current overburdened service at the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald. I hope this unit can remain in place until the business case for the permanent scanner has been approved.A South Eastern Trust spokeswoman has confirmed that there are no plans to reduce the number of ENT sessions delivered at the Downpatrick hospital.She added: ldquoThe Trust is planning to increase ENT clinics at the Downe and to relocate an ENT day surgery session from Downpatrick to the Lagan Valley Hospital to facilitate the cataract elective care centre prototype work..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Food firm to create 125 jobs with £17m investment  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK is in line for a major jobs boost.Finnebrogue Artisan has this week unveiled plans to create  new jobs as part of a poundm investment in an ultra-modern nitrite-free bacon facility.The news comes just weeks after the firm unveiled details of a poundm investment in a new vegan and vegetarian factory to support  jobs.Already one of the districtrsquos leading employers and widely regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos most innovative food producers, Finnebrogue Artisanrsquos latest investment is being supported by Invest NI.The new manufacturing facility is for the production of the companyrsquos nitrite-free bacon, hailed by many experts as a breakthrough in the food processing sector when it was unveiled to wide acclaim in January last year.The Naked Bacon range is now widely available in leading supermarkets across the UK, with Invest NI offering the Downpatrick company over pound.m of support towards the capital investment in the new nitrate-free bacon facility.The  new posts are expected to be created by , supporting  posts already in place at the ultra-modern plant outside Downpatrick.Finnebrogue chairman Denis Lynn says it has been known for decades that nitrites used in curing meat can cause cancer.ldquoThatrsquos why, despite being the UKrsquos leading top tier sausage maker, we refused to make a single rasher of bacon until we could figure out a way to make it better and safer, he continued.ldquoWe always set out to make food the best it can be, without being bound by the way it has always been done.

The development proposal includes plans for almost  parking spaces, eight of which are reserved for mountain rescue team members.A new pedestrian crossing at the Bryansford Road junction with Shimna Road forms part of the proposal and while planners have received  objections, they have also received five letters in support of the proposal.In papers submitted ahead of next weekrsquos meeting, planners confirm that none of the statutory consultees, including the Department for Infrastructure, Rivers Agency, Environment Agency and the local environmental health department, have lodged any objections to the redevelopment of the former school site.They confirm that roads officials are content that the proposed development will not have any ldquoadverse impact on the existing road infrastructure and is acceptable in terms of road safety.Planners are also insisting that the indicative designs of both the new store and mountain rescue centre would not be inappropriate in this part of the resort.They say it is acknowledged that there are ldquoobvious restrictions for the redevelopment of the existing Lidl store in Railway Street and there are no alternative vacant sites in the town centre which can accommodate the supermarketrsquos needs.ldquoA suitable brownfield site has become available at the edge of the town centre which could accommodate the proposal and has met the requirements of strategic planning policy, say planners.They also confirmed that a study of the impact of the new store on existing retailers shows the proposed investment will not have any ldquosignicant or unacceptable impact on Newcastle town centre.Environmental health officials say they have no objection in principle to the investment, provided conditions are attached restricting hours of business and deliveries, with planners concluding that the overall impact of the proposal, which is close to a number of homes, is not considered to be ldquosignicantly detrimental to warrant a refusal of the application.Lidl has confirmed it plans to develop a new , square metre supermarket, explaining it opted to redevelop the former primary school site as there are limited opportunities to redevelop the storersquos current base at Railway Street in the resort.Lidl says it has been looking for alternative premises in Newcastle town centre for over a decade without success and that while properties have become available, none were suitable because they were too small.It says the current sales area at its Railway Street base is is too small for the store to carry a full range of goods, pointing to narrow aisles with limited circulation space. The company says the car park is too small and fails to meet its requirements, with the general customer experience falling short of a modern food store.Planners say that having assessed the ious planning policies and having regard to all representations made, all consultees engaged and all other material considerations, it is found that the proposal is acceptable in planning terms and approval is recommended..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Newcastle’s pop up beach back on agenda of council  ","story":"A DECISION to reject a proposal for a pop-up beach in Newcastle has been overturned.Last month, a Newry, Mourne and Down Council Committee recommended not to proceed with the articial beach mdash similar to those in Paris and other parts of Europe ndash at the townrsquos promenade.However, the decision was overturned at Monday nightrsquos meeting of the full council when it was agreed to seek funding for the pop-up beach and develop a business case which could pave the way for its introduction.But not all councillors agreed, with Sinn Fein members rejecting it. They said there were health and safety concerns associated with the beach. They expressed support for transporting sand by road from Ballykinlar to Newcastle promenade and implementing an enhanced beach management plan.The radical suggestion to bring a touch of French summer flair to Newcastle was initially discussed last September when it was agreed to further explore the idea, with the initial focus on the cost of developing such a facility.The idea was suggested because of the lack of sand on Newcastle beach.Pop up beaches along the banks of the Seine and other cities and towns across Europe are hugely popular and some local politicians believe they can be a success in Newcastle.Council officials have confirmed that while Newcastle promenade is not suitable for pop-up beaches, two areas adjacent to the Downs Road car park would be suitable and that the cost over a nine-week period would be pound,.At last monthrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee, politicians rejected the pop-up proposal and agreed to seek a meeting with the Environment Agency to discuss securing a marine licence to transport sand from Ballykinlar to Newcastle.It was also suggested that groins would be placed along sections of beach to protect the sand and a programme of better beach management introduced. On Monday night, this recommendation was overturned by  votes to .Mournes SDLP councillor Laura Devlin, who initially proposed to explore the merits of a pop-up beach, said the local authority ldquoneeds to think outside the box to create an articial beach or ldquosimply accept that Newcastle will never have a sandy beach.She continued: ldquoIf improving the natural beach was an option I would obviously proceed in that direction. However, it is not workable.ldquoI have been advised in no uncertain terms by a iety of coastal erosion experts that importing sand to Newcastle or removing stones from the beach simply wonrsquot work due to the movement of sediment and that permission to do this work would be denied by central government.ldquoAs a councillor for Newcastle, I want to improve our tourism product and the pop-up beach proposal is simply my suggestion to try and do something dferent. I also recognise that an articial beach would have to be properly managed and maintained.Cllr Devlin added: ldquoA pop-up beach could not just be created at the start of the summer and left. It would have to be adequately cleaned and looked after. As a mother, I would not want my child playing in dirty sand so the management and cleanliness of the pop up beach is essential.ldquoThis suggestion wonrsquot be without itrsquos issues, but surely as a council it is our job to try and make improvements and better our area where possible, expressing disappointment Sinn Fein opposed her proposal.Sinn Feinrsquos Willie Clarke argued that there was no appetite for a pop-up beach and that the suggestion to move sand from Ballykinlar to Newcastle was to replace the hundreds of tonnes which drt away on a seasonal basis.He continued: ldquoHow are you going to manage a pop-up beach that will be filled with stagnant sand  There is the potential for both dogs and young infants to foul the sand and other health and safety issues which need to be addressed.ldquoWill the sand be cleaned every day  What measures will be taken to prevent sand from blowing up Main Street  Local people and traders want to see a sandy beach, not a pop-up beach. I believe it is a no brainer that we try to secure Environment Agency agreement to place sand on the beach.Cllr Clarke said part of the pleasure of going to the beach was being able to go into the water and suggested that a pop-up beach could not provide such an experience.He added: ldquoWe need to look at anti-social behaviour issues associated with pop-up beaches which could contain broken glass. I wonder who is going to look after them given the dficulty I have in getting someone to clean the beach ldquoWe need to invest resources to ensure the proper management of the beach and encourage people to go to parts of it where there is sand.Cllr Andy McMurray described pursuing the idea as ldquofolly given the current problems in keeping the promenade tidy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Penalties settle derby cup tie  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH Olympic set up a Clarence Cup quarter-final clash away to Comber Rec, but they had to do it the hard way at Kilmore Road on Saturday.The biting cold wind and rain turned this derby clash into a lottery which went to a penalty shoot-out that ended in total controversy.Olympic held a slight advantage at - on penalties when Kilmore goalkeeper Darren Ross threw his side a leline after he brilliantly saved Niall Murrayrsquos spot kick.This was no more than Kilmore deserved, but their players and supporters quickly became incandescent with rage when the referee insisted that Ross had moved off his line and ordered the spot kick to be taken again.Murray made no mistake at the second attempt and blasted Olympic into the last eight as Kilmore were left to rue what might have been.Olympic played with the swirling, gusting wind in their backs in the first half, but Matty Hardy and Jack Larkin at the heart of the Kilmore defence looked calm and composed.Olympic were struggling to get the ball down in the middle of the park and play their normal passing game as Kilmorersquos Michael Monan and Anton McGrattanrsquos forced Stevie and Ryan Noade into hurried passes.However, with  minutes gone Murray used the wind to his advantage.Olympic were awarded a free kick just inside the Kilmore half and out on the line beside their own dugout. Murray launched the ball high into orbit and wasnrsquot the least bit surprised when the wind took over and helped it on its way to the top right hand corner of the net with Ross clutching at thin air.Six minutes later at the other end Anton McGrattan struck yet another free kick from just outside the box past Ryan Walsh to bring the sides level.Olympic continued to see more of the ball, but Jones, when he did receive the ball out wide, was let down on a few occasions by a lack of support in the box and some wasteful finishing from Shane Murray.Kilmore were far from out of it and the bustling Joe McKinney was proving a handful and he almost gave the visitors a nd minute lead when he shot wide after a sizzling breakaway run from Anton McGrattan.Murray missed another good chance for Olympic after Jones carved out another opening before Kilmore seized the lead.Callum Dougan foraged deep and played a delightful through ball into the path of McKinney, who had beaten the offside trap. McKinney wasnrsquot for hanging around and after shrugging off Stevie McGoran, herounded lsquokeeper Walsh to make it -.The unrelenting wind and rain greeted both sets of players back for the second half and it was Kilmore who went on the offensive with Ryan Slavin being denied by Walsh.Two minutes later Kilmore shot themselves in the foot when Murray floated a free kick into the box and Jason Noade had all the time in the world to head the ball past Ross.Things became hot and heavy for a while with the tackles flying in, but clear cut chances at either end were hard to come by.Kilmore were now asking most of the questions, but a resolute Olympic rearguard refused to budge and Walsh had relatively little to do, apart from the odd shot from distance.Extra-time produced little of note, but Kilmore could have wrapped things up in the second period when McKinney crossed for Pete Casey, but, for once, he sliced his effort into no manrsquos land.Jones, Jason and Stevie Noadersquos first three penalties were perfect for Olympic, but they were matched by McGivern, McKinney and Larkin for Kilmore.Adam McLean nudged Olympic - ahead before Anton McGrattan fired his effort wide, advantage Olympic.Murrayrsquos first attempt was saved by Ross, but the referee made him retake the penalty as he insisted Ross had moved forward off his line. Murray was not about to look a gt horse in the mouth and drilled his second attempt to the net, much to the despair of a mightily aggrieved Kilmore side.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Aaron McClean, Jason Noade, Ryan Noade, Stevie McGoran, Stevie Noade, Ryan Molloy, Shane Murray, Niall Murray.

Photo: House of Commons PA WireAlthough the  margin was reduced from the record -vote defeat of the first “meaningful vote” in January, Mrs May was left far adrt from a majority with just  days to go to the scheduled date of Brexit on March .European Commission president Mr Juncker had already warned thatMPs turned down the package agreed in Strasbourg on Monday, there would be “no third chance” to renegotiate.In line with a promise set out by Mrs May last month, MPs are now due to vote on Wednesday on whether they are willing for the UK to leave the EU without a deal on March .Mrs May announced that she will grant Conservative MPs a free vote on a motion stating that “this House declines to approve leaving the European Union without a Withdrawal Agreement and a framework on the future relationship on March   and notes that leaving without a deal remains the default in UK and EU law unless this House and the EU raty an agreement”.Prime Minister Theresa May speaking during the Brexit debate in the House of Commons, London today, Tuesday March . Photo: UK Parliament Jessica Taylor PA WireIf MPs reject no-deal as most Westminster observers expect, a third vote will follow on Thursday on whether to authorise Mrs May to request an extension of the two-year Article  negotiation process.A Labour Party spokesman said: “Allowing a free vote on no deal shows Theresa May has given up any pretence of leading the country. Once again, she’s putting her party’s interests ahead of the public interest.”Struggling with a croaky voice, Mrs May said that she still believed that leaving with a deal was the best option for Britain and that “the deal we’ve negotiated is the best and indeed the only deal available.”She added: “Let me be clear. Voting against leaving without a deal and for an extension does not solve the problems we face.“The EU will want to know what use we mean to make of such an extension and this House will have to answer that question. Does it wish to revoke Article   Does it want to hold a second referendum  Or does it want to leave with a deal, but not this deal “These are unenviable choices. Thanks to the decision that the House has made this evening, they are choices that must now be faced.”An extension requires the unanimous agreement of all  remaining member states, and Mr Juncker has warned that it cannot stretch beyond May  unless the UK takes part in the European Parliament elections starting on that date.DUP will not back May’s Brexit deal Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Following the vote, a spokesman for European Council president Donald Tusk said: “On the EU side we have done all that is possible to reach an agreement. Given the additional assurances provided by the EU in December, January and yesterday, it is dficult to see what more we can do. If there is a solution to the current impasse it can only be found in London.”The spokesman said that the EU stood by the Withdrawal Agreement reached in November.But he added: “With only  days left to March , today’s vote has signicantly increased the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit. We will continue our no-deal preparations and ensure that we will be readysuch a scenario arises.“Should there be a UK reasoned request for an extension, the EU will consider it and decide by unanimity. The EU will expect a credible justication for a possible extension and its duration. The smooth ing of the EU institutions will need to be ensured.”Cabinet gave its approval to Mrs May’s package at an early-morning meeting in  Downing Street which ended with the PM telling colleagues: “Today is the day. Let’s get this done.”But the momentum moved sharply against the Prime Minister shortly afterwards, as Attorney General Geoffrey Cox released formal legal advice that the changes secured by Mrs May “reduce the risk” that the backstop will be permanent, but do not remove it altogether.The Star Chamber of lawyers convened by the Brexit-backing European Research Group declared that three new documents agreed in Strasbourg failed to deliver the legally-binding changes demanded by the Commons.And the Democratic Unionist Party — which props up Mrs May’s minority administration in the Commons — said its  MPs would vote against the latest deal as “sufficient progress has not been achieved at this time”.With husband Philip watching from the Commons gallery, the Prime Minister warned MPs that “Brexit could be lost”they gave her deal the thumbs-down again.But she met a wall of hostility from her own party as well as the opposition parties, with  Conservative MPs voting against along with  Labour,  SNP,  Liberal Democrats,  DUP, four Plaid Cymru,  Independents and Green Party MP Caroline Lucas.Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said that “no signicant changes” had been secured in two months of negotiations and the Government’s strategy was “in tatters”.Brexit figurehead and former foreign secretary Boris Johnson told the Commons that Mrs May and Mr Cox had “sowed an apron of fig leaves that does nothing to conceal the embarrassment and indignity of the UK.”Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told the Commons: “After three months of running down the clock the Prime Minister has, despite very extensive delays, achieved not a single change to the Withdrawal Agreement.“Not one single word has changed. In terms of the substance, literally, nothing has changed.”Charles Walker, vice chairman of the  Committee of backbench Tory MPs, warned that defeat in the second “meaningful vote” on Tuesday evening would lead to a general election.He told BBC Radio ’s World At One: “If it doesn’t go through tonight, as sure as night follows day, there will be a general election within a matter of days or weeks.“It is not sustainable, the current situation in Parliament.”try catch  TrendingStorm Gareth worse than originally thought - N.I. to be pummelled by mph galesNewry murders: Distraught father will lsquosell taxirsquo for chance to say goodbyePolice not seeking anyone  in connection with Newry deathsN.I. child reported missing is found safe and wellN.I.

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth. There were also celebrations on the Penarth Pier on Tuesday night following a Pancake Day event, while wandering bands of musicians like Wonderbrass kept spirits high.The festival culminated in a grand Mardis Gras party on Tuesday, which saw crowds of costumed residents dance the night away.Richard Parry, one of the carnival organisers, said: ldquoToday is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time.

Last month I met with constituents over disruption to local rail services. I know that many of you will have experienced delays and cancellations to services in the weeks following the handover of the Wales Rail Franchise. I understand and share the frustration that these delays have caused. There has been a shortage of rolling stock as a result of a large maintenance backlog following the handover of the franchise together with planned changes to rail services. This has led to a signicant reduction in services and replacement bus services. I have been in contact with the Minister for Transport and Transport for Wales to raise the concerns of constituents. I have been assured that service levels are now back to normal and they do not anticipate any restrictions to services in the coming year. I will of course maintain my interest to see that those assurances are kept. I will update residents again on future plans to deliver improved station facilities, trains and more regular services.As many of you are aware Cardf Bus has recently announced changes to bus services across Cardf and the Vale. A number of bus routes are at risk as part of these changes. The removal of bus links for work, social links and public services, including hospital routes, would have a signicant impact on my constituents.Cardf Bus are not acting to deliberately hurt our communities. Far from being an uncaring organisation Cardf Bus are stuck with a legal framework that stops them from operating on the same basis as commercial competitors. Competitors can cherry pick and target single profitable routes that undermine the wider social propose that most of us want from local bus services. Cardf Councilrsquos Labour leadership has committed to supporting at risk bus services for  years. Unless the Conservative leadership of the Vale Council agrees to Labour councillors amendments to the budget and protects local bus services in the Vale then bus routes will go. The Vale Council leadership could and should act. If they donrsquot then my constituents will suffer.In future, the regulation of buses is the answer. London was the only part of the UK that was allowed to keep a regulated bus service. It is no mistake that it has the best and most coherent service. We now have the legislative powers to regulate bus services here in Wales. The Welsh Government is currently consulting on proposals to reform bus and taxi services in Wales. More information on the consultation can be found at: https:beta.gov.wales improving-public-transport.

This will be Travelodgersquos first hotel in Penarth.Opening a Travelodge hotel in the town would represent an investment of around poundm for third party investors and create  new jobs.Travelodges own studies indicate customers spend double their room rate with local businesses during their stay, which would equate to a multimillion spend annually.This expansion programme was announced today at the official opening of Rhyl Seafront Travelodge, the hotel companyrsquos th hotel and its th in Wales.Tony OrsquoBrien, Travelodge Development Director said: ldquoAs Walesrsquo first branded budget hotel chain we are delighted to celebrate  years of trading in Wales by opening our first hotel in Rhyl and announcing plans to open a further seven hotels including a second hotel in Wrexham.\"During the last three decades we have become symbolic in Wales for offering great value.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Because there will be no third chance, he said.ldquoThere will be no further interpretations of the interpretations and no further assurances of the re-assurances..@JunckerEU @theresa_may in case of negative vote in House of Commons tomorrow: ldquoI have been clear: There will be no new negotiations.

Once again, shersquos putting her partyrsquos interests ahead of the public interest.Prime Minister Theresa Mayrsquos deal has been dealt a heavy blow Struggling with a croaky voice, Mrs May said that she still believed that leaving with a deal was the best option for Britain and that ldquothe deal wersquove negotiated is the best and indeed the only deal available.She added: ldquoLet me be clear. Voting against leaving without a deal and for an extension does not solve the problems we face.ldquoThe EU will want to know what use we mean to make of such an extension and this House will have to answer that question. Does it wish to revoke Article   Does it want to hold a second referendum  Or does it want to leave with a deal, but not this deal ldquoThese are unenviable choices. Thanks to the decision that the House has made this evening, they are choices that must now be faced.An extension requires the unanimous agreement of all  remaining member states, and Mr Juncker has warned that it cannot stretch beyond May  unless the UK takes part in the European Parliament elections starting on that date.Following the vote, a spokesman for European Council president Donald Tusk said: ldquoOn the EU side we have done all that is possible to reach an agreement. Given the additional assurances provided by the EU in December, January and yesterday, it is dficult to see what more we can do. If there is a solution to the current impasse it can only be found in London.The spokesman said that the EU stood by the Withdrawal Agreement reached in November.But he added: ldquoWith only  days left to March , todayrsquos vote has signicantly increased the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit. We will continue our no-deal preparations and ensure that we will be readysuch a scenario arises.ldquoShould there be a UK reasoned request for an extension, the EU will consider it and decide by unanimity. The EU will expect a credible justication for a possible extension and its duration. The smooth ing of the EU institutions will need to be ensured.PA Graphics.Cabinet gave its approval to Mrs Mayrsquos package at an early-morning meeting in  Downing Street which ended with the PM telling colleagues:ldquoToday is the day.Letrsquos get this done.But the momentum moved sharply against the Prime Minister shortly afterwards, as Attorney General Geoffrey Cox released formal legal advice that the changes secured by Mrs May ldquoreduce the risk that the backstop will be permanent, but do not remove it altogether.The Star Chamber of lawyers convened by the Brexit-backing European Research Group declared that three new documents agreed in Strasbourg failed to deliver the legally-binding changes demanded by the Commons.And the Democratic Unionist Partyndash which props up Mrs Mayrsquos minority administration in the Commons ndash said its  MPs would vote against the latest deal as ldquosufficient progress has not been achieved at this time.With husband Philip watching from the Commons gallery, the Prime Minister warned MPs that ldquoBrexit could be lostthey gave her deal the thumbs-down again.Attorney General Geoffrey Cox delivered his legal advice to the House of Commons But she met a wall of hostility from her own party as well as the opposition parties, with  Conservative MPs voting against along with  Labour,  SNP,  Liberal Democrats,  DUP, four Plaid Cymru,  Independents and Green Party MP Caroline Lucas.Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said that ldquono signicant changes had been secured in two months of negotiations and the Governmentrsquos strategy was ldquoin tatters.Brexit figurehead and former foreign secretary Boris Johnson told the Commons that Mrs May and Mr Cox hadldquosowed an apron of fig leaves that does nothing to conceal the embarrassment and indignity of the UK.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told the Commons: ldquoAfter three months of running down the clock the Prime Minister has, despite very extensive delays, achieved not a single change to the Withdrawal Agreement.ldquoNot one single word has changed. In terms of the substance, literally, nothing has changed.Charles Walker, vice chairman of the  Committee of backbench Tory MPs, warned that defeat in the second ldquomeaningful vote on Tuesday evening would lead to a general election.He told BBC Radio rsquos World At One: ldquoIf it doesnrsquot go through tonight, as sure as night follows day, there will be a general election within a matter of days or weeks.ldquoIt is not sustainable, the current situation in Parliament..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: MPs reject PM us Brexit deal by an overwhelming majority for a second time article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How did you get started in the industry  When we first opened Asia Supermarket in , it was the family’s ambition to bring a taste of home to Belfast. We brought the Chinese culture to the local community through cuisine and provided authentic and tasty ingredients for the hospitality trade here. We branched out due to demand to also provide Indian, Korean, Philippine, Thai and Middle Eastern food and are always looking for opportunities to extend our range. Typically, who are your clients or customers  Our customers would be both wholesale and retail to include restaurants all over Northern Ireland, as well as consumers who want to create some unique dishes in their home kitchens. Do you enjoy what you do, and what in particular  Yes, and in particular having just completed the new build we have enjoyed being involved in the day-to-day aspects, given the bespoke nature of the project, coupled with the hustle and bustle of the day to day challenges of satisfying our customer needs. What is the most dficult part of your job  One of the most dficult parts of the job is sourcing good quality produce at competitive prices and enhancing the range of products available. However, we’re very proud of our new supermarket and warehouse which provides even more quality and choice for our customers. What are the challenges facing your sector, and the economy in general  One of the biggest challenges facing our sector is the cost of goods from our suppliers, particularly those procured in foreign currencies which in turn has a knock-on effect on what we charge our wholesale and retail customers. To maintain our share of the market we constantly endeavour to get the best prices from our suppliers so that we can pass on competitive prices to our customers to maintain and grow our market share. With Brexit looming it will bring a major impact on imports costs and supplier prices which will present a major challenge for our business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cleaver_1.jpg","title":"is the future bright for the ni energy market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by Ulster Business It is clear that there are a number of signicant challenges facing the energy sector in Northern Ireland but where there are challenges, there are also opportunities, according to law firm Cleaver Fulton Rankin.The ExecutiveNorthern Ireland has just completed its second year without a ing local government and in the words of David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Civil Service is “… doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances…but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions”.  This is very much the case with regard to energy policy. The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.

The proposal for the work to Broadcasting House on Ormeau Avenue in Belfast was approved last March by the BBC board, with the announcement made to staff by the BBCs director general Lord Tony Hall. Now, the plans – which include the redevelopment of the exisiting BBC Broadcasting House building, including the refurbishment and extension of the buildings – will be put to the public, as part of a necessary pre-application event before planning can be submitted. It includes a new extension to the rear, including a landscaped plaza opening onto Linenhall Street. A spokesman for BBC Northern Ireland told Ulster Business: \"As part of the pre-planning application process, public consultation events will take place this month before we can move on to the next phase. The investment to BBC Broadcasting House in Belfast, announced in March last year, will transform the iconic building, its technology and facilities, highlighting the BBC’s commitment to audiences in Northern Ireland. We will share more detail in due course.\" Money invested will go towards structural work on the -year-old building to ensure its long-term sustainability, addressing what the state broadcaster has said are \"critical deficiencies\". Before the announcement last year that the BBC was to stay put and develop its existing building, it was understood the broadcaster had been eyeing up other city centre locations, or could create a new media hub in the Titanic Quarter. The event will take place at the Clayton Hotel on March , between pm and pm, and March  between pm and .pm.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20190201_0983.jpg","title":"pwc investing in people purpose and belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business Almost  years after it moved  staff and , paper files into Waterfront Plaza, PwC will move again – this time taking around , people and some very smart technology to Merchant Square in the heart of Belfast Just  months after being appointed to PwC’s national management board as head of UK regions, Paul Terrington, PwC’s NI regional chair, has no plans to reduce his commitment to keep growing the business locally.“This is an incredibly exciting time to be part of PwC. Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Instead Paul built on the legacy of his predecessors and accelerated growth in new, technology solutions, while retaining the traditional accounting, tax and consulting services. Today PwC remains the leading provider of advisory services to the region’s family-owned and owner-managed businesses and multinationals, but has also built an impressive portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, opened the door to signicant export markets and is tackling some of society’s most challenging issues. “We’ve grown in many new areas – blockchain, cyber, cloud-based accounting services – but the single biggest impact has come from developing our distinctive ‘Operate’ ision,” Paul says. ”Operate is our service delivery business, which supports and delivers technology and people solutions to large, often regulated organisations. So instead of just advising clients how to solve their problems, we now do the heavy lting for them.”Run by Ian McConnell, a partner who’s been with the firm for  years, Operate is already attracting global attention. “Clients increasingly don’t want a consulting firm just to tell them what to do: they want a problem-solving partnership.” he says. “In its first year of operation, Operate earned over £m, now has , people and is still growing.”Reinforcing Paul’s confidence to invest in Northern Ireland as a strategic location is a  forecast from TheCityUK that it could become the second fastest-growing financial services region outside London by , helping deliver £bn of additional gross value-addedto the UK economy. But that depends on the ability to recruit the right talent, and he says the challenge now is finding and retaining the skills.That’s an issue that particularly concerns Paul as he looks ahead at the economic picture with Brexit and lack of an Assembly to the fore.“The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.“However I do worry about the impact of political stalemate on our long term future. Failure to invest, particularly in education and skills, will impair our competitiveness and make this a less attractive place for business.The decreasing effectiveness of health, environment and infrastructure will mean that talented people will opt to make choices to live their lives where.“In my national role, I see other parts of the country fusing partnerships in innovative and exciting ways between business,education and government. Compared to that, we are already getting left behind. We should be moving forward.”Which brings us to Merchant Square, the £m, , sq ft office development which PwC takes over in . “We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.“That makes it important for Belfast too and not just because it’s the city’s biggest-ever private sector office deal. As we were making our decision, the whole Bank Buildings issue was at its height, and we wanted to show our support for the city and its future.” The Merchant Square relocation project is led by Kieragh Nelson, a director who joined the firm in . “We’ve got serious ambitions for Merchant Square,” she says. ”There’s a sense of ‘OK, we’ve just opened flagship offices in London, and Manchester – what more can we do in Belfast how can we make it even better ’ And the vast majority of decisions on how it will look, feel and work are made by the team here. Our goal is to create the most technologically-advanced, innovative and collaborative space for ourselves, our clients, and also for the communities around us.”Doing the right thing is a maxim often repeated in PwC, but it gets backed up. On the morning of our interview, a large group of people from the firm, including Paul, took part in one of their regular ‘Darkness Into Light’ walks to raise awareness of mental health. The firm’s commitment to social mobility has seen a number of employment programmes launched, notably the UK’s first technology degree apprenticeships, with Queen’s University one of five universities selected to run the programme. And it’s expanding its Hive Academy programme, which delivers free technology education to primary and secondary schools, to the Channel Islands.This year the firm challenged itself and created a unique charity partnership – the PwC Challenge – to create innovative suicide prevention programmes.“Our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems, and it really does feature in how we look at what we do. We strive to celebrate and share our knowledge widely and unselfishly with our people and communities and not be afraid to take a stand and do the right thing. And we put it at the heart of what we do every day. “Take the PwC Challenge: more people in Northern Ireland have died by suicide since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement than from the violence in the years before. This is a crisis, and it’s one which affects our people, and our communities. So we asked local charities in north and west Belfast, the worst affected areas in the UK, to collaborate and devise really innovative approaches programmes to give opportunities to young people and their families through education, technology, sports, and mental health coaching.“As well as the clubs in PwC which fundraise every year for the challenge, our own people are volunteering every week in ious projects – particularly with our Hive Academy. We want to ensure that people, who are high achievers in many dferent fields, are supported to play their fullest part in society.” For Paul, it’s all about the people. Last year PwC invested around £m on staff development here, and this year, a number of people have begun the first Masters in Operation service delivery, run by Ulster University. “It’s important to support people to develop their careers in ways they mightn’t have considered when they joined. That’s a key building block of our purpose – it drives social mobility, equality and ersity.“It’s true thatsomeone decides they want to head off and join PwC Australia or New York, they can. That’s the beauty of working for a global firm – those opportunities are there. But what I really want to make sure is that you don’t have to leave:you want to live and work in Belfast, and have global clients, work with cutting-edge technology and be part of a firm that’s engaged in society, you can do that too.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/eopen_1.jpg","title":"the open its the biggest thing since sliced bread","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business With just  weeks until Northern Ireland hosts the biggest sporting event in its history, John Mulgrew speaks to the bosses tasked with organising the legendary Open Championship We’ve come a long way in just a short few years. Despite its huge golfing credentials, especially in the modern game, it had been more than  years since Northern Ireland played host to the Irish Open.That all changed in , when it ed north to Royal Portrush. And that, buoyed on a refreshed and renewed interest in both the tournament, and the sport itself.Now, in  weeks, that same links course will see more than , people flock to arguably the world’s greatest golf tournament and the largest sporting event ever hosted on these shores – The Open – transforming a small Co Antrim town for a handful of summer days.“There is a buzz with everyone at the RA,” Johnnie Cole-Hamilton tells Ulster Business. He’s executive director of championships at the RA – the ruling authority of golf throughout the world, aside from areas such as the US, and organisation responsible for organising The Open.“This will be my th Open Championship, and one reason I continue to be involved is that it’s a challenge every time.”It will see Irish golfing greats, including Open winners Rory McIlroy and Darren Clarke, Graeme McDowelland Padraig Harrington – among others – join the biggest name in sport, Tiger Woods.“One of big drivers to ing to Royal Portrush was the success of the Northern Irish and Irish golfers. They have raised the profile of golf immeasurably. “We are absolutely delighted with the response so far – % of tickets sold in  hours, and sold out within a record-breaking eight weeks.”Johnnie says the decision to choose Portrush, bringing it back to the course after a  year hiatus, was the correct one – buoyed by the support from the community, agencies and organisations. The th Open will be held at Royal Portrush from July -.“In my career, we had a similar scenario, ing to Liverpool for the first time in  years, and we had a very similar response. It ed in , and now Royal Liverpool is firmly on the rota, and I hope that Royal Portrush is similar.”Of course, aside from the golf, both the short-term and long-term economic benefits will trickle down and benefit, not on the surrounding areas, but prop Northern Ireland up on yet another global .According to Tourism NI chief executive John McGrillen that longer-term benefit could be worth up to £m for the wider economy.“There will be , tickets sold for championship days, and % of those sold to people out of state, outside Northern Ireland,” he tells Ulster Business.“It allows us to present an extremely positive image for Northern Ireland, and into key markets across the globe. We will never have experienced the opportunity to provide such a positive image of Northern Ireland. Despite what we might think, there are perception issues.“Northern Ireland has a normalised society and some of the most dramatic golf courses, scenery and landscape to see.“More specically, the fact that the Open will have been here, as one of the world’s top golf courses, will drive up the amount of spend, especially from golf tourism.”That alone makes up around % of Northern Ireland’s tourism intake. John says he wants that to grow to £m by . He says golfing visitors spend around four times that of an average tourist.Johnnie says all signs so far suggest that the Open in Portrush is “going to be an enormous” success. But the process hasn’t come without its challenges – namely theIrish Sea.“This is the first Open Championship we have hosted in my time, in which we have a body of water between our base and our contractor base. There’s getting things across water, and an enormous amount of work on the golf course – new holes, a new road system around the course and a tunnel for the players from one of the new greens to tee. You can’t do that without support from the golf club“The members have been hugely supportive, turning the course upside down, but maintaining integrity and enhancing .”He said, along with the blue light services, local authorities, council and tourism groups, the community in and around Portrush “understands that this will bring great benefits” to the area and Northern Ireland as a whole. “You can overcome dficulties with support,” he says.“Royal Portrush has never had more than , people drive to it, or get the train to it, at the same time. It’s a challenge to make sure we deliver a wonderful Open Championship and a spectator experience.”John McGrillen says the triumph in landing the Open itself was down to the success of the Irish Open in the last few years. “You had more than , people turning out at Portrush… visitor numbers had been dwindling.“That allows us to demonstrate that the course can deal with that many people. Everyoneworked very well, collectively, and that gave confidence to the RA that we would have the capacity to deliver it. The risk factors they had were eliminated because of the success of the Irish Open, and that was very critical.”As for boosting many of the hundreds of businesses in and around the area, John said: “It will do, as it’s showing off Northern Ireland… we have seen a big boost in the number of Americans playing golf. We don’t have to wait until after the event. “The visibility the Irish Open has given us. We have Royal County Down, Royal Portrush and Portstewart – that’s increased signicantly. It’s not just those courses which are benefiting – it’s being spread. People will typically stay in Belfast and travel around.”For John, the best outcome is, of course, an Irish winner. Oh, and clear skies. “A local winner would be phenomenal. It would be fantastic to see Rory win, or Tiger Woods.“If Tiger Woods won the Open in Portrush, that would remain in peoples’ memories forever.

As Theresa May is due to bring her withdrawal deal back to Parliament next week, with less than a month to go before the March  deadline, a letter from the CBI, signed by  firms, calls on MPs to unite behind a way forward that avoids a hard border and protects peace and economic progress in Northern Ireland.  It says that “local businesses believe that the failure to approve a deal with Europe on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU will have signicant repercussions for the local economy\". “Such a scenario will both hinder indigenous and foreign direct investment, it would result in signicant job losses and will stle opportunities for the next generation across Northern Ireland.  “We therefore urge MPs across the UK to consider the damaging impact on Northern Ireland’s economy and political stability in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  “The peace and economic progress that flowed from the Belfast  Good Friday Agreement cannot be overlooked at this critical time in the UK’s history. All Members of Parliament must consider the burden of responsibility that they now carry for this region’s future.” Those putting their names to the open letter include aerospace giant Bombardier, which employs around , staff here, Danske Bank and First Trust, along with agribusinesses such as Devenish Nutrition, Fane Valley and Linden Foods.
