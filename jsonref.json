I don’t ask my cover stars to do a blood analysis. \u0027What else is dangerous is we have a crisis about mental health and body image. It is one cover in a world that has venerated thinness.          Piers Morgan was involved in a fiery debate with the glossy mag\u0027s editor Farrah Stoor (pictured), who defended the cover for promoting a positive body image.          Mr Morgan claimed the magazine was \u0027doing it for click baits and get Cosmo talked about\u0027, before adding: \u0027You are celebrating morbid obesity\u0027\u0027I’ve see her run around with her children, she works 14 to 15 hours a day.\u0027Mr Morgan claimed the magazine was \u0027doing it for click baits and get Cosmo talked about\u0027, before adding: \u0027You are celebrating morbid obesity\u0027.Mrs Stoor replied: \u0027Am I saying that this is OK to look like? Yes I am. The reason she is on my cover is to show that there is a different way to look.\u0027We live in a culture that venerates being thin. Someone will see and think I’m going to feel good about looking like this.\u0027Mr Morgan pointed out that throughout the interview, conducted by Mrs Stoor, she did not mention at any point the health issues surrounding obesity.When Mrs Stoor responded by saying \u0027we don\u0027t pass judgement\u0027, Mr Morgan said: \u0027You do pass judgement, Cosmo do that literally on every page.    During the debate, Shameless and Brookside star Tina Malone (right), who lost 12 stone and 4 pounds, revealed she started missing out on work due to her weight loss\u0027She is representing to them an image that isn’t right. You should be encouraged to come out and be healthy and lose weight. \u0027You would not put someone on the front cover with drugs and vodka. She is killing herself. If you look at the picture you can see her knees buckling.\u0027Mr Morgan first made his opinion known in a tweet on Thursday, writing: \u0027As we battle an ever-worsening obesity crisis, this is the new cover of Cosmo.\u0027Apparently we’re supposed to view it as a huge step forward for body positivity. What a load of old baloney.\u0027This cover is just as dangerous and misguided as celebrating size zero models.\u0027Soon after, Mrs Holliday herself replied, responding: \u0027To everyone saying I’m a burden to the British health care system, I’m American so you don’t have to worry about my fat a**.\u0027Worry about what horrible people you are by whining about how me being on the cover of a glossy magazine impacts your small-minded life.\u0027          Mr Morgan (pictured) pointed out that throughout the interview, conducted by Mrs Stoor, she did not mention at any point the health issues surrounding obesity"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/03/15/4FAB27D300000578-6125981-image-m-46_1535986231754.jpg","title":"Sara Cox Zoe Ball Jo Whiley favourites succeed Chris Evans","story":"Experts say a woman is likely to replace Chris Evans (left today) on Radio 2 with Sara Cox set to take over          Fans are calling for Sara to get the top job and this was her message of thanks todayChris Evans announces that he is leaving Radio 2 to rejoin...Labour MPs could go on strike if Jeremy Corbyn refuses to...X Factor viewing figures drop to lowest numbers since the...The BBC\u0027s Bodyguard wins Sunday night\u0027s ratings battle as it...Share this articleJo Whiley, who hosts drive time with Simon Mayo, Zoe Ball, a former Radio 1 breakfast host, and Claudia Winkleman, will also have a good chance of landing the role          Sara Cox is the favourite with the bookies and fans to get the top job in BBC radioStrictly host Claudia Winkleman is also among the bookies\u0027 favourites for the job, which earned Evans more than £1.6million last year. Jo Whiley and fellow drive-time host Simon Mayo are also being touted as a \u0027safe bet\u0027 to take over from Evans, who has millions of loyal listeners the station will be desperate not to lose.Other men in the running will be Radio 2 stablemates Dermot O\u0027Leary and Graham Norton.              Sir Richard Branson took to Twitter to say he was \u0027very excited\u0027 to have Evans back at Virgin Radio\u0027I see nothing but exciting and groundbreaking opportunities ahead.\u0027In a medium that is changing so quickly on a daily basis, the potential for growth is unprecedented.\u0027Our plan is: to give it all we\u0027ve got, see where we can get to and have the most possible fun along the way. It makes me smile every time I think about it.\u0027The outgoing presenters of the Virgin Radio Breakfast Show, Amy Voce and Sam Pinkham, are set to be offered a new slot on the station.Sir Richard Branson said he was \u0027absolutely delighted\u0027 to have Evans back at Virgin Radio.He said in a statement: \u0027Chris continues to be one of the most entertaining people on the airwaves today and we\u0027re very excited to have one of the world\u0027s greatest radio presenters hosting our flagship breakfast show on Virgin Radio.\u0027Of course, Chris and I have a long history with Virgin Radio. \u0027When I originally tried to convince him to join us back in 1997, I had to fly on BA\u0027s flagship Concorde plane – at the height of their Dirty Tricks campaign against Virgin Atlantic – to get Chris to sign (more on that adventure soon).\u0027It was a partnership we both knew would work wonders, and eventually Chris joined us and created one of the most infamous shows in radio history. He was so successful that he ended up buying Virgin Radio himself, and going on the long, laugh-a-minute journey that has eventually led us back together after all these years. \u0027Like radio listeners across the UK, I can\u0027t wait to see what Chris comes up with for his new breakfast show. One thing I\u0027m certain of is it is going to be a lot of fun.\u0027He added: \u0027All of the Virgin family wish Chris and the team the very best and look forward to seeing the number one breakfast show and its presenter back where they belong.\u0027            Fans took to Twitter after the announcement saying they are devastated by his departure \u0027Whoever that turns out to be, I wish them all the very best, they are in for an absolute blast.\u0027 Fans took to Twitter after his shock announcement, saying they were \u0027close to tears.\u0027One said: \u0027So close to tears co @achrisevans is leaving the breakfast!!

Also a DJ on Radio , she has stepped in for him in the past when he has been absent.One said: \u0027So sad to hear that Chris Evans is leaving Radio 2, always enjoyable on the drive into work. Sara Cox hopefully will step in.\u0027Another added: \u0027If Sara Cox doesn\u0027t permanently take over from Chris Evans when he leaves then you\u0027re missing a huge trick! She definitely needs a prime time show, not stuck at 10pm - she\u0027s great!.\u0027Evans previously hosted the Radio 1 Breakfast show, Virgin Radio and presented TV shows TFI Friday and Don\u0027t Forget Your Toothbrush.He has suffered a few tough years after the failure of his Top Gear reboot and the death of his mother four months ago.The broadcaster, who earned £1.66million last year, is the BBC\u0027s second highest earner after Gary Lineker.

Then and only then will black lives matter.\u0027The reverend was responding to Wonder\u0027s mention of \u0027black lives matter\u0027 on stage after he had spoken to the audience in Detroit, Michigan.   Aretha Franklin\u0027s (pictured December 2015) family say Reverend Jasper Williams, Jr did not properly eulogize her on Friday. She died August 16 aged 78Referencing an Aretha song, Williams tried to soften the blow he received via social media after the comments about the African-American community.It also came from people who opposed his views about single parenthood for black mothers raising their male children without the help of a father figure.  \u0027What we need to do is create respect among ourselves. Aretha is the person with that song R-E-S-P-E-C-T that is laid out for us and what we need to be as a race within ourselves. We need to show each other that. We need to show each other respect. That was the reason why I did it,\u0027 he explained.\u0027Here\u0027s the root of what I\u0027ve been talking about: In order to change America, we must change black America\u0027s culture.

We\u0027re not all right. It\u0027s a lot of change that needs to occur. This change must come from within us. Nobody can give us things to eliminate where we are. We have to change from within ourselves. \u0027It is ludicrous for the church not to be involved. The church is the only viable institution we have in the African-American community. We must step up and turn our race around.\u0027Williams maintains that a turnaround of black-on-black crime would be the ultimate tribute to the Queen of Soul who sang about black female empowerment way ahead of the time it became trendy in mainstream music.\u0027I think if she\u0027s immortalized, she should be immortalized,\u0027 he said. \u0027If we can turn black America around, it would be the greatest and best immortalization we could properly give to her for what she did for black America and the world when she lived.\u0027  Williams hasn\u0027t backtracked at all, he seemed to feel more sorry for how people chose to react rather than the content of his words.He responded: \u0027I understand it.

Experts say a woman is likely to replace Chris Evans (left today) on Radio 2 with Sara Cox set to take over\u0027I first discussed it professionally last year and discussed it with my colleagues and bosses here a few months ago.\u0027A few weeks ago I made my mind up for sure.\u0027Since that conversation it\u0027s been pointed out to me that I have been for 13 years – which is a long time, it\u0027s a long time.\u0027In a statement then released by the BBC he said: \u0027I have absolutely loved every single moment of my time at Radio 2.          From left to right, Zoe Ball, Sara Cox and Jo Wiley, are among the favorites to step into Chris Evans\u0027 shoes as the new host of the Radio 2 breakfast showBy Emily Kent SmithSara Cox has been tipped as the favourite to replace Evans on the Breakfast Show.Odds for Cox, 43, were slashed to 2-to-1 yesterday.The former \u0027ladette\u0027, who has reinvented herself in recent years and is regarded as a top talent at the BBC, received widespread backing on social media.Fuelling rumours further, she posted on Twitter: \u0027Shucks. You lot, honestly. Whatever happens, today on Twitter has felt like one massive hug. Thank you.\u0027Cox joined the BBC in 1999 and currently has her own 10pm to midnight programme during the week.If picked, she would be the first woman to host the flagship morning programme full-time since the station launched in 1967.Contrary to the posh Oxbridge image that some associate with the Corporation, Bolton-born Cox left school with four A-levels for a career in modelling and moved into TV aged 19 after being spotted by scouts.But her career has not been without its controversies.On Radio 1\u0027s Breakfast Show, she told of how she had lost her virginity in a field at the age of 15, and was once sent home from a modelling shoot drunk. Cox has since admitted she\u0027s come a long way since the wild days of her youth, telling the Mail: \u0027Ladette is a word that makes my toes curl now.\u0027A married mother-of-three, she has already covered for Evans on occasion.And following the gender pay crisis that has engulfed the BBC, many believe the coveted position should go to a woman.Several other female stars are in the mix with odds of 6-to-1 on Jo Whiley and Zoe Ball. Claudia Winkleman is the outsider at 12-to-1. Drivetime presenter Simon Mayo is the top man tipped for the job with odds of 4-to-1.

   BBC presenter Rachael Bland (pictured with husband Steve) has been told she has days to liveRachael Bland has not revealed exactly why doctors have given her days to live - but she is battling a rare and aggressive form of breast cancer that has spread.Last month the newsreader revealed on her blog that a liver enzyme called ALT was rising, ruling her out of further clinical trials.A high level of ALT in the blood is often a sign of liver damage and a warning that a person\u0027s kidneys are also failing.Decreasing appetite, increasing sleep, an irregular heartbeat, dropping blood pressure and  body temperature are also signs that will tell doctors a person\u0027s life is coming to an end.In an Instagram post last month Rachael also said she had stage 4 cancer - meaning the killer disease  has spread to other organs or parts of the body.It also means survival is highly unlikely.Last week, before she was told she had days to live, she said: \u0027At the moment, hope is pinned on things like spending days off supplementary oxygen and getting my increasing liver enzyme numbers down with blood thinners in the hope they’re just caused by a blood clot on my liver\u0027.Rachael has triple negative breast cancer -  a rare and aggressive type of breast cancer often found in younger women.Sufferers will often need chemotherapy, breast surgery and radiotherapy in an attempt to halt its growth and spread.Most breast cancers have receptors on the surface of the cancer cells for the hormones oestrogen and progesterone, and less commonly for a protein called HER2. These receptors can stimulate the cancer to grow - but also mean that they can be treated with hormonal treatments that can slow or stop growth.Triple negative breast cancer don\u0027t have these receptors so this cancer is harder to stop because hormone therapy will not work.Triple negative breast cancer is found in about 1 in 5 women with breast cancer.It occurs more commonly in women under the age of 40 and in black women.A recent study of 50,000 women with all stages of breast cancer found that 77 per cent of women with triple-negative breast cancer survived at least 5 years, versus 93 per cent of women with other types of breast cancer.                                                      Her brave tweet yesterday announcing she has \u0027only got days\u0027 has sparked thousands of responses praising her inspirational dignity and bravery in the face of terminal illness. Yesterday the BBC broadcaster tweeted the news, sparking an outpouring of grief among friends and fans, and today she agreed to publish the plans she has made in the event of her death.She wrote on HuffPost: \u0027I have a Whatsapp group with Steve’s sister where I send her things I want for Freddie and his future. The things that might overwhelm and upset Steve now but she will make sure happens.\u0027Like not cutting his hair too short until he really insists, or my wish for him to go to the very best school and university possible, so long as that’s what he wants.\u0027I’m also planning and wrapping birthday presents which he can open between the ages of four and twenty one.\u0027Personal effects like my notepads – so he can see what my writing was like. Or the perfume he helped pick out for me earlier this year so he’ll remember my smell. And his all-important box of newborn keepsakes\u0027.Rachael is also writing a memoir for her son, called \u0027For Freddie\u0027, and faces a race against time to complete it.She added: \u0027It’s a collection of all those stories your parents tell you over the years from their point of view, mixed in with all the advice they give you.\u0027I’d only known Steve for such a short period of time before we married – I feel there’s so much he needs to know from my point of view and in my voice. And I think I best get my personality down on paper\u0027. Rachael has been documenting her fight against the disease in a blog called Big C Little Me since she was diagnosed in November 2016. The Welsh journalist also hosted a podcast series called You Me \u0026amp The Big C where she discussed the highs and lows of battling the illness.Former BBC colleague Susanna Reid was among those to show their sympathy, writing on Twitter: \u0027Oh Rachael. You have so much courage. \u0027You are loved beyond measure by people you haven\u0027t even met because of the way you have dealt with this. My love to you and your family.\u0027  Writing on Instagram and Twitter yesterday she said: \u0027In the words of the legendary Frank Sinatra, I\u0027m afraid to say the time has come my friends. And suddenly I\u0027m told I\u0027ve only got days, it\u0027s all very surreal.\u0027Colleagues, friends and followers posted online to offer their support and express their sadness. Victoria Derbyshire wrote: \u0027Bloody hell Rachael.

A few days later came the call.  \u0027I was at the ice cream farm with Freddie and some of his little pals.

Last November, a friend introduced the couple (pictured) to Beau, now four, and Allison said the connection was instant          Allison with Rosie, the day Rosie was born. The mother-of-two said: \u0027It was so hard with Rosie at first because we were not able to focus on really any of the things a typical parent gets to focus on          Mrs Sweatman said: \u0027When I first held Beau there were so many emotions and I knew him becoming my son meant his birth mom sacrificing greatly for us to have him in our family\u0027\u0027Then we heard about Beau.\u0027Mr and Mrs Sweatman chatted constantly with Beau\u0027s birth parents before meeting them at Legoland in November 2017.Two months later, the adoption was finalized.\u0027When I first held Beau there were so many emotions and I knew him becoming my son meant his birth mom sacrificing greatly for us to have him in our family,\u0027 Mrs Sweatman said.\u0027We definitely had an instant connection with him, especially my husband.\u0027Watching Beau and Rosie - who are both non-verbal - hit milestones and develop a close bond with one another has been \u0027incredibly rewarding\u0027 for the couple.Mrs Sweatman, who blogs at aliswholelife.com and hosts the podcast, Oh, So Extra, added: \u0027We are just like a lot of other families but I absolutely recognize that we are also incredibly different from the outside looking in.\u0027We do get people staring at us or asking questions, but it is just a part of our life.

Your daughter is so much more than her diagnoses.\u0027\u0027After we learned so much about Rosie and her medical complexities, we realized that heart and brain problems were scary to us, but Down Syndrome wasn\u0027t.\u0027We always knew we wanted to adopt, so when it came time to think seriously about it, it didn\u0027t make sense for us to rule out any potential matches based on their chromosomes, especially since there is such a need for special needs adoption.\u0027When we really thought about that, we realized we could and should actually seek out a child with Down Syndrome.

Amnesty International considers this incident to have entailed multiple crimes under international law by both India and UAE, including arbitrary detention, torture and enforced disappearance.The national Government of the UAE – a federal state of which Dubai is a constituent member – should act to ensure that Dubai respects its citizens\u0027 human rights.\u0027Since her escape attempt the fate of Princess Latifa is unknown as she has not been seen in public and her father refuses to say where she is.Dubai Government sources only confirmed she was back in the country and that she was \u0027with her family\u0027 and \u0027doing excellent\u0027.But the NGO Detained in Dubai, who have led the campaign for her release, fear she might never be seen again unless international pressure can be brought on the Arab kingdom.           The Princess escaped with Ms Jauhiainen (right) and planned to start a new life in America but three weeks into her escape bid, their yacht Nostromo was surrounded by Indian forces          Princess Latifa would have been \u0027drugged and held against her will\u0027 after her failed escape attempt, her best friend Ms Jauhiainem (above) had later told a London press conference          Former French secret service agent Herve Jaubert, who mounted the bold rescue operation, posing at the wheel of the Nostromo, the boat the group used to help the Princess to flee \u0027It is six months since anyone outside of Dubai has seen or heard from Princess Latifa, said David Haigh from Detained in Dubai.\u0027We do not know if she is even alive still.

This day is thought to be when Nuh, or Noah, left the Ark and Musa (Moses) was saved from the Pharaoh of Egypt by God, according to Al Jazeera.          Afghan Shiite Muslim flagellate themselves with knives during the Muharram processionMuharram also marks the anniversary of the historic Battle of Karbala on October 10, 680 AD where the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, Imam Hussein ibn Ali, was killed during the siege of the Iraqi city and is now commemorated by Shia Muslims.The start of the new year also honours Muhammad’s emigration from Mecca to Medina, known as the Hijrah and is what gives the first day of the year its name.Muharram 2018Muharram will fall on the date of Tuesday, September 11 on the Gregorian calendar this year, because the last day of Dhu al-Hijjah falls on September 10. Express also writes that Muharram will end on October 9.The Islamic New Year falls on a different day each year because the Gregorian calendar does not properly synchronise with the one of the faith, which means that each year, Muharram is pushed back by around 10 or 11 days.How do Muslims celebrate Muharram?Like with every new year celebration, for Muslims it represents new beginnings and an opportunity for self-reflection. As well as fasting on Ashura, the tenth day of Muharram, mourning congregations will gather to express grief.At these events, Shia Muslim sects often practice chest beating, which is referred to as Latyma and some also self-flagellate and cut their foreheads. Sunni Muslims consider Ashura as a day of respect for the Prophet Moses, but do not take part in the ritual.Did Kevin Wendt reveal he took Ashley I.\u0027s virginity on Bachelor in Paradise?Who is Bob Woodward?

We are not going to take that lying down.\u0027                         His remarks are likely to spark fury among Labour moderates who have warned Momentum is trying to change the rules so they can purge the party of Corbyn critics.Ms Ryan has been a vocal critic of Mr Corbyn\u0027s failure to tackle the anti-Semitism crisis.And local Momentum members are pushing to deselect her because of her criticisms of the Labour leader, The Evening Standard reports. The explosive question of deselection is expected to flare up at Labour Party conference in Liverpool later this month where motions to make deselection easier are expected to be debated.Momentum, a large grassroots campaigning organisation set up to hep keep Mr Corbyn as Labour leader, is backing a rule change. Momentum says an overhaul is needed to create an \u0027open, inclusive\u0027 process in order to create \u0027a new generation of MPs\u0027.They have not given details of exactly how they want the rules changed, but sources said they want to make it easier for wannabe MPs to campaign to unseat the incumbent without having to hold a no confidence vote. A statement from the campaign group said: \u0027Recognising the groundswell of support from ordinary Labour members, Momentum would like to affirm its commitment to the creation of a more open, inclusive selection process which would open the door to a new generation of Labour MPs.\u0027Labour has to nurture the talent of its half a million members and we cannot let an outdated rulebook hold back a new generation of MPs.\u0027Labour\u0027s selection procedure should be democratic, give a fair chance to all candidates and encourage positive campaigning.

The things that might overwhelm and upset Steve now but she will make sure happens.\u0027Like not cutting his hair too short until he really insists, or my wish for him to go to the very best school and university possible, so long as that’s what he wants.\u0027I’m also planning and wrapping birthday presents which he can open between the ages of four and twenty one.\u0027Personal effects like my notepads – so he can see what my writing was like. Or the perfume he helped pick out for me earlier this year so he’ll remember my smell. And his all-important box of newborn keepsakes\u0027.Rachael is also writing a memoir for her son, called \u0027For Freddie\u0027, and faces a race against time to complete it.She added: \u0027It’s a collection of all those stories your parents tell you over the years from their point of view, mixed in with all the advice they give you.\u0027I’d only known Steve for such a short period of time before we married – I feel there’s so much he needs to know from my point of view and in my voice. And I think I best get my personality down on paper\u0027. Rachael has been documenting her fight against the disease in a blog called Big C Little Me since she was diagnosed in November 2016. The Welsh journalist also hosted a podcast series called You Me \u0026amp The Big C where she discussed the highs and lows of battling the illness.Former BBC colleague Susanna Reid was among those to show their sympathy, writing on Twitter: \u0027Oh Rachael. You have so much courage. \u0027You are loved beyond measure by people you haven\u0027t even met because of the way you have dealt with this. My love to you and your family.\u0027  Writing on Instagram and Twitter yesterday she said: \u0027In the words of the legendary Frank Sinatra, I\u0027m afraid to say the time has come my friends. And suddenly I\u0027m told I\u0027ve only got days, it\u0027s all very surreal.\u0027Colleagues, friends and followers posted online to offer their support and express their sadness. Victoria Derbyshire wrote: \u0027Bloody hell Rachael.

A few days later came the call.  \u0027I was at the ice cream farm with Freddie and some of his little pals.

They were once part of a migrating community of reindeer herders but today, in their old age, they spend most of their days in the village of Yar-Sale, cut off from their nomadic relatives and friends.Though the men are encouraged to stay within the wandering community as they grow older, the women often find themselves facing the struggles of ageing in isolation.Life in the village might seem more comfortable than life as a migrating elder in the wild tundra, but it comes at the cost of great loneliness and a loss of purpose. In the past, each woman held an essential role in her community. Pudani, for example, was a leading herder, while Liliya was the only person in her tribe who knew how to read. Over many cups of tea, these women shared their life stories. They told me about magical snowy landscapes, lost parents and partners.  I asked each woman for permission to take their portrait in the natural light of their homes and wearing a precious item from their past. Using their stories as a guide, I also documented the wild landscapes they once wandered.Autipana Audi (born 1941). During her lifetime, Autipana experienced many sad losses. She lost her husband, son and daughter to diseases, and a few years ago her entire reindeer herd perished to starvation during a cold wave. Almost unable to walk, she spends her days mostly limited to her bed. Autipana, who was born in the tundra, says that “walking in the snow” is what she longs for most.Necla Audi (born 1928). Although Necla was 89 when this portrait was taken, she still wishes to live with the migrating community. “I was born in the tundra and spent all my life there, it’s the only way of living I know.” At the far left of her bed is a picture of her two sons taken when they were young. Now, both of them are herders in the tundra.Angelina Serotetto (born 1942). Angelina was part of a family of shaman women and her mother taught her to read the future using sacred objects from nature. “Yes! I miss those days in the past,” she says. “But I try to remain optimistic. I view everything with a loving eye. I think you learn it as you get older”. Vaynoto Vera (born 1967). Having living in nature throughout her entire life, Vaynoto’s daughters rented her a small apartment in the village of Yar-Sale so that she could live in comfort. They come to visit her whenever possible but as they are obliged to return to their herds and migrating journeys, Vaynoto is often left alone.Zinaida Evay (born 1946) and her cat Persik (“peach” in Russian). Zinaida was married for many years, and she shared with me that she had a beautiful and loving bond with her husband, right to his last day. Now that he has passed away she is living in a small apartment alone, with their mutual cats, with almost no friends to come and visit. “All that is left are the lullabies I sing to myself.” Liliya Yamkina (born 1944). As a child she was the only one in her clan who knew how to read. She said she still remembers how important she felt when she read everyone their letters and formal documents. However, the importance of her reading skills to the clan was also the reason that her father prevented her from going to college and that caused many conflicts between them. Now, in her apartment, she writes love songs about the Tundra and her dream is to publish them in a magazine. “I did not fully understand the importance of tradition and family when I was young. I argued so much with my parents. I wanted to escape from my roots.” But, she adds: “I remember how much I liked it when they told me folk tales around the bonfire. I miss them so much.”Pudani Audi (born 1948). Like her ancestors who have wandered the frozen landscape of northern Siberia for thousands of years, Pudani was born in the tundra and roamed since birth. During her adulthood, she was a leading herder, leading the precious herd through one of the most extreme environments on earth. She told me that she is still hoping to return to wander, but without her community’s support it is clear that this longing will never be realised. In this portrait, she is wearing a fur hat, the sole object she was left with from her wandering days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bcafdea5135df62ef44582f24025e793a54cb03/78_63_6816_4598/master/6816.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026usm=12\u0026fit=crop\u0026crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026bm=normal\u0026ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=4f989f04003369fa9493cb710213fbae","title":"adventures in street photography in pictures","story":"Funny, tragic and often bizarre, Stephen Leslie’s photos in his book Sparks are an unique ode to street photography, matching short fictions with the images that inspired them.• An exhibition of selected prints will be on display at theprintspace gallery in London until 5 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb200c061090084f446ba293ceebe9c5a284c92c/0_104_5409_3245/master/5409.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a27b705331bd58edc8b86ef6b78296d","title":"keeping mark carney at bank of england is the smart move","story":"Governor carries diplomatic clout and finding a replacement as Brexit approaches is an unwanted headache Mark Carney’s offer to stay did not sound like a desperate attempt to cling to office. In his big reveal to MPs on Tuesday, which came as no surprise to anybody after a week of this saga, he said he was willing to stay beyond June next year as governor of the Bank of England if that’s what the government wants.Big gigs like the top job at the International Monetary Fund are not currently up for grabs, so there will be a strong suspicion that it suits Carney’s short-term interest to remain in Threadneedle Street. He has reputation for cute career planning, after all. At the outset in 2013, he negotiated a five-year deal instead of the eight that George Osborne had wanted, before agreeing a one-year extension after post-referendum lobbying by Philip Hammond.But on this occasion it makes little sense to guess at Carney’s motives. He’s willing to stay and the real question is whether it suits the UK to keep him. Unless the chancellor has a whizzy alternative candidate up his sleeve (probably not), the answer should be: yes, stick with Carney.First, he carries diplomatic clout. His regular warnings to the EU that the UK is the “banker for Europe”, and that it would suit nobody to upset the financial apple cart, have more force for being delivered by an obvious Brexit sceptic who is also head of the international Financial Stability Board.Second, Carney’s departure is currently planned for next June, which suddenly looks to be rotten planning if a no-deal Brexit is on the cards. It is conceivable that the UK and EU could be engaged in a Greek-style episode of extended deadlines and ultimatums that lasts well beyond the intended exit date of 29 March. Why insert a new governor into a potential mess if you don’t have to?Whatever he decides, Hammond should get on with it. The past week of uncertainty makes all parties look ridiculous. Extending Carney’s stay to mid-2020 would be the smart move."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/529a91950027e8d17d037a7f43a34dd4b2c5524c/0_202_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35eccb28372a5af5fb5409c3604ffa9e","title":"canadian cities where minorities are the majority markham brampton","story":"In ‘majority-minority’ cities such as Markham and Brampton, ersity isn’t aspirational it’s a fact. But how does integration work?The Foody Mart in Markham, a sprawling city near Toronto, is found in a typical North American suburban plaza, sprinkled with fast-food chains, nail salons and a small legal firm. But look closely and you will notice the mall’s parking signs are in Chinese and the bank serves customers in Cantonese and Mandarin.Inside the Foody Mart, there are shelves of salted duck eggs, air-shipped mangosteen and durian. Staff hand out samples of fish balls and regulars drink bubble tea alongside young families enjoying hot meals from the takeaway counter, as Shanghai pop plays over the speakers.Stores such as the Foody Mart did not exist when Jennifer Chin first moved to Markham in 1991. Born in Jamaica, Chin, 53, is ethnically Chinese, as is her husband. They raised three children while running a business manufacturing Jamaican patties, often described as a quintessentially Torontonian snack.One of the most notable characteristics of Markham’s rise has been thriving pockets of businesses – groceries, clothing stores, spas, tea shops – to serve those groups, particularly in Chinese and south Asian malls.“It’s good and bad,” Chin says. “I love the ersity. I love that we have different kinds of foods: Sri Lankan, Indian-Chinese, even different types of Chinese food. However, sometimes you feel people aren’t encouraged as much to adapt.”Ethnic ties have long attracted newcomers to the suburbs of Toronto, transforming what were once bedroom – or commuter – communities into thriving cities in their own right. Markham’s biggest mall now features high-end shops that rival the shopping centres in Toronto. The city has its own Whole Foods store, as well as chic mid-rise condos to complement the earlier sprawling developments of large single-family homes. As cities get bigger, it’s only natural to be attracted to those who are similar to you, says Mohammad Qadeer, a professor of urban planning at Queen’s University, Ontario. “You usually hang out and interact with people you share interests with,” he says. “Ethnicity and religion are strong ties that bring people together.”But majority-minority cities also serve as a reminder that erse populations do not necessarily generate utopian post-racial societies. White flight and hate crimes still occur, as do coded fights over issues that disproportionately affect immigrants – for instance, blowback against multi-generational housing, where several generations live under one roof.There remains ongoing debate, however, on how much cultural change can be adopted into mainstream society, and how quickly. For instance, statutory holidays, which are mostly aligned with Christian holidays, are days off for workers in Canada. But in 2011, some Chinese grocers in Markham (including the Foody Mart) stayed open in defiance of the law.City councillor Joe Li heard both sides of the debate: that grocers were being discriminated against for not being able to stay open, and that Chinese businesses were trying to impose their culture on the city. Ultimately, Li decided in favour of the grocers, arguing that consumers should have the option to shop on holidays. The move proved so popular that York Region, in which Markham sits, voted that from 2018 any business could stay open 364 days a year.Li asked for something in return: to hire more ersely. “Now you’re starting to see it,” he says. “You walk in and see south Asian people in the store, you see halal meat in the store.”Easy access to halal meat, south Asian groceries and a mosque are all things Rameeka Khan appreciates about living in Markham. The 33-year-old pharmacist of Pakistani descent was born in Canada and has lived in the city nearly her whole life, choosing to settle here with her husband. She is glad they bought a house in 2010 – her family would be priced out today. “In general, people know who you are talking about – it must be the Chinese,” Li told a recent council meeting. “I don’t want that kind of impression.”But with its rapidly increasing ersity has come another development: not just a decreasing proportion of white residents, but also a shrinking number. According to numbers cited by the Toronto Star, the white population fell from 192,400 in 2001 to 169,230 in 2011, and now hovers around 151,000.Bromley attended the same Catholic high school where she now teaches and says the city’s demographic makeup has changed hugely. She sees troubling trends, such as African-Caribbean students being streamed into less-academic courses while Indian students face high expectations to excel. Bromley also sees students trying to bridge the linguistic and cultural gap between schools and their parents, and others who struggle with language themselves.“You might get a kid who presents like they are struggling with the language, but actually they have a learning disability, or you might have a kid who has no conversational ability but they can write just fine.” Bromley feels ill-equipped to help students with such different needs because they have to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, she says, and the English language learners programme doesn’t help her navigate these inidual problems.Gurpreet Malhotra is familiar with such institutional gaps. He is the CEO of Indus Community Services, an organisation that serves newcomers in Brampton. In his experience, businesses have caught on that integration is a two-way street – whether they are clothing shops hiring staff who speak Punjabi or grocers stocking Indian cooking staples – but government-funded institutions have not. Political power, he says, does not reflect Brampton’s population. “We have to dislodge the well-entrenched powers,” Malhotra says of the city council.On the federal and provincial level, the Punjabi community is well represented in Brampton. The first non-white federal party leader, Jagmeet Singh, has a strong political base in the city, where he held a seat as a provincial politician. But Brampton has only one non-white city councillor, Gurpreet Dhillon, who is Punjabi.In the last municipal election, Bromley recalls watching a Punjabi candidate on television arguing that the mayoral office should reflect Brampton’s ethnic makeup. “I had a moment where I felt, ‘Now I’m really going to be a minority,’” she says. “To be brutally honest, it felt like I was being pushed out.”The moment passed. She remembered she had a stable job, in an ideal neighbourhood to raise her five-year-old twins. But she struggles with how to integrate into what Brampton is becoming. She feels lucky to teach students with whom she can have “honest, unfiltered conversations”, but does not feel she can approach, for example, the group of older Indian men hanging out at the park, or busy mums at her skating rink. “Intercultural interaction is a matter of common ground and increased opportunity for encountering each other,” says Qadeer. In cities such as Markham and Brampton, where suburban sprawl reigns and most people travel by car, those opportunities outside school and work can be hard to come by. Brampton is trying to address this as part of its long-term vision for 2040. “The expression of the incredible ersity of the community doesn’t really manifest itself on the ground,” says Larry Beasley, a Vancouver-based planner who spearheaded the project.To ensure people across cultures can better interact, Beasley says the city needs to create places for them to meet. After taking more than 11,000 residents’ comments into account, the plan proposes five city centres – walkable communities that mimic Brampton’s downtown area – to facilitate those interactions. Creating a place for communities to converge was also Jael Richardson’s intent when she founded the Festival for Literary Diversity, which brings together writers from a variety of backgrounds. “I wanted to start a festival that gave erse writers – anyone who’s not typically represented – a space to be the expert,” says Richardson. “We consider having the event in Brampton part of the ersity mandate in and of itself.”The festival was initially met with scepticism – Richardson says Toronto writers frequently told her the event would do better in Toronto – but her tenacity appears to be paying off. This year it secured a multi-year sponsorship from Audible – the digital audiobook producer – and publisher Penguin Random House sent a sizeable contingent of staff.Richardson is creating space for writers in a city where ersity isn’t aspirational – it’s a fact. While it is true that changing demographics here have disturbed the mainstream sensibility, Canada’s majority-minority cities also appear to be changing what mainstream means. For some residents of Markham, such as Chin, the question isn’t whether newcomers can assimilate into the city, but whether both can adapt together.“I don’t think you need to fit in,” Chin says of her majority-minority city. “Everybody fits in.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65918985192d2092a51c3ced89b224d0c8799d91/0_234_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9a9e351d3b7040c65c80f1e6c0d12a5","title":"tell us about your third place where you connect with your community","story":"The closure of pubs and cuts to public services mean shared social spaces are dwindling. We want to hear where you like to goIt may be your local pub or park, your gym, or your closest cafe. A particular public bench where you go to read or think, or your neighbourhood library.The “third place” is a public, social place where you spend time that is neither home nor work. Whether it is publicly run, like a library, or a commercial venture, it is, above all, shared – a site of community-building and interaction with others.The concept was brought to the fore by the US sociologist Ray Oldenburg in his 1989 book The Great Good Place, in which he explored the positive contribution of the third place to democracy, neighbourhood communities and residents’ wellbeing.It was just this sort of organic interaction that Eugene Quinn was attempting to replicate with his monthly Coffeehouse Conversations meet-up in Vienna. “If you wander into a pub in Dublin or a diner in America, you’ll be able to meet locals quite quickly – in a coffeehouse in Vienna, not so much,” he said. “People don’t drift into each other’s worlds.”But increasingly, we have fewer options.John Harris has decried the loss of shared spaces in Britain, pointing to the decline of religious affiliation, closure of pubs and music venues, and cuts to public services as “leaving us a nation of cliques”. With city-dwellers in particular operating within silos, Harris writes, “maintaining community life is an ongoing struggle”.Last week findings showed that London parks – ostensibly public spaces – were more off-limits than ever before as councils rented them out to host music festivals. Alex Clark wrote about the implications:Nobody can say what a park means to all its users. Nobody knows what conversations are provoked as we stroll along, what agonies soothed or problems thought through. ... These dwindling spaces are precious and should be protected from commodification and the modern disease of constant, organised fun.Now we want to hear from you.Where is your third place, or favourite, most often frequented shared space? Where do you find yourself falling into conversation with strangers and having – as Harris writes – “the best kind of chaotic, unexpected experiences”?

Sky News captioned Uhuru Kenyatta as “president of Africa”, while the BBC gave the title he should have had, “president of Kenya”, to his rival, Raila Odinga.There are a million metaphors in Britons declaring an African superstate based in Kenya – who knew our broadcasters were such pan-Africanists? – and declaring an Odinga coup. But the reality is that there is widespread cluelessness in Britain about the political and economic situation across the continent today, and it shows.The royals have shown more interest in African countries than our elected political leaders have. While we have had to tolerate endless patronising and presumptuous slogans about how African economies will fill the gap left by the EU, it’s worth asking what it is that Britain really has to offer Africa.The continent’s countries are growing, both in terms of their economies and their population, and – bucking the trend elsewhere in the world – are seeing job creation outstrip demographic growth. Most African economists differ on just how effectively that will translate into prosperity in the coming decades, but they tend to agree on two things. What Africa needs is greater regional integration, and a more intense focus on domestic manufacturing, especially agricultural machinery and goods for domestic consumption – moving away from the old colonial pattern of exporting raw resources and importing food, patterns that hugely benefited the former imperial powers.Britain’s approach to Africa contrasts starkly with that of Germany, which is investing in more of the kind of industry African countries actually want. While May was honing her dance moves, Angela Merkel was offering manufacturing plants. The German chancellor, also on a working visit to the continent last week, agreed plans with Ghana – the nation Britain once considered its “model colony” – to establish a Volkswagen assembly plant, adding to the facilities it already has in South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda and Nigeria. To be fair, Britain is still a major investor in Africa, ranking way ahead of Germany and second only to the US. Both Britain and Germany have terrible colonial records on the African continent. But in Britain’s case, the pattern established in that era is highly relevant today. Post-independence, British policy was overtly geared towards encouraging exports to Africa that benefited the British economy, and definitely not towards helping African nations reduce their dependence on importing British products.In some cases that’s beginning to change, but Brexit feels like a giant step backwards. The emphasis will now again be on how Britain can use Africa to prop up its own economy. When May announced that the UK will host the 2019 Africa Investment Summit, it’s hard to avoid the perception that Britain wants to increase its visibility relative to China. All eyes are on China because the nation currently exports eight times more goods to Africa than the UK and is the continent’s major investor in infrastructure, albeit with growing concerns about the unsustainable levels of borrowing – “debt trap diplomacy” – that it is creating in the process.Visibility in Africa is important to Britain because this is still very much a relationship that evolved out of imperial domination. That’s obvious in the political choreography, which is undeniably clumsy and awkward, and, from Boris Johnson in particular, has at times been plain insulting. While China invests in African construction and infrastructure, which is key to real growth here, British investment is still concentrated in extractive natural resources – most of all, energy.Africans I talk to are sceptical about grand pronouncements by foreign governments over deepening ties with the continent. It’s hard to ignore the pull of the natural resources that Africa has in such abundance: vanadium, diamonds, phosphates, cobalt, chromium and gold. History shows that extracting them does little to enrich ordinary Africans. What they want are investments that accelerate the growth and innovation African businesses are already pioneering.If Britain wants to be a friend to Africa, it needs to stop looking to the continent to boost its self-esteem – “the shared history and cultural ties” of which May talks allude to Britain’s imperial domination – and its coffers. African nations have no incentive to deal with nostalgia, particularly when nations such as China, Israel, Turkey and India are competing for access.And if Britain is interested in Africa, as we are so often told it is, it shouldn’t have to wait for Brexit to ask what it is that African nations actually want, rather than simply presuming they are happy to provide a source of post-Brexit enrichment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3606257611de47a2b5beab6ea494d83868b9a62d/0_173_4672_2804/master/4672.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=415d51b87c69592b936153a8b526d563","title":"brexit northern ireland eu human rights law good friday agreement","story":"Once Britain leaves the EU, the underpinning of human rights law vanishes. And that breaks the Good Friday agreementIt is hardly surprising that the people of Britain, by which I mean the people of England, Scotland and Wales, are baffled by the key part in the Brexit drama being played out in Northern Ireland. After all, they have been treated to statements of breathtaking ignorance by Westminster politicians in recent months.Consider this sample about the Irish border by leading Tory Brexiteers. Jacob Rees-Mogg: “It’s not a border that everyone has to go through every day.” Boris Johnson: “It’s so small, and there are so few firms that actually use that border regularly.” David Davis: the border problem can be solved by “a whole load of new technology”.In fact, because the border has existed in name only for the past 20 years, it is crossed and recrossed by many thousands of cars and lorries on a daily basis. There are 208 crossing points, and technological monitoring appears unfeasible even in the highly unlikely event that people opposed to the border don’t put the devices out of action.Cross-border cooperation has become a fact of life and touches every sector, both public and private, including agriculture, health and higher education. People travel across the border to work. Regional development bodies aimed at improving the infrastructure on either side have been set up. Small businesses trade without a fuss across a frontier that to most people, especially the younger generation, is a meaningless entity.There is growing consternation about the likely effects of leaving the EU, as highlighted in hundreds of yellow placards placed at border crossings by an organisation called Border Communities Against Brexit. There has been humour, too, with a three-part BBC TV series, Soft Border Patrol, lampooning the notion that it would be possible to police a re-established border.But genuine concern about the border and the likely threat to the economies on either side of it is not the only fear haunting the 1.8 million people who live in the six counties that were carved from the island of Ireland in 1921. Just as compelling, and arguably more so, has been the realisation that Brexit is likely to destroy the delicate political framework erected in 1998.The Good Friday agreement (GFA) made a specific reference to Britain and Ireland being “partners in the European Union.” And, crucially, the agreement committed the UK government to enshrine the European Convention of Human Rights in law, and therefore enabled Northern Ireland’s residents to benefit from the European court of human rights.Although the British population may not realise it, this aspect of human rights protection was of immense importance in the northern Irish context because it was, and is, the cornerstone of the peace process. The GFA dismantled a political arrangement built on discrimination and replaced it with one of enforced power-sharing.That was some achievement. And now, according to Michael Farrell, the man who led the civil rights campaign in Northern Ireland in 1968, it is imperilled by Brexit. In an  article last week, he pointed out that once Britain leaves the EU, the underpinning of human rights legislation vanishes.The Conservative government has pledged to repeal the Human Rights Act, which incorporated the ECHR into UK law. Instead it wants to introduce a bill of rights, which will relieve British judges of the requirement to follow decisions by the European Court of Human Rights. It amounts to a breach of the GFA, but this is not a technical, legal issue in Northern Ireland, where rights are fundamental to the smooth workings of its society.Fears of a further encroachment to human rights centre on the fact that one of Northern Ireland’s major parties, the DUP, which opposed the GFA and opposed EU membership, is also opposed to extensions in equality legislation. It also happens to be the party that keeps Theresa May’s government in power.That reality has prompted the other major party, Sinn Féin, to call on Ireland’s constituency commission to maintain post-Brexit representation for Northern Ireland’s residents in the European parliament by allocating two new MEPs’ seats.Sinn Féin’s current MEP in the north, Martina Anderson, argues that it would satisfy a commitment made in a joint EU-UK report that once Britain leaves the EU there should not be a diminution of the rights for the north’s citizens.She says: “An exit from the EU stands to undo the progress of recent decades. Rather than being able to focus our energy on the forward march for more rights, we instead face losing what has already been won.”There has been tentative backing for Sinn Féin’s call by Ireland’s other main parties. Fianna Fáil’s leader, Micheál Martin, said earlier this year that it was “conceivable” that people north of the border would be able to cast their votes in future EU elections, while the Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly has said the idea is “worth exploring”.The DUP, however, is having none of it. Its MEP, Diane Dodds, believes that allowing people north of the border to vote in European elections after Brexit would “redefine the benefits of Irish citizenship”. She may well be right about that, of course. But Brexit redefines British citizenship too, does it not?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a2a80ba93a7e57a3dbd21a9ba1a817b5e28a53d/0_82_2832_1699/master/2832.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2160b83e6a504275cdd7de6de3f67a8","title":"chris evans stars dj bbc pay","story":"Pay peanuts, get monkeys. Put crudely, that’s always been the excuse given for astronomical salaries at the top of corporate and public life: that good people will just leave, dragging the rest of the company down, if their mouths aren’t stuffed with gold. It’s rare to see this thesis tested live in front of our eyes, but by quitting his BBC Radio 2 breakfast show this week, for a relative minnow of a station but a whopper of a package, Chris Evans has provided a genuinely intriguing case study.Although Evans says he’s leaving simply because he’s run out of professional mountains to climb, cynics may wonder if the mountain of cash on offer at Virgin might have something to do with it. (He’ll shortly be trousering £2m, compared with £1.6m at the BBC). But don’t underestimate the appeal of professional flattery. Like BBC Radio 4’s Eddie Mair, who has just defected to LBC, Evans had come under intense public pressure to defend his salary when the BBC revealed its gender pay gap figures, and visibly did not enjoy the public clamour for him to take a pay cut.At this level, money isn’t just money, but status. Chiselling away at it may not materially change anything much – Evans has already made his millions, and Mair was on between £300,000 and £350,000 – hardly chickenfeed – but emotionally it’s still a slap in the face, especially for men used to being adored. What balm for a bruised ego it must be to hear that someone else still thinks you’re worth it.But regardless of why Evans left, it’s what happens next that matters. If millions of listeners do follow both men over to their new stations and mass poaching by commercial rivals starts genuinely hurting the BBC, critics will dismiss pay restraint as a lovely idea that just doesn’t work in real life. Managers across corporate and public life, who have been watching the BBC’s enforced experiment with interest, will glumly resign themselves to meeting the most outrageous of demands.But if that doesn’t happen – if it turns out the big stars aren’t quite as irreplaceable as they thought, that listeners are almost as loyal to programmes as they are to front men, that financial bluffs can indeed be called – then we may be genuinely witnessing the start of something interesting.Sky-high pay is closely entwined with the cult of personality, with salaries based on the assumption that the PM programme would be just another bog-standard drivetime news show without Mair’s extraordinary emotional range as an interviewer or that a star executive can work miracles in a company that has lost its way. Highly paid iniduals can be exceptionally good at creating their own hype, but the truth is surprisingly few people are genuinely so special that the world would end if they left.My own working afternoons have been punctuated by PM for as long as I can remember, and I felt a genuine pang when Mair announced his departure. But in many ways, PM is still PM. It’s still perfectly timed for making sense of the day’s news, still a companionable backdrop to cooking the kids’ tea, and – perhaps most importantly – it still has the same razor-sharp editorial team labouring away in the background for zero credit. Success is a team game, and it’s dangerous for star players to forget that.But there’s a salutary lesson here too for managers, which is that pay restraint probably works best when you have something novel to offer the bored and the restless instead of cash. Take it with a pinch of salt if you like, but Mair insisted his move wasn’t about the money but about the lure of one last, midlife adventure. The premature deaths of several fellow middle-aged broadcasters had, he said, left him with a sense that life is short, and he might as well “give something else a whirl while I still can”. It’s often the rich who claim that money isn’t everything. But maybe it’s time to take more of them at their word."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9211b3b8e645b17fb845480acf5ee7fe09965690/0_251_5016_3010/master/5016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a90556f9ee82d1caca99253353110873","title":"ks2 results primary schools performance","story":"Performance improved overall but substantial variations remain between local authoritiesThe gulf between the strongest- and weakest-performing primary schools in England widened this year, according to national results from key stage 2 tests of literacy and maths taken by 11-year-olds in spring.While the results showed an improved performance overall, substantial variations remained between local authorities, while girls continued to maintain or extend their edge over boys in reading and writing abilities.In the third year since the new standardised tests were introduced in 2016, the proportion of pupils reaching the government’s expected standard continued to improve, with this year’s cohort of 600,000 pupils the first to have been taught the full revised national curriculum.In maths, girls were a single percentage point ahead of boys in reaching the national standard, and more boys were marked as performing at a higher level, the single category where they outperformed girls.Local authority-maintained schools did slightly better than those with academy status, although there remained a clear ide between those schools that voluntarily converted to academy status and those that were taken into sponsorship.Inidual school-level data will be published by the Department for Education in December."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11fa6a34a775f4cd35d149936ac46b6bfcf514bf/0_0_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e431380ee7f3ed13ac50e20652bd66d","title":"france mont blanc daily cap 214 climbers mountain","story":"Rockfall a growing risk as high temperatures thaw ground at higher altitudesFrance will impose a daily cap of 214 climbers on Mont Blanc next year, one of several measures taken to limit overcrowding on one of Europe’s highest peaks.“It’s a tough decision but a very good one, because Mont Blanc is a climb unlike any other. You have to be prepared,” said Jean-Marc Peillex, mayor of Saint-Gervais-les-Bains, the Alpine town where the most popular route to the top of the mountain begins.More than 300 people have attempted to climb the mountain each day this summer season despite the growing risk of rockfall, as high temperatures thaw more ground at higher altitudes. At least 16 have died so far this year, though just one has occurred on the busy “royal route”.Police this summer began requiring aspiring climbers to have a reservation at one of the refuges on the route before letting them proceed. Peillex said he was considering the creation of a “snow brigade” of officers to enforce the new rules.Officials say the scramble to summit the 4,810-metre peak has caused tensions among climbers, some of whom are ill-prepared (wearing trainers, for example) or unfamiliar with mountaineering etiquette. Peillex reported a tourist setting up a tent at the very top of the mountain.Skirmishes have been reported among climbers jostling for position on key sections of the trail, while fake guides have also been found leading tourists up.The new limits were announced after a series of meetings over the weekend between local officials, France’s mountain police brigade, the French mountaineering federation and guide associations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f991235848c2b5e00a451f33257456465cd1d23/0_0_2560_1704/master/2560.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e41f6417ac4f5995f895e9d605cc7d90 660w","title":"city of joy netflix documentary drc eve ensler schuler deschryver","story":"The team involved with a centre in the eastern Congo that acts as a refuge for women who have survived violence discuss the impact of their workHow does one find joy amid unspeakable tragedy? Madeleine Gavin’s documentary City of Joy, about a community built around women who have survived horrific violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), gives us a glimpse at both an incredible injustice still occurring today, and how Congolese women are combating it with their own grassroots movement.The documentary follows the beginnings of City of Joy, a center established in 2011 in the eastern region of the DRC to help women who have been victimized by the ongoing mining conflicts in the area. The center was set up by the Panzi hospital founder Dr Denis Mukwege, women’s rights activist Christine Schuler Deschryver and Eve Ensler, author of the Vagina Monologues and founder of V-Day. Schuler Deschryver is the director and works with staff to oversee day-to-day operations, while Mukwege serves as an adviser and Ensler helps to fundraise and raise awareness.A large, gated community within the city of Bukavu, City of Joy serves as a type of boarding school: the women stay there for six months, and during that time they focus entirely on healing. Ensler describes it as a “kind of spiral of love”: there’s a collective of social workers and “Mamas” who built City of Joy with their own hands, and they’re the ones who do the cooking and take care of the women. “The women have someone take care of their children so they can purely focus on their own recovery, on getting better,” said Ensler. “And they have every kind of class imaginable. I mean, they have from group therapy to learning their rights to self-defense to learning permaculture and agriculture to learning English. It’s a whole roster.”This format was entirely determined by the Congolese women themselves. “Dr Mukwege, Christine and I spent weeks and weeks talking to the women and listening to stories,” said Ensler. “We started asking women what they wanted. What did they need the most, what would help them the most? And the majority of them said that they needed a safe space where they could heal. Where they could learn, where they could become leaders and do something to change the direction of the country.”Eastern DRC is rich in the four most commonly mined conflict minerals: coltan, tin, tungsten and gold. Once processed, these minerals are sold to companies all over the world to make consumer products such as phones, laptops, cars and appliances. Coltan, in particular, is the integral ingredient that allows smartphones and electronics to hold a charge. Some of the companies that use coltan, and thus benefit from these conflicts, are Apple, Nintendo, Sharp, Nikon, Sony, Canon, Toshiba, Lenovo and Samsung.The demand for these invaluable resources has led countless militia groups to vie for control of the mines, and this proxy war has created unspeakable atrocities in the surrounding areas, with many of the victims being women and girls. It’s almost impossible to accurately track the magnitude of this humanitarian disaster, but a study published in the American Journal of Public Health estimated about 48 women are raped in the DRC every hour. At his Panzi hospital, Dr Mukwege has performed reconstructive surgery on over 40,000 women who have been brutalized by sexual violence as a result of militia taking over their villages. In speaking to the  in 2015, Mukwege called rape the “monstrosity of the century”.Schuler Deschryver said the militia use “rape as a weapon” solely to “terrorize people”. This conflict has been raging since 1996 while the war that sparked these events officially ended in July 2003, both Ensler and Schuler Deschryver have seen little meaningful, lasting change from the world powers and multinational corporations that benefit from the sale of these minerals.“You know, I think this is where I become like a crazy person, because it’s over 12 years later and Dr Mukwege, Christine and I have made the rounds to every person with power on the planet and it’s still going on,” said Ensler. “Nothing has changed. And then you start thinking like, OK, do the people of Congo matter to anyone? Do the women of Congo matter to anyone?”There have been some attempts to audit the sale of conflict minerals. In 2012, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted a rule mandated by former president Barack Obama’s Dodd-Frank Act that companies registered with the SEC had to disclose the use of conflict minerals sourced from the DRC, and they had to submit their reports by May 2014. While well-intentioned, regulating the minerals did not successfully snuff out the violence or existence of various militia groups. Amnesty International published a study in 2016 that concluded that many of the companies subject to reporting requirements under Dodd-Frank were still “contributing to the funding of armed groups or fuelling human rights abuses in the DRC”. As late as March 2018, those same companies were still “trying to ensure” their coltan was ethically sourced, and just last year Donald Trump drafted an executive order that would suspend the Dodd-Frank rule entirely.“I don’t think they want it to change,” said Schuler Deschryver. “They want to keep going on so they can just plunder Congo with no witnesses.”It’s an endlessly frustrating situation, and the hope is that the wide release of City of Joy on Netflix will help people to realize how interconnected we all are – and how we should be demanding our own countries and corporations do better. “I think people are so surprised to find out how complicit we all are in these wars and in the rape,” said Ensler. “Because the fact of the matter is, every time a village gets ransacked, and every time a rape is used to get people to flee their villages, it’s so the village can be taken over because of the mines. And so we’re all part of this story, whether we know it or not.”The women of City of Joy, meanwhile, continue to do the important work – healing themselves, healing each other and figuring out, hopefully, how to heal the country itself.Since its inception in 2011, City of Joy has graduated 1,117 women. “When women arrive … many of them have been exiled because they’ve been raped. They’ve been marginalized and really live on the edges. And many come so bruised and so battered and with diseases and sickness,” said Ensler. “And when you see them six months later you can’t even believe it’s the same people. They’re just these radiant, gorgeous flowers that have blossomed and who are secure and competent.”It’s difficult to see how and when the violence in the DRC will end, but that doesn’t stop the women from focusing on their goal of raising awareness, and demanding more responsibility and transparency from foreign entities. “For the war to end in Congo, I don’t know how,” said Schuler Deschryver. “I don’t know how this will end, but we will keep fighting, knowing we are fighting against giants and we are just little.”And there’s hope that the film will inspire more to join the movement. “It’s really hard to get people to care about women in Congo, as you can imagine,” said Ensler. “And I feel so overjoyed that finally their voices and their stories are getting out. So it’s thrilling, and hopefully this will inspire people to wake up to not only what’s happening in the Congo, but also just to think about how we can create literal and metaphoric City of Joys everywhere.”You can find ways to help City of Joy at their website."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28850a5c0e8500b329f90f2fe4d571f16ba98256/429_1383_7201_4321/master/7201.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5d22aa162fa99c8ab4ff838ae21d7ec","title":"tamal ray recipe bavarian apple mousse","story":"A light and fruity dessert, perfect for saying goodbye to summerWith autumn nearly here, I find myself wondering, once again, what to do with the mountain of apples from the old tree in my parents’ garden.

Shelly Kerr’s side celebrated automatic qualification as winners of Group Two courtesy of Ross’s goal in a 2-1 triumph after Little’s early opener had been cancelled out by an Albanian equaliser.While the visiting celebrations in Shkoder were ectastic, things were a little lower key in Pavlodar where England ended their qualifying campaign unbeaten with seven wins and one draw. Between now and next June Neville wants intense, and increased, competition for places in his squad and England’s manager used the opportunity of an ostensibly dead rubber against the group’s bottom side by making 11 changes from the side who started at Rodney Parade. The England team who ran out against Kazakhstan duly contained seven players making their full debuts.Considering their hosts had only scored twice during a dismal qualifying campaign – and one of those was an own goal – such inexperience did not hamper Neville’s players. By half-time a Beth Mead penalty and another goal from Rachel Daly had put them two up.Neville describes the latter, Houston Dash utility player as “seven footballers all rolled into” and, deployed as a forward on this occasion, Daly - who has also excelled at left back recently - once again emphasised her versatility.Alongside her and Mead, Reading’s Lauren Bruton also shone as she won her first cap but it was Izzy Christiansen – the midfielder who swapped Manchester City for Lyon this summer – who put Neville’s side three up in the 54th minute following Bruton’s cross.Another debutant, Birmingham’s Lucy Staniforth, - who has overcome two ruptured cruciate ligaments - claimed a 66th-minute fourth before England won another penalty. This time, though, Arsenal’s Mead missed, hitting a post.Undeterred, Mead soon atoned by shooting the fifth and Bruton created the sixth for the substitute Lucy Bronze as Welsh play-off hopes evaporated.Although Ludlow’s side, who for a time where above England in their group table and held Neville’s players to a 0-0 draw at Southampton last April, finished second, they were not one of the four best qualifiers across seven groups. Having completed their fixtures, Ludlow’s players were left on tenterhooks waiting to see if other results went their way.Agonisingly they did not o Germany, Norway and Sweden joined Scotland in clinching automatic qualification Belgium, Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands found themselves consigned to the lottery of two play-off games to determine the final European place at France 2019.Considering the Netherlands are European Champions - they beat England in the semi-finals of Euro 2017 before defeating Denmark in the final – their failure to qualify automatically will be seen as a setback."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b1b2549803670d0668bbb311a6ad9d627991980/180_734_3630_2178/master/3630.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c0dbcd82642c21e09b3ac4a46f968e6","title":"steve sidwell interview retirement premier league brighton","story":"Much-travelled midfielder reflects on career as a Premier League player and on the tough decision to call it a day earlier this year“I’ve been with my wife since we were kids at school and she had never seen me cry, ever,” Steve Sidwell says as he remembers the spring evening this year when he sat next to her on their bathroom floor. Sidwell cried for a long time, his tears leaving little marks wherever he looked, as he finally accepted that his career as a professional footballer was over.He had joined the Arsenal academy 26 years before, aged nine, and played in the Premier League for Reading, Chelsea, Aston Villa, Fulham and Stoke before joining Brighton in 2016. Sidwell helped Brighton gain promotion to the Premier League last year but he had been injured for the whole of their first season back in the top flight. A varied career, which saw him work under managers as different as Arsène Wenger and José Mourinho, had ended and Sidwell felt overwhelmed.A small smile drifts across his previously serious face. “In a way I wanted the tears to happen. It was good, it was a real relief. Once it happened I accepted it. That was it. I was done as a player.”On an autumn morning at Brighton’s training ground, where Sidwell will coach the under-16 squad an hour from now, the 35-year-old reflects on the pain of letting go and the anticipation of a new life. He may fulfil his ambition of becoming a high-level coach or carve out a different path as a pundit as Sidwell is bright and perceptive. The former midfielder is also honest when he considers the ide that separates most footballers from mainstream society – while capturing the insecurities inside the Premier League bubble.Did he avoid showing emotion as a footballer? “Yeah. You grow up not wanting to show weakness in a dressing room because the other players will have a different opinion of you. You don’t want to show the gaffer that either because you might not be selected. So you build up a front.”That front disappeared once he decided to retire. “There was a honeymoon period where you’re telling people and it’s all new. But then you reach the stage of ‘I’m crossing the line’. So I was nervous, excited, scared. It’s every emotion you can imagine – an out-of-body experience. It’s similar to scoring a goal. You can’t really describe it. Football is something I’ve always done so I’ve had that structure and been given instructions day in, day out.“I’m really close to my wife but others aren’t so lucky. You see how the orce rate goes up for former footballers. You’ve been doing something you love for so long and then it’s gone. It can be a bereavement and you take it out on the ones nearest to you.”Sidwell describes the jolt footballers feel when cut free from their high-pressured but numbingly cosseted world. “Football is about instant results. Yes, footballers live a luxurious life and we get given everything. If you split a pair of boots you get a new pair that same afternoon. If you’ve got a cough you see the club doctor. And you get a prescription that’s filled straightaway. Everything’s given to you instantly.“You’re a commodity to the club, and they want you to have no stress. So you lose a little touch with reality. I’ve never had a GP because I’ve never needed to go outside my club but in the big world you need to pay accounts, sort out your MOT. People outside football won’t always grasp this but not doing these little things can mean you lose touch with society.”It also means that some footballers don’t develop many social skills. “One hundred per cent,” Sidwell says. “It’s even more so for the top players. They get criticised if they go out or if they stay in. They can’t win so in the end they build up a barrier. Now when your career finishes you’re not really used to talking to people. And you obviously need that skill in the real world.”Sidwell is different because, as he explains, “throughout my career I’ve been very grounded and that’s come from mum and dad. My dad had a scaffolding company in south London and he had me working as a kid – even on my days off when I was a pro at Arsenal. He’d come into my room at half-six and get me up for work.“My kids are very fortunate, they can get most things but I’m having the same thing with my 12-year-old son. He smashed his iPhone and said: ‘Dad, can I have another one?’ I said: ‘Well, give me £600.’ He only had £150 in his savings. I said: ‘OK, earn it.’ My brother’s now taken on my dad’s company so my eldest son has been working there in the holidays.”His three sons play football and, as Sidwell says, “sometimes they think: ‘Dad’s a footballer, I can be one too.’ But they’re slowly grasping it’s a brutal and relentless road.”Sidwell expresses concern that, despite admiring the way in which Gareth Southgate helped his England World Cup squad reconnect with the public, the gap between Premier League footballers and ordinary people is deepening. “More so than ever now. The Premier League, PFA and clubs do a lot in terms of trying to interact with fans and local communities. That’s great but there’s a big gap now. How many times do you see teams get off the coach and they can’t go near the barriers? They can’t sign autographs, so that connection is lost. We need to get it back quickly. Football should be about enjoyment but the business side is taking over.”Mourinho signed him for Chelsea, in 2007, and he struggled to break into the first team, making 15 appearances in his one season at the club. Sidwell’s personal experience with Mourinho, however, stands in stark contrast to his impressions of the manager’s troubles at Manchester United. “He was brilliant with me even though I came in the year he left. It was that third-season syndrome for him. But his player management was unreal then. He told me two weeks before my starting debut: ‘You’re training really well. You’re not playing this Saturday but you’re starting at the Bridge, against Blackburn, the following Saturday. Get mentally prepared.’ He had brilliant little touches then.Steve Coppell is Sidwell’s favourite manager, after they forged such a close bond at Reading, but his respect for Brighton’s Chris Hughton runs deep and he believes “the gaffer is right up there and I’ve worked with some of the best in the game”.As well as being an assistant coach of Brighton’s under-16s Sidwell is a club ambassador. “Brighton have been fantastic and allowed me to adjust. I had a summer holiday in August which was my first in 20 years. I’m now loving the coaching. I’ve got my B coaching badges and I’m in the final stages of getting my A licence. You need to earn your stripes, learn the trade, and your coaching career could swiftly take off – or come crashing down. But I’d rather do it, and fail, than not try.“In six months I might say: ‘This is not for me’ and the media side might take off. I would’ve liked to have done TV and media to start but look at Stevie Gerrard and Frank Lampard. They could’ve done media work permanently but they’re competitive. The competitive edge draws us back in. I’m spinning plates and we’ll see what takes off.“But I’m happy with my decision to retire. The toughest thing was admitting it – because of injuries I didn’t go on my terms. But there’s nothing I would change. I did everything with purpose and intent. If it worked out, or didn’t, I knew I’d tried my best.”Sidwell looks up, nods and smiles with the certainty that, after the pain of retirement, he will apply the same principles in his new life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41cc5370a8266849b0b854a4595bbfb5dabe5842/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d7c349d0db5961e80fdb75544c3b51b","title":"destiny 2 forsaken","story":"Following fan criticism that the game was limiting how much they could play it each week, the newest expansion has reversed course – with more to do than ever beforeWith all the focus on the economics and communities of Destiny – and other all-consuming “hobby” games ranging from Fifa to Battlefield – it can be easy to overlook that they’re supposed to be fun. But based on a day sitting down with a near-final version of the game in Bungie’s studios just outside Seattle, Washington, it’s clearly been as much on the minds of the team as any of the financial and fan pressure facing the developer.When it was released last autumn, Destiny 2 dialled back on the original’s endless grind, for better and cooler weapons. It won praise from fans and critics for ditching the randomly awarded loot of the first game, in favour of a more predictable system that guaranteed players powerful items for hitting weekly milestones. But the reaction to the changes wasn’t what Bungie expected. Rather than feeling like they were freed from a pointless chore, a vocal part of Destiny’s player base felt like the game was artificially limiting how much they could play it each week.And so, with the newest expansion to Destiny 2: Forsaken, Bungie has reversed course. There’s more to do than ever before, with the reintroduction of collectible bounties, weapons with randomised perks, multiple types of new currencies, and more.There’s also an entirely new mode, Gambit, that shares top billing with the new story-driven campaign. Gambit sees two teams of four competing to be the fastest to take out waves of computer-controlled enemies, gather the items they drop and deposit them in a central bank. This indirect competition becomes direct when your deposits spawn large, tricky enemies in your opponents’ arena, blocking any further banking until they’re cleared and more direct still when, periodically, one member of your team can “invade” the opposing team’s map, taking out players.The whole thing comes to a head with a boss-tier enemy to kill, even while the invasions continue. First team to take out their giant mob wins the game, and best of three games takes the match.Gambit is the most fun I’ve had playing Destiny for years. The competitive element makes every game feel meaningful, in contrast to some of the story missions, which rapidly cease to provide any reward beyond the satisfying feeling of popping aliens’ heads off their shoulders. But unlike Crucible, Destiny’s long-running player-versus-player mode, the matches aren’t ultra-tense. A Gambit match is surprisingly relaxing, only taking on a frantic edge when an opposing player invades.For the Forsaken expansion campaign, the changes are more evolutionary, less revolutionary. For longtime Destiny fans, perhaps the biggest shock of the opening couple of hours isn’t the much-trailed death of fan-favourite robot Cayde-6, but what follows shortly after, when the player’s character talks. s haven’t always been the strong, silent type – they had a fair few lines of dialogue in the original Destiny – but since 2015, their chat has been limited to grunts and exclamations.That tonal shift, a rethinking of what the world of Destiny is, continues throughout the first chunk of the games’ campaign. One character, an alien from a race with very few talking roles in the series, arrives speaking flawless English with a southern drawl, and reels off a list of villains the player is to take out, giving each one a personality and a backstory. Gone are the days when characters would drop preposterous names such as Herald of Xol, and Bungie would hope that the air of mystery made up for the slender substance.For die hard Destiny players, the story missions are always just an appetiser. By the midway point of Forsaken’s campaign it was clear that players would not be wanting for endgame activities. Multiple forms of bounties, a plethora of in-game currencies, and the reintroduction of random rolls for some weapons all give players plenty to do. The question for Bungie will be whether it can convince them that it’s worth getting reinvested all over again. • Destiny 2: Forsaken is released on 4 September. Activision provided flights and accommodation to attend the preview event."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f581aecff41be3bf7ad4bb499223b41e693eba74/0_197_2923_1754/master/2923.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82c1de67956b68c6da5ae9e4312b2a7c","title":"the secret to self improvement time washing dishes and other drudgery","story":"Even the most tedious task can become an enriching experience when you’re listening to great podcasts, audio books and moreWe have more time on our hands than we think. According to a 2017 study, the average driver in the UK will spend 32 hours a year in traffic jams. In 2016, the Trade Union Congress found that around 3.7 million workers spent more than two hours commuting each work day.Furthermore, research for cleaning experts Jeyes claims that the average Brit spends nearly 21 hours a week on household chores. That’s 45 days a year on everything from doing the washing up to tidying up, ironing and walking the dog.On the whole, these activities represent sheer drudgery. Yet there’s little reason why these monotonous, repetitive undertakings should send us spiralling into an intellectual netherworld. This goes for other less-humdrum tasks – be they running, working out in the gym, cooking or taking a bath. Instead, we should see them as fresh windows of opportunity to enrich our daily lives. A good audiobook, documentary or podcast can be just right for transforming the banal into something genuinely entertaining or instructive. Indeed, as a recent study by University College London – in collaboration with Audible – demonstrated, listening to an audiobook can be even more emotionally engaging than watching films or TV.Testing scenes from stories across a range of genres on more than 100 people aged between 18 and 67, the research conclusively showed that audio produced a stronger physiological response in participants compared with video adaptations. This was indicated by a greater fluctuation in both heart rate and electrodermal activity. Given this power to engage the emotions of listeners, audio content offers a great opportunity for escapism during dull chores or a punishing commute. Ever listened to Audible Original’s Treasure Island on the underground? Try it. Creaking claustrophobia, stale air and rattling carriages give way to high seas, gold and mutiny. You are no longer a dour-faced commuter but young adventurer Jim Hawkins the guy next to you, Long John Silver. Comedy and Monday morning might seem odd companions, but I defy anyone to listen to Alan Partridge’s 2011 memoirs par excellence, I, Partridge, and not raise a chortle. Read by creator Steve Coogan, Norwich’s most famous son is brought to life in all his horrendous, score-settling glory. Although containing significantly less hubris, Parks and Recreation star Amy Poehler’s autobiography, Yes Please, is no less entertaining, and offers up a genuinely charming insight into friendship, parenthood and love. Guest vocal appearances from the likes of Seth Meyers, Patrick Stewart and Kathleen Turner all add to the fun. Of the chores mentioned above, washing up is perhaps most conducive to a strange mood of contemplation – being elbow-deep in suds is an immersive experience, in both a literal and figurative sense. An absorbing podcast or piece of audio journalism can be just the ticket in this instance. One of the picks of last year, Jon Ronson’s The Butterfly Effect, delves into the world of free porn as part of his latest sprawling investigation. Far from being salacious or judgmental – despite traditional perceptions of the subject matter – this podcast is both eye-opening and, in places, deeply moving, and was nominated for the Audie award for nonfiction 2018.In addition to being an extraordinary storyteller, Ronson possesses a voice that is homely and soothing in tone – a sibilant mesh of south Wales and north-west England. In some instances, one might be forgiven for selecting listening material based almost exclusively on the reader’s brogue – especially when going to sleep at the end of the day.Stephen Fry is surely the nation’s favourite reader, lending his voice to numerous audiobooks, which range from the Harry Potter series to Paddington Bear and Sherlock Holmes: The Definitive Collection. Another reader who’s well worth setting your Audible sleep timer to is Sean Barrett. In possession of resonant, rich and honeyed tones, Barrett is best-known to English-speaking listeners as the voice of Jo Nesbo. He is also the reader of Michael Robotham’s latest psychological thriller The Other Wife. Scarlett Johansson also does a decent job of tackling Lewis Carroll’s dizzying assortment of characters in Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland. More solitary pursuits – think an overnight road trip or a long-distance run – can afford a kind of intimacy to heart-on-sleeve audiobooks. Actor and comedian Robert “Peep Show” Webb’s autobiography How Not to be a Boy proved something of a revelation last year, with its poignant depiction of childhood and losing a mother young.Similarly, to hear the late, great Maya Angelou read I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings from beyond the grave is at once compelling, moving and vital. Of course, what you choose to listen to, and where, boils down to subjective mixing and matching. There is no rule of thumb here.

Indeed, award-winning Nigerian novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie once wrote that in “nonfiction, and in particular the literary memoir, the stylised recollection of personal experience, is often as much about character and story and emotion as fiction is”.For that reason, memoirs lend themselves brilliantly to being read aloud, offering personal yet universal tales of hardship or happiness, or maybe both. They can be captivatingly recounted by their well-known authors, who get another chance to put their own spin on a story they’ve lived and chronicled. Alternatively, they can draw you into an extraordinary but less-publicised life.Either way, there’s something about the warmth and human connection of hearing these stories read aloud as audiobooks that makes them a cut above a bingeable boxset.

This is the birthplace of Voltaire, Proust and Simone de Beauvoir. During the late-19th and early-20th centuries the city had one of the most exciting and glamorous art scenes of any capital, with hangouts such as Les Deux Magots and Cafe de Flore boasting customer lists that read like the dream dinner-party lineup – or perhaps the dinner party from hell, depending on your point of view – with the names Verlaine, Rimbaud, Hemingway, Camus, Picasso and, later, Sartre all on the on the list.You don’t have to make much of an effort to bump up against literary characters in Paris: the evidence is everywhere, as is a host of independent bookshops, including a great selection offering English-translated literature (of which Shakespeare and Company, another legendary writers’ hangout, is the best known). It would be possible to devote an entire trip to Paris’s literary museums. The Maison de Balzac in Rue Raynouard is a favourite the garden has a fabulous view of the Eiffel Tower. The Maison de Victor Hugo is an essential stop on Place des Vosges. And the Musée de la Vie Romantique, on Rue Chaptal and closely linked to George Sand, is breathtakingly beautiful. I’m not sure how cheering it would be to visit Marcel Proust’s actual bedroom, where he spent the last few years of his life tending to his sensitive lungs, but it has been lovingly recreated in the Musée Carnavalet. If you’re on a short trip, the one must-see is the Père Lachaise cemetery, the resting place of Proust, the poet Apollinaire, the great playwright Molière and American author Gertrude Stein. It’s also a site of pilgrimage for those visiting the graves of Oscar Wilde, Édith Piaf, Frédéric Chopin, Maria Callas and Jim Morrison of the Doors (his followers gather with hip flasks and bottles of red wine to toast his memory). Make sure you use the entrance near Gambetta Métro, as then you can walk downhill rather than uphill as you explore.For a wander around Paris that really gives a flavour of its literary heritage, the Latin Quarter has got to be the place to start. It’s worth visiting (or staying at) L’Hotel in Saint-Germain-des-Prés, Oscar Wilde’s last home in Paris. He never paid his final bill, and it is still displayed in room 16, in which he lamented: “My wallpaper and I are fighting a duel to the death. One of us has got to go.” L’Hotel is one of the most beautifully preserved properties in the city, and has an amazingly atmospheric cocktail bar that opens on to a stunning courtyard. Close by is Cluny-La Sorbonne Métro station, and it’s around this area that lots of literary landmarks are clustered, including the Pantheon, which houses the tombs of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Victor Hugo, Émile Zola and Alexandre Dumas. Not far from the Pantheon is 74 Rue du Cardinal Lemoine, Hemingway’s address in Paris in 1922 and 1923. He used to drink at Café des Amateurs, now called Café Delmas. From here it’s a short walk to the Jardin du Luxembourg, the famous site of the meeting between Marius and Cosette in Hugo’s Les Misérables. The best shortcut to soaking up the literary flavour of Paris? A meal at Polidor, the restaurant in the sixth arrondissement favoured by André Gide, Jack Kerouac and Henry Miller. Diners sit at long, communal tables next to Polidor’s trademark mustard pots and salt cellars. If you’re alone, it’s the best place to be, with a pleasing audiobook to keep you company.The Hunchback of Notre-Dame by Victor Hugo, NaxosAlthough outshone in recent years by Les Misérables, largely thanks to a lavish Hollywood remake with Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway, The Hunchback of Notre-Dame is Hugo’s real masterpiece and his ode to Paris and its architecture. (He wrote the novel to showcase the cathedral of Notre-Dame.) Set in 1482 during the reign of Louis XI, the novel follows Quasimodo, a hunchback tasked with kidnapping the gypsy Esmeralda for his master, Archdeacon Claude Frollo. When the plan goes wrong, Esmeralda nonetheless shows Quasimodo a moment of human kindness that he will never forget.The Red and the Black by Stendhal, NaxosThis classic, narrated by audiobook legend Bill Homewood (a Shakespearean actor with a ridiculously mellifluous voice), is often overlooked. Published in 1830, it tells the story of Julien Sorel, a provincial young man determined to rise above his humble beginnings. He realises that unless he behaves in a ruthless and calculating way, there is no place for him in French society, especially not one ruled over by the Church. Known as one of the earliest psychological novels, Stendhal’s tour de force shows the deterioration of a man’s character as he grapples with hypocrisy. Madame Bovary by Gustave Flaubert, NaxosFlaubert insisted that the flighty young woman bored in her marriage and desperate to escape provincial life at the heart of what is commonly regarded as the great 19th-century French novel represented something bigger than herself. “Madame Bovary, c’est moi,” he said of his most famous character. Emma Bovary marries a rather tragic country doctor, Charles, and finds her life unbearably dull. She embarks on a series of romantic and consumerist escapades to attempt to alleviate her misery. Juliet Stevenson’s narration is Oscar-worthy and the pacing is superb: vivid, dramatic and occasionally spine-tingling.Les Liaisons Dangereuses by Choderlos de Laclos, AudibleWho doesn’t want to hear Dominic West as the lascivious and corrupting Vicomte de Valmont (the character played by John Malkovich in the film)? Choderlos de Laclos’s addictive epistolary novel was published in 1782 and caused a scandal at the time. It is a sharp critique of the morals and behaviour of the aristocracy. Two older former lovers, Vicomte de Valmont and the Marquise de Merteuil use two naive young women as pawns in their metaphorical emotional chess match. This two-hour audio version is taken from the Donmar production starring Elaine Cassidy and Janet McTeer. It’s unmissable.100 Greatest Poems: Paul Verlaine, Victor Hugo, Baudelaire, AstorgA fantastic three-and-a-half hour introduction to French poetry, featuring extracts from Victor Hugo’s Contemplations and Autumn Leaves, the lyrical work of Paul Verlaine and Flowers of Evil by Charles Baudelaire. Hugo was to become better known for his fiction, but the poetry he wrote in his late teens earned him a pension from Louis XVIII. Verlaine, a close friend of Rimbaud, had a messy life, but was loved by the French public and crowned “Prince of Poets” in 1894, while Baudelaire’s reputation for romantic gothic poetry is unparalleled a great selection of his classics are featured here.Moderato Cantabile by Marguerite Duras, Éditions ThélèmeNarrated beautifully (in French) by Pauline Huruguen, who specialises in reading modern French authors, this is a treat. Marguerite Duras’s best-known works are her novel, The Lover (which won the Prix Goncourt in 1984), and her screenplay for Hiroshima Mon Amour (nominated for an Oscar in 1961). Moderato Cantabile was her entry into French literary society, and sold more than half a million copies. An unusual and evocative novel, and one of the first examples of the sparing, suggestive style of the “nouveau roman”, it builds up a picture of the life of Anne Desbaresdes, whose cosy, middle-class existence falls apart when she witnesses a murder.Paris After the Liberation: 1944-1949 by Antony Beevor and Artemis Cooper, PenguinFor some historical background on Paris before the heady days of the Left Bank and the 1960s, turn to this fantastic study of French life, which details the chaos that followed the war up to 1949. This masterful history is brought to life by narrator Sean Barrett. It conjures up images of Paris from within living memory that are extraordinarily vivid. With liberation come joy and relief, but also a raft of recrimination and blame. The city is hungry and there are constant fuel shortages. Sobering and entertaining.Bonjour Tristesse by Françoise Sagan, des femmesIf you want to practise your French or just hear something extraordinarily beautiful while you are walking around Paris, listen to this incredible abridged audio version of Françoise Sagan’s 1954 novel. Bonjour Tristesse caused an overnight sensation when it was published, its author being only 18. Seventeen-year-old Cécile is spending the summer in the south of France and trying to figure out how to navigate life with her philandering father. When one of his friends arrives, the family’s fragile equilibrium is destroyed. Catherine Deneuve’s voice is sublime.Down and Out in Paris and London by George Orwell, CSA WordThis autobiographical work traces Orwell’s steps as he tramps around the two capitals. While working as a drudge in Paris kitchens, Orwell drifts into an underworld, where he documents how society regards the poor and miserable. Although he is a tourist in this situation (and doing it to prove a political point), this is a poignant and important work that has stood the test of time. You would hope the sanitary conditions of hotel life and restaurant food have moved on since the book’s publication in 1933, however. Me Talk Pretty One Day by David Sedaris, HachetteSedaris is one of US’s best satirists and a fantastic public speaker. This, then, is a double pleasure: his work, narrated by him. Some of the recordings here are live, others were done in the studio. The book contains a mix of stories about Sedaris’s life, but it mostly centres on his attempts to learn French and the ridicule he faces at the hands of the French, especially on the Paris Métro. A (sometimes reluctant) Francophile, he’s the ultimate snarky insider guide to Paris. He is also utterly brutal – and hilarious – on the behaviour of Americans in France.Viv Groskop is the author of the forthcoming Au Revoir, Tristesse: Lessons in Happiness from French Literature Your first audiobook is free with a 30-day trial from Audible – £7.99 a month after 30 days.

But just in case, a gentle reminder: as engrossing as these stories are, make sure you always pay full attention to the road)The complete Harry Potter by JK Rowling, read by Stephen Fry5 days 7 hrs 39 mins, equivalent to cycling from New York City to Miami BeachStephen Fry’s peerless narration of JK Rowling’s world-storming story about the boy magician, the Dark Lord, and the various mishaps, prophecies and extracurricular adventures at that very peculiar school Hogwarts, crowns this the king of the audiobook world. Perhaps your parents played it during long car journeys as a child, or you listened to it furtively in your bedroom way past your bedtime. Well, it’s even better as an adult. Sit back, relax and let Fry do the hard work for you.War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy, read by Frederick Davidson61 hrs 8 mins, equivalent to driving from Inverness to Tel AvivJames Norton caused a stir when he took over our screens in the BBC’s six-part adaptation of Tolstoy’s vast 19th-century novel about life among Russia’s aristocracy in the Napoleonic wars. Seeing as merely holding the book aloft is likely to do you an injury, it’s wise to find an audible alternative. Luckily, the late Frederick Davidson – the chain-smoking titan of the audiobook world, who narrated more than 700 titles – had a quick 61-hour flick-through to make your life easier.Sherlock Holmes: The Definitive Collection by Arthur Conan Doyle, read by Stephen Fry72 hrs 3 mins, equivalent to cycling from Monaco to MadridElementary, my dear Watson. Though, of course, Arthur Conan Doyle, Sherlock’s creator, never really wrote those words – it’s a misattribution. Or is it? Find out for yourself by listening to Stephen Fry reading the Victorian novels that birthed the most well-known detective in the English language (with apologies to Poirot and Marple).The Romanovs 1613-1918 by Simon Sebag Montefiore, read by Simon Russell Beale28 hrs 45 mins, equivalent to driving from London to TallinnRussia’s a big country, which means that any attempt to cover even a chunk of its history is going to take up a lot of book. Simon Sebag Montefiore’s look at the history of the Romanovs – the dynasty of tsars and tsarinas who ruled Russia and its empire from the 17th century up until the revolutions of 1917 and the death of Tsar Nicholas II in 1918 – was well reviewed, but is a heavy book to carry around and get through. Simon Russell Beale, the Bafta-winning actor who starred in films The Death of Stalin and Into the Woods, reads it all for you, which makes it much easier to sort your tsarinas from your Tatianas and your Alexanders from your, er, other Alexanders.Ulysses by James Joyce, read by Jim Norton and Marcella Riordan27 hrs 16 mins, equivalent to flying from London to WellingtonThis is probably one of those books you always thought you ought to manage if only you could summon the wherewithal. James Joyce’s bizarre, epic, rambling novel is a literary landmark. Saying you’ve read it is a sure-fire way to earn appreciative nods from any real-life writers at your friend’s dinner party – and they need never know that it was read to you in Jim Norton and Marcella Riordan’s dulcet tones.Bleak House by Charles Dickens, read by Miriam Margolyes43 hrs 12 mins, equivalent to flying from London to Los Angeles and back, twiceUnless you’ve got Miriam Margolyes (think Professor Sprout in Harry Potter and Mrs Mingott in The Age of Innocence) guiding you through Charles Dickens’s least-enticing-sounding novel, with its vast list of characters and occasionally impenetrable satire, the truly bleak part about ticking Bleak House off your should-really-read-that list will be all the paper cuts you get from turning those oh-so-many pages.James Bond: The Collection by various authors, read by various narrators12 days 22 hrs 58 mins, equivalent to driving from Tunis to Cape Town and backAlmost no other literary character has had such traction, such deep cultural penetration and such extensive remodelling as James Bond. Originally created by Ian Fleming and named after the author of a book on birds in the Caribbean, Bond has captured the imagination of writers, from Anthony Horowitz and John Gardner, to Kingsley Amis and Sebastian Faulks. This extraordinary, leviathan series – with readers including Bill Nighy, David Tennant, Rosamund Pike, Tom Hiddleston and Hugh Bonneville – encompasses almost all of them.Alexander Hamilton by Ron Chernow, read by Scott Brick35 hrs 58 mins, equivalent to cycling from Madrid to BarcelonaIt’s the musical that’s become a phenomenon: it’s been used to subtweet President Trump by the American Civil Liberties Union been poignantly performed in parts in front of Barack Obama in his last days of office and had its every line obsessed over by legions of fans across the world. But the book Hamilton was largely based on, Ron Chernow’s hefty, comprehensive biography of the US’s first treasury secretary, hasn’t had quite so much attention. It should – it’s a great listen, contains some insightful stuff and will help you get your head around the show that bit better.Your first audiobook is free with a 30-day trial from Audible – £7.99 a month after 30 days.

But too often this fandom lapses into misogyny and body shamingAhead of Britney Spears’ record-breaking show at Brighton Pride this year, Aaron Hussey noticed a fellow fan wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with a picture of Spears’ nervous breakdown: the 2007 incident when, head shaved, she attacked a photographer’s car with an umbrella. “I think he thought he was being funny,” Hussey says. “He wasn’t.”“Brightney Pride”, as it has affectionately been nicknamed, was one of the biggest events of the gay calendar – so big that 4,000 revellers were left stranded once the city’s heaving public transport system failed under the pressure. Surely only dedicated Spears “stans” – the most dedicated kind of fan, a portmanteau of “fan” and “stalker” taken from Eminem’s hit about a crazed follower – would have braved these conditions to glimpse their idol. So why the cruel taunt?Gay male culture has always coalesced around female pop stars, from Judy Garland to Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande. Academics and critics have puzzled over the source of this connection, their often misplaced theories ranging from the outlandish to the oedipal. But gay men and the women they worship are usually happy to bask in the mutual affection. This year, Spears was honoured with an award by the US’s Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (Glaad) for promoting equality. She responded by saying the gay community had shown her “unconditional love”.But “unconditional” is often precisely what this love is not. Scratch lightly at the surface and what flakes off is, yes, reciprocity and genuine affection, but also callous misogyny. One theory of the gay fan-a link is that of shared oppression – gay men and women are both ground under the wheel of hetero-patriarchy. Perhaps in that model, the Spears T-shirt could be read as a show of solidarity, a knowing acknowledgment of her pain and our understanding? But there was nothing knowing in the way another gay fan photoshopped an umbrella into his meet and greet photo with the unwitting star and later circulated it online. These actions have a distinct edge of mockery, the air of a joke that their subject is not in on.Dr Michael Bronski, a Harvard University professor and the author of books on queer history and gay culture says “There is a long history of gay male fan culture latching onto famous women and then turning on them. Queens would come to a Judy Garland concert and then scream at her when she was too drunk to finish it. The women have changed – it’s no longer Marlene Dietrich and Judy Garland. But the dynamic remains in western culture.”The love-hate dynamic of gay stan culture that Bronski describes is now largely mediated through social media. Heckling in smoky nightclubs has been replaced by “hate memes”, when stans circulate unflattering edited pictures or examples of a star’s least-becoming behaviour, while the cheering has morphed into a lexicon of superlatives and put-downs that may seem impenetrable to the uninitiated: “we stan” favoured female pop stars, they’re “iconic”, a “kween”, an “unproblematic fave”. “She outsold” describes both someone’s commercial successes and a general sense of their superiority. Anyone who fails to meet those standards? “Fat”, “flop”, “failure”.This online community relies on a dense matrix of references and neologisms informed by everything from drag culture to reality TV. Sami Baker is 21 and a self-professed gay stan – his favourites are Grande, Beyoncé and Charli XCX. He explains that the culture reaches further than many beyond the community might realise, citing the example of the recent avalanche of memes of reality star Gemma Collins. “They originated from gay stan Twitter. The language used within this culture is taken from the same place that Drag Race gets its lexicon,: namely the underground subculture where LGBT people compete in various drag and performance categories, documented in the film Paris Is Burning, and an inspiration for Madonna and Beyoncé.For many gay men, Baker and myself included, gay pop stan culture is the distillation of everything meaningful in life. That statement reeks of camp melodrama, but it’s true. To my teenage self, women like Lady Gaga were the only light in a world where my queerness left me feeling like an outsider. As I grew up, the process of connecting my love for them with a wider culture of fandom enhanced my realisation that I was not alone as a queer person. “As I learned more about pop culture and references, that’s when I found people with the same interest,” says Baker. “These same people became my friends, my support network.”It is hard to overestimate how meaningful the fan-a relationship is for gay men. What is so perplexing is why this pseudo-religious devotion has always been laced with spite. Earlier this year, pop singer Hayley Kiyoko criticised Rita Ora, Cardi B, Bebe Rexha, and Charli XCX for their single Girls, a song about bisexuality that she, as a lesbian, thought was appropriative. Within hours, stan Twitter had unearthed and circulated incriminating tweets by Kiyoko from nine years ago (when she was 18) in an attempt to “cancel” her – excluding a person entirely from online discourse, except as the target of hate memes – for daring to critique a song they liked.For Adam Byrne, a 23-year-old gay stan, this was a prime example of gay misogyny: “They didn’t care what she had to say. They just wanted to silence her”.Baker says: “I’ve seen stan Twitter make jokes about the Manchester attacks, Demi Lovato’s recent overdose, Beyoncé’s skin tone, Noah Cyrus’s appearance.”Much has been written about the “queer art of failure” – how queer people are always viewed as failures by heteronormative society, and thus must make a success of their own non-conformity. Perhaps, in this context, it’s unsurprising that gay men seem to revel in the perceived setbacks and shortcomings of their stanned subjects. But the sympathy one might expect to accompany this identification seems absent. The behaviour is less like a playful poke in the ribs, and more like a slap in the face.Just last week, singer Marina Diamandis – an idol of the gay community – tweeted back to a fan who is part of the gay stan community after he sent her an abusive tweet. “There is a fan culture of degrading people online that I’m really not into. I haven’t been on social media a lot the past 3 months because I suffer from depression and the negative comments really affect me,” Diamandis posted. “Marina omg please don’t take it the wrong way I’m a stan and this was just intended as a harmless joke,” the fan protested. As Diamandis herself pointed out, stan culture can fail to grant humanity to the subjects of their worship.Even when gay men aren’t raining outright abuse on these women, their praise can sometimes reveal different forms of misogyny. One recent trend is to laud women by hailing them as “skinny” or a “skinny legend” – a trope that took off with a meme about Mariah Carey. Though it is used figuratively to imply flawlessness, it is revealing that a word historically used to police female physicality has naturally evolved in the gay male vernacular. Can it be anything other than chauvinist body-shaming?Indeed, “skinniness” is just one of many hyper-feminine traits that gay men seem to prize in our stanned women. Helen Moynihan, 23, is a self-identifying queer woman who says the stanning of Ariana Grande exemplifies precisely what is problematic about gay male idolatry. “Often I think gay men only see beauty in hyper-feminine, not butch, women,” she says. “It made me laugh when Grande was called a queer icon because she is the least queer person to me: someone who’s always trying to escape hyper-femininity.”Grande’s blinding highlighter, swinging ponytail and heels are ubiquitous hallmarks of the gay stan hall of fame. Buzzcuts and Doc Martens are few and far between. It’s conditional love again – do we only stan the “right” type of women? Other forms of gay culture are similarly plagued by this insidious heteronormativity – men on dating apps like Grindr use refrains like “masc4masc” to praise masculinity and shun femininity in other men.It’s important to remember that gay male culture exists at the confluence of many social currents, including wider male misogyny and societal homophobia. It is easy to apportion blame to gay men who are merely trying to find escapism and belonging, and to scapegoat behaviour that is universal. “In our culture of binary, heterosexual dysfunction, men hate women,” says Bronski. “It just so happens that some of them are gay.”This is an important qualifier. Stanning itself is not exclusively homosexual territory – Eminem, the originator of “stan”, is hardly a queer icon. Dr Lynn Zubernis is a professor at West Chester University in Pennsylvania and an expert in fandom. She says the bullying behaviours found in gay stan culture are common to all fandoms.“Because the object of a fan’s adoration becomes very important to the fan’s happiness, when there is some sort of disappointment, that brings a strong – and sometimes problematic – response. That is the dynamic behind the ‘mood swings’ you see in fandom, where fans love something one day and turn on it the next. It’s not about misogyny. It cuts across gender, sexuality, type of fandom, even time. Sports fans sometimes turn on star players in the same way. I don’t think it’s a male-female thing or a gay-straight thing. I think it’s a human thing.”However, not all fandoms operate with the same power dynamics. In football, the vitriol Dr Zubernis uses for comparison takes on a new dimension when it intersects with racism. In gay stan culture, gender does not just occasionally intersect with online hatred – it defines the landscape. The abuse and objectification of these women is distinctly gendered – any man, gay or straight, tweeting “fat!” at a woman is unarguably misogynistic.Gay men and pop’s women alike benefit from the mutuality of their “special relationship”. Spears is unlikely to have noticed one nasty T-shirt through the love heaped on her that day. But with gay male misogyny being discussed more widely than ever, in terms of our nightlife, queer spaces, and social movements, what does it say when this relationship is often so heartless? What kind of permissiveness are we helping to cultivate around misogyny? Deep down, do we really know what it means to love these women?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0dd1a30ff3aef73033566d5858dad3739b26f96c/0_163_4134_2481/master/4134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ada34e388e2791d81202a088d50c1863","title":"dominic raab reduced to the lowest common denominator of stupidity","story":"The Brexit secretary displays the confidence of a man who has forgotten just how sidelined and out of his depth he really isThe Commons got back to business after the summer recess with a deadening sense of deja vu. The House broke up in July with the Brexit secretary trying to convince himself as much as anyone else that the UK was genuinely getting somewhere in the EU negotiations, and it returned to find him doing much the same thing.Dominic Raab was ostensibly in the House to give a statement updating MPs on the progress of his recent talks with Michel Barnier but, as there hadn’t been any, he chose instead to ad lib. The break has been kind to the Brexit secretary. In July, he looked tense and sweaty and would get tetchy if anyone dared contradict him, but now he appeared more urbane and confident at the dispatch box.Unfortunately for him, it was the confidence of a man who had forgotten just how sidelined and out of his depth he really was.Everything was going really well, Raab declared breathlessly. Apart from the bits that were going extremely badly. The talks had been injected with a new pace and intensity – they now ate sandwiches at the negotiating table rather than taking a two-hour break for lunch – and agreement had been reached in some key areas. The EU and the UK had settled on who would do the photocopying (they would take it in turns) and only semi-skimmed milk would be used for the coffee.There were still a few problems, mind. Northern Ireland was still proving a bit tricky but he was sure it would get resolved one way or another without war breaking out. There again, maybe not. On the bright side, a no-deal wouldn’t be as bad as all that. We would be keeping a six-week stockpile of medicines, so there was a fair chance that no one would die unnecessarily immediately. And if everyone put aside a few cans of baked beans, then no one should starve while the government tried to come up with a better plan.“There are some risks to a no-deal scenario,” Raab generously conceded. But, one way or another, the UK would be ready for Brexit next March. His voice rather tailed off as he added that last bit, as he realised the fundamental absurdity of what he was saying. The UK is going to be ready for nothing. The only Brexit we are going to get is the one the government manages to smuggle past both the EU and parliament. And right now it doesn’t have a clue what that might be.Keir Starmer sighed. The shadow Brexit secretary had hoped that Raab might prove to be a bit brighter than the dim David Davis, but there was clearly something about the nature of the job that reduced every incumbent to the lowest common denominator of stupidity. Still, Starmer was willing to do his job even if Raab wasn’t up to doing his, so he read out the same checklist of questions that he always asked on these occasions. Questions he knew weren’t going to be answered.Was Raab aware that time was running out to get a deal? In July he had said he would have the outline of a deal by October. Now he was suggesting it would come in November at the earliest. When was he going to get round to dealing with Northern Ireland? And was he aware that saying a no-deal wouldn’t be the end of the world wasn’t the most inspiring rhetoric? The Brexit secretary bristled. He doesn’t like having his obvious shortcomings pointed out so forensically. He was doing better than Labour would have, he snapped. Hard to refute, but equally hard to believe.There was one upside for Raab. As everyone knows that it is now the prime minister who is calling the shots and the Brexit secretary has less authority than the four pot plants, none of the big-name Tories such as Boris Johnson, Iain Duncan Smith, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Ken Clarke and Anna Soubry, bothered to turn up to give him a hard time. The worst of the friendly fire was the deranged Owen Paterson insisting that Northern Ireland could easily be sorted out with technology that hadn’t been invented yet. Someone call a doctor.So it was left to Labour’s Hilary Benn, Yvette Cooper and Chuka Umunna to deliver a few home truths. The Chequers deal was dead in the water. Barnier said so. The Tory right said so. And Labour said so. So wouldn’t the government be better off coming up with a new plan and working out what it was going to do if it couldn’t get any deal through parliament. “Ssssh,” whispered Raab. This was the kind of careless talk that could cost lives if the EU got wind of it. At this point some MPs began to wonder if Raab actually had been born yesterday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/284aa5e34f96f275cf2ece649fdf85920e6f3686/0_108_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c81635f812b60fdd1b657ebf0bb831be","title":"union call for brexit vote adds pressure on corbyn to follow suit","story":"GMB general secretary Tim Roache says UK public has a right to vote on final dealOne of Britain’s biggest unions has called for a vote on the final Brexit deal in a move that will increase pressure upon Jeremy Corbyn to adopt a similar line.Tim Roache, the general secretary of GMB, said the British public had a right to a public vote upon a final deal following consultation with members across the UK.GMB sources said this could be in the form of either a general election or a second referendum on the final deal if there was no election forthcoming.The union, which has 620,000 members, backed remaining in the EU, although it admitted its members were ided.Roache said in a message to members: “GMB respects the result of the referendum, but how we leave the EU is as important as the decision to leave in the first place. That’s why today, GMB is calling for a public vote on the final deal.“As trade unionists, when we negotiate a pay deal with an employer, we go back to our members and ask them if they’re happy with it. Whether they want to accept or reject it.“That’s what people deserve now, because the promises that were made during the referendum campaign are simply not the reality we are facing,” he said.Brexit is likely to be a contentious issue when Labour members gather for their party conference in Liverpool later this month. Campaigners say dozens of local parties have passed motions urging the leadership to back a vote on the final deal.The GMB is one of the three big unions – alongside Unison and Unite – that exercise the greatest influence over Labour, in part because of its funding to the party. It is the first to call for a referendum this explicitly.The issue will also be debated by the union movement in Manchester next week at the TUC conference. The Royal College of Nursing, Community and the transport workers’ union the TSSA also support a second referendum.Unite, whose general secretary, Len McCluskey, is a strong backer of the Labour leadership, passed a motion at its policy conference in July supporting the possibility of a popular vote on Brexit.Roache said GMB members in manufacturing, ports, chemicals, energy, retail and public services were facing uncertainty and a government more preoccupied with internal isions than working people’s livelihoods.“People voted for change – they voted to take back control. They did not vote for economic chaos or to put jobs and hard won rights on the line,” he said.“The government need to know they have to come back and face the music – they can’t sell working people down the river. That’s why GMB supports your right to decide what sort of Brexit is the right Brexit.”Theresa May on Sunday ruled out calls for a second referendum. As negotiations between the government and the EU27 on an exit deal enter their final phase, the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, has insisted the option of a referendum must be kept on the table if the deal is rejected by MPs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29f6d953864af0ed11ccd7f829fafef65376e741/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9d3900d5f9f519212f3f7c504593b0a","title":"the vagina is self cleaning so why does the feminine hygiene industry exist","story":"From talcum powder to jade eggs and douches, an industry has grown up to sell products – some of which are harmful – that play on women’s fears about being dirty or smellyWhich of the following should go nowhere near your vagina: a penis, a finger, a tampon or talcum powder? According to a jury in Missouri in July, it is the talc: the court found in favour of 22 women who claimed their ovarian cancer had been caused by their use of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson baby talc, because it contained asbestos. The women were awarded $4.14bn in punitive damages.This is not the first time a court case has found in favour of a woman claiming talc is carcinogenic: a California court did so last year, although the decision, also against J\u0026ampJ, was overturned on appeal and a new trial granted. According to a spokesperson, J\u0026ampJ “remains confident that its products do not contain asbestos and do not cause ovarian cancer and intends to pursue all available appellate remedies”.Talc consists mostly of the mineral silica. However, because silica and asbestos are often mined near each other, talc could be contaminated with asbestos. The claimants’ lawyers in the Missouri case presented evidence that microscopic asbestos fibres had been found in many of the women’s ovarian tissues. “J\u0026ampJ sells the same powders in a marvellously safe corn starch variety,” said Mark Lanier, the lead lawyer, after the verdict. “If J\u0026ampJ insists on continuing to sell talc, they should mark it with a serious warning.” Six of the 22 women are already dead.Deathly baby powder sounds like something Q would make for 007, but the idea that talc could be linked to cancer has been percolating for decades, although conclusions are still debated vigorously. Some studies have found a slightly increased risk others have not. An NHS analysis in 2016 said it was “plausible that talc could work its way up into the upper genital tract and have some type of biological impact” Ovacome, a charity that works to reduce ovarian cancer, does not believe a link has been proved. It says: “We still do not know what really causes ovarian cancer. But it is likely to be a combination of many different inherited and environmental factors, rather than one cause such as talc.”So, while assertions and evidence continue to be thrown around, here is another question: why is any woman putting talc inside her vagina or on her vulva? (The vagina is a tube of muscle that joins the cervix and the vaginal opening the vulva is the exterior genitalia.)The vagina is an amazing organ. It is lined with a mucous membrane that protects against infection (necessary in any part of the body that opens to the outside world), as well as a clever, complex mix of bacteria – also known as vaginal flora – that does the same thing (only the bowel has more bacteria than the vagina). Together, they keep the vagina healthy. It is self-cleaning, too, keeping itself safe and hygienic with secretions. (One day, I will get used to gynaecologists referring to my vagina as “a self-cleaning oven”.)All women have a DIY vagina-vulva-wash of mucus, which can vary in appearance and volume throughout the menstrual cycle. It is mostly highly effective, except in the case of infection, including STIs, which can be signalled by a change in colour, thickness or odour. (Odour can become slightly muskier due to exercise or sex if anything is noticeably different, or you itch, get a medical professional to check it.) But you would not know about our natural powerwash from the size and value of the industry that has grown up to tell women we smell.Of course, we all like to feel fresh and clean, particularly when we are bleeding. But for decades what is called the “feminine hygiene” industry has worked hard to increase our fears that we are not. Seventy years ago, women were being sold Kotex products that would make them feel “tangy”. Nothing has changed. Show me a sanitary pad or a tampon campaign that does not use the word “fresh” and I will swallow a bottle of vinegar douche. For every mention of “fresh”, look for the fear at which it is aiming: fear that we smell of period blood or are leaking fear that we smell in general fear that our sexual partners will mock or reject us because of what our vaginas and vulvas look or smell like. The jingle for baby talc was “a sprinkle a day keeps the odour away”. There is a reason that “you smell” is one of the most powerful playground taunts: it is the accusation we fear most and the hardest to protest. We all fear fishy.To ensure cleanliness, the vulva needs nothing fancier than water, mild soap and a gentle pat dry (do not rub). The vagina does not need vajazzle, internal glitter bombs or leech therapy, a treatment touted as detoxifying by some eastern European beauty clinics (it is not). Jade eggs, which you insert in the vagina, are also a terrible idea, according to the gynaecologist Jen Gunter: “Jade is porous, which could allow bacteria to get inside and so the egg could act like a fomite … It could be a risk factor for bacterial vaginosis or even the potentially deadly toxic shock syndrome.” The mucous membrane that lines the vagina is also very porous. This makes the vagina an efficient route for absorbing medication and pathogens. Vaginal steaming – popularised by Gwyneth Paltrow, who supposedly sits herself over steaming herbal potions to improve her vulval and vaginal health – is not good for your vaginal wellbeing.The outlandish stuff is one thing. But even a simple solution of vinegar and water sprayed up the vagina is a bad idea. Douching, as this is called, is done by one in five American women aged 15 to 44. Commercial douches can contain antiseptics, as well as potentially hazardous chemicals such as parabens, along with fragrances that are unknown: because these are cosmetic products, the US’s Food and Drug Administration requires only that manufacturers do not include anything “deleterious” in their products and trusts manufacturers to comply – it does not require any testing of products before they are launched. In short, products you are putting in close quarters with a highly porous part of your body are less stringently regulated than cough sweets. In the UK, they are regulated as general products, not medical devices it is up to the manufacturer and seller to make them safe.Anything introduced to the vagina risks upsetting the careful balance of bacteria, particularly if a woman is buying products because she thinks something is wrong. Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh found that the more women douched, the greater their risk of getting bacterial vaginosis, a mild infection that can cause itching and discharge (and therefore lead women to douche even more). If the women surveyed douched once a week, their risk doubled.Douching has been linked to greater rates of bacterial vaginosis, premature births and cervical cancer. One study of 40,000 women in Puerto Rico and the US found douching doubled the risk of ovarian cancer. There were caveats, as an NHS article pointed out: the women, who did not have cancer, were followed over six and a half years to see whether they developed cancer and whether they douched. Forty women who reported douching their vaginas developed cancer. The researchers concluded a link the NHS was more circumspect. Perhaps women with poor vaginal health are more likely to douche. The researchers did not enquire about risk factors such as a family history of ovarian cancer or whether the woman smoked.“It’s a myth that the vagina needs extensive cleaning with perfumed soaps or feminine hygiene products,” says Vanessa Mackay, a spokeswoman for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. “It’s a good idea to avoid perfumed soaps, gels and antiseptics, as these can affect the healthy balance of bacteria and pH levels in the vagina and cause irritation. Women are advised to use plain, unperfumed soaps to wash the area around the vagina (the vulva) – not inside it – gently every day. During a woman’s period, washing more than once a day may be helpful.”I wonder if such statements would be necessary if “vulva” were as conversational as “sex”. If we discussed our fears about vulvas and vaginas – conversationally, with GPs or health professionals and with our partners – as easily as we seek help for a headache, the aisles of feminine washes, sprays, douches and wet wipes, all those sticking plasters on our fears and embarrassment, would vanish. “If nature had intended the vagina to smell like roses or lavender, it would have made the vagina smell like roses or lavender,” said Ronnie Lamont, an RCOG spokesman, in an interview for the NHS website. If we were more outspoken about genital matters, women’s health and confidence would be vastly improved, even if we might smell less fragrant.

That influence was given mainstream corporate backing on Monday when Nike confirmed that Kaepernick would be the face of a new ad campaign for the 30th anniversary of their ‘Just Do It’ slogan.The big reveal ahead of the NFL’s regular-season opener on Thursday night came as more of a surprise than it should have, given the lengthy track record of the sports apparel company, which has been out in front of social trends for decades. Nike put money behind prominent African American coaches like Georgetown’s John Thompson before doing so was popular. They made a black teenager the face of their company when Tiger Woods turned professional with the provocative Hello World campaign that sparked controversy (and, lest we forget, even boycotts) by leaning into America’s thorny racist past.They made Spike Lee’s Mars Blackmon character the face of an Air Jordan campaign, throwing their support behind a 30-year-old black filmmaker who challenged America to wake up with desperate urgency, showing us the right thing isn’t always the easy thing. Now three decades on, they’ve aligned themselves with a 30-year-old black quarterback who’s done the same thing with his silent protest against police violence, one that’s ushered in an era of athlete activism unprecedented since the 1960s.The NFL won’t die because of Colin Kaepernick – the concussion epidemic, maybe, but that’s a different issue – but it has bungled its handling of the issues he has raised. The NFL may have the smartest marketing people in the business, but the cabal of billionaire owners continue to demonstrate they’re so out of touch it’s embarrassing. How quickly could they have avoided their ongoing headache if they’d pulled Kaepernick aside from the beginning, made a good-faith effort to understand the issues of police brutality and pledged, say, to match every donation made by a player to social justice causes? He succeeded by starting a conversation, but now the free-agent quarterback is more powerful than ever. Last week Kaepernick won a legal victory in his grievance against the NFL, in which he alleges the owners have conspired to keep him off the field because of his protests, when an arbitrator denied the league’s request to throw out the case. Proving collusion by the league’s 32 owners will not be easy due to the high legal standard of the claim, but the decision by one of the league’s top partners to make Kaepernick the face of a prominent campaign won’t do much to back up the argument that he is radioactive for business. Two years after Kaepernick, following a dialogue with a military veteran, first knelt during the Star-Spangled Banner, American news organizations continue to a mischaracterize the movement he launched as “anthem protests”. But that’s an intellectually dishonest sleight of hand intended to ert the conversation from state violence, a misdirection seized on time and again by America’s president. They have actively framed Kaepernick’s actions as inconsistent with patriotism when in fact patriotism is at the movement’s very essence. It’s also codified in the document comprising America’s DNA: the belief in a more perfect union. That we can always do better. That without struggle there is no progress. That the job is never done. Which makes Monday’s announcement a triumph for clarity over obfuscation, for progress over regression. For many, what it means to be an American is less and less some dude riding a tractor and more Kaepernick and Serena and LeBron. That’s what the people burning their shoes on Tuesday are upset about. For all the bluster about respecting the flag, they have never been more nakedly exposed: it’s quite obviously not about respecting anything at all.

This has been an outstanding season for him, with victories in the La Flèche Wallonne and San Sebastián Classics as well as his brace of stage wins and king of the mountains jersey at the Tour, and it could well be about to get even better.After the drag up to the Clifton Suspension Bridge, the slightly uphill sprint was contested by a group whittled back to 32, with Caleb Ewan nominally the fastest, but on this occasion the late hills deadened the speed in the Australian’s legs. Alaphilippe enjoyed a fine lead-out from his teammate Bob Jungels, which appeared to have rivals such as Bevin gasping, although the 19-year-old Londoner Ethan Hayter punched well above his weight to claim fourth.Wednesday sees a long, contorted loop from Nuneaton into the Cotswolds and back to Royal Leamington Spa, which will favour Ewan, the Newport winner André Greipel and Fernando Gaviria, both of whom went on the attack en route to Bristol the smart money will be on them saving their energy for what should be a certain sprint finish."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7f3e221bbc610ef4ef491b81bd91201d4d0a8a0/0_304_4711_2827/master/4711.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb09c432475f0aadb59c2c2e62404d37","title":"thomas bjorn choose sergio garcia ryder cup wild card","story":"• García’s 2018 form has been poor but he has experience• Bjørn to announce his four wild cards on WednesdayThomas Bjørn is set to side with experience when naming his captain’s picks for the European Ryder Cup team on Wednesday. Henrik Stenson, Paul Casey, Ian Poulter and Sergio García have emerged as the favoured quartet to join Bjørn’s eight automatic qualifiers as Europe look to reclaim the trophy in France at the end of September.While the selection of Stenson, Casey and Poulter will raise few eyebrows, García’s inclusion, if confirmed, will trigger debate. The Spaniard found himself embroiled in a late battle with his compatriot, Rafael Cabrera-Bello, and the in-form Englishman Matt Wallace to reach the European team. Both will have cause to be upset if, as expected, García gets the nod.Poulter, who has emerged as something of a Ryder Cup icon for Europe, was always part of the equation amid a terrific career renaissance. Stenson has struggled with an elbow injury this summer but, at 42 and as a former Open champion, is a valuable part of the team dynamic. Casey’s return to the European Tour fold after making himself unavailable for the last Ryder Cup meant Bjørn would struggle to omit the matchplay specialist.García has been woefully out of sorts, in essence since ending his wait for a major championship at the Masters last year. The 38-year-old, who has missed the cut in his last five major appearances, has slipped to 30th in the world rankings. He was not one of the 125 players exempt for the PGA Tour’s end of series FedEx Cup play-offs.Yet influential in Bjørn’s thought process has been the appearance of five rookies in those who earned their spots automatically. García has played in eight Ryder Cups – first as a teenager – amassing 22.5 points, making him one of the most successful European players in history. He also finished in the top 10 at this year’s France Open, played on the Ryder Cup course on the outskirts of Versailles. In addition he is viewed as a player compatible with multiple partners.Cabrera-Bello, a spot ahead of García in the world rankings and part of the Europe team who lost to the United States at Hazeltine two years ago, finished in a share of seventh at the PGA Tour’s Dell Technologies Championship on Monday. The 34-year-old posted four rounds of under 70.It is thought Bjørn may have taken a dim view of Cabrera-Bello’s desire to compete in the United States rather than at the last counting event for the European team, the Made in Denmark event. That being the case, it is notable García, who was not eligible for the PGA Tour competition, did not travel to Europe either. Suspicion will automatically emerge García was sure of a pick, regardless of the form of others.Wallace won a four-man play-off in Denmark for his second European Tour success in three months. Working against Wallace, though, was always the qualification of so many debutants: Tommy Fleetwood, Jon Rahm, Alex Norén, Thorbjørn Olesen and Tyrrell Hatton. Bjørn will lead Europe against a United States side whose strong reputation firmly goes before them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95b27a45ac8ec4e5a3c1fd25ff5f129d957bf876/0_252_3779_2267/master/3779.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=874f7b3baa84e1602dc1cd41b4aace0f","title":"us open 2018 day nine stephens v sevastova del potro v isner and more live","story":"Third set: Isner* 7-6, 3-6, 6-5 Del Potro A tougher game this for Isner, but at 30-30 Del Potro misreads a serve, and at 40-30 he can hardly reach one, and that’ll do.Third set: Isner 7-6, 3-6, 5-5 Del Potro* A third successive game in which the returner has failed to win a point or seriously threaten to (though Isner had a forehand that would have won him a point had it not dropped a couple of inches long).Third set: Isner* 7-6, 3-6, 5-4 Del Potro That’s a mercifully brief game for Isner, who holds to love. Del Potro is excellent, but this match has for the time being become the story of his opponent’s battle against the conditions and his own body.Third set: Isner 7-6, 3-6, 4-4 Del Potro* Isner starts the game with a fresh shirt and a fresh impetus, but having taken a measure of charge of the opening point he dumps the ball into the net and it’s downhill from there. Del Potro holds to love.Third set: Isner* 7-6, 3-6, 4-3 Del Potro It’s hard to see Isner winning in five sets here, or even finishing them. Del Potro curls a forehand past him for 30-30, at which Isner misses his first serve but then produces a killer second effort. The state of Isner’s shirt here. It is drenched. Dripping. Del Potro forces a mistake, and then produces a return that puts him in charge of the point and he doesn’t let go. Break point. Isner saves it, backhands his way to advantage, and then hits a second serve that kicks so high that Del Potro just can’t reach it.Third set: Isner 7-6, 3-6, 3-3 Del Potro* Hello again! Del Potro serves his first double fault of the match, and then straight away the second, turning a comfy 30-0 to a nervy 30-30. A service winner brings game point, and though Isner holds it off Del Potro wins the next two points. All the talk is of the conditions: humans just aren’t supposed to be doing this kind of thing in this kind of heat and humidity. They are battling not only each other but nature, and logic.Third set: Isner* 7-6, 3-6, 3-2 Del Potro After a nervy first point, Isner roars back with a couple of fantastic in-out forehands. The pace that both these players are generating is astonishing. A drop shot and an ace for Isner closes out the game and has Del Potro looking a little flat. Both are drenched in sweat. Why don’t tennis players wear gloves? Look at the state of Del Potro’s hands here.And with that, I’ll hand back to Simon. Cheers! Third set: Isner* 7-6, 3-6, 2-2 Del Potro At 15-15, Del Potro is once again dominating the rally, but a misjudgement means Isner’s forehand finds the baseline, then a wayward Del Potro forehand goes long. Two break points for Isner, his first of the match! With Del Potro consistently missing his first serve, Isner squanders the first into the net with a backhand, then can’t recover from another bomb serve out wide. Deuce, but the Argentinian has found his rhythm, and holds serve after twice coming to the net. Third set: Isner 7-6, 3-6, 2-1 Del Potro* Isner responds in kind. The rallies last a little longer with on the American’s serve, but it’s the same effect. An easy hold – Isner definitely seems to have perked up since the second set, where he suddenly looked very flat. If this does go to a fifth set, will likely be a test of endurance as much anything else. Third set: Isner* 7-6, 3-6, 1-1 Del Potro The Argentinian holds to love. Isner simply can’t return Del Potro’s serve with any conviction, and from there Del Potro’s forehand pummels the American to submission. Third set: Isner 7-6, 3-6, 1-0 Del Potro* Despite the cutest of drop shots, Isner finds himself break point down after a couple of lazy backhands into the net. But he finds the line with a crushing forehand to get to deuce and aces the next point before closing it out with another looping serve out wide. Good scrambling from Isner there, although he’s yet to even get one break point on Del Potro’s serve. Nearly eight minutes since set point, and the players are back on court. Del Potro re-emerges visibly perturbed with an official, although it’s not clear why. Perhaps Isner snuck back to the locker room mid-match? Novak Djokovic did that yesterday when he was struggling with the heat. While we wait for the players to re-emerge from their air-conditioned dressing rooms, I have a question: if you could be a line judge for this match (down the T), would you be? You have to balance all the pressure, scrutiny and jeopardy of being hit on the nose by a 140mph howitzer by the fact that you have the best seat in the house. I would, but only because it appeals to my narcissism. Answers to michael.butler@the or @michaelbutler18, if you will. Hello world, Michael Butler here, just jumping in for a short while as Simon gets a break. Just the one unforced error for Del Potro in that last set, which is remarkable considering how much he is going for his shots: the average (AVERAGE) mph of his forehand is a frankly ridiculous 81mph. Second set: Isner 7-6, 3-6 Del Potro* Del Potro holds to love, and takes the second set. Both players head off the court to change their clothesrecharge their spirit.Second set: Isner* 7-6, 3-5 Del Potro Isner holds to 30. He does look knackered, but he could just be saving himself for set three. Unless, that is, he can conjure a break now …Second set: Isner* 7-6, 2-4 Del Potro Given the temperatures, and the amount of time he’s already spent on court in this tournament – plus his seniority – Isner seems less likely to prevail in a lengthy match. Perhaps the fatigue is already creeping up on him. He holds here, to 30, winning the game with his 14th ace of the match.Second set: Isner 7-6, 1-4 Del Potro* Del Potro holds to love, and appears well on his way to levelling the match.Second set: Isner* 7-6, 1-3 Del Potro Isner has a massive lead in unforced errors – 20-5 over the match, 8-1 this set – and a couple of them land him in trouble at 0-30. There’s no magic ace to rescue him this time, and instead Del Potro’s excellent return presents him with three set points. Isner saves one with a fine forehand down the line, but another unforced error and we have a break of serve!Second set: Isner 7-6, 1-2 Del Potro* Del Potro holds to 15 again, clipping another unreturnable forehand off his ankles in the process. After the game he has an argument with the umpire and then the referee over his ability to change his shorts, which are irritating him somehow. He isn’t allowed to do so, but will presumably sneak just off court to do so at the next changeover.Second set: Isner* 7-6, 1-1 Del Potro At 15-15 Isner has an easy forehand from midcourt, but he hits it straight to Del Potro, and loses the point. He deals with the micro-crisis in the most obvious way – by hitting a vicious ace out wide. Two overhit backhands later he’s got another one on his hands, a break point now, and he conjures an identical solution. This must be spectacularly disheartening for an opponent, and Isner then concludes the game with an ace down the middle, just to keep his opponent on his toes.Second set: Isner 7-6, 0-1 Del Potro* One fine winner from Isner, but Del Potro’s always in control and holds to 15. Here’s Kevin Mitchell on Sloane Stephens’ defeat:First set: Isner 7-6 Del Potro At 1-0 Isner hits two fine forehands to work a fine position in the rally, but then he sends a backhand wide to waste the chance. So instead we have to wait until the seventh point for a mini-break, as Isner repeatedly pokes Del Potro’s backhand and the Argentinian eventually sends one wide. And that’s what does it: an ace and an unreturnable serve yields three set points. Del Potro saves the first two on his own serve, but then Isner serves one, and he slams it down the middle for an ace. It’s not even close to the T, and Del Potro still can’t get anywhere near it. First set: Isner 6-6 Del Potro* Thrown by the depth of an Isner backhand, Del Potro bottom-edges the ball into the ground for 40-30. Isner then goes for a risky down-the-line backhand, misses, and the first set will – get this – be decided by a tie break!First set: Isner* 6-5 Del Potro A break point! An actual break point! At 30-40 Isner is half an inch away from an ace, but a kick serve and wrongfooting, cross-court forehand saves the day anyway, and then a forehand drop-shot helps him take the game.First set: Isner 5-5 Del Potro* At 0-15 and second serve, there’s a chink of light for Isner. But Del Potro puts some kick on his delivery, and Isner has no answer, to that or for the remainder of the game.First set: Isner* 5-4 Del Potro Isner hits a backhand wide and Del Potro leads 0-15, the closest we’ve come to a break of serve since the opening game of the match. Then, after a second foot fault call of the match against Isner, Del Potro hits an excellent backhand winner. 15-30. A couple of aces later, Isner’s sitting down, game comfortably held.First set: Isner 4-4 Del Potro* Del Potro sends a forehand into the tape at the top of the net. This is very much the highlight of the game for Isner, who loses it to 15.First set: Isner* 4-3 Del Potro What a shot! The shot of the match so far, and predictably it’s a Del Potro forehand. Pushed out wide by a fine forehand from Isner he slams it down the line at 102mph. Then the American nets a forehand and it’s 30-30! Isner takes the next two points and the game.First set: Isner 3-3 Del Potro* A break! Kind of! Isner wins a point against serve with a backhand of impeccable depth. Del Potro holds to 15, clipping a lovely forehand off his ankles to win the game.First set: Isner* 3-2 Del Potro There’s another fantastic point-winning volley from Isner as a third successive game goes by without anyone winning so much as a point against serve.First set: Isner 2-2 Del Potro* Del Potro also holds to love, and proves he doesn’t always need a big serve by hitting a powder-puff one to start the final point, eventually won by a succession of superlative, powerful forehands.First set: Isner* 2-1 Del Potro Isner holds to love, ending the game with – yes – an ace."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29978a802465e997a4e607491fafc51dbdb47e07/0_1183_3524_2114/master/3524.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cd571a865b7e0df52cd8c3fcd443a5b","title":"shakespeare by angus mcbean in pictures rsc","story":"Featuring Christopher Plummer as Richard III, Vivien Leigh as Viola and Charles Laughton as Bottom, Shakespeare by McBean is a volume of the photographer’s shots at the RSC between 1945 and 1962 "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c6827e51bbb6f1b81d40d3fa7fecfbea297e7de/0_285_4066_2440/master/4066.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2e402eb6a471e4a77454114d3a0baee","title":"amazon becomes worlds second 1tn company","story":"Amazon has become the second company to be valued by Wall Street at $1tn, a matter of weeks after Apple reached the milestone first.On Tuesday, a rise in the share price of Amazon, which is listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange in the US, briefly took it above the trillion-dollar watermark for the first time. Amazon ended the day valued at $995bn, just short of its new record.Crossing the $1tn threshold marks the latest chapter in an astonishing story of growth for the company, founded by businessman Jeff Bezos in Seattle in 1994.Less than 25 years later, Amazon has garnered a major presence in everything from retail, to groceries, to video streaming, helping it rack up revenues of $178bn (£139bn) last year.Bezos has become the world’s richest man in the process, with a net worth estimated at more than $167bn on Tuesday, according to Forbes.Amazon went public at $18 a share in 1997 – on Tuesday those shares hit $2,050, pushing the value of the whole company over $1tn.But with rapid growth has come fierce criticism over its attitude to tax and workers’ rights.The company that started life selling books and CDs online has morphed into a behemoth that now makes much of its money from hosting websites such as Airbnb, Netflix and Unilever. Amazon Web Services is currently the frontrunner for a $10bn contract to provide cloud computing for the US Department of Defense.Alongside cloud services, Amazon has been growing its own content business, developing TV shows and movies. Last year it bought Whole Foods, the grocery chain, for $13bn as Bezos moved to expand Amazon’s food offering. The company now appears to have targeted the healthcare market as its next big opportunity.Amazon’s size – and Bezos’s fortune – have attracted the ire of Donald Trump. Bezos bought the Washington Post in 2013, and though he has kept the Post as a distinct company from Amazon, the newspaper’s criticism of Trump has sparked numerous attacks from the president.“Amazon Washington Post has gone crazy against me,” Trump wrote on Twitter in July, the latest in a series of verbal assaults. Trump has accused Amazon of ripping off the US Postal Service (USPS) and has convened a taskforce to assess USPS’s finances.Trump has also threatened a wider investigation into Amazon’s dominance in online retail. The company accounts for 49 cents out of every e-commerce dollar spent in the United States, and has been blamed for the failure of once powerful retailers such as Toys R Us.“Is Fake News Washington Post being used as a lobbyist weapon against Congress to keep Politicians from looking into Amazon no-tax monopoly?” Trump asked last year.The company has also attracted criticism from the left. Amazon is currently assessing where to build a second headquarters in the US, dubbed HQ2. The massive complex is expected to add 50,000 local jobs, but the winning city also looks sure to burnish Amazon with generous tax breaks.Amazon was offered $7bn to build its second headquarters in Newark, New Jersey, a cash-strapped city that critics say could easily find better ways of spending the money than giving it in tax breaks to one of the world’s richest companies.Seattle, Amazon’s home town, has also developed an ambivalent view of the company. Rents in the city have soared, pushing poorer people out, and Amazon lobbied hard to stop the city imposing a tax on large corporations that was meant to tackle growing economic inequality.Amazon had been vying with Apple to reach the landmark $1tn figure for months but lost out when stock markets responded favourably to Apple’s financial results last month.Both companies now have a stock market value more than a third the size of the UK economy and larger than the economies of Turkey and Switzerland.Saudi Arabia’s national oil company Saudi Aramco was expected to achieve a $2tn valuation via a stock market listing, but the oil-rich Gulf state has reportedly put the plan on hold."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fb6cccc21c2f631d8052b712bc49bf553dedbfb/0_20_728_437/master/728.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5966460d17b2d2c24fb39922e4f5724","title":"doctor who regenerates little miss for mr men books","story":"Jodie Whittaker version to join series that merges sci-fi and childhood favouritesThe casting of Jodie Whittaker as the first female Doctor Who has not just transformed a Time Lord into a Time Lady, but has also seemingly regenerated a Mr Man into a Little Miss.Penguin Random House has announced that later this year Dr Thirteenth will join its range of stories that mashup the world of the Mr Men with the universe of Doctor Who.Like all the stories in the Doctor Who Mr Men series so far, it has been written and illustrated by Adam Hargreaves, the son of Roger Hargreaves, who asked his father “Daddy, what does a tickle look like?”, and thus inspired the creation of the whole Mr Men series in 1971, back when Jon Pertwee was playing the Doctor on TV.The new book, already available to preorder, is scheduled for release on 6 November. Preview pages show the new Doctor alongside the three companions who will appear as her friends in her debut season: Yasmin, Ryan and Graham, played on-screen respectively by Mandip Gill, Tosin Cole and Bradley Walsh. The story centres around what the Doctor, Ryan and Graham are going to get for Yasmin’s birthday, which turns into an explosive surprise.There will be a limited edition hardback cover version of the book, but the regular paperback will sit happily alongside the Mr Men and Little Miss books that have been a bedtime story staple for decades. The Doctor Who Mr Men books launched in 2017, and have since included special Christmas adventures. Collectable figurines from the series have also been produced.The BBC is yet to confirm when the new series of Doctor Who will air – although there was speculation this week that the date will be Sunday 7 October, after reports that the iTunes store in Germany briefly displayed the launch date.

The movement, named Aufstehen (Get Up), is the creation of Sahra Wagenknecht, a leading member of the far-left Die Linke party, and her husband, Oskar Lafontaine, a former German finance minister and co-founder of Die Linke. Whether Aufstehen, which has drawn comparisons with similar movements in France and the UK, will garner the sort of support enjoyed by Jean-Luc Mélenchon’s La France Insoumise (France Unbowed) or Jeremy Corbyn’s Momentum, remains to be seen. However Wagenknecht said since the movement had already attracted 100,000 members it had had a positive beginning.“We don’t want to keep observing, we want to change something,” she said, rejecting criticism that the movement could not be described as grassroots because it was being steered by people already enmeshed with Germany’s political elite.Wagenknecht, a controversial star of the left who grew up in the communist east as a committed Marxist, and has been compared with Rosa Luxemburg and Frida Kahlo, said her aim was to reach leftwing voters who had turned their backs on classical parties. Aufstehen is being seen as the left’s response to the rise of the anti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party, to which Die Linke has lost an estimated 400,000 voters.“In such a country democracy is no longer functioning,” she said. “Anger that has been piling up has helped form a breeding ground for hate and violence. If we don’t take counter measures this country will not be recognisable within five to 10 years.”Recent events in the eastern city of Chemnitz, in which 6,000 far-right protesters demonstrated in the streets after a Dresden man was stabbed, allegedly by two immigrants, indicated how urgent it was for politics to find a new direction, she said. “The climate is more raw than ever, the social ides are deeper. Had we needed another impulse then the events in Chemnitz show us that we urgently need a new political revolt.”Among the movement’s more than 80 initiators alongside politicians, were writers, playwrights, artists, pop stars and professors.The main critics of the movement have been leaders of the parties whose supporters Wagenknecht had hoped to unite. Leaders of the Greens, Linke, and SPD, have accused Wagenknecht of being infuriatingly vague in setting out the intentions of Aufstehen. They also argue that Aufstehen could lead to the political left becoming even more ided. The SPD, suffering a downward spiral in support for years, fears Aufstehen could morph into a new leftwing party which could destroy it altogether.But Wagenknecht insisted her goal was the opposite. “If everyone fights for this agenda then a leftwing majority in Germany will become realistic once more,” she said.The founding of Aufstehen has fuelled speculation that Wagenknecht and Lafontaine are attempting to stage a power grab from the Die Linke leaders Katja Kipping and Bernd Riexinger, with whom they are at loggerheads about the direction of the party.Wagenknecht accused her critics of hatefulness, saying it was wrong to label everyone who tried to talk about tackling immigration as a racist.A representative poll of German voters this summer showed that about a third of voters could envisage voting for Aufstehen if it turned into a legitimate political party."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6cf6770452f75dfad6da8d786c856a30b9da386/0_8_4686_2813/master/4686.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59b92eca379090e708e7049ac3c39716","title":"ninety elephant carcasses found in botswana with tusks and trunks chopped","story":"Charities and ministers voice concern after discovery of carcasses with tusks hacked offNinety elephant carcasses have been found in Botswana with their tusks hacked off, in what is believed to be one of Africa’s worst mass poaching sprees.Most of the animals killed were large bulls carrying heavy tusks, Elephants Without Borders said on Tuesday.The discovery was made over several weeks during an aerial survey by scientists from Elephants Without Borders and Botswana’s Department of Wildlife and National Parks.Mike Chase, the charity’s director, said: “We started flying the survey on 10 July, and we have counted 90 elephant carcasses since the survey commenced. Each day, we are counting dead elephants.”The wild pachyderms were shot with heavy-calibre rifles at watering spots near a wildlife sanctuary in the Okavango Delta.According to Chase, the carcasses’ skulls were “chopped open by presumably very sharp axes, to remove their tusks”. In some cases, the trunks were also removed.“The scale of elephant poaching is by far the largest I have seen or read about in Africa to date,” Chase said, adding that the poaching coincided with Botswana’s rangers being reportedly disarmed earlier this year.Botswana previously had a zero-tolerance approach to poaching, with a “shoot-to-kill” policy against poachers.The landlocked country with its unfenced parks and wide open spaces has the largest elephant population in Africa at more than 135,000.Chase said elephants in Zambia and Angola “have been poached to the verge of local extinction, and poachers have now turned to Botswana”. Botswana’s tourism minister, Tshekedi Khama, confirmed dozens of elephants had been poached.“I am very concerned, it’s a huge worry,” he said. “I’m aware that the numbers are in double digits, and for Botswana they are high.“Because we had been spared poaching for a long time, I think now we are realising the sophistication of these poachers. Unfortunately, sometimes we learn these lessons the hard way.”Maj Gen Placid Segokgo, the country’s defence chief, said he was unable to immediately comment on rangers being apparently disarmed earlier this year under a new government policy.The number of African elephants has fallen by about 111,000 to 415,000 in the past decade, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).The killing is taking place at a rate of about 30,000 elephants a year, to meet demand for ivory in Asia, where tusks sell for about $1,000 (£780) a kilo.The Botswana poaching occurred months after Ian Khama, who is passionate about protecting wildlife, stepped down as president, handing power to his chosen successor, Mokgweetsi Masisi.The International Fund for Animal Welfare’s vice-president for conservation, Jason Bell, said of the slaughter: “Until now, Botswana’s elephant herds have largely been left in peace, but clearly Botswana is now in the crosshairs.”Poachers have also targeted rhinos in Botswana, with six white rhino carcasses found in recent months."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3611383.1535552668!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the secret teacher meet ireland s biggest dosser","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Secret Teacher: “I can’t abide dossers. Expertly shaving just a couple of minutes off the start of every class amounts to a lot of saved time  over the course of a week.” Photo: iStockI can’t abide dossers. Expertly shaving just a couple of minutes off the start of every class amounts to a lot of saved time and energy over the course of a week.Forgetting something and having to nip out to get it brings a welcome breather half-way through a class, and when there’s an important appointment right at the end of the day an early exit means beating the end-of-school rush and the consequent traffic.Meet Mary, Ireland’s Biggest Dosser. She “teaches” next door to me and could single-handedly write the Dossing for Dummies manual.She and her children take the mother-child bond to a whole new level, so finely tuned is her children’s instinct for precisely when Mammy needs saving from work.Their teething problems and nasty bugs always coincide with Mary writing the in-house exams, so she will take a step back “if people don’t mind”.Astonishingly, her children’s parent-teacher meetings just happen to clash with staff meetings. I could go on but there isn’t any point.Nor is there any point in raising the subject with Mary, as everyone knows she has her union on speed dial, and won’t be long finding a fundamental maternal or human right that has been violated.More fool any union official who entertains such calls and colludes in helping the Marys to evade their basic pedagogical duties.In recent years our nation has demonstrated an admirable capacity to air its dirty laundry in public and courageously engage in frank discussions about it, the church abuse scandal being an obvious example.But I suspect the strategically-managed dossing will remain buried, despite its prevalence.A well-paid secure job sets one up for life. While the teaching profession is now in crisis, with interest dwindling, prospects poor and morale low, it was for many years both a highly respected and eagerly sought job.The dossers have contributed hugely to how perceptions of teachers have changed over the years.Not so long gone are the days when the priest, the guard and the teacher were the holy trinity of a community, especially in rural Ireland. All three have fallen dramatically from grace in different ways in recent years.Collusion contributes massively to the silent scandal that is the dosser teachers. Job security creates an “untouchable” aura around an inidual. Power, when wielded just the right way, prevents others from wanting to “take you on”.And fear very often prevents parents from complaining when they absolutely have grounds for doing so – fear that their child will bear the brunt of the fallout, fear that nothing will change anyway, fear that making a complaint will lead to far more stress and bother than just finding a way around the problem and riding it out while it lasts.And that’s where those who give grinds are on a real winner. Last week, in schools the length and breadth of the country, classroom teachers took the credit for marks to which a grinds teacher had contributed far more significantly. Saying nothing always amounts to collusion, even if it is, unfortunately, often the most sensible course of action.The holy grail for any young adult is securing a good job with long-term prospects. In our profession this is known as a CID, contract of indefinite duration (ie a job for life).While striving to attain CID, teachers engage in all sorts of extracurricular activities, and many cannot do enough to please school authorities. This is a critical stage in a teacher’s formative experience, as the buzz and the joy of working with the students outside the classroom can inspire them to be involved in such activities for life.Others are simply playing the game, and will abandon all the extras with more enthusiasm than they had ever shown for them in the first place the minute their CID comes through. Plenty of them drop the essentials as well as the extras, but not necessarily like hot coals nor indeed all at once.Obviously we are not all like that, but this piece isn’t about the effective and admirable teachers.In my experience the dossers and those who are at the top of their game rarely mix. They would make for strange bedfellows anyway, having so little in common. Teachers are generally courteous and professional to each other despite huge variations in how they perceive their role and conduct themselves.Those who share my frustration at the dossers giving everyone a bad name, and the parents or students who have suffered at the hands of a dosser, are probably thinking how easy it is for me to write anonymously.Some are undoubtedly willing me on to be the whistleblower that this scandal urgently needs.Well, that’s not going to happen. That’s not how it works. Fear and collusion ensure that I won’t – not for now anyway.But like much of our other dirty laundry, maybe one day this too will be aired for all to see and talk about.The “Secret Teacher” is a practising secondary school teacher.

Photograph: Maxwells Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has rebuffed Taoiseach’s Leo Varadkar’s appeal for talks on an extension of the Confidence and Supply for up to two years, saying he will only enter talks towards the end of the year, as specified in the original agreement.Last week the Taoiseach wrote to the Fianna Fáil leader seeking early talks on an extension of the agreement in the interests of stability during the Brexit negotiations, in a letter Mr Varadkar published this morning.However, Mr Martin told the Taoiseach he will not open talks on an extension before the budget.Mr Martin said he will abide by the terms of the original agreement, and review its operation, with the possibility of an extension at the end of this year.In his letter, Mr Martin said that he does not “see a reasonable basis for the statement in your letter that ’government cannot function if it does not know if it will last from week-to-week or month-to-month’.”“This has no grounding in our Constitutional system and was not raised as an issue when the arrangement was negotiated. Indeed it would be extraordinary if we were to agree that Ministers could not be expected to do their jobs without advance assurance of a compliant Dáil,” Mr Martin wrote.The confidence and supply agreement which underpins the current minority government was agreed between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil in May 2016 and effectively ends after Budget 2019 this October, with a review process to follow thereafter. The parties are scheduled to begin talks on the budget on Wednesday. Key issues to be addressed include the housing crisis, taxation and health funding.However, while Government has an overall budgetary spend of €3.4 billion for the coming year, some €2.6 billion has already been committed, which leaves about €800 million to spend. But given the commitment under the programme for Government to have a minimum 2:1 ratio of investment versus tax cuts, this reduces to just about €265 million available for tax cuts. In his letter to Mr Martin last Friday, the Taoiseach says much had changed since the agreement reached in April 2016, including the UK’s impending exit from the EU and the power-sharing collapse at Stormont. The economy continues to grow alongside “concerns about overheating with growing downside economic risks due to international developments”, he wrote. However, despite record levels of spending, the State is struggling to make improvements to healthcare while the housing crisis persists, Mr Varadkar adds. “Without doubt, there is more to do. It is my strong view that a government cannot function or work in the interests of the people if it is living on borrowed time... Such uncertainty weakens our hand in Brexit talks, domestic negotiations, and of course those opposed or resistant to reform are simply more likely to wait us out.Mr Vardkar argues such a scenario “would not be in the interests of citizens, taxpayers, or users of our public services,” adding that in the interests of certainty the two parties should agree on a general election date for the summer of 2020. “I am ready to appoint a team to commence negotiations immediately”. Fianna Fáil’s Justice spokesperson Jim O’Callaghan said his party would not enter negotiations to extend the Confidence and Supply agreement with Fine Gael until after Budget 2019.It would be “completely illogical” and would make “absolutely no sense” for Fianna Fáil to agree to extend the Confidence and Supply agreement prior to any agreement on Budget 2019, he said. To do so would leave Fianna Fáil with “no tool” in their negotiations on the Budget, he told RTÉ’s News at One.“My view is that Leo Varadkar wants an election in October or November and that’s why he’s trying to get out of the Confidence and Supply agreement.”He said it was unusual for a four page letter to be drafted for the media. It was a distraction and was creating instability. Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan said he does not subscribe to speculation about an early election and does not believe the electorate wanted an election.Fianna Fáil spokesman on communications Timmy Dooley described said discussions about the extension of the confidence and supply agreement were a distraction from issues such as the housing crisis and the health service. Once the upcoming budget has been implemented, then talks on extending the agreement should begin, he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3618046.1536069833!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ff calls for public service obligation payment to save post offices","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil TDs Eugene Murphy,  Fiona O’Loughlin, Timmy Dooley and  Marc McSharry TD during a media briefing at Leinster House in Dublin. Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsThe motion recommends the Government introduce a public service obligation (PSO) payment to ensure post offices around the country remain open.Fianna Fáil spokesman on communications Timmy Dooley described the proposed closure of the post offices as a “planned attack” by the Government and An Post to eliminate a large proportion of the postal network which could create a “domino effect” on surrounding businesses and small shops in the area. An Post announced last week the locations of the 159 post offices which are set to close in the coming weeks and months as part of a restructuring plan. Minister for Communications Denis Naughten will face questioning before a parliamentary committee on Tuesday on the controversial plan to close so many.Fianna Fáil members said on Tuesday that the retirement of postmasters and postmistresses was being used as “a smokescreen” to cover up the closure of so many rural postal offices. The removal of the service will place an “intolerable burden” on the lives of the elderly and more vulnerable who rely on their local post office for pension payments and to pay bills, Mr Dooley warned, adding that elderly users would struggle to continue their transactions online. “We don’t believe that an essential public service should be viewed in terms of profit and loss,” said Mr Dooley. “We believe the viability of the villages and the people around it is more important.”He noted that a PSO payment was already used to subsidise public transport services and projected it would cost €8 million to extend the payment to post offices. “It is for the State and the Government to step in and ensure that these services are maintained and I believe the way to do that is a direct transfer from central exchequer to An Post to deliver an important service. We do it in so many other ways hospitals, community centres, nurses, doctors, guards, which we pay from central exchequer.”Asked to comment on the high number of post offices which closed between 2000 and 2011, during which time Fianna Fáil was in power, Mr Dooley said offices had closed due to a lack of demand in the area. “The difference between then and now is this has been a planned attack by the Government and An Post to eliminate a very significant section of the post office network. It’s happening in villages where there is a demand to retain the service.“Post offices cannot be viewed as simple accounting units with a focus solely on profit and loss. They are immeasurable part of community life across Ireland, but especially in rural Ireland, and the Government must listen and must intervene.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3618328.1536083946!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ira has left the stage and is not involved in sinn f%C3%A9in doherty says","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSinn Féin TDs Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, Mary Lou McDonald (the party leader) and  Pearse Doherty.

The PSNI assessment suggested the IRA had a role in the political direction of Sinn Féin but Mr Doherty said the paramilitary organisation had “left the stage”. Mr Doherty was asked to clarify comments made by party leader Mary Lou McDonald in an interview on RTÉ yesterday, in which she did not specifically say the IRA no longer exists. He said Ms McDonald had on numerous occasions said the IRA was gone.“Mary Lou (McDonald) said (in the interview) that during the conflict there were many (members) who went through the prison system but the leadership of Sinn Féin is the leadership of Sinn Féin,” he told reporters in Cavan as the party’s elected representatives held a strategy meeting. “I am a member of the collective leadership of Sinn Féin. Mary Lou is the leader and she takes the decision collectively with the rest of it.” Mr Doherty said the PSNI report had formed the basis of a “political attack” from Fianna Fáil leader “Micheál Martin and all the rest”. Mr Martin at the weekend claimed “shadowy figures” were prominent in the background in Sinn Féin. “He is running scared of the fact that Sinn Féin is offering real solutions to real problems that people face on a daily basis.

Defending the controversial An Post plan to cull 159 post offices, mainly in rural areas in the west, midlands and southeast, Mr Naughten said communities themselves had voted for it “with their own feet”. “This is the fact of it, and some people have failed to acknowledge this, but the local community have bypassed some of those post offices, have gone to the bigger towns, have not used the local shop,” he said. Before a specially-convened Oireachtas committee hearing to debate the imminent closures, Mr Naughten insisted they were “not a surprise to anyone”. “So communities knew that their post office was under threat, yet they continued to pass by the front door, and are now concerned in relation to it.”Mr Naughten said: “The community has spoken themselves with their own feet.” The entire post office network almost collapsed last year as it struggled to cope with mounting multimillion-euro losses, he told the Oireachtas Communications, Climate Action and Environment Committee. An Post bosses had outlined for him a “very bleak future” and the “very real possibility” the State-owned company could go bust. “The potential for a complete shutdown of postal services with the loss of thousands of jobs was undeniable,” he said.Mr Naughten said the financial circumstances were so dire that immediate action was needed. “It was needed to ensure the survival of An Post,” he said. “It was needed to safeguard the post office network. It was needed to protect thousands of jobs across the country.” Mr Naughten’s remarks were backed up by David McRedmond, the company’s chief executive. An Post was “virtually insolvent” 18 months ago, he told TDs and Senators. Consultants brought in to assess the scale of the problem said the company faced further losses of €180 million over the coming five years, the committee was told. Mr Naughten also laid blame for the crisis on a failure to act by successive governments.But “after years of drift” the decision to restructure and consolidate the entire network means “the future is not as bleak”, although, he added, “underlying challenges” remain. Responding to repeated calls for the post offices to emulate community banking models in New Zealand and Germany, the Minister suggested a link up with Ireland’s own credit union movement could be a better option. Mr McRedmond told the hearing “there have been some discussions” with the credit union movement about a possible partnership. Mr Naughten denied a suggestion that postmasters were made “an offer they can’t refuse”, insisting the redundancy scheme leading to the closures was entirely voluntary. That a majority of postmasters did refuse the severance package proved this, he told the hearing. Postmasters themselves had asked for three things, he said: modernisation of the network redundancy packages and new services to bring in more customers. The Minister said all these demands are being met. Progress was being made bringing more government services to post offices while community banking services are being rolled out across the network, he added. Mr Naughten said An Post is the only postal service in the world “actually expanding” its services at moment, including in the most isolated rural communities. “But we can’t justify keeping a post office open that has 12 transactions a week,” he added. Responding to repeated calls for the post offices to emulate community banking models in New Zealand and Germany, the minister suggested a link up with Ireland’s own credit union movement could be better option. Mr McRedmond told the hearing that “there have been some discussions” with the credit union movement about a possible partnership.

Photograph: EPA Britain’s Brexit secretary Dominic Raab has told MPs that Theresa May’s Chequers proposal has received a positive response from European leaders, even if it was “challenging” for some in Brussels. Mr Raab was speaking days after EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the Chequers plan for customs was unworkable. And its proposal to give Britain single market access for goods but not services could destroy the European project.“I will continue to meet regularly with Michel Barnier, confident that a deal is within our grasp. And if the ambition and pragmatism that we have shown is matched by our EU friends, this House and the British people can rest assured that the UK will be ready for Brexit, deal or no deal,” he said.A number of Conservative Brexiteers on the Commons EU scrutiny committee who met Mr Barnier this week were encouraged by his suggestion that Britain’s negotiating red lines made a Canada-style free trade agreement the best available option after Brexit. Some pro-European Conservatives have also called on the prime minister to abandon her Chequers proposal because it has no chance of being accepted either by the EU or by parliament.Ms May will make a statement on Brexit at a meeting of EU leaders in Salzburg on September 20th, after which the other 27 leaders will discuss the issue among themselves. Downing Street hopes that, by making the case for Chequers directly to the other leaders, the prime minister will persuade them to soften Mr Barnier’s negotiating mandate.“But equally this is a decision which at the end of the process will be taken at a political level by the European Council. So you can obviously expect a continued and strong engagement with fellow European countries.”Bank of England governor Mark Carney confirmed to a Commons committee on Tuesday that he is discussing with the government a possible postponement of his departure from office next summer to offer continuity in the months after Brexit. Mr Carney warned that a no-deal could mean years of hardship for British households.“There is going to be a period of adjustment if we’re moving quickly to a WTO relationship and it is likely, given the pace of wage growth at present and the inflation effects, that the real income squeeze will return for households across the country for a few years,” he said.Mr Raab told MPs, however, that although the government was not seeking a no-deal Brexit and did not expect it, it could bring some opportunities.“We would be able to lower tariffs and negotiate and bring into effect new free trade deals straight away. There would be the immediate recovery of full legislative and regulatory control, including over immigration policy, and – whilst mindful of our legal obligations – a swifter end to our financial contributions to the EU,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

husband as the husband to the Lord.\u0026#34An onscreen Bible reading which demanded women be submissive to their husbands has sparked calls to end religious broadcasting on public television in Belgium.The New Testament reading, from Ephesians 5.22 - 33,  was broadcast on radio and Flemish TV station VRT from a Catholic mass in the town of Grimbergen.A lay reader said, “Women, be submissive to your husband as the husband to the Lord. For the man is the head of the woman as Christ is the head of the church.”Sven Gatz, the media minister for the Dutch-speaking Belgian region of Flanders who represents the Flemish liberal party, tweeted: “No outdated, woman-unfriendly statements … please. What if, for example, an imam would have said this?”He told newspaper Het Nieuwsblad: “The fact that they come from an old book is not an argument for letting them go to our people. This is not of this time, and that it is broadcast on the VRT for the whole of Flanders is already completely crazy.”Religious TV programmes on public broadcasters, like Britain\u0026#39s Songs of Praise, could face the axe in Belgium, if Flemish Liberal Sven Gatz gets his way. Mr Gatz has been unsuccessfully calling for the end of Songs of Praise-style programmes at the taxpayer’s expense since last year, but he now hopes the controversy will reignite the debate and insists different solutions could be found for religious people who are unable to attend mass.“I want to examine all the technical possibilities to give these people their weekly celebration. But this cannot be an argument to keep these broadcasts, at the expense of the taxpayer, he said.VRT said it had “no problem” with its broadcasts leading to debate and discussion, while the Dutch Bible Society, which has Flemish members, said that the reading had been taken out of context.“The contested statement is preceded by a very different sentence: ‘Accept each other’s authority out of respect for Christ’. This indicates that this is a very different matter than legitimisation of the oppression of women by men,” a spokesman for the society said.Theresa May accused by own MP of \u0026#39not getting it\u0026#39 over British troops facing charges during the TroublesThe Great British Bake Off 2018, Cake Week review: swearing in the tent, while Paul Hollywood gives out handshakes like an over-eager salesman Bob Woodward, the Watergate veteran who set his sight on Donald TrumpWatch: Duke of Sussex pulls funny faces with ill youngster at WellChild awardsSenior Trump figures called president ‘unhinged’ and like ‘a fifth-grader’, explosive new book claimsMont Blanc to impose climber quotas to cut crowds and chaos atop Western Europe\u0026#39s highest peakNHS hides true scale of superbug deaths for fear of looking like it\u0026#39s \u0026#39failing\u0026#39, Chief Medical Officer warnsComment: Is there a more miserable job in politics than Brexit Secretary?Controversial Colin Kaepernick is the face of new Nike ad campaign – in the age of Donald Trump, companies are forced to be politicalSpurned woman sends ex-lover video of her killing his fish with bleach after accusing him of affair, court hears Nicola Sturgeon\u0026#39s government labelled \u0026#39well past sell-by date\u0026#39 after she unveils \u0026#39thin\u0026#39 programme Rachael Bland reveals online trolls \u0026#39berated\u0026#39 her for not \u0026#39trying hard enough\u0026#39 to save herselfBillionaire rapist travelled the world unchecked after blunder by UK authoritiesProtesters burn Nike trainers after company reveals Colin Kaepernick is face of new campaignDavid Beckham employs \u0026#39Mr Loophole\u0026#39 lawyer to fight speeding charge Jeremy Corbyn condemned  after claiming it is not anti-Semitic to describe the creation of Israel as \u0026#39racist\u0026#39Shooting the Bodyguard: the secrets of the hit show\u0026#39s filming locationsMale suicide drops to lowest level in 30 years amid reduced mental health stigma Osteoporosis may not be prevented with vitamin d supplements, says studyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/09/04/TELEMMGLPICT000173351859_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqdsBoNc5Q1tcKBq1Fh6n_BoCO6ynE_MBL155WMllozCw.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"osteoporosis may not prevented vitamin d supplements says study","story":"The government recommends adults and children over 10 take vitamin D in winter and autumn to protect musculoskeletal healthVitamin D supplements do not work as well as previously thought to prevent osteoporosis in healthy adults, a major study has recommended. About half of UK adults take vitamin supplements with vitamin D being one of the most popular.  The vitamin is routinely given to prevent and treat osteoporosis based on official government advice.The researchers looked at 15 genetic variations – such as bone mineral density, vitamin D levels, intake of calcium and the age at which a woman began menopause – as a way of determining the key risk factors for developing the condition.The research, published in the British Medical Journal, analysed the genetic data of more than 500,000 people using genetic profiles gathered from previous studies and American consumer genetics company, 23andMe in the largest-ever study looking at the genetics of osteoporosis and bone fracture risk.They found that genetic predisposition to low levels of vitamin D and calcium intake – previously thought to be important in determining someone’s risk of fracturing their bones – does not affect someone’s chances of developing osteoporosis.5 natural ways to get a shot of vitamin DBone mineral density – how thick or dense your bones are – was the only factor that directly determines a person’s risk of developing the condition.“Bone mass density is the only risk factor that’s causally related to fracture risk,” said Dr Fernando Rivadeneira, the study’s lead author and a genetic epidemiologist at the Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam.Bone mass density peaks at the age of 20. The peak is determined by a number of factors such as genes, how well nourished a person was in the womb and childhood diet. After the age of 40, bone mass starts to decline with smokers, heavy drinkers, thinner people, those who exercise less and women more likely to be negatively affected. .html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}Building strong bones and strong muscles is the way to goDr Fernando RivadeneiraDr Rivadeneira said that the research findings suggest that health authorities may need to re-assess the wide-spread use of vitamin D and calcium in clinical practice.“One of the most important insights from our work for patients at risk of osteoporosis, is obtaining additional evidence from the genetic studies that \u0027widespread\u0027 vitamin D supplementation is unlikely to be effective for the prevention of fracture,” he added. “It’s an eye opener.”Osteoporosis, which causes bones to become weak and fragile, affects 9 million people around the world – including three million people in the UK.  It leaves sufferers at risk of fracturing their wrist, hip and spine bones. The disease can be so serious for some people that even a cough or a sneeze can lead to a fracture.Post-menopausal women are at particular risk due to the effects that changes in oestrogen levels can have on bone density.“Building strong bones and strong muscles is the way to go,” said Dr Rivadeneira. “You need increased physical activity or at least not to lose your physical activity level and to have a balanced diet.”Many studies have looked at the association between vitamin D and health, but doctors and researchers are still not agreed on the level of vitamin D healthy people need or the potential adverse health consequences of a lack of the vitamin. The \u0026#039sunshine\u0026#039 supplement: should we all be taking vitamin D?As well as providing more evidence that builds on earlier studies that have also called into question the benefits of Vitamin D in preventing fractures in healthy people, the researchers said that the findings will help scientists identify new treatments for osteoporosis. By understanding the genetic variations that predispose someone to develop osteoporosis, they hope that better targeted treatments can be developed.“Some of the identified genetic variants are related to genes part of pathways currently targeted by recently developed osteoporosis medication, while other novel ones hold potential to become drug targets in the near future”, said Dr Rivadeneira.“Instead of putting everyone in the same melting pot, we have different types – people who lose bone, people who cannot form bone, and people who have a combination of the two,” he added.While the researchers said that Vitamin D is unlikely to have a significant effect on preventing osteoporosis in otherwise healthy adults, they have not ruled out that there could still be a role for supplementation such as in people who have particularly low levels of Vitamin D.  The researchers also recommend that osteoporosis sufferers taking treatments for the disease do not discontinue their vitamin supplements since the effectiveness of many current treatments have been tested in conjunction with use of Vitamin D and calcium.Cyrus Cooper, Professor of Rheumatology at the University of Southampton and president of the International Osteoporosis Foundation who contributed to the study said that bone density was probably some two to three times better at predicting someone\u0027s risk of getting osteoporosis than their level of Vitamin D level. I don\u0027t think this paper debunks the idea that Vitamin D is useful, he said. It\u0027s just that it is a small determinant. You\u0027d do some good if you make sure that your Vitamin D levels are okay.Commenting on the current UK advice for management and prevention of osteoporosis he said: The current guidelines are appropriate however, a bone density evaluation needs to be done as part of fracture risk screening.Professor Juliet Compston, a bone medicine expert at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and  a clinical adviser for the National Osteoporosis Society supported the study\u0027s findings. She said: The results of the analysis confirm and emphasise further the major role of low bone mass density as a risk factor for fractures, something that has been recognised for many years. There is an increasing consensus that in generally healthy community dwelling people, calcium and vitamin D supplementation does not reduce fracture risk, and this is supported by the findings of the study.Although the findings of this study do not support population-based vitamin D and calcium supplementation in community dwelling adults, there is strong evidence to support the continued use of supplements in high risk groups such as the housebound and institutionalised. Secondly, in people receiving pharmacological interventions for osteoporosis, calcium and vitamin D supplements should be provided if calcium intake andor vitamin D status are inadequate, she added.  So the study does not change current guidance for managing osteoporosis.Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleProtect yourself and your family by learning more about  Global Health Security  .

out at online trolls who berated” her for not “trying hard enough” to save herself during her cancer battle.BBC Radio 5 Live journalist Rachael Bland revealed she had receive some negative responses in describing her experience with the illness.On Monday, Bland, 40, who was diagnosed with cancer in 2016, announced via Twitter that she only had “days to live”, which triggered an outpouring of support including goodwill messages from journalists and colleagues.But in an article for the Huffington Post, which was published on Tuesday but written before her most recent diagnosis, the journalist recalled some messages she received were mixed.“I was sent so many beautiful messages,” she said.  “Along with many telling me to go to foreign climes to try miracle cancer treatment – FYI these all get deleted immediately,” she continued. Bland said she feared leaving her son Freddie behindBut Bland went on to reveal she received criticism for “not trying hard enough” to save herself. The 40-year-old did not elaborate on how many disparaging messages she received. In the article, the journalist emphasised her support for “modern medicine”, and stated that she had enrolled in clinical trials. Bland, who is married with a three year-old-son, Freddie, wrote she had hope for new treatment options early on in her diagnosis, but also ensured she completed a “memoirs” book for her son to remember her by.  In an article for The Sunday  last month, Bland wrote: I’m not scared of dying.  I only fear for those I leave behind.

Fellow insulin manufacturer\u0026nbspFrench firm Sanofi has already pledged to hold a 14-week stockpile, increasing reserves by nearly a third.“Our first commitment is to ensure that patients treated with our medicines remain unaffected in the event of a ‘no-deal’ Brexit,” said Pinder Sahota, corporate vice president of Novo Nordisk UK.“Our decision to increase stock is in line with the technical notices and guidance published by the government to industry.”How a new diabetes test could save millions of livesType 2 diabetes in children up 40 per cent, an ‘unmitigated disaster’Insulin pill could end need for diabetics’ daily injectionsThe Independent is leading a campaign to ensure the public gets a Final Say on the event terms of UK’s exit, and leading medical organisations have highlighted the serious health risks that need to be addressed first.Leaked civil service plans have shown how food and medicines in parts of the UK could run out within days unless a deal is in place, as additional delays and custom checks at Dover throw freight logistics into chaos.If prime minister Theresa May, herself a type 1 diabetic, is unable to agree a transition arrangement by March then the European Medicines Agency will deem the UK a “third country”.This will mean more stringent checks on imported medicines\u0026nbspuntil the UK gets its own systems in place for quality and assurance monitoring.The government is already preparing to turn the M20 into an overflow car park to manage queues at Dover and logistical disruption increases the chances of insulin stocks – which must be kept chilled – being spoiled.Despite these risks, the government is adamant that it will not give the public any vote on the terms of Britain’s exit.Dan Howarth, head of care at Diabetes UK, said: “This further commitment from Novo Nordisk will no doubt reassure those people with diabetes who rely on the insulin this company produces.“Insulin and other diabetes medication aren’t optional extras for the millions of people in the UK who rely on them. It’s incredibly important that the companies involved in their production and distribution, and those involved in guaranteeing their entry into the UK, work together so that supply continues uninterrupted.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/30/13/frestonia-1.jpg","title":"frestonia squatters london declare independence uk 1970s free independent","story":"Created with Sketch.The Free Independent Republic of Frestonia was born of a generation who knew counterculture as much as precarious living. Now a new book collects photography and stories from the communityClick to followThe IndependentThe community designed a flag, appointed ministers of state – including actor David Rappaport as foreign minister – made their own postage stamps and issued visas for visitorsThere was a lot of talk, in the wake of the Brexit referendum, suggesting that London should stage its own exit from the United Kingdom, declare independence, and ask to rejoin the EU as a nation state.Ignoring for now the fact that not everyone – though\u0026nbspit might seem that way to London – outside the capital voted to leave the EU, it seemed a satisfying, though jokey, postscript to the Brexit vote. Indeed, more than 180,000 Londoners signed an online petition calling for the mayor, Sadiq\u0026nbspKhan, to “declare London independent, and apply to join the EU –\u0026nbspincluding membership of the Schengen zone”.But what a lot of the signatories might not have realised was that there was indeed a precedent for London seceding from the UK. Or at least, one street of the capital.\u0026nbspWelcome to the Free Independent Republic of Frestonia. Or, what’s left of it, which these days amounts to the Frestonian Gallery, keeping the name and spirit alive of one of the most curious episodes in London’s history. It\u0026nbspbegan on Halloween\u0026nbsp1977, when the residents of Freston Road in Notting Dale, West London, which was largely comprised of squats and communes, declared independence.Threatened with eviction, the squatters said they were no longer part of the UK and appealed to the United Nations to send in peacekeeping forces to prevent Greater London Council turfing them out of the homes they had claimed. They designed a flag, appointed ministers of state, and even made their own postage stamps and issued visas for visitors.The short-lived story of the Free Independent Republic of Frestonia has now been documented in a new book of photographs by one of its residents, the photographer Tony Sleep, who was resident on Freston Road from 1974.\u0026nbspSleep describes the Frestonia experiment as “part publicity stunt, part theatrical protest”, and adds that while it wasn’t a serious attempt to break away from the UK, there was never any need to, because what became Frestonia “was already on a different planet”.He writes in the lavish book: “Frestonia was rooted in the counterculture of the time. The period is now dismissed as little more than daft clothes and hair, accompanied by a great soundtrack and the invention of sex and drugs.“It was, we are told, youthful self indulgence that ended badly because it was irresponsible and naive.”Frestonian Gallery)Frestonia was born out of problems that young people will recognise today: the lack of affordable accommodation. Sleep points out that the millennial generation might have a beef with the baby boomers who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s because they had it easy, and accommodation was cheap and plentiful. Not a bit of it, he says.“Rented flats were in very short supply, and mostly slum standard. You might achieve a rented bedsit as long as you weren’t black, Irish\u0026nbspor a dog. Then, as now, landlords wanted ‘professional’ people.“Council housing lists were only for families, and backlogged for decades. Despite what now seem like absurdly low prices, only the wealthy and secure could obtain mortgages at a time before easy mass debts. Less than half the population owned their own homes at the start of the 1970s.”Freston Road, where squatters and activists founded housing coop and community Frestonia\u0026nbsp(Getty)Many of the houses on Freston Road were empty, having been condemned as unfit for human habitation, and most of the residents had been relocated to the new highrise blocks of flats that began to go up in the 1960s and 1970s. There had been a move to demolish the vacant properties, but residents in neighbouring communities had complained that they would be looking out onto swathes of barren, rubble-strewn land that would encourage flytipping, so the authorities decided to take the cheaper option and just leave the buildings standing for a while.Freston Road might have been abandoned, but that didn’t mean it was unused. From 1974, squatters began to break into the empty houses and set up home there Tony Sleep, aged 24 at that time, was one of them.He recalls:\u0026nbsp“Squatting is distinctly equal opportunity. If you can gain possession, it’s yours. This led to an interesting mix of people who had little in common except needing somewhere to live and being poor for one reason or another. While some tried to make their new homes habitable, several houses were quickly wrecked.”Sleep remembers well his first sight of Freston Road. He’d been living in a “dismal rented basement” in west Kensington, but as he and his girlfriend parted company, he needed somewhere else to live, and heard about a street of empty houses. Some of his friends went to have a look and broke into two of the houses.“That night I paid them a visit,” writes Sleep. “Eight people, four guys, four girls, in one candlelit room, the only one that had windows. There was no toilet, no water, no electricity.”But his friends set to work installing plumbing and wiring as best they could, found an old toilet, rescued carpets and furniture from skips, and Sleep asked if he could move in with them.By 1977 Freston Road had settled into an unorthodox community, of sorts. But the attention of the GLC wandered back to these old, abandoned homes, and the squatters were told that they were to be evicted from these properties.The council offered to place the squatters in what were considered “hard to let” properties dotted around London, and some took the flats –\u0026nbspand, says Sleep, were promptly replaced in Freston Road by other people desperate for somewhere to live.\u0026nbspThe GLC announced its intention to bulldoze Freston Road after all, and a meeting was called, attended by 200 people. They decided – inspired by the Ealing comedy Passport to Pimlico – to go it alone. The Free Independent Republic of Frestonia was born. And the battle was on.The Frestonian National Anthem was written (“Long live Frestonia! Land of the free – not the GLC”) and a community newspaper, The Tribal Messenger, was distributed. Frestonia made the international press, and the Daily Mirror ran a piece declaring “All Hall, Frestonia”. The actor David Rappaport was made foreign minister, and playwright Heathcote Williams became ambassador to the United Kingdom.It was all a bit jolly and, of course, more than a pinch of Ealing comedy. But, Sleep points out, Frestonia was also an interesting way of putting British society under the\u0026nbspmicroscope.“Communities are defined, more or less, by what people have in common,” he writes. “That’s usually class, background or aspiration, sometimes race or religion. What people have in common helps them feel safe and valued. What is different can be threatening or isive.Frestonian Gallery)“Families, on the other hand, are a matter of being stuck with people you sometimes struggle to tolerate, let alone like. Frestonia was a bit of both.“Frestonians were, beneath the veneer of pragmatic anarchy, from different cultures. There were the hippies, idealists of a sort. There were the punks, nihilists of a sort. And there were the itinerant street people, whose lack of youth and lost changes gave them a thread of bitterness to chew on together.”Over the next couple of years, fighting the threat of the GLC bulldozers, the anarchic squat collective organised itself more seriously, forming the Bramley Housing Cooperative with an aim that was less about the fun of independence and more about securing the future of the Freston Road community.Eventually, the GLC won the war, and demolition of the squats began in 1983. But the Bramley Housing Cooperative, working with the Notting Hill Housing Trust, continued to fight for Freston Road as a residential area. And, ultimately, they won.Sleep says, “Frestonia didn’t cease when the squats were demolished. How could it? They were only useful ruins. Frestonia was about the people, its improbable family.“If you walk through Frestonia now, there’s little to suggest it is much different from anywhere else. You’ll find a street of small, but perhaps unusually pretty houses, built in the mid 1980s. They look carefully designed, a bit too inidual to be social housing. You may not notice the enclosed communal gardens, or the sheltered housing scheme that the coop insisted on, you won’t know the coop ensured housing for some of the more vulnerable Frestonians.”It might be that Frestonia would be forgotten all together, but for Tony Sleep’s photographic record of the people, events and houses on Freston Road in the late 1970s and early 1980s.‘Pop-up squat’: Activists occupy property to protest Housing BillNew photography exhibition shows the tough reality of squattingChallenging consumption and overwork in a Danish communityThe name does linger on in the form of the Frestonian Gallery, opened in 2017 by Matt Incledon and Rollo Campbell, who have published Tony Sleep’s photographs and recollections in Welcome To Frestonia. A pair of, in their own words, “itinerant art dealers”, they opened the gallery in The People’s Hall, a Victorian building that was once at the heart of Frestonia.\u0026nbspFrestonian Gallery opened in 2017 to remember a most curious episode in London’s history\u0026nbsp(Tony SleepFrestonian Gallery)Becoming appraised of the story of Frestonia, they were introduced to Tony Sleep, and arranged an exhibition of his photographs. They write in their foreword: “It was an exhibition unlike anything either of us had worked on previously. Each day at the gallery provided a steady stream of visitors keen to revisit and share their own personal memories of Frestonia. It would be a nice point at which to say ‘We then decided a book of Tony’s work needs to be published...’ but again, in truth, the decision had been made for us already by the sheer emotional response to this unique exhibition.”Was it all worth it for the Frestonians? Did it make a difference? Tony Sleep closes his remarkable document of this time by musing, “Forty years on, the UK seems to have travelled in a large circle and arrived little the wiser, but probably angrier, more cynical and more ided than ever.\u0026nbspWe are all Frestonians, on this small blue dot in the middle of nowhere.

Russian reports citing anonymous sources suggest that the problem could have existed from the time the Soyuz capsule headed up to the International Space Station, and might have been treated with a temporary fix that has recently come undone.Nasa\u0026nbsphas only said that the Russian space agency has has convened a commission to conduct further analysis of the possible cause of the leak.Russian news agency TASS reported that the boss of the Russian space agency, Roscosmos, said the theory that the hole was caused by an impact had been discounted.We are considering all the theories, Dmitry Rogozin, according to TASS.\u0026nbspThe one about a meteorite impact has been rejected because the spaceship’s hull was evidently impacted from inside. However it is too early to say definitely what happened.But, it seems to be done by a faltering hand… it is a technological error by a specialist. It was done by a human hand - there are traces of a drill sliding along the surface. We don’t reject any theories.He said that problem could have happened by accident or on purpose, and either on Earth or in space. A full investigation is being mounted to find the person responsible, TASS reported him as saying.Both Nasa and Roscosmos\u0026nbspstressed throughout the leak that the astronauts were in no immediate danger, and had been allowed to continue sleeping once the drop in pressure was recognised.Once they were awake, astronauts worked with experts on the ground to find the hole and then to plug it up – initially, simply by placing a finger over the hole. Once it was fixed, pressure appears to have stabilised and the astronauts on board have gone back to their usual schedule.The leak was traced back to the orbital part of the Soyuz capsule, which docked on the side of the International Space Station when it arrived. It is that capsule that astronauts are set to use to come back down to Earth, and work is ongoing to ensure the rest of the craft is safe.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/12/26/12/walls.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/12/26/12/walls.jpg","title":"boy passport home office belgium holiday blocked mother","story":"Created with Sketch.Exclusive: Mohamed Bangoura, born in Leeds in 2012,\u0026nbspblocked from reuniting with his mother in Britain after Home Office revoked his passportClick to followThe IndependentSajid Javid opposes \u0027hostile environment\u0027 approach to UK immigration opting instead for a \u0027compliant environment\u0027British boy who has lived in country since birth refused entry to UK on return from holidayA six-year-old boy who has lived in the UK all of his life has been prevented from returning home to his mother following\u0026nbspa holiday after\u0026nbspthe Home Office revoked his passport.Mohamed Barrak Diallo\u0026nbspBangoura, who was born in Leeds in 2012, had been staying in Belgium with family friends for six weeks during the school holidays.He was due to board a flight home to his mother on Sunday, but officials\u0026nbspat Zaventem airport in Brussels said the Home Office had instructed them he could not travel to the UK.Home Office attempts to deport children ‘harmful and ineffective’Passports for UK-born children of EU nationals rejected ‘in error’Home Office using immigrants as a ‘cash cow’ as citizenship fees soarShadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott described the case as “truly shocking” and said the act of blocking a UK-born child from returning home was “exactly one of the effects” of the government’s hostile environment.Hawa Keita, the boy’s mother, who is of New Guinean origin and lives in Sheffield, received a letter from the Home Office in March informing her that her son’s passport had been issued in error and had been “revoked” due to questions surrounding his British citizenship.The letter stated that the child’s claim to British citizenship was no longer valid because it had “come to light” that the man Ms Keita was married to at the time of his birth\u0026nbspwas not settled in Britain.Since a change to legislation in 1983, children born in the UK will only have British citizenship if at least one of their parents is a British citizen or is living in the UK with permission to stay in the country permanently.The boy\u0026nbspnow remains in Brussels\u0026nbspwith ​the family he was staying with,\u0026nbspfriends of his mother.\u0026nbspMs Keita is in the UK and unable to travel because she was residing in the country based on her son’s British citizenship.Abdoul Diallo, a political advisor for the EU who has been looking after the child in his family home in Belgium and took\u0026nbsphim to the airport on Sunday, told The Independent he was shocked\u0026nbspwhen he was preventing from boarding the flight.“We went through all checks and security controls in the airport, but as we were about to board plane, the staff said British authorities had sent them email saying the child cannot board,” he said.“It was a shock. We were told to go to the British embassy, but it was Sunday and the next\u0026nbspday was a bank holiday. I had to call the Belgian police, who gave me a document saying I should look after the child until a solution is found.”Mr Diallo\u0026nbspsaid that Mohamed appeared to be\u0026nbsprelaxed about the situation so far, but warned that it may become more difficult once his friends go back to school on Wednesday, at which\u0026nbsppoint he will be looked after by Mr Diallo’s mother.“We’re going to have him for one more week. He has been happily playing with my eight-year-old daughter and\u0026nbspmy nephew who is six, but they will start school tomorrow. That’s\u0026nbspwhen he will start realising the situation,” he said.“Hawa is residing in the UK based on his British nationality, so she\u0026nbspcannot leave the country, meaning for the time being the child is stuck here. No matter what the parents\u0026nbsphave done, the child shouldn’t be separated\u0026nbspfrom them.”Responding to the incident, Ms Abbott told\u0026nbspThe Independent: “This case is truly shocking. That this government would preside over a system blocking a six-year old born here from returning home is almost beyond belief.“We have ministers telling us they are sorting out the\u0026nbspWindrush\u0026nbspscandal, and their hostile environment\u0026nbspisn’t to blame. But this shows their reassurances are worthless.\u0026nbsp“People being refused re-entry here is exactly one of the effects of their policies. It will keep on happening until they abandon the hostile environment altogether.”Chai Patel, legal policy director at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI), called for a full and independent inquiry into this shambles of a Home Office”, accusing the department\u0026nbspof stranding\u0026nbspa young child in a foreign country, when the only home he knows is in the UK.He was born in Leeds. It is disgraceful that he is not being allowed to return, and shows that the Home Secretary continues to have scant regard to his legal duty to safeguard the best interests of children, he added.The letter to Ms Keita from the Home Office in March stated that the child’s claim to British citizenship was no longer valid because it had “come\u0026nbspto light” that neither she\u0026nbspnor her husband were settled in Britain at the time of the child’s birth.UK news in picturesPro Labour party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, protesters demonstrate outside the Labour party headquarters in London.

Mr Corbyn’s close ally – shied away from backing a fresh referendum.Conference delegates instead endorsed a weaker statement, where Unite remains “open to the possibility” of another EU referendum “depending on political circumstances”.Up to 200 local Labour branches will attempt to make a further Brexit referendum official party policy at the conference in Liverpool, starting on 23 September.Mr Corbyn hopes to force the prime minister into another general election if her Brexit deal is rejected by parliament this winter, or if she fails to strike any agreement at all.However, the party has been edging closer to backing a referendum, with both John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, and Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, insisting it must remain an option.The issue will also be debated by the union movement in Manchester next week, at the TUC conference.Responding, Brandon Lewis MP, Chairman of the Conservative Party, said: “Rerunning the referendum would take us all back to square one.“Jeremy Corbyn should stand up to his union paymasters and rule out a second referendum once and for all.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that

Bosnia wearing the European Union flag on their uniforms.“No one should now join the British army until we have left the EU and this has all been reversed,” Mr Batten said.“Our soldiers are no longer fighting for Queen and Country but under a foreign military command.Our ancestors, the heroes of The Armada, Waterloo, Trafalgar, Passchendaele, El-Alamein, and others too numerous to mention, did not fight so that their descendants could serve under the flag of a foreign power.”Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: “For goodness sake, this is ridiculous. We’d have lost the war if we’d have refused to work with our allies.”But Mr Batten said it was only after the UK left the EU that “we will be able to rebuild our military into a force which serves the interests of our nation first and foremost.

IndependentIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte in Jerusalem on MondayBenjamin Netanyahu has warmly welcomed\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspcontroversial Philippine president, who once\u0026nbspcompared himself to Hitler, adding to mounting criticism of the Israeli prime minister’s close ties with authoritarian world leaders.Rodrigo Duterte, who is in Israel for a four-day tour, is the first Philippine leader to visit the country since the two nations established diplomatic relations 60 years ago. \u0026nbspThe firebrand president is expected to sign a major oil deal with Israel and to purchase Israeli arms, during the short tour in which he has been accompanied by an entourage of security forces.\u0026nbspMr Duterte has faced widespread criticism for his deadly crackdown on drugs back home which has left thousands dead and for several foul-mouthed comments, including comparing his war on drugs to the Holocaust, and most recently\u0026nbspjoking about rape.Despite the many controversies, on Monday Mr Netanyahu highlighted the two country’s historical\u0026nbspfriendship, including the Philippines’\u0026nbspdecision to vote in favour of Israel’s establishment in 1947, becoming the only Asian country to do so.“We remember our friends and that friendship has blossomed over the years and especially over the last few years,” Mr Netanyahu said, after signing three agreements on trade, science and care-giving.Mr Duterte, who later visited the country’s Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial and met top officials including President Reuven Rivlin, said they “share the same passion for peace”.“Israel can expect any help that the Philippines can extend,” he added.We remember our friends and that friendship has blossomed over the years and especially over the last few years\u0026nbspThe Philippines has enjoyed\u0026nbspincreasingly strong ties with Israel over the years. In December it abstained from a vote at the United Nations General Assembly rebuking the US for moving its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Washington’s controversial decision recognised Jerusalem as Israel’s capital despite the fact it is contested city claimed by both Israelis and Palestinians. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Philippine president is also seeking new sources of military hardware and emerged as a significant new customer in 2017 for Israel, with sales of radar and anti-tank equipment worth $21m.Mr Netanyahu has been praised for forging ties with new allies abroad, where Israel has often lost support for its occupation of the Palestinian territories.However, in recent months the Israeli leader has come under fire for the choice of those partners.Why Netanyahu sees Poland as Israel’s most important ally in EuropeIsrael’s Netanyahu criticised for wooing Hungary’s far-right PMWhy has Netanyahu pushed through the Jewish Nation State bill now?Benjamin Netanyahu questioned by police in corruption investigation Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu flies to Europe to lobby May on Iran dealMr Duterte’s visit comes just weeks after Netanyahu welcomed Viktor Orban, Hungary’s four-time prime minister who was criticised last year for praising Miklos Horthy, Hungary’s World War II-era ruler and a Nazi collaborator.Mr Orban was also accused of employing anti-Semitic tropes against George Soros, a Jewish Hungarian-American billionaire philanthropist, during his re-election campaign. During Mr Orban’s visit to Israel in July, Mr\u0026nbspNetanyahu praised him for combatting anti-semitism.Mr Netanyahu was also criticised for striking a deal with Polish President Andrzej Duda over his country’s controversial Holocaust speech law, which would have criminalised blaming the Polish nation for crimes committed against Jews during World War II.Mr\u0026nbspDuterte, who assumed power 2016, did little to assuage fears on Sunday when he kicked off his four-day tour of Israel with a rambling expletive-ladened speech to members of the Filipino community in Jerusalem.During the hour-long talk he justified comments made on Thursday that the high rape rate in a Philippine city was due to the number of “beautiful women”. And he apologised for calling former US president Barack Obama a “son of a whore”.Duterte defended by spokespersonIn 2016, Mr Duterte drew worldwide anger when he said he would kill as many drug addicts as Hitler did Jews, adding “I’d be happy to slaughter them”. \u0026nbspIn the same speech he had also claimed three million Jews were killed in the Holocaust, half the number agreed by historians. The president later apologised, saying he had been misunderstood.But his comments were not forgotten in Israel. Left-leaning daily Haaretz\u0026nbspon Monday published an editorial headlined “A Hitler admirer at Yad Vashem,” while The Times of Israel asked why Israel was “opening its doors” to Mr Duterte in a piece entitled “this man has no place in our country”. Left-wing politicians, meanwhile, questioned why Mr Netanyahu wanted to “whitewash an illegitimate leader”.He “took pride in massacring his citizens and violating human rights… so why?” Tamar Zandberg, head of the leftist Meretz party, wrote on Facebook.“Because Duterte is willing to support the occupation (of the West Bank),” she said.The most controversial quotes from Rodrigo Duterte“These sons of whores are destroying our children.

In the past he has joked about wanting to rape an Australian national who was killed during a prison riot in 1989, he called Pope Francis a “son of a whore” for causing a traffic jam in the capital Manilla, and labelled God a “son of bitch”.He has also advised citizens not to wear condoms despite an HIV crisis, forcibly kissed a woman on stage and told soldiers to shoot female rebels in the vagina.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/139/590x/lewis-1012920.jpg","title":"brexit leave eu arron banks blackballed brandon lewis conservatives","story":"Brandon Lewis is being asked to explain the blackballing of Arron Banks from the Conservative party (Image: )Insurance tycoon Mr Banks, a former Ukip donor who bankrolled the unofficial leave campaign, said the decision sends a message that Brexiteers are not welcome in the Tory party.Mr Banks, along with his spin doctor Andy \u0026ldquoWiggy Wigmore, had sought to join the Tories in North West Leicestershire, the constituency of Brexit-backing MP Andrew Bridgen.Leave.EU has launched a push for its supporters to join the Conservative Party to back a Brexiteer candidate in any leadership contest to replace Theresa May.But a Conservative Party spokesman said: Arron Banks and Andy Wigmore\u0027s applications for membership of the Conservative Party have not been accepted.\u0026nbsp                \u0027Put Verhofstadt in detention\u0027 British MEP mocks \u0026lsquoEuromeddler\u0026rsquo                Brexiteer RIDICULES Theresa May\u0027s Chequers with BRILLIANT pointMr Bridgen, a prominent critic of Mrs May\u0027s leadership, said his local Conservative association was seeking a written explanation from Mr Lewis as to why the two men were being blackballed.He told the Press Association: I think it\u0027s only right there\u0027s a written explanation of why Arron Banks - who was a member of the Conservative Party until 2013 and a donor - and Andy Wigmore are being blackballed.Just saying \u0027we\u0027re going to reject their membership\u0027, that\u0027s not how it works and it\u0027s not how it should work.You can\u0027t just blackball people because the current leadership don\u0027t like them or feel they might be a threat.Mr Banks and Mr Wigmore are two of the self-styled Bad Boys of Brexit, with close links to former Ukip leader Nigel Farage.Leave.EU has launched a campaign to unite the right and persuade the Conservative grassroots they need a new Brexit leader to replace Mrs May.

He had shot them with his fathers rifle, then made it look like his sister had done it.The White House Farm murders were one of the most brutal in UK history.Jeremy, then 24, savagely murdered his adoptive parents, Nevill and June Bamber, his adopted sister Sheila Caffell and her six-year-old twin sons Daniel and Nicholas - with his fathers gun.The murders are now the focus of an ITV drama, White House Farm - which will air in 2019 - starring Freddie Fox as Jeremy and Prince Harrys former girlfriend Cressida Bonas as his doomed adoptive sister Sheila - a schizophrenic model nicknamed Bambi.Jeremy was jailed for 25 years but still maintains his innocence - and had appealed his conviction several times.Here Sun Online takes a look at the real story behind the crimes that shocked the nation and remain controversial 33 years on.On 6th August 1985, police received a call from a distressed Jeremy, then aged 24.He said hed received a phone call from his dad Nevill about his adopted sister Sheila going berserk with a gun - and that the line had gone dead in the middle of the call.Jeremy - who had been adopted by the family as a baby - met officers at the home, saying his sister was a nutter who knew how to use guns.Police were confronted by a massacre. First, they discovered the body of Nevill, 61, next to the AGA - he had been shot eight times and had head injuries.On the upstairs landing lay his wife June - shed been shot between her eyes.Sheila lay in the bedroom with two bullet wounds to the throat and a rifle across her body - leading the police officers to initially believe shed killed her family then herself.Her six-year-old twins Daniel and Nicholas were in the next room, both having been shot several times in the head.Officers thought they knew the truth - Sheila, in a psychotic episode, had killed her family then herself.Her mental health struggles were well-documented in the press over the following weeks - a model, whose marriage to husband Colin had broken down, shed received treatment for paranoid schizophrenia and anorexia.At first, police accepted that Sheila was responsible for the killingsAs well as taking anti-psychotic medicine, she was snorting cocaine - racking up drug debts of £40,000 - and sleeping with older men.Her relationship with her adoptive parents had been strained. It seemed logical she was the killer.But it wasnt long before cracks started to appear in their theories.Detectives started to wonder if a slim woman who was fatigued from anti-psychotics could really overpower and kill her 6 foot 4 well-built father.Then, at the funeral, Jeremys extended family said hed cracked smutty jokes and gave a chilling, big grin.He also acted over-the-top: falling on his knees and howling in front of the TV microphones.Soon after, Jeremy split with his girlfriend Julie Mugford and new evidence came to light.Julie told the police hed rung her on the night of the murders to say its tonight or never and that hed been plotting to kill his family for 18 months.Jeremy was arrested on 8 September, denying everything and accusing his ex-girlfriend of being angry about their breakup.Privately-educated Jeremy was no stranger to criminal activity - a few weeks before the murders he robbed the family business, making it look like an inside job.And when travelling around Australia and New Zealand, he stole from a jewellery shop. He also boasted about smuggling heroin.His extended family, who inherited the family fortune, said Jeremy often provoked his parents - starting arguments and even hiding a bag of live rats in his fathers secretarys car.There had been tension leading up to the killings: Nevill told ious people, including his secretary, that he foresaw a shooting accident.Police became more and more suspicious.The rifles silencer was found in a cupboard on the farm by Jeremys cousins and it was noted that Sheila wouldnt have been able to place it there after shooting herself.Sheilas feet were also clean - if shed gone on a rampage they would have been blood-stained. Photos of Jeremys feet showed blood on them.The bedroom phone was found plugged into the kitchen socket - something experts say Sheila would have been unlikely to have done during a psychotic episode.There are an estimated 75 prisoners serving whole life terms in UK prisons at present, while others have passed away in jail.Five notable criminals sentenced to life imprisonment include:Jeremy was finally charged with the murder of all his family members a month later.Described by his trial judge as evil beyond belief, Jeremy was found guilty by the jury on a ratio of 10-2 - and sentenced to 25 years - extending to a whole life order in 1994.He has been in HM Prison Wakefield ever since.But despite the evidence, many of Jeremys supporters believe he is innocent - and that Shelia committed the gruesome mass murder.They say that the blood on his feet was that of a rabbits - and that the police destroyed evidence.Bob Woffinden, an expert in miscarriages of justice, previously believed Sheila was the killer.However, he changed his mind in 2011, when researching the theory about the house phone.After reading numerous police reports, his theory is that on the evening of the murders, the first thing Jeremy did was to take the kitchen phone off the hook, disabling every phone in the house.Bob believed Jeremy was wearing a wetsuit to avoid getting his clothes covered with bloodstains, and shot the children with his fathers rifle first.But when his father tried to call the police from the bedside phone, he wouldnt have been able to.Jeremy then shot Nevill before battering him to death with the rifle butt. He then shot his mother and sister.Bob says Jeremy needed to direct one bullet at a precise angle to Sheilas throat to make it look like a suicide. But the first didnt kill her, so he shot her again.This was a mistake - if it was suicide she couldnt have shot herself twice.After showering in the wetsuit - which he later disposed of - he got dressed before plugging the bedroom phone into the kitchen socket.If Sheila had killed her family and herself, she couldnt have rearranged the phones.This is the final piece of evidence in the case for Jeremys guilt, and Bobs theory has been accepted by many experts.  However, Jeremys supporters, who include MPs and campaigner Peter Tatchell, say the case is one of the worst miscarriages of justice in British history - and the website calling for his release has a forum where hundreds of people attempt to prove his innocence.But with his last appeal bid being rejected six years ago, Jeremy seems destined to spend the rest of his life in prison.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Far left Trotskyite infiltrators — operating under the banner of the Militant Tendency — took over the city council.Under the leadership of the charismatic but confrontational Derek Hatton they were set on purging traditional Labour voices and creating Moscow on the Mersey.They ramped up tension between the city and central Government by playing politics with council jobs.Their antics provoked then Labour leader Neil Kinnock into giving one of his most famous speeches when he condemned the “grotesque chaos” of a Labour Council sending redundancy notices to its own workers by taxi. Eventually, the moderates won, Militant was defeated and the city was saved.But now, fast forward 33 years and another titanic struggle for the future of Labour is being played out in Merseyside.Veteran Labour MP Frank Field who was the target of Militant in the Eighties, has sensationally been thrown out of the party he’s served all his life after resigning the whip in protest at the rise of the new extremists.But this time it’s not just Liverpool that’s being taken over by the hard Left but the Labour Party itself.And instead of Labour’s leader mounting a fightback for moderation, as Neil Kinnock did, the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn is the heart of the problem.Corbyn will be in Liverpool later this month for Labour’s own party conference — where the fate of the party may be decided.Will it cement victory for the new militants, now calling themselves Momentum, or be the moment that we get, in every sense, the opposition we need?I’ve known Frank for many years and he’s Labour to the core.He’s dedicated his life to fighting poverty. He has been a tough critic of my party and speaks with the moral authority of someone whose whole life has been given to serving the poorest.He pursued Philip Green over the collapse of BHS and got millions back for the company’s pensioners.But because Frank is an authentic spokesman for working people, including on issues like Brexit, he’s been targeted by the new militants who want everyone to follow Comrade Corbyn’s rigid party line.Frank is also heir to the Old Labour tradition of fighting racism and intolerance wherever it comes from. A war baby, he cherishes the role Labour played in defeating fascism. So when he takes such a stand against the party he loves, and does so citing the leader’s own complicity in anti-Semitism, then this is an alarm bell no-one can ignore.Other Merseyside MPs including Luciana Berger and Louise Ellman have also spoken out against rising anti-Semitism and intolerance within Labour ranks and the abuse they have received is truly shocking.The question now must be, will others follow Frank?With not just local parties, but the leadership itself, implacably in the grip of the hard Left, can moderates stay, and thus lend cover and credibility to the current leader?Labour was the party, when Frank was a boy, which helped create the state of Israel as a homeland for the Jewish people, which helped build Nato as a bulwark of Western values and which put the interests of working people first.Now that Labour’s leadership is criticised by our own Chief Rabbi for its attitude to Israel and the Jewish community, now that Labour has a leader who doesn’t believe in Nato and a strong defence, now that Labour is more interested in single-issue protest than building a better future for workers, can the majority of Labour’s MPs, who are decent, hard-working and moderate, really stay?Frank is right to shine a light on the issue of anti-Semitism. And not just because it is truly horrendous that, after the horrors unleashed in the 20th Century, this intolerance should return.But also because attitudes towards the Jewish community are the best indicator of how free and progressive a country is.Throughout history, the countries where Jewish people have felt safest, like the Netherlands and the UK, have been among the world’s freest.Countries where Jewish people have faced growing prejudice, like Germany and Russia during the last century, have been countries slipping into darkness.And as the Chief Rabbi has reminded us, what starts with prejudice against Jewish people spreads to taint society more widely.The Jewish community is the canary in the coal mine.And if our democracy is to stay strong then we need to have political parties that are broad-based social movements and not increasingly ideological sects.I am a Tory but I grew up to admire and respect the patriotic Labour tradition of people like Clement Attlee, Ernie Bevin, Jim Callaghan, Peter Shore, Barbara Castle and Frank Field.I wish him well and hope that his bravery will prove the wake-up call his party and the country needs to ensure there’s a sensible party of the centre left once more.NO more heroes any more, the Stranglers sang. Well, they reckoned without Lewis Pugh, a man whose grit, endurance, idealism and dedication make him the very model of a modern hero.Lewis is the endurance swimmer who powered his way into the record books this week by covering the length of the English Channel – from Land’s End to Dover – in 50 days.He covered the 330 miles – past the Eddystone Lighthouse, the Isle of Wight and Dungeness Power station – in just Speedos, cap and goggles.In stormy waters, sometimes swimming in the dead of night, through rain and high winds, with shoulder injuries, jellyfish stings and treacherous currents to slow him down, Lewis triumphed in a trial of character and cojones, which takes the breath away.But what drove Lewis on was not a desire to etch his name in the record books.It was a swelling passion for our seas, the wildlife in them and the future of our planet.In our own waters, and across the globe, the seas have suffered as a result of past exploitation, the growing danger from climate change, acidification and the rising tide of plastic waste.We have an opportunity to change that now.Leaving the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy means we can have a more sustainable approach to managing the fish in our seas.And reducing our reliance on single-use plastics, as well as improving recycling, can stem the flow of waste into our seas.But there is still more to do and making sure that more of the Earth’s surface is protected from exploitation is critical.Lewis records that during the length of his swim he encountered jellyfish in abundance, happy to bask in our warming waters, but far fewer fish, dolphins and other marine wildlife than he would have expected.As another modern hero, Sir David Attenborough, has reminded us, our Blue Planet is a precious but fragile place and we all have a responsibility to think about our impact on our seas.But the good news is that more and more people in Britain are cutting down on plastic, recycling more and helping nature recover, which is heroic in itself.The tech giant is planning to co-operate with China to censor material online.But it won’t respond to calls from the UK, US and others to co-operate in removing horrific images of abuse.The company’s motto used to be “Don’t be evil” but that was dropped earlier this year. Now we know why.I’M not surprised Prince Harry burst into song – albeit briefly – when he and wife Meghan met the cast of hit musical Hamilton.The hip-hop lyrics are infectiously catchy, so much so the Gove family often sing along to them in the car.And a musical about breaking free from an overbearing and distant overlord who doesn’t govern in your interests does have a special resonance for us.Happily, she accepted and will presumably now promise to forsake all udders.SAD to see the lovely Kirsty Young having to take a break from Desert Island Discs to battle fibromyalgia.This terrible condition – marked by chronic pain and extreme fatigue – has no ready cure.It can strike any of us down, casting a shadow over even the simplest pleasures.I hope Kirsty recovers soon ­– and I also hope that the light shone on this illness hastens progress towards a cure.Almost everything you need for a healthy, balanced diet can be sourced from British farms and fishermen.And you know it will have been caught or grown in a way that respects the environment.Instead of our diet going south, why not save on the food miles and help the planet by buying British?THE return of Strictly to our screens this autumn divides the Gove household. But not in the way you might think.My wife can’t stand the show and my daughter cringes at it – but my son and I are hooked.We’ve cheered on Ed Balls’ Gangnam Style and rooted for Susan Calman last year.This year I think Casualty actor Charles Venn and Paralympian Lauren Steadman could become popular favourites.But no, I won’t be harbouring dreams of joining in.

They trust our laws and our financial services, they admire our Armed Forces and they envy our universities.Actually, that’s not quite true: everywhere I go in the world, except right here in the UK.There are some who can’t or won’t see the natural advantages we have and the opportunities that exist for us. I get frustrated when some people purposefully choose to ignore good news such as last week when China opened up their market to UK dairy products.Britain can and should be confident and the world needs a confident Britain.A confident Britain can bang the drum for free trade across the world, as more and more countries look to pull up the drawbridge and turn away from the huge benefits that we have seen in poverty alleviation.A confident Britain can work with African countries to tackle extremism and instability which threatens millions of people across the world, including right here in the UK, as the Prime Minister promised to do this week.A confident Britain with an independent seat at the World Trade Organisation can be a leading voice for free trade and prosperity.A confident Britain is good for the world, and it’s good for us at home too. Why?Because free trade means we can sell more world-class British goods and services across the globe. That means safeguarding and creating jobs as well generating revenues for the Treasury to spend on our vital public services.That’s why I launched the Export Strategy last month: to turn the UK into a 21st Century exporting superpower.We need to work together to ­create a more confident Britain that can export to the world.To do that, we need to support business the length and breadth of the whole UK.Over 99 per cent of our businesses are small or medium-sized, and 96 per cent are micro-sized, employing fewer than nine people.That means many thousands of Sun on Sunday readers either own one or work for one.You are the lifeblood of our economy — it’s your entrepreneurship, risk-taking and innovation that drives the entire economy.It’s your wealth creation that provides the income we all depend on for our public services, from funding our NHS to paying our brave Armed Forces.It also means that you might not be exporting — yet — because more than 90 per cent of companies aren’t currently seizing the opportunities of exporting.That’s where we can help.Government doesn’t manufacture products and doesn’t provide services for exporting.But we can help create the right conditions by intervening where only government can.We have created a network of Her Majesty’s Trade Commissioners to lead the Government’s trade and investment promotion and policy in high-growth regions across the world.And I as International Trade Secretary can step in and speak to foreign ministers about overcoming a trade barrier — as I did last week, when I signed a deal in Beijing to enable the UK to export seed potatoes to China or help a UK company close a deal in an overseas market or seal a partnership with a foreign company.And to support British businesses — whether they produce farm products, or manufacture playgrounds, or provide legal services — we are also creating a network of Export Champions, people who run businesses that successfully export, to guide their peers and share their expertise.As I’ve often said before, in the next ten to 15 years, around 90 per cent of global economic growth is expected to be outside the EU.I truly believe that Brexit is an ­opportunity.The positive response and engagement we’ve seen from the EU negotiators to the Chequers proposals makes me believe that a good deal is now more likely.At Chequers the Government agreed its proposal for an economic partnership with the EU after the UK leaves on March 29, 2019.It confirmed that the UK will leave the Single Market and the Customs Union and will seize new opportunities from trading with the rest of the world.That’s why the Prime Minister visited Africa, one of the fastest-growing regions in the world, this week.It’s why I visited China last week, and am visiting India later in the autumn, to ensure Britain can make the most of their breakneck growth.Booming countries across the globe are confident in Britain.They’re confident in our crucial role in supporting world prosperity, world security and world growth.If they have faith in us, we need to have more faith. Because a more confident Britain is a better Britain for the world.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They want our politicians to get on with it.Mrs May has also claimed that she is going to start focusing on her domestic agenda. About time.Away from Twitter and Westminster, voters aren’t worried about the latest Project Fear smear.They care about the NHS, schools, being able to afford a home, and money in their pockets.Mrs May said she was the PM for the “Just About Managings”.

As with most of her premiership, Mrs May mustered her best in an awkward situation.This approach helps explain why a poll shows that Tory voters believe she is the figure who can unite Britain, ahead of other leadership prospects.Meanwhile, Liam Fox writes on this page that Britain should be confident going forward as an independent nation.There might finally be light at the end of the Brexit tunnel.IT is shocking that schools are calling for pupils to bring in loo roll because of cuts.Others are cancelling lessons and closing early.

He knows now.Last week, Field quit the Labour Party whip amid a barrage of “intolerance, nastiness and intimidation” from Corbyn outriders over his stand against anti-Semitism.Along with other moderate Labour MPs, he was battered by Twitter storms using the vilest language to wish him dead.Field bluntly accuses Jeremy Corbyn of racism and hints he is ready to force a by-election if kicked out of the Labour Party. Others facing deselection may follow suit.Leadership critics have endured relentless bullying and abuse, a trademark of the brutal machine which swept Jezza to power and intends to keep him there. As Frank Field himself now admits, Corbyn is going nowhere.The party might split but the ageing hippy “will lead Labour into the next election”. Corbyn’s sullen anti-Semitism triggered this revolt, but it is only a symptom of the sinister nature of hard-Left politics which brooks no criticism.Labour really is the Nasty Party. Jezza’s pro-Russian, anti-capitalist malcontents loathe everything the UK and other Western democracies stand for.They support some of the world’s most brutal tyrannies and catastrophic economies while railing against free speech and Press freedom.Corbyn sees no evil in these repressive forces and this week shelved an invitation from MI5 chiefs to show him the secret intelligence. On such evidence alone, it is fair to say Corbyn as PM would permanently damage this country, its freedoms and its prosperity.We knew all this when Ed Miliband threw open the party’s leadership to anyone with three quid to buy a vote. Thanks to his stunning act of stupidity, the “broad church” Labour Party of Clem Attlee, Hugh Gaitskell, John Smith and Tony Blair is history.It lives on in name only, an empty husk colonised by Momentum parasites who once fought the party they now own. Corbyn didn’t even want the job, telling supporters: “You’d better make f***ing sure I don’t win.”When he surprised himself by storming to victory in 2015, shell-shocked Blairite MPs assumed they could get rid of him if he stepped too far out of line.They tried that in 2016 — turning Jezza into the unassailable champion of the loony Left and handing over the keys to the asylum. Theresa May bolted him in place with her botched General Election. No wonder the Glastonbury millennials cooed: “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn.”Have we learned from Frank Field’s mistake? Or do we believe, as he did, voters will never be silly enough to give Corbyn the keys to power? Well, look at the polls. They show nobody much rates Jezza, but Labour remains neck and neck with the Tories.Theresa May has yet to navigate her way to a tricky Brexit deal with Brussels — or to a no-deal rejected by Commons Remainers. She has rightly turned her face against a second referendum, a democratic abomination.But who knows who will be leader by then? Boris Johnson is circling, helped by a growing team of sponsors and supporters. Mrs May would do anything to stop BoJo. She is even seeking official advice on another snap election gamble. Good luck with that, Theresa. But Remainers should be careful what they wish for.Corbyn, a fervent fan of arch-Eurosceptic Tony Benn, loathes the EU as much as the angry Labour supporters who voted Leave. But he would conveniently bury that hatred for the time being if it meant riding a Remainer wave into Downing Street.Pro-Brussels campaigner Keir Starmer would emerge, not for the first time, as a “useful idiot”.The Purge will have just begun.At a media event before his referendum, the ex-oil analyst confidently bet the price would not crash below 50 a barrel. It did. He sent me my winnings but they apparently went astray.So he offered double-or-quits. The price stayed below 50 for yet another year – and is still only a bit higher today.

She says we can leave in a safe and orderly manner through the Chequers plan or we can leave dangerously and chaotically if we don’t agree a departure deal with Europe.In truth, there are other choices. We could surrender less sovereignty by proposing a conventional trade agreement, as Davis suggested in a white paper that was rejected by the PM.But his proposal was never published, and Davis is now on the backbenches.We could join the European Economic Area, like Norway, leaving us subject to European laws, including free movement, and paying into the Brussels budget.Advocates, including the Tory MP Nick Boles, say this would buy us time to sort out our long-term relationship with Europe, but we would risk getting stuck half-in, half-out of the EU for years.Whatever the merits of his case, however, Boles is a backbench MP who cannot impose policy on the Government.Because Theresa May is the Prime Minister, Chequers is the only policy on the table. But Chequers, as bad as it already is, will not be the final deal.Downing Street insiders insist it is “obtainable” without further compromises, while the PM says she will not accept compromises “that are not in our national interest”. But this is the problem: There will be further compromises, which come on top of an already flawed proposal.And this is hardly a surprise, because Chequers is unacceptable to the Europeans.The EU’s number one rule is that the “four freedoms” of its single market — in goods, services, people and capital — cannot be divided.And yet Chequers — as unacceptable as it is to British Eurosceptics — seeks to divide these four freedoms.Britain is effectively asking to stay in the single market for trade in goods but not in services, people and capital.If we want what we have proposed for goods, the Europeans will say we must accept the other obligations.As part of an agreement about services, they will insist on Britain accepting more EU laws and a greater role for the European Court.They are likely to demand financial contributions and access to British waters for their fishing industry.And while they might not call it free movement, they will insist on concessions that grant Europeans almost automatic access to the British labour market.This prediction is not plucked out of thin air. It is based on decades of EU policymaking, and everything European leaders and their negotiators have said since the referendum.It is reflected in the EU’s own negotiating guidelines, issued to the European Commission by the Council of Ministers.And it is why, in her Lancaster House speech last year, Theresa May ruled out single market membership.Having to accept its obligations, she said, “would to all intents and purposes mean not leaving the EU at all”.And yet this is the danger we now face. According to several Government sources, the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, is “itching” to make a “generous offer” on immigration. Some believe he wants to retain free movement rules, because he says we cannot get a good trade deal unless we do so.Theresa May, on the other hand, is adamant that free movement must end.But whether or not we are legally part of EU free movement rules, the question is whether her deal will regain full control of immigration to Britain. And what we know already is alarming.There is nothing wrong with allowing tourists to come here easily, students to attend British universities and business people to travel without bureaucracy.Nor is there a problem with firms moving their workers across borders quickly and easily to provide services.And it makes sense to give Europeans preferential access to Britain compared to people from further away.But few ministers care about reducing immigration, and the Chequers white paper is remarkably open about the options. It proposes, for example, a “youth mobility scheme” that would give young Europeans the right to live and work in Britain for fixed periods.Without strict limits, this alone could destroy meaningful immigration control, because most people who want to migrate are young.Around 64 per cent of EU migrants to Britain are under 30, while 86 per cent are younger than 40.The white paper suggests “other specific mobility areas”, without giving further details. It proposes “social security coordination” which might allow migrants to claim benefits for children living back home in countries like Poland.And it says nothing about our ability to deport or bar European criminals from Britain.Most worryingly, there is no proposal for a visa system for European workers.Without that, unskilled and low-skilled immigration will continue without limit.It does not need to be like this.We are discussing these unacceptable compromises because Chequers proposes partial membership of the EU’s single market.If we want to escape Europe’s laws, its court and its demands for our money — and if we want to control immigration — the Government needs to revive its plans for a free trade agreement, and it needs to do so urgently.Unless it does, Brexit will not mean Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And we can see big advantages if he fancies staying on for another year after his scheduled leaving date next June.The financial markets will need all the consistency and stability they can get as we exit the EU next March. Changing the head of the Bank of England won’t help.The Canadian is a serious figure. Keeping him at the helm would offer a welcome degree of calm.But he will also need a laser-like focus on helping to supercharge our economy for a new era of pioneering independence, with low interest rates and inflation combined with lower taxes.He will need to ensure the world knows Britain is open for business.Our economy is ticking along despite all the uncertainty produced by foolish Remainer doom-mongering. Imagine the massive boost to growth ready to be unleashed once we know for sure what Brexit looks like.Forget Project Fear . . . if he stays, Mr Carney can be in charge of Project Hope.HE has played 160 Tests, made 12,254 runs and hit 32 tons — all England records.Alastair Cook is not the showiest batsman we’ve ever had.

Most of my family have.His dad was first sent away when James was nine, and his cousin, who is the same age as him, has recently been handed a lengthy prison sentence for stabbing someone.And having been arrested five times already - all for small things - James fears that it wont be long until he ends up joining his dad.That is, unless he can get a job and break the cycle... but, as many of James peers are finding out, Redcar isnt bursting with the same opportunities it once had.The once-thriving port town is now short of work following the closing of the Teeside steelworks in 2015.Over 3,000 jobs vanished - and repercussions from the loss of income are being felt throughout the town.For 16-year-old Kaitlyn, the upcoming school prom is a far more immediate concern than finding work.However, prom is an expensive business, and her mum, Kat, has found it so hard to find a full-time job in the town that she currently holds down three different part-time positions.The relentless combination of energy bills, council tax, and food costs - plus the prospect of Kaitlyn going to university in the not-too-distant future - mean she can sometimes end up working 75-hour weeks just to make ends meet.Then, a couple of years ago, after splitting from Kaitlyns dad, the pressures became too much for Kat to bear.I was in this dark place on the weekends when Kaitlyn was out with her dad, she says on BBC2s The Mighty Redcar.I went out with my friends and started drinking loads. She even had to dress me one day, and I just thought: thats it.Kat found herself relying on a food bank to survive, and was spurred on to throw herself into work.With Kaitlyns prom looming, Kat, who works as a cook and a carer, has been putting away £10 a week for the whole year, just to spend on the dress.It means that when the end of term comes around, she can afford to splash out on a stunning £600 gown for her daughter, but the biggest financial challenge is yet to come.Drama-loving Kaitlyn is currently studying musical theatre at a college in Middlesbrough, and she is already making a name for herself as an up-and-coming performer.Although Kat is concerned about the £9,000-a-year fees, Kaitlyn hopes that she can eventually go to uni in Manchester, Liverpool, or at RADA - the prestigious acting academy in London.Despite Redcar always being my home there are just more opportunities in the big cities, Kaitlyn tells Sun Online.I never faced any problems growing up in Redcar. I had everything I needed.I know I’ll be happy as soon as I go but I’ll miss my mum, dad and all my family.Kat and Kaitlyns story is fairly typical for Redcar - a town where no matter where you go, you never seem able to escape the shadow cast by the abandoned metalworks.The North Yorkshire coastal town used to be a manufacturing hub and a busting holiday destination, with a sprawling beachfront and a lively fishing industry to boot.Its enormous steelworks were staffed by hard-working local people, and world-renowned steel made in Redcar was used to build the iconic bridges over the river Tyne and Sydney Harbour.But as the 2010s approached, global steel prices slumped, production left the UK, and in 2015 the towns furnaces were shut down forever - sending over 3,000 jobs up in smoke.Long before then, cheap overseas holidays had stunted the towns tourism industry, and declines in the fishing industry gutted the areas other big profession.But although everyone always talks about the steel leaving the town, its clear that the locals still have it in spades.People are also quick to look out for each other, and four volunteer-run food banks have recently opened in Redcar to combat the job losses from the collapse of the steel industry.Weve only got one Costa coffee though, says the shows narrator, local student Madison Cooper. I guess that says a lot.Kat says its the people of Redcar who make the town a great place to live.Were very proud to be from Redcar, she tells Sun Online.Some people get down, and theres some negativity, but there are always people there to support and help each other. That makes Redcar. Theres a community feel to the place.Im proud as punch of my daughter and Im proud as punch of Redcar.In James case, theres been no shortage of help in his job search. Hes being personally mentored by council worker Lynn and local businessman Ray.Thanks to Rays efforts, James lands a weeks trial at a gardening firm on the first episode of the show.Hes grateful for the cash, but hes earning just £20 a day. Just a few years ago, manual workers in Redcars steelworks could have expected a comfortable salary of over £30,000 a year.I want a job, says an exasperated James. I want a regular income. I want a career and a quiet life.Redcars population is falling by the year as people leave to look for better jobs but, for the 35,000 people who are left behind, it can feel like theyve been, well... left behind.Now, documentary series The Mighty Redcar has captured the reality of growing up in a proud British town ravaged by job losses, economic pressures and globalisation.Billed as a real-life soap, the show follows young people from the town over the course of a year as they chase their dreams of making it big - or at least carving out a living for themselves and their families.But with unemployment at 8.3 per cent , Redcar isnt the easiest place to find a job, let alone a career.The steel, tourism and fishing jobs may be all gone forever, but the people of Redcar do still have their work ethic and optimism to fall back on.One of the most determined characters in the whole town is 23-year-old Dylan, an aspiring musician who moved to Redcar when he was 15.In and out of the foster system for his whole life, he left his biological family as a teenager to live with his childhood foster mum, Wendy, who chose to live in Redcar because she wanted to be by the sea.When I came to school here I was the only black kid, Dylan says. You dont get many big black guys with afros in Redcar.Choosing to leave his family behind was tough, but Dylan said he had to leave his old home for the sake of his safety.To me, Redcar is everything, he says. It became my Mecca - a safe place where I can live my life.Im unbelievably lucky to not be on drugs, in jail or dead.The dream is to make a living and never have to work in a bar or call centre again.For a while, Dylan worked as a bartender in a Wetherspoons, but his real passion has always been for hip-hop music.Every night after work, he would spend hours locked away in his bedroom, writing and recording songs, which he performed at weekend gigs in nearby pubs and clubs.His hope was always that he could make it big and take his 15-year-old brother out of foster care and bring him to Redcar to live with him.Then, at the end of the documentary, Dylan is invited to the Universal Music HQ in London.After being scouted at a gig, producers have spotted his talent and want to offer him a record deal - which should pay for a flat he can rent with his brother.Many of his peers may still be struggling to find meaningful work, but Dylans story is proof that theres always hope - and it goes to show that the mettle never really left the Mighty Redcar.The Mighty Redcar airs on Thursday at 9pm on BBC2. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It raked across the western part of the largest main island, Honshu, near the city of Kobe, several hours later, heading rapidly north.Evacuation advisories were issued for more than 1 million people as the wind and rain began picking up, the Fire and Disaster Management Agency said.Our house is right at the base of a mountain, so its a little dangerous and we decided to leave, one woman told NHK.Footage showed waves pounding the coastline, sheet metal tumbling across a parking lot and a truck turned on its side.Kobe residents posted on Twitter that the wind was shaking their apartment buildings and ripping branches off trees.Around 3.9 inches of rain drenched one part of the tourist city of Kyoto in an hour, with as much 20 inches set to fall in some areas in the 24 hours to noon on Wednesday.Video posted on Twitter showed a small part of the roof of Kyoto train station falling to the ground.Shinkansen bullet train services between Tokyo and Hiroshima were suspended and Universal Studios Japan, a popular amusement park near Osaka, was closed.Toyota Motor Corp said it was cancelling the night shift at 14 plants.The capital, Tokyo, will be far from the centre of the storm but was set for heavy rains and high winds by the end of Tuesday.Jebis course has brought it close to parts of western Japan hit by rains and flooding that killed more than 200 people in July.However, it was set to speed up after making landfall, minimising the amount of rain that will fall in one place."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000429650941-e1536056394987.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"british airways cabin crew smoke hoods toxic fumes nice flight","story":"Airline staff were forced to wear breathing apparatus for 20 minutes on a terrifying flight from Heathrow to France, which sparked emergency checks.Stunned families were left without any protection and fearing for their safety after a toxic stench circulated the cabin.Passengers watched the crew staggering around while the overhead oxygen masks werent released as they are only deployed when a plane suddenly loses cabin pressure.The drama unfolded on Flight BA354 from Heathrow to Nice on August 26.It was the fourth fume event to hit BA flights in a single day - as airline bosses are worried about damaging payouts.A cabin crew member told The Sun: Wearing one of those smoke hoods is probably the most terrifying thing crew have to do every year at recruit training.“It threw me into utter panic after about 30 seconds with it on, but the fear factor soars up in the clouds in a real life scenario when no one knows what’s going on.“The hoods heat up as the chemical reaction to create oxygen kicks in.One source added: “Panic set in because of course passengers were worrying about their own safety.But there was nothing for them.A series of emergency checks were carried out and the flight landed safely - before the crew on the flight were signed off as unfit to work.There were three other fume events declared on BA flights on the same day.Meanwhile, two cabin crew on board another BA plane were taken to hospital amid fears they had been exposed to dangerous fumes.Dramatic scenes broke out when the stewardesses fell ill, complaining of nausea from the contaminated airThey were taken to Redhill Hospital near Gatwick airport, Sussex after the BA flight touched down from Genoa.The BA crew were checked for carbon monoxide poisoning before being released.BA bosses paid for their transport to and from hospital.The Airbus A320 was taken out of service following the flight on August 31 while further checks were carried out.Airline bosses are terrified at the prospect of legal claims costing billions of pounds following the suggestion that passengers and crew have fallen ill and even died as a result of fume events on jets.Research is ongoing as scientists examine the effects on passengers and crew breathing in stale recycled cabin air and leaked jet engine fumes.Toxic fumes on board planes were believed to be behind the death of BA pilot Richard Westgate, according to him and his family.The pilot from Edinburgh, who died in December 2012 aged 43, suffered years of ill health including severe headaches, mental confusion, sight problems and insomnia which he claimed were caused by exposure to toxic chemicals on board planes he flew for the airline.The inquest into his death stated overdose as the cause but acknowledged that the fumes in the plane caused “consequential damage” to frequent flyers.The families of pilots Matt Bass, 34, and Karen Lysakowska, 43, and BA steward Warren Brady, 46, believe they all died as a result of being exposed to toxic fumes while working for the airline.Research by Stirling University published last year in the World Health Organisation journal Public Health Panorama found 88 per cent of pilots knew they were exposed to contaminated air and 80 per cent of incidents involving toxic fumes took place when the aircraft was preparing for or in flight.On their website the Civil Aviation Authority acknowledges the issue of aero toxicity.It states: “There is strong evidence that some people experience acute symptoms as a consequence of fume events.Some of the chemical contaminants that are present during such events are irritant, and may cause itching or soreness of the eyes, nasal discharge, sore throat or coughing.Airline bosses said the BA pilot on the flight to Nice told passengers that crew were wearing hoods as a “precaution”.Passengers on the flight disembarked normally in France.Crews are invited to report fume events, BA insisted.A BA spokesman told The Sun: “The safety of our customers and crew is always our highest priority.Our flight landed normally and customers left the aircraft as usual.“As is always the case, our engineers made a full inspection of the aircraft before it was returned to service. We would not operate an aircraft if we believed it posed a health or safety risk to our customers or crew.“We always encourage our colleagues to report any potential safety incidents, no matter how minor, to allow us to investigate them.

Our soldiers are no longer fighting for Queen and Country but under a foreign military command.Our ancestors, the heroes of The Armada, Waterloo, Trafalgar, Passchendaele, El-Alamein, and others too numerous to mention, did not fight so that their descendants could serve under the flag of a foreign power.The sooner we are out of the EU, the sooner we will be able to rebuild our military into a force which serves the interests of our nation first and foremost.Meanwhile British men and women should vote with their feet and not join the armed forces.Defence sources ridiculed Ukips claim - pointing out that Britain has been part of the EU-led force in Bosnia for 14 years.They also said UK troops routinely carry the flag of multi-national organisations such as Nato or the UN on their uniform.A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: “It is untrue to suggest this is the first time our soldiers have worn EU badges, just as it is untrue to say they don’t wear the Union Flag.They have worn both since the mission in Bosnia And Herzegovina began in 2004, much like UN and Nato operations where the respective badges are on uniforms.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000386984549.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"eurocrats broke the rules to parachute jean claude junckers right hand man into top eu job a damning report finds","story":"Officials were found to not have followed proper procedure in letter or spirit when Martin Selmayr was promoted to become the blocs top civil servant.In an explosive attack on Mr Junckers top team, ombudsman Emily OReilly said there were four instances of maladministration in the process.Her scathing criticism intensified the scandal already engulfing Brussels over the elevation of Mr Selmayr, a powerful German Eurocrat.Nicknamed the “Monster of the Berlaymont”, in reference to the way he controls dealings at the building housing the EU’s headquarters, he has been a constant thorn in the UKs side on Brexit.And he was a shock pick for the job of Secretary-General of the European Commission earlier this year, with his appointment being savaged by democracy campaigners and MEPs.Senior figures in Brussels have repeatedly rebuffed calls for him to quit, but today’s report by Ms O’Reilly could change things, after she concluded they had created an artificial sense of urgency to shoehorn him Mr Selmayr into the role and was then evasive when questioned.She said: All of this risked jeopardising the hard won record of high EU administrative standards and consequently, the public trust.“The College of Commissioners collectively is responsible for the maladministration in this case.It is extraordinary that no Commissioner seemed to question the Secretary-General appointment procedure, which in the end raised valid widespread concerns.”Mr Selmayr took the top job overseeing 30,000 EU civil servants in March immediately following the surprise resignation of his predecessor.Dutch official Alexander Italianer suddenly retired with the German Eurocrat, then Mr Junckers head of cabinet, stepping straight into his role.Mr Selmayr was appointed deputy secretary-general for a matter of minutes before being immediately promoted again to the top job.There were no other candidates for the secretary-general role and the vacancy was not published, creating a furore about a stitch up.Ms OReilly said the Commission had failed to take appropriate measures to avoid the risk of a conflict of interests related to the swift handover.She added that when journalists questioned the surprise promotion, the bloc was defensive, evasive and at times combative in its response.In response to the report the EUs commissioner in charge of staffing, Gunther Oettinger, continued to defend the controversial appointment.He said: While we do not share all aspects of the underlying report, we welcome that the Ombudsman neither contests the legality of the appointment procedure of the Secretary-General, nor the choice of the candidate.On some aspects, where the Commission has a different factual assessment, we will provide further information to the Ombudsman in due course.But Ukip MEP Jonathan Bullock called Mr Selmayrs promotion a “coup as corrupt as it was efficient”.He added: “It was a total stitch up and it should not have taken over six months for the Ombudsman to reach that conclusion.The entire Commission has questions to answer as even Mrs OReilly stated it was extraordinary not one Commissioner raised any issues.

Should we turn around and have a look?’“So we turned round and pulled in at the side of the road, and watched it walk along until it went behind the hill.Photos snapped by Charlotte from the roadside show the creature prowling low in the bushes.Local legend says the Beast hunts mainly sheep — and has been known to leave mangled headless carcasses in its wake.Charlotte added: The pictures on my phone just don’t do justice to how big it looked when you saw it.“I’ve never come across anything like it before.“I live in Penrith and occasionally people will say they’ve seen something like this, but to actually see it for yourself is quite amazing.“I’ve always thought it was possible that we have them in Cumbria because the habitat and the land round here could probably sustain them quite well without them being seen regularly.”“If it had just been me I’d have been like, ‘No, don’t be silly’.But my mum was with me as well and we both saw it, and it made us stop.”The existence of big cats in the British countryside has long been rumoured — but experts are sceptical.In the past, lynxes and even one puma have been captured roaming the countryside.These are usually presumed to be escaped pets that had been kept illegally.But Cumbria Police have received dozens of sightings since 2003 — with many major sightings in each of the past three years.Since the extinction of the lynx in Britain between 450-600 AD, our island’s only confirmed remaining wildcat is the Scottish Wildcat — which resembles a domestic tabby."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT0004309654041.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jeremy corbyn urged to rule out a second brexit vote for good after his big union backer calls for a second eu referendum","story":"The GMB, who have handed over hundreds of thousands of pounds to the Labour leader and his party in the past few years, say people deserve a final say on the deal Theresa May brings back from Brussels.In a statement today they claim that promises made during the campaign in 2016 are “not the reality we are facing”.But the Tories are urging Mr Corbyn to “stand up to his union paymasters” and remain firm in his commitment to honour the original decision of the electorate.The GMB union said it had consulted thousands of its 620,000 members, and there was widespread support for holding another ballot once the negotiations are complete.Its general secretary Tim Roache said: Sitting on the sidelines watching the mess this Government is making of Brexit is infuriating, because there is so much at stake.GMB respects the result of the referendum, but how we leave the EU is as important as the decision to leave in the first place.“Thats why today, GMB is calling for a public vote on the final deal.As trade unionists, when we negotiate a pay deal with an employer, we go back to our members and ask them if theyre happy with it.

You have shown all of us what it means to be a champion – whether for yourself, your family, your community, or someone in need.The stories that we’ve all just heard – of resilience, strength of spirit, and the power of working together – were without doubt, incredibly moving and motivating.They really sum up what WellChild is all about – giving families the best chance to care for their children at home, and supporting them through the reality of all that that entails.The ceremony will celebrate the inspiring qualities of some of Britains sickest children and their carers.Winners this year include brave Matilda who is paralysed from the chest down and has endured more than 40 operations.She has been praised for her great zest for life and her courage, strength and determination.Also hailed as inspirational was Mckenzie, from Fife, who had to learn to speak, swallow, eat and drink and move again due to acute flaccid paralysis.She was praised for being there for other children when they are scared or sad.WellChild said: Despite his own problems Mckenzie cheers up everyone when they are low, and is guaranteed to put a smile on your face."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/raab-commons.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brexit secretary claims uk is making significant progress every week in eu negotiations","story":"Dominic Raab told MPs that despite Theresa May’s plan coming attack on all sides – including from Brussels’ chief Michel Barnier – he was bullish an agreement will be found.His update to MPs came as Downing Street revealed the Prime Minister will use a European Union meeting later this month to make the case for her Chequers compromise direct to fellow leaders.Mr Barnier has said he is strongly opposed to the proposals, which he warned would undermine the European project and the single market.But Mrs May’s official spokesman made it clear that despite the Frenchman being the public face of the talks, final approval of any Brexit deal is a matter for the heads of the remaining 27 countries.And the PM will join them for an informal session of the European Council in Austrian city Salzburg on September 20, and will use the opportunity to engage with individual leaders on the Brexit issue.It comes after Mr Raab told ministers at this morning’s Cabinet meeting that the Chequers proposals had received a warm and positive response from European leaders over the summer.And he rejected suggestions by opposition parties that they were being dismissed by the EU, and claimed progress was being made in all facets.He said: We’ve made significant progress, and we are making significant progress every week.”In response to the SNP’s Peter Grant, he listed off a number of areas where agreement is being reached, adding:  “All of these areas we have made progress, so I don’t think it’s right for the honourable gentlemen to say nothing has changed.“We make progress every week and a deal is within our sights.”Mr Raab said Britain would be ready for Brexit, deal or no deal, as he was pressed on the preparations for exiting the bloc without a long-term agreement.He acknowledged some elements of the plan were challenging for some EU countries, but said: We approach these talks with ambition, pragmatism and energy and if our EU friends match us, we will strike a deal that is in the clear and overwhelming interest of both sides.The Cabinet minister added: We are taking action to avoid, to minimise and to mitigate these potential risks so we are quick to manage any short-term disruption.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Good. Then let’s proceed, in an open-minded fashion, with X Factor, the focus group years, where there are some new faces on the panel.We’ve got Louis “lad” Tomlinson, who brings the experience of taking part in the show.Robbie Williams, who brings the ­experience of over 20 years in the music industry.And Ayda, who brings the ­experience of playing Angela Moroni in Days Of Our Lives.Ironically, though, the newest face of all probably belongs to Simon Cowell, whose head now requires constant fanning and is so curiously swollen they could shove it on a plinth in the FA Museum above a plaque that reads: “1923 Cup Final ­football.”What caused it to balloon, I cannot say for sure, but if it was done to divert attention from the other end of the judging panel, he’s seriously underestimated the attention-seeking and self-absorption of Robbie Williams, which is total.A factor not helped by the adoring presence of Ayda, whose public displays of affection for “Rob” could quickly become the X Factor’s most nauseating ever detail.Enormous as it is, there’s not much Simon’s head can do about the singing either.The problem here, of course, is that almost everyone who wants to audition for a karaoke show has now auditioned, or sung professionally.So we were swamped with re-treads on this weekend’s double-header.Among them were: Danny Tetley, who appeared on Pop Idol, Caribbean ­talent show ­veteran Olatunji Yearwood, who’s already got a record deal, Livin’ Joy’s Janice “Dreamer” Robinson, and Brendan ­Murray from Hometown, a Sony act who were managed by Louis Walsh. Not that anyone was admitting as much.If there was any joy and spontaneity to proceedings, though, it was generally ­provided by those random whack-nut contestants who don’t appear on Simon’s approved list.Acts like Livia and the Elementals, Aaron Denham, who looked like he’d absconded from Guantanamo Bay, and Andy Hofton, who performed a song called Castle Of Love that’s been 20 years in gestation and, to no tune at all, went like this.“All my life, I’ve been building a castle of love. That lifts me to your heart.“Here I am, I’ve built my castle of . . .”“Andy! ANDY!” Simon’s hand of objection went up. He was then asked if he had a second song. Angels kicked in and I think you know what happened next.If someone on the judging panel had their wits about them, obviously, they’d have waited for Andy and Robbie to finish their duet then said: “Actually, let’s try Castle Of Love again.”No chance of that, though, as Cowell set his stall out, day one, when he told Danny Tetley: “The music business should be more open-minded.”The irony of a show that’s spent 14 series steering viewers towards its preferred winner now demanding open-mindedness won’t be lost on anyone, but I think it’s just ­cosmetic.The sort of “let’s-pretend we’re-nice” ­cobblers political parties trot out when they’re in as much trouble as this show.It won’t work, though. ’Cos there were so many things the X Factor urgently needed to ditch — sob stories, manipulation, product-placement, deception, scripted “spontaneity” — yet it sounds like the only element it’s going to discard is the brutal and funny honesty which made it stand out from the competition.Show’s over, folks.Paul Merson: “The one person I feel sorry for is the Newcastle fans.”And Tony Cottee: “Hemed’s had two efforts, Freeman’s had two efforts and all three have been saved.”CELEBRITY Big Brother viewers finally got to see last week why the show paid £75,000 to book actress Roxanne Pallett, whose relationship with the truth could, at best, be described as flexible.Unwitting victim was Corrie’s Ryan Thomas, who engaged her with a spot of the house craze for shadow boxing on Thursday’s show, which everyone could see was entirely playful.Having initially laughed it off, though, Roxanne suddenly decided it was “an assault” and he was “a woman beater”, who had to be removed.It made a mockery of the real thing, obviously, and would have ruined Ryan’s life if there’d been a hint of doubt about the video footage.In the kangaroo court atmosphere of the #MeToo movement, however, and with a £75,000 investment to protect, Channel 5 had to indulge her fantasies and give Ryan an official warning for his “behaviour”.She’s since fled the house, of course, without her fee, and apologised.If anyone’s missing Roxanne’s histrionics, though, there’ll soon be another chance to see the dingbat lose her s**t on Celebrity Island With Bear Grylls, where her stay comes to a tearful climax over the camp fire which, apparently, sparks fevered memories of a teenage house inferno that could’ve killed her entire family. But didn’t.It’s a pattern likely to continue as well.Given the fact then that reality television clearly causes Roxanne Pallett such huge emotional distress and painful memory spasms, it’s probably best if neither she nor the toxic show that booked her ever troubles us again.BBC2’s Eight Go Rallying, in ­CambodiaBBC1’s Bodyguard is a curse, a liability, a Jonah. Norman bloody Wisdom in a bullet-proof vest.He sits on a train, ­suicide bombers appear in the next carriage.He gets in a car with the Home Secretary, a sniper’s killed Terry the driver.He turns up to see her speak? KABOOM! The front three rows of the ­theatre suddenly explode.Where Sergeant David Budd goes, trouble ­immediately follows.And still no one at MI5 or Scotland Yard has made the connection.Mind you, it took the best brains at the Met several days to work out the sniper, who had a shot on him like Yul Brynner in The Magnificent Seven, “might be ex-Forces”.Yeah, well, it’s not a bad theory, I suppose, though you couldn’t rule out the possibility they’ll haul in David Blunkett for questioning next week, as this lot all seem to have trained with Walford CID, the world’s stupidest police force.It’s just one of several reasons why I’m still not buying into Bodyguard.The others being, its idiotic levels of political correctness, the stilted performance of Richard Madden as Budd, and his entirelyunbelievable relationship with Keeley Hawes’ Julia Montague.Mind you, she did conjure up an even more far-fetched and disturbing possibility on Sunday night when she told him: “Sex with the Home Secretary, it’s a heinous crime.”Sex with the Shadow Home Secretary. A lock him up and throw away the key crime.MEANWHILE, on Age Before Beauty, Ivy-Rae: “We need to do something so bad that they’ll still end up sweating in 20 years’ time.”Mission accomplished.

Jonathan Bartley and Sian Berry were elected by a landslide in a ballot of members, the party announced today. It means the Greens in England and Wales will continue with a joint leadership, after Mr Bartley and the party\u0027s only MP Caroline Lucas shared the helm for the past two years. The pair easily saw off challenges from rivals, scooping 6,239 of the 8,379 votes cast, against 1,466 for Shahrar Ali and 495 for Leslie Rowe. Amelia Womack was re-elected for a third term as deputy leader, taking 3,981 out of 7,369 votes.  The new co-leaders pledged to put the party on course to supplant the Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party to claim the title of the third political party in Britain, and said they aim to get a Green into every council chamber.   Mr Bartley said: We\u0027re proud to lead a party with a track record on the right side of history and are ready to mobilise a fiercer Green resistance than ever before. When faced with the environmental destruction of fracking or the spiralling costs of HS2, or the inhumanity of indefinite detention and forced removals of refugees and migrants, we are not afraid to join protesters putting their bodies on the line for what is right.  Ms Berry said: With Brexit on the horizon and our planet burning, the last thing people need is the stale centrism of the past, which brought us austerity and privatisation and totally failed to tackle climate breakdown or give people real security and quality of life.

The GMB said promises made during the 2016 vote are “not the reality we are facing”. It said it had consulted thousands of its members across the country, and there was widespread support for the public to have a say on the final outcome of negotiations. The union, which has 620,000 members, backed remaining in the EU, although admitted its members were divided. General secretary Tim Roache told members: “Sitting on the sidelines watching the mess this Government is making of Brexit is infuriating, because there is so much at stake.  “GMB respects the result of the referendum, but how we leave the EU is as important as the decision to leave in the first place. That’s why today, GMB is calling for a public vote on the final deal. “As trade unionists, when we negotiate a pay deal with an employer, we go back to our members and ask them if they’re happy with it. Whether they want to accept or reject it. “That’s what people deserve now, because the promises that were made during the referendum campaign are simply not the reality we are facing.”  Mr Roache said GMB members in manufacturing, ports, chemicals, energy, retail and public services were facing uncertainty and a Government more preoccupied with “internal divisions” than working people’s livelihoods. He added: “People voted for change - they voted to take back control. They did not vote for economic chaos or to put jobs and hard won rights on the line.” "},{"url":null,"title":"huge tour britain artwork devon","story":"NewsHuge Tour of Britain artwork on Devon hillside rearranged into extremely inappropriate shapeThe artwork of a bicycle had been put in place to largely celebrate Geraint Thomas\u0027 Tour de France successShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByJamie HawkinsBradley Jolly15:58, 4 SEP 2018Newsthis.style.display=\u0027none\u0027\"/Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror/news/uk-news/video/drone-footage-giant-bicycle-ilfracombe-13191047,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-M3TH25P,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Brazen vandals rearranged artwork of a bicycle on a hillside to the shape of a huge penis - but amused residents love it.

The company\u0027s two brands, John Lewis and Waitrose have undergone a rebrand, complete with new names and logos - the department store is now John Lewis \u0026amp Partners, while the supermarket will be known as Waitrose \u0026amp Partners. Developed by Pentagram, the new logos feature the same elements across both brands, but with a black colour scheme for John Lewis and green for Waitrose. The changes are set to be rolled out across UK stores over the next five years, but new branding has already been revealed online and at John Lewis’s flagship Oxford Street store, as well as Waitrose in Edgware Road and Clerkenwell.  Paula Nickolds, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners managing director, explained the company had decided to implement the changes to put their partners back at the heart of everything they do. She said: Our Partnership business model and the inherent strength of our partners really sets us apart. That’s why the change to our visual identity this week puts partners back at the heart of everything we do. This move not only reflects the business we have become but more importantly, the business we want to be.  Alongside the new names and logos, John Lewis have also released a new advert featuring the Queen track, Bohemian Rhapsody. People on Twitter were thrilled about the new ad, but had mixed feelings about the rebrand. One person wrote: John Lewis have just released the best ad and the worst logo ever at the same time.    Another commented: John Lewis may have changed its logo and brand but I see it retains its enthusiasm for taking a pop classic and kookifying it in its ads. A third said: End of an era - the old logos were just so good. It does look like John Lewis and Waitrose are now an solicitors firms. I wonder what\u0027s the logic behind the tree stripes? John Lewis has a new logo for the first time since the industrial revolution and I fear for the future of Britain, added a fourth.

The duo, who married in May, had an adorable encounter with young winner Matilda Booth at Tuesday night\u0027s glittering WellChild Awards in London. The youngster has Spina Bifida and is paralysed from the chest down. She spent her early years in hospital and has had brain surgery seven times as well as around 40 operations. During the event the brave little girl had the opportunity to speak to Harry and Meghan, who she gave a bouquet of white blooms. For latest updates on the awards: Follow the live blog here.  The Duchess picked a white rose out and gave it back to Matilda and told her to keep in her memory box, leaving the youngster beaming from ear-to-ear. She was later pictured clutching the flower close to her chest. Sharon Booth, 47, who lives with her daughter Matilda in West Yorkshire, said after the royal encounter: Matilda chose the flowers, she was shell-shocked to be given the rose, she said she\u0027s going to put it in her memory box. Not to be left out, Harry made a pinky pledge with the youngster during a reception before the awards ceremony began, hooking his little finger around the girl\u0027s matching digit. Mrs Booth said the royal urged her daughter to never stop smiling as you\u0027ve got a beautiful smile.  The youngster is this year’s Inspirational Child 4-6 years winner, and wants to be a nurse when she grows up. Matilda has a “great zest for life” and impresses all she meets with her great courage, strength and determination, the charity said. When she brought out her soft-toy pug, she told the duke and duchess it was named after talent show mogul Simon Cowell. Mrs Booth added: Harry said, \u0027I can see the resemblance\u0027. The event celebrates the inspiring qualities of some of the country\u0027s seriously ill young people and the dedication of those who go the extra mile to keep children healthy and happy. Harry, who has been patron of the charity since 2007, and Meghan were seen mingling with youngsters - and medical staff who care for others and were recognised for their efforts. Meghan\u0027s first appearance at the event saw her interacting with all the winners, sharing jokes, a hug and receiving gifts along with her husband. Melissa Granger, 15, from St Helens, who has Angelman syndrome which leaves her needing 24-hour care, hugged the royal couple as her brother Jacob, 18, watched.

The Duke of Sussex attended a glittering awards bash in London tonight with wife Meghan as they honoured inspiring young children battling complex conditions. However a throwaway comment during the WellChild awards with one of the young winners may ruffle the music mogul\u0027s feathers - if he doesn\u0027t see the funny side, or the prince\u0027s much-loved sense of humour. The conversation was between seven-year-old Matilda Booth, who has Spina Bifida and is paralysed from the chest down.  She spent her early years in hospital and has had brain surgery seven times as well as around 40 operations.  She was among the winners for her unwavering “zest for life” and her great courage, strength and determination. During the event, the brave little girl had the opportunity to speak to Harry and Meghan. When Matilda brought out her soft-toy pug, she told the duke and duchess it was named after talent show mogul Simon Cowell. Sharon Booth, 47, who lives with her daughter Matilda in West Yorkshire, said after the royal encounter: Harry said, \u0027I can see the resemblance\u0027. Cowell, 58, returned to TV screens alongside Robbie Williams, wife Ayda, and One Direction star Louis Tomlinson last weekend for the new series of the X Factor.  In the past he has made no secret of his love for a little nip and tuck - and recently confessed to having a non surgical facelift. He previously admitted using botox added 10 years to his TV career, but that he regrets going overboard with the procedure. He added: Hopefully I look better now – I probably did have a little too much Botox a couple of years ago, because everyone on TV has it. Now I have facials, but nothing too extravagant at the moment. I have a girl who comes here and does a great face massage – it\u0027s very relaxing. I also had a sheep placenta facial once, which was quite out there. Meanwhile, it\u0027s not the first time the lovable prince has made a jibe at other people\u0027s expense.  In July he left garden party guests giggling after admitting he was glad his father, Prince Charles, didn’t bore the Irish Prime Minister senseless during a previous visit. The charity event at the Royal Lancaster Hotel, London, on Tuesday night also saw young winner Matilda give a bouquet of white blooms to Meghan. In a heartwarming gesture, the Duchess picked a white rose out and gave it back to Matilda and told her to keep in her memory box, leaving the youngster beaming from ear-to-ear.

Alex Parry and little Olivia were out with her friend Danielle Feather and her son Oscar when the embarrassing incident happened. The 22-year-old, who said she regularly visits the pub with her daughter, said it was the first time she’d ordered a meal for the child, who had only just started eating solids. Wales Online reported that after apologising to one of the waitresses for the mess Olivia had caused, Ms Parry said she was told it wasn’t a problem and not to worry. But moments later the manager came over with a dustpan and brush.  Mitchell \u0026amp Butler, which runs the Antelope pub in Menai Bridge, said no offence was meant and that the group had offered to clean up the mess. Ms Parry denied the claim she had offered to clean up, but said she would have done so anyway at the end of the meal. Miss Parry said she had been made to feel uncomfortable by the approach, before the meal was even finished. She said: “Olivia had spilt a little bit on the floor - as babies do, so when the waitress came over, I apologised for the mess and she said it was fine and there was no need to worry about it. “But when the manager came over to serve food to another table, I could see him looking at the floor by our table and said he would get a dustpan and brush for me to clean it up. “At first, I thought he was joking but he came over while I was still eating and put it on the table next to us, which I thought was really unhygienic and unnecessary. “Of course I would have cleaned it up myself, but after we had finished eating, not mid-way through our meal. “It wasn’t even that bad. It made me feel extremely uncomfortable, and it was as if they didn’t want us there. “It didn’t feel very child friendly at all.” "},{"url":null,"title":"queens great nephews shows impressive","story":"NewsQueen\u0027s great nephews shows off their impressive abs on sunny holiday with palsArthur and Sam Chatto, Princess Margaret\u0027s grandsons, has been enjoying a holiday with his friendsShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByZoe ForseyActing Audience Editor18:22, 4 SEP 2018NewsArthur is apparently a big hit with the ladies \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailDespite being some of the most photographed people in the world, the senior royals lead very private lives.

Since its founding in Manchester in 1868, the Trades Union Congress has backed workers and fought attempts to undermine their rights and pay.  Today it represents five million people. This week the Mirror looks back at some critical points in its remarkable history. Hope Street in Liverpool has history seeping from every pore.  Towering over its south end is the world’s fifth largest cathedral, Giles Gilbert Scott’s Anglican masterpiece, while at its north end, built on the site of a poor house, is the largest Catholic cathedral in England. In between, you’ll find the Medical Institution, where slavery abolitionist William Roscoe was born, and The Everyman Theatre, cradle of world-class writers Willy Russell and Alan Bleasdale. Then there’s the Philharmonic Hall, bearing a plaque to its musicians, who played on as the Titanic sank, and the art school where John Lennon met Stuart Sutcliffe, which is next to The Institute School where Paul McCartney met George Harrison. But nothing typifies the radical, ground-breaking spirit of this extraordinary street more than an ordinary three-storied building called The Casa.  In 1998, the semi-derelict shell, once a drinking den called The Casablanca, was bought by sacked dockers who had lost jobs that had been in some families for generations, after one of the longest disputes in UK history. Sacked for refusing to cross a picket line – a principle that resides deep in Scouse DNA, and one they thought worth fighting for to the bitter end. Sadly, not every-one, including the Transport \u0026amp General Workers’ Union leaders, and later the New Labour government, shared the stomach for the fight. Hardly anyone but the dockers themselves thought they would win and, like most landmark disputes of the last century – General Strike, the Miners’ Strike – ultimately they lost.  But those dockers never gave up the hope or the fight. And what emerged from that loss, in the form of that three-storey Hope Street building, is a testament to defiance, enterprise and solidarity.  They simply turned defeat on its head by building a social justice hub which became a monument to their principles. The 850-day dispute started in September 1995 when Bootle-based docks firm Torside sacked 80 workers for refusing to accept the imposition of what we now call zero-hours contracts. Those dockers – holding a banner saying “Save The 80: Say No To Casuals” – handed leaflets to workers arriving at Seaforth container terminal and 329 workers employed by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company refused to cross their picket line. Despite being described by Lloyd’s List as “the most productive workforce in Europe” they were all immediately sacked.  The MDHC said: “The striking men are in breach of their contracts and we have therefore terminated them.”  The dockers, well used to scraps with management, believed it would quickly be resolved, but they miscalculated.  It began to look like a carefully-laid trap to smash the unions’ influence on the docks and employ cheaper, casualised labour. And it worked. The dockers had not held a ballot, so the strike was declared unofficial by their own union, the T\u0026ampGWU.  New Labour made it clear if they were elected they would not reverse any of the Tories’ anti-trade union legislation. In theory, the dockers were on their own. But not in practice.  The support for their 28-month battle to be re- instated was incredible – and global.  On one International Solidarity Day, workers in 52 countries came out on strike to back them.  American longshoremen and Australian wharfies brought their nations’ ports to a halt. Later, every Japanese docker stopped working, and in South Africa all ports were closed “in solidarity with the Liverpool dockers who stood by us during apartheid”. Youngsters from protest movement Reclaim the Streets went to Merseyside to occupy the offices of the MDHC. Liverpool star Robbie Fowler was fined \u0026pound900 by UEFA for unveiling a mock Calvin Klein T-shirt supporting the dockers in a goal celebration.  Comics Jo Brand, Mark Steel, Jeremy Hardy and Lee Hurst, and musicians such as Noel Gallagher did fundraisers. At the 1998 Brit Awards Chumbawamba changed the words of Tubthumping to “New Labour sold out the dockers, just like they’ll sell out the rest of us”, and singer Danbert Nobacon famously poured a bucket of icy water over Deputy PM John Prescott, saying: “This is for the Liverpool dockers.”  Wives, girlfriends, aunts and mums joined Women of the Waterfront. They went on speaking tours, organised all-women pickets and marched on No10. In January 1998, after 28 months out of work, the dockers reluctantly accepted \u0026pound28,000 each to end their dispute. It was not the end of the story.  They poured some of their pay-off money into retraining workshops, one of which involved a creative writing class, where Jimmy McGovern and Irvine Welsh gave tuition. Out of that came an agreement, brokered by McGovern, that they would make a film about their struggle.  There were two conditions – the dockers had to write it, with McGovern “editing”, and they would receive all the proceeds. Channel 4 bit their hands off, and in 1999 the TV movie Dockers hit the screens, starring Ken Stott, Crissy Rock and Ricky Tomlinson.  The dockers wanted to leave a lasting legacy to the spirit of collectivism.  So they used the \u0026pound127,000 they received from Channel 4 to buy and renovate The Casa, turning it into a community hub run on not-for-profit, socialist ideals. Downstairs became a bar and function room for parties, charity fundraisers, meetings, recitals, dramas, or rallies to promote progressive political causes. The floor above became an IT training centre, which helped people gain computer skills and find work. The third floor became a welfare advice centre offering free, expert help from professionals about benefits, debt, employment, asylum and health, or simply on how to fill out a form.  Over the past 18 years it is estimated that more than \u0026pound15million worth of free advice has been given out here to people in desperate need.

The giant suppliers, some foreign-owned, have been increasing prices year after year and leaving broken pipes unrepaired. Perhaps it was a growing public backlash or the threat of a Labour Government renationalising them finally shamed them into action. The five-year business plans submitted to regulator Ofwat, reducing bills an average 4% over the five years from 2020 to 2025, are a drop in the ocean after increases and neglected leaks for as long as anybody can remember.

The man in his 60s had gone to the doctors complaining about discomfort while he tried to sleep and said he could hear noises like something was beating a drum. Ear, nose and throat specialist Cui Shulin shared footage of the moment he found a bean-sized spider about two inches deep in his ear during an endoscope. The medic from Dalian Central Hospital in north eastern China said the man was complaining about a possible insect in his head. The unnamed patient told him: I felt discomfort in my ear while sleeping last night but I tried to ignore it.  This morning the discomfort was still there. There were noises like something was beating a drum. Doctor Cui and his nurses were stunned when the endoscope revealed the live spider having occupied the patient\u0027s ear canal so deep. It had also spun elaborate webs to shield itself, the footage shows. The experienced doctor eventually flushed the spider out by spraying the patient\u0027s ear canal with water, later confirming that the man suffered no injuries during the arachnid occupation.

It changes the dynamic in the market hall. It\u0027 a great unit with fantastic windows and great visibility.The idea is to charge \u0026pound20 per hour for use of the premises.If the initiative is approved by the council\u0027 city committee, Mrs Murray promised the unit would be redecorated before it is let.Meanwhile, the market could be renamed Old Town Arcade Inverness in a major rebranding exercise.The proposal has emerged after talks between interested parties and council, which has employed consultant Tristram Woolston Design of Cannich to look at the marketing of the landmark, which has often been a focal point for city visitors from home and abroad.Mrs Murray said further talks will be held before it goes to Highland councillors for consideration.\u0026ldquoThe consultant has identified problems with the existing name, in that the building and its environment doesn\u0026rsquot strongly present Victorian qualities and it\u0027 not a \u0026lsquomarket\u0026rsquo as such, but has permanent enclosed retail units rather than changeable stalls, she said.\u0026ldquoThe vision for this historic building after refurbishment is to provide a high-quality destination with a mix of unique Highland brands and products, a place to eat and drink, and a venue for events and entertainment.\u0026ldquoOther similar destinations in the UK and abroad call themselves arcades and hence the proposed new name is Old Town Arcade Inverness.Those involved will discuss the new image for the facility in September.Inverness economist Tony Mackay said it might be better to focus on other matters.\u0026ldquoTo be honest I\u0026rsquom not sure what sort of impact changing the name will have, he said.\u0026ldquoThere needs to be improvements at the market, there are a few empty premises in the centre.

Detailed measures will be presented next week.Leaders of the minority independent administration said every attempt would be made to minimise the impact on services but \u0026ldquosome impact on service is inevitable.Budget leader Alister Mackinnon said: \u0026ldquoOur  reserves of \u0026pound8 million are well below the minimum recommended by Audit Scotland and it\u0027 vital that they\u0026rsquore not depleted further. The committee agreed stricter controls on recruitment and overtime, a review of all agency appointments and tighter controls on staff travel.The \u0026pound5.1 million figure equates to one per cent of the total budget and compares with a \u0026pound2.7 million estimate at this stage last year. The potential overspend is blamed on high cost placements for \u0026lsquolooked-after children\u0026rsquo, lower income from new parking charges and fewer savings from toilet closures because those two policies have not yet taken full effect.Council chiefs insisted no staff jobs were at risk.Finance director Derek Yule, however, warned there were \u0026ldquono more rabbits to be pulled from hats to tackle the problems.Black Isle Liberal Democrat Gordon Adam blamed Scottish Government grant cuts while SNP city councillor Richard Laird said the crisis was \u0026ldquoentirely of this council\u0027 making.Council leader Margaret Davidson claimed local government services were \u0026ldquonot a priority for the Scottish Government.The budget leader angered the SNP benches, accusing group leader Maxine Smith of not fully participating in budget discussions.

But Cllr Gowans added: \u0026ldquoInverness schools are one of the biggest budget pressures we\u0026rsquore going to face. The last estimated cost to resolve the issue would be something like \u0026pound200 million.\u0026ldquoThat would affect every single service within this council \u0026ndash not just Inverness. But they\u0026rsquove been restricted to Inverness members.\u0026ldquoI cannot fathom why such important issues as Inverness schools, and the implications that has for the resources of Highland Council, are not being brought forward in an open, transparent way in the chamber so they can be discussed.\u0026ldquoThat way, we could reassure communities that this matter is being addressed.Ross and Cromarty area committee chairwoman Fiona Robertson, an independent councillor, did not join the chorus but, speaking after the committee meeting, said: \u0026ldquoWhen it comes to the allocation

You can even donate your corneas.“Donating can go towards saving the lives of seven people.“Hearts and lungs and livers literally save lives.“They improve lives, dialysis is so limiting. People who have received kidneys, it’s given them a new lease of life, there’s no need to do dialysis.”There is currently legislation with the Scottish Government that would change the current opt-in system to ‘opt-out’.At present, people must opt in in order to have their organs donated for transplants after they die, however, under the new proposals, which were tabled in June, it will be assumed that people were in favour of donation unless they have specifically stated otherwise.Medics will still check with families to confirm that they understand the process.It is a system that is being used in Wales, which came into effect in December 2015.Claire said: “It’s something that is best left for politicians, but anything that increases the amount people on the organ donation register is good.“Wales have had it for a while, but it’s probably still too early to tell if it really makes a difference.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/09/5b8d414ae319c-938x564.jpg ","title":"tours showcasing new offshore wind turbines to start in aberdeen1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tTours showcasing the new offshore wind turbines are to start in Aberdeen.Aberdeen Harbour Tours has been operating excursions out of Commercial Quay West in the city for the past 25 years and is now looking to offer close-up views of the newest addition to the North Sea horizon. 100vw, 620px\" /Bosses want to sail visitors around Vattenfall’s £300 million wind turbine development.Tours are expected to start soon, with operator Greenhowe Marine Services taking people up close and personal to the huge structures.Ricky Greenhowe, who operates the tour boat, said: “A lot of people have been asking about it.“Instead of an hour, the cruises would be an hour-and-a-half as it is five miles from the harbour to the windfarm.“There’s a lot of people interested so far.“We do the harbour tours and we did one trip out there already.”Ricky said the company is just waiting for the confirmation that the boat can go out before the tours begin. The company also takes visitors out to sea for the opportunity to spot dolphin pods up close, rather than simply viewing them from the harbour.The boat has previously been used as a water taxi to transfer goods and crew to offshore installations.He added: “There’s nobody else doing anything like that.“It’s two-and-a-half miles off the coast, but this way you can see it up close.“We’ve had a lot of interest from companies as well. It’ll be good – it’s something different.”The European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre  took nine weeks to build, from the time the first foundations were installed.The development is the largest offshore wind test and demonstration facility in Scotland.The 11 turbines began generating power for the first time in July.They are expected to generate the equivalent of 70% of Aberdeen’s domestic electricity demand. The wind farm has also been the subject of legal challenges by US President Donald Trump.Mr Trump claimed it would ruin the views from Trump International, his multi-million pound Menie golf course.As well as being one of the fastest developments of its kind to be installed, one of the world’s largest floating cranes, the Asian Hercules III, was used to secure the equipment to the seabed.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"work on union terrace gardens could start by end of year","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe co-leader of Aberdeen City Council today said he hopes work will start on the redevelopment of Union Terrace Gardens by the end of the year – but could not guarantee it.The council is still working to appoint a contractor for the multi-million-pound revamp of the Victorian gardens, with a tender process under way.But Douglas Lumsden, co-leader of the local authority, could not say for certain the work – which is due to be completed by 2020 – will kick off in 2018.He said: “It really depends on what the tenders come back with.“I don’t know what will be in them.

They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

But Alfie Briggs does plan to downsize the long-established business. Mr Briggs, 74, wants to change part of the arcade, to create a town house. And he has been granted planning consent by South Ayrshire Council. Mr Briggs says he will transform the smaller part of the arcade - next to the Harbour Bar pub - back into a house. But the larger, deeper part of the business will remain an amusement arcade. However, Mr Briggs also has consent to create a house there, should it ever be required. He said: “I was advised to do it  this way. But I’m definitely not closing the arcade.” He added: “I won’t be around forever, and maybe my children will decide it should go back to a house. “But I know I won’t do it.” Mr Briggs, who lives in Ayr, has owned Mayfair Amusements since 1984. The business was created in 1962 by the late Edwin Lawrence, a former travelling showman. He had bought the two-storey house next to the Harbour Bar pub, and converted the downstairs front into a small amusement arcade. This had originally been John Carson’s fish shop. The arcade was greatly expanded around 1970, after the acquistion of a house at No 29 Knockcushan Street. The arcade, which included a prize bingo and a shop, was run successfully by Mr Lawrence and his family, until bought by Mr Briggs. The new owner kept the name ‘Mayfair Amusements’ which was a tribute to Mr Lawrence’s wife May, as well as an affluent part of London. Alfie Briggs recalls: “There was more business for everyone back in the days when there was about five amusement arcades in Girvan. “Takings have certainly gone down, but we’re still getting by. “This conversion will allow me to rent out a house and a flat, instead of just a flat.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilGirvanAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayr united fans under starters","story":"NewsAyr United fans under starter\u0027s orders for Somerset Park charity racenight in aid of Ian McCall\u0027s player fundInternet supporters\u0027 team KaisAyr is staging the bash this Saturday night in United\u0027s Hospitality Suite.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson10:56, 23 AUG 2018NewsAyr\u0027s Craig McGuffie and Alan Forrest go for a ride with mascot Pandamonium \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThey’re under starter’s orders for a top night of action at Somerset Park this Saturday.

Pupils, parents and teachers surrounded the car park of Kyle Academy to show their appreciation of Gavin Drysdale, who smashed a world record at the European World Para Athletics in Berlin. S6 pupil Gavin, of Ayr, brought home the gold in the race running 100m category with an incredible time of 17.37 seconds. And he was given a hero’s welcome as he was led in by a bagpipe performance. He made his way round the hundreds of emotional crowd, and there was barely a dry eye to be seen. It was clear to see how much Gavin had brought the community together, and how immensely proud they were of the superstar. A teacher was even seen asking “is my mascara running?”, which summed up the emotional parade for Gavin. And it was so clear to see how delighted Gavin was with the turnout, with pupils even running over to grab selfies with him. A buzzing Gavin said: “The reception I got coming back to school was overwhelming. “I wasn’t expecting anything like that reaction I got, it was great. “Kyle Academy are always very supportive of any competition I am doing.” Gavin, 17, has cerebral palsy and has been race running for 10 years. He trains at Dam Park, and when he started way back in 2008 he was the only race runner from Scotland. Now there are over 100 competitors from the country.  He is part of the race running club which is supported by Blue Rock Insurance Brokers. The race club is a branch of Ayr Seaforth and is coached by David Phee. Gavin also trains at Red Star in Glasgow with Janice Eaglesham. And the race running has came so far since he started, and these games have helped it get well on its way to being a part of the Paralympic games. Gavin competed in a special racing trike, which has impressive Continental tyres on it. Gavin is still on cloud nine after bagging the top prize in Berlin. He said: “When I won I was totally stunned. “I felt like I had already won a gold medal just by being there, so the fact I actually won was amazing!”  All the way through Gavin’s journey, his mum Margaret and dad Peter have been there supporting him. His family and friends have helped him along the way, and his sister Natalie even had banners up at the family home to celebrate his success for when he got back. Dad Peter said: “We are just so proud of Gavin. “We were so relieved when he won the gold - as we knew how much hard work he put into his progress. “The games went great, and it’s incredible to see how well the Scottish athletes done at the games.  “We have to extend our thanks to Kyle Academy for being so supportive and for this spectacular welcome they have given us.” Gavin isn’t just a star on the track, he has just sailed through S5 picking up an impressive five highers at A and B grades. He was also a part of the Commonwealth games baton relay in 2014. Headteacher for Kyle Academy, Mary Byrne said: “The whole school is so proud of Gavin. “We are delighted that we are able to show our support for him, and everyone at the school is delighted for him.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13159837.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_swr_ayp_010915cinema.jpg","title":"kyle centre ayr bids open","story":"NewsKyle Centre in Ayr bids to open 24 hour Energie Fitness Gym in town centre shopping mallBosses say the move is part of a strategy to keep the ailing retail hub sustainable in the long term.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson16:44, 29 AUG 2018NewsKyle Centre manager Fiona Paton \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailShopping bosses want to launch a 24 hour gym in Ayr town centre, the Ayrshire Post can reveal. The ailing Kyle Centre is to lodge plans for a round the clock fitness facility. Retail chiefs want to rival Heathfield’s bid for a similar project on the outskirts of town. Both are now set to go before South Ayrshire Council in a battle for planning permission. Kyle Centre boss, Fiona Paton, said: “Lifestyles and work patterns are changing and we believe there is demand for this. “There is no escaping that we, as a centre, need to evolve and we’ve had to adapt our business model since I came here 10 years ago. “Opening a gym is part of that direction of travel and can help sustain the centre moving forward.” Energie Fitness has agreed a deal to open an 8000sq foot unit within the barren centre. And bosses claim their stalling dream to open a cinema is far from dead.  Negotiations, understood to be with screen giant Odeon, have so far failed to bear fruit. But Fiona, 48, said: “This sits separately from our plan to open the cinema, which very much remains the long term aim. “Unfortunately it has taken longer than we’d have liked but we are getting there with it. “I can understand why some people have given up on the Kyle Centre – but I wouldn’t be here unless we had a bright future. “We have private investment and our vision is very clear, it is just a matter of staying patient. “People say that our success is vital to the town and that is true. “There is a lot going on in Ayr at the moment and a prosperous Kyle Centre is key to that.” We revealed earlier this summer that retail rivals Heathfield had signed a deal with the Gym Group to open a 24 hour gym. Both plans are now subject to council approval.

much loved Scottish meals with a distinct Bajan twist.\nThe now popular festival had humble beginnings in the 1990s when a Welsh men\u0026rsquos choir travelled to the island to perform in a local concert hall.\nSince then, the celebration has expanded and has featured Celtic acts from Canada, across the UK, Ireland, the USA and even Australia.\nFestival director Carol Anderson from Edinburgh

used in practice.\n\u0026ldquoIn the last year there have been 15 dog control notices with two pending, although there are some issues with obtaining owner details. Some owners just need to be spoken to and advised of their responsibilities.\nDog control orders allow Scottish Borders Council to impose certain conditions on dog owners. For example, a dog which frequently runs away may be required to be kept on a lead at all times, or an aggressive dog may have to be muzzled when in public spaces.\nThe control orders can also be used to compel dog owners to seek training for themselves and their pet. Failure to adhere to a dog control order could lead to a ban from keeping animals or the dog being put down.\nA Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe council is currently reviewing its responsible dog ownership strategy, which will aim to remind owners of their social and legal responsibilities.\n\u0026ldquoAs part of this strategy, the council works in partnership with local and national charities to promote responsible ownership and dog control by educating the public at ious events across the Borders.\n\u0026ldquoThe council responds to all complaints received concerning out of control dogs, but in order to assist us in investigating each complaint fully, we ideally require the dog owner\u0026rsquos details.\n\u0026ldquoMembers of the public can contact 0300 100 1800 or visit www.scotborders.gov.uk if they have a concern about a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour.\nMs Grahame added: \u0026ldquoMy main concern is that members of the public may not be aware that if a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour is causing concern, for example being allowed to be out of control, they can report it to the council through this route.\n\u0026ldquoThe police, of course, deal with the most serious incidents.

It\u0026rsquos subjective.\n\u0026ldquoThe officers and the consultees have expressed reservations, even though they might not have objected.\n\u0026ldquoI think when you join together all these different aspects, of the reservoir, of the William Ogilvie cairn, the cumulative and residential impacts, in my view that makes this application unacceptable.\nA report put to the committee found that 75 comments had been submitted to Scottish Borders Council regarding the project, and all but one of those were objections.\nThe council also received objections from six community councils that would be within sight of the wind farm, and Hawick councillors David Paterson and Watson McAteer also voiced their objections.\nThe latter wrote to his fellow councillors, imploring them to reject the wind farm: \u0026ldquoThis application is a test and should this authority grant the application it is in danger of sending a signal to all developers that rejection is simply a temporary set back and that after some fine tuning reapplication is likely to be successful.\n\u0026ldquoThis approach is debilitating for fragile communities who are being worn down by commercial enterprises that bring financial muscle to a process destined to create over proliferation, landscape desecration and wind turbine blight to a naturally beautiful area of the Borders.\n\u0026ldquoMembers, those I represent can see no valid reason why the previous rejection is not equally valid today and it is your responsibility to ensure that this community is listened to.\n\u0026ldquoIt is quite ridiculous that those who live and nurture this area are once again being called to fight to protect a precious environment, that includes a perilous roads network, from a profit centred business who have no interest in the effect their development will have on such a historic rural community.\nNot all councillors opposed the development, however, with East Berwickshire councillor Helen Laing proposing a motion to support officer\u0026rsquos recommendations and approve the application, which Tweeddale East councillor Eric Small seconded.\nCouncillor Laing said the revised plans were a big improvement on the 2012 application: \u0026ldquoI think there has been a significant change to what they have proposed.\n\u0026ldquoI do have my concerns, particularly around the impact on nearby properties, but on balance I am supportive of the officer\u0026rsquos recommendations. There are lots of advantages to this.\nDespite councillor Laing and councillor Small\u0026rsquos support for the bid, the remaining five members of the committee voted to reject the

grieving for a cat","story":"In the run up to Grief Awareness Day on August 30, Cats Protection would like to let readers know that it offers a grief support service called Paws to Listen.For many, losing a cat can be a very traumatic experience and there can be a lack of understanding from family and friends about how deeply the loss can impact on a person.A survey carried out for Cats Protection earlier this month highlighted that 73 per cent of pet owners feel it can be as difficult and upsetting grieving for a pet as it is grieving for the loss of a person.Cats Protection understands just how much a cat means and what owners may be going through if their pet is missing, has had to be re-homed, nearing the end of its life or has recently passed away.Cats Protection has a large range of resources, information and support to help at this difficult time, including ways to celebrate the cat\u0026#8217s life.Anyone experiencing the loss of a cat can talk to Cats Protection on 0800 024 9494 between 9am-5pm Monday to Friday excluding bank holidays.It is a free and confidential service and our volunteer listeners can provide emotional support and practical information.To talk to someone please give the Paws to Listen service a call.We all need to be mindful of the emotional impact that losing a pet can have on a person.Stuart Sheppard,Cats

local schools.If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved  school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities.Council authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system.Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is of course partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms so as to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew’s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus

is encouraging those working within the industry to make safety a priority.FSPS, which consists of key industry stakeholders, will focus on different types of farming activities, each quarter, to deliver key messages and encourage those working and living on Scotland’s farms and crofts to take action.This week, the campaign, trailing on from Farm Safety Week in July, is urging people to make an active choice about their safety and will focus on the following between September and November: general maintenance on farm, falls from heights and safety at harvest.Last year there were 33 deaths in the agricultural industry in the UK, with five in Scotland.The most common causes of death in the agricultural industry continues to involve falls, transport, animals and equipment.Over the last five years 38 people have been killed in the UK by a moving vehicle 12 people have been killed by contact with machinery 10 have been killed by asphyxiation or drowning, including in grain stores or pits and slurry pits and eight people have been killed by contact with electricity.This data does not take into account the number of injuries on Scotland’s farms and crofts, a number that is believed to be significantly higher.For those amidst harvest, it is essential that they practice the ‘Safe Stop’ method when working with machinery, equipment and vehicles \u0026#8211 handbrake on, controls in neutral, engine off, keys out.Anyone working with equipment or machinery should also be appropriately trained, with full risk assessments carried out, particularly when working near power lines.Speaking on behalf of FSPS, NFU Scotland chief executive Scott Walker commented: \u0026#8216One death or injury on Scotland’s farms and crofts is frankly one too many and as an industry we need to take action to make a conscious effort to put our safety, and that of those living and working around us as a priority.\u0026#8216Whether it is carrying out maintenance to a roof, checking over a machine, or working in a field with power lines, injuries and deaths through accidents most of the time are preventable by taking simple steps and precautions.\u0026#8216This campaign encourages farmers and crofters to make a point of ensuring their working environment is safe, to help us work together to reduce the death and injury toll on our farms and crofts.\u0026#8216This autumn, it is about your Safety, your Choice, and as the darker nights draw in, and many are rushing to get the job done it is important to take a step back to make sure you are working safely.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter dogs are not sensible cycling accessories","story":"I was interested at your article about the Bartholomew family and their cycling exploits.As

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

If approved, the merger would follow the expected merger of Haddington Infant School and King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, which have Jacqui McKinnon, headteacher at Cockenzie Primary School, as interim headteacher until their formal merger goes ahead.  According to the Prestonpans proposal, the two schools would \u0026lsquoclose\u0026rsquo in February \u0026ldquoor as soon as possible thereafter, with a new non-denominational primary school then created. The town\u0026rsquos St Gabriel\u0026rsquos Primary School would be unaffected.  The merged school would continue to operate over the two sites within the existing buildings and facilities, but with a single management team.  Currently, Prestonpans Infant and Nursery School, on West Loan, has a school roll of 358 up to P3, with the primary school, on Preston Road, home to 332 pupils from P4 to P7.  The leadership of Prestonpans Early Learning and Childcare Centre, which opened last year on Kirk Street to provide additional nursery places for the town, would also transfer to the headteacher of the new single school structure if the move goes ahead.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, was surprised to hear the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoFirstly, I would like to see the details of it and what is behind the proposals because the infant school is a superbly-run school and works exceptionally well.  \u0026ldquoThe primary school is a very well-run and successful school as well \u0026ndash we have got two very well-run and successful schools.  \u0026ldquoWe would need to look at what the implications are.  Fiona Robertson, East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos head of education, stressed the local authority was \u0026ldquoabsolutely committed to continuously improving the quality of education at the two schools.  She said: \u0026ldquoOur Education Service Local Improvement Plan sets out a range of key outcomes, one of which is to ensure consistency in our approaches to planning learning, teaching and assessment.  \u0026ldquoWe believe that the proposal to establish a single school operating under a single management team offers the best solution to ensuring this consistency, improving transitions for children, and will deliver considerable educational benefits to all of the schools\u0026rsquo children and young people.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet member for education and children\u0026rsquos services, said: \u0026ldquoOur first priority is to ensure that we provide the best educational experiences and outcomes for the children and young people of Prestonpans. The consultation process will focus on how we do this through an educational benefit statement.  \u0026ldquoWe have already informed the chairs of the parent councils of this proposal.  \u0026ldquoAll parents, carers and the wider school community will have the opportunity to comment on the proposal once the consultation has been published and the statutory consultation period begins on Monday.  The consultation runs to October 2, with drop-in sessions held at both schools next month.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.  Graeme Jeffrey, community council chairman, said: \u0026ldquoAs a community council we are promoting our vision of what we would like to see. It supports the masterplan, looking at how it could be delivered.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe have set out our ambitions for a public energy company and its contribution towards tackling fuel poverty.  \u0026ldquoWe will be consulting on proposals later in the year and will make sure that Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council have an opportunity to provide their views."},{"url":null,"title":"action-promised-on-beach-eyesore","story":"  The sewage pipe on West Beach became visible for about 500 yards of the beach, one of the town\u0026rsquos most popular visitor attractions, as a result of the \u0026lsquoBeast from the East\u0026rsquo that plunged the county under snow for several days in March.  Mother Nature has been kind and the pipe is, by and large, under sand once again \u0026ndash though there are concerns it is likely to be exposed again in future if a permanent solution is not found.  As well as being an eyesore at a popular tourist spot, sand and rocks collect around the pipe and are then blasted by the tide at the sea wall, causing it damage.  The town\u0026rsquos community council has long voiced concerns over the issue and claims houses overlooking the iconic West Beach are \u0026ldquoin danger.  North Berwick Community Council  contacted Scottish Water over the issue and the company\u0026rsquos response was read out at a NBCC meeting last week.  A letter from Brian Lironi, director of corporate affairs, said: \u0026ldquoWe are not able to re-lay this section of pipe. However, following an inspection of it, we plan to carry out some work on the casing around the laterals and raised manhole columns.  \u0026ldquoThis work will take place outside of the bathing season when the laterals are more exposed and the beach is less busy. This should help to improve the aesthetic of the pipe.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoOn the point of erosion, we do not believe our pipe is to blame for this. With that said, I am asking for this to be looked at in more detail as it is important that we take an evidence-led approach. This will not happen during the bathing season.  Mr Lironi said the community council would be kept informed of any developments.  Spring 2018 was not the first time that severe weather saw the sewage pipe badly exposed. The pipe was clearly visible in the aftermath of storms in December 2010 and it took many, many months before the tides re-covered it with sand."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  HADDINGTON...

Plans lodged with East Lothian Council are split into two.  The design and access statement states: \u0026ldquoThe brief is twofold: to diversify the core business on the site with the introduction of small-scale gin and whisky distillation to enable the production of speciality spirits for sale within the business pub chain.  \u0026ldquoSecondly, in light of the increasing demand for both brewery tours and the use of the Monk\u0026rsquos Retreat as a function venue, it is felt that the facilities require being upgraded, both in terms of general amenity, improving the visitor experience and to provide for the disabled visitor with the addition of a platform lift and accessible toilet.  A spokeswoman for owners Greene King explained why they were looking to diversify at the site, on Belhaven\u0026rsquos Brewery Lane.  She said: \u0026ldquoLike any business we are always exploring options to develop our business and facilities. The recent planning application is just one of many opportunities we are considering but no decision has been made yet about whether it is an option we will pursue if planning permission is granted.  In terms of the production of gin and whisky, a still house would be created.  According to the design and access statement: \u0026ldquoThe distillery will be designed to produce 250 litres of spirit a day. It will be unique in the marketplace, making spirit from the same wurt as the beer.  \u0026ldquoThe spirit will be a mixture of Scotch whisky, gin and rum.  \u0026ldquoThis volume and complexity will mean that the brewery will need to employ an additional person to run the distillery.  \u0026ldquoIn time the site would like to re-instate a historical greenhouse within the gardens in order to grow their own botanicals to add to the gin however, this will be part of a separate application.  The new still house would mirror the mash house, which was given planning permission in January 2011, in terms of its look.  It is two storeys, with a more modern design than some of the historic buildings on-site.  If the plans were given the green light, work would also be carried out at the main building on the Belhaven site.  A museum is already in place on the ground floor of the main building, with a pub on the first floor.  Plans show a refurbishment of both floors as \u0026ldquothe existing interiors are now tired and dated and in need of a revamp.  The application, which could go before members of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee later this year, adds: \u0026ldquoConsidering the site\u0026rsquos historic importance both locally and within Scotland, it is clear that any development both internally and externally requires to be sensitive.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to recognise the value of this development in terms of the improved visitor experience, which will impact visitor numbers to the area as a whole, and the business diversification."},{"url":null,"title":"avid-lynyrd-skynyrd-fan-pens-foreword-to-new-book-about-his-idols","story":"  Iain Monk has contributed to The Gospel According to Abraham by Paul Abraham, who was the American band\u0026rsquos road manager for a decade.

Iain said: \u0026ldquoI became an instant fan of the band in the 1970s and was instantaneously hooked by the music, that kind of southern rock music.  \u0026ldquoMy obsession for the band just grew from there but the first time I saw them live was in 1988 in New York when I flew over to see them.  \u0026ldquoI had written to the band\u0026rsquos management to see if they could help me with tickets and I think they were impressed that I was coming from Scotland to see the band.  \u0026ldquoThat relationship grew with management, road crew and members of the band and I started following them across America.  Iain, who lives in Gullane, has spent countless hours travelling across the globe to see his idols perform at 31 shows, ranging from New York, Boston and Washington to Belgium, the Netherlands and all across the UK.  His friendship with band members and those associated with the band has even seen him spend a week at the family home of Randall Hall, who was the band\u0026rsquos guitarist, in Florida. A friendship also grew with Paul Abraham, with Iain interviewing the road manager for his Lynyrd Skynyrd blog about his intention to write a book.  Iain said the band, which was formed in 1969 and continued following the tragic death of lead singer Ronnie Van Zant in 1977, were \u0026ldquoamazing live but also \u0026ldquolovely people.  He added: \u0026ldquoThey are down to earth, very friendly people in my experience and the people that formed the band are very approachable.  \u0026ldquoI have been very, very fortunate that I have been given access to the band over the years.  \u0026ldquoThat is something most fans would simply not get and I think that is down to trust and trusting me not to take advantage of their generosity.

However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.

The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer if members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again lengthening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance. It is important that the local community has its say and we look forward to engaging with this process."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-when-haddington-was-underwater","story":"  John Hamilton of the Facebook page Lost Haddington got in touch with the Courier to highlight how the floods of 1948 would look in present-day Haddington.  He said: \u0026ldquoUsing the flood mark in the video-still as a reference, I got a friend who has access to a theodolite to use this and project this water level to other landmarks around the river and town centre.  \u0026ldquoRobert Byers from Haddington Camera Club then used his photo editing skills and a photoshop \u0026lsquoflood\u0026rsquo plug-in to reconstruct the photos.  In August 1948, persistent heavy rainfall saw the county face its most serious flooding in history.  Although much of East Lothian was affected, Haddington took a major hit. High Street as far west as the Town House was under several feet of water which stretched to the gates of Amisfield Park, a distance of more than half a mile.  Distillery Park, the Nungate, Peffers Place and Brewery Park were similarly devastated.  The Biel Burn also flooded, submerging all the low-lying land north and west of West Barns.  The flood occurred as the culmination of a period of truly exceptional rainfall \u0026ndash 122 mm of rain fell between August 1 and 8, followed by 153 mm in the next five days.  The saturated ground then received a huge 139 mm of rain in the next 24 hours, bringing severe flooding across the county.  The Haddingtonshire Courier reported on \u0026ldquodisastrous flooding without parallel in living memory \u0026ndash if not in history.  In the August 20, 1948 edition of the Courier, \u0026ldquoserious damage was inflicted on the banks of the River Tyne while other streams burst their banks and \u0026ldquoleft destruction in their wake.  It added: \u0026ldquoSo heavy was the flood of water that the streams made courses for themselves, with the result that many people were flooded out of house and home.  \u0026ldquoOne of the worst areas to suffer was Haddington, where a large number of people were rendered homeless, while shops and business premises were flooded to a depth of several feet.  Meanwhile at West Barns, the Biel Burn overflowed, causing serious damage to houses and shops in the village but fortunately \u0026ldquono loss of life is reported, although some people had narrow escapes, so suddenly did the water levels rise.  The floods also caused serious damage to crops on farms close to the Tyne and extensive damage was also caused to the now-demolished New County Cinema on Hardgate.  Nungate residents who had been enjoying the evening\u0026rsquos film were instructed by cinema management to return home to avoid being cut off as water levels rapidly rose.  And slightly further afield, the electricity supply in Gifford and Saltoun was interrupted, and at the Maltings in Haddington the sub-station was completely swept away. It was anticipated it would take many months for the affected areas to return to normal, and calls for assistance to help with the recovery were issued."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-commodore-of-haddington","story":"  TEENAGERS often get a bad press. To be sure, it\u0026rsquos a time when parents wonder what has happened to their children and feel they have lost them or gone wrong somewhere. This is because teenage years are a time of great change in terms of brain development. Quite literally the teenage brain is being remodelled and new priorities and emotions are created as a result.  It\u0026rsquos a time when peers and their approval become more important than parents or family, or almost anything else. Taking risks, or doing seemingly foolish things, are all part of this. We are familiar with the term \u0026lsquopeer pressure\u0026rsquo, but in our teenage years, approval by our peers and being included by them takes on a massive importance. It is an essential part of growing up and creating a new self-identity.  And a story from over 200 years ago shows that although the word teenager may not have been invented, and that there was no such thing as \u0026lsquoyouth culture\u0026rsquo as we now know it, behaviour was much the same.  It involves a group of young men who we would now call teenagers. They were a group of friends from Haddington. They included George Neill, John and William Haldane who were brothers, Peter Martine, Benjie Hunter and John Davie, whose nickname was \u0026lsquoLettie\u0026rsquo. They were all from Haddington, and their escapade became a story told well into their senior years. The nickname \u0026lsquoCommodore\u0026rsquo was coined for George on this day and stayed with him until he took it to his grave many years later.  Much of the tale is left to the imagination but the essentials were well told. One of the group came up with the idea of hiring a boat and heading out to Fife. These young men were not from poor backgrounds and so had the means to do this. So with the madcap plan devised, they set off as a group to the fishing village of Prestonpans.  The negotiations to hire a boat were concluded and they set off for the foreign shore of Fife, aiming for the town of Kirkcaldy. I cannot comment on their sailing abilities but they must have had some experience for they successfully navigated themselves to the shore of the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo, possibly using the Lomond hills as a marker.  They came ashore like invading Vikings, intent on mischief. No social media in those days, but each town had a drummer who would disseminate news. And so they found Kirkcaldy\u0026rsquos drummer and paid him to announce to the town that at three in the afternoon there would be a spectacular diving and swimming show at the harbour entrance. The drummer set forth announcing the news, creating an air of expectation.  The group chose Lettie to be the performer. He was the best swimmer amongst them. As 3 o\u0026rsquoclock approached, a large excited crowd assembled on the harbour walls. The Haddington lads looked at each other with wry smiles and secret sniggers. Their ruse had worked, perhaps too successfully.  \u0026ldquoShow them what ye can dae, Lettie was told by his friends. And so Lettie stood on the edge of the boat and dived into the sea, from a height of about two feet. The crowd was silent, except for a wee five-year-old girl who clapped. She was the only one impressed by the spectacle.  There were murmurings as the Kirkcaldy folk began to realise they had been duped and were being made a fool of by these young Haddington lads. The mood began to get angry, and boos were followed by threats and words I cannot print here. It was clear it was time to go.  \u0026ldquoThank ye, the lads said, bowing to the crowd and laughing, mocking them for being so gullible. Stones began to fly towards them as they set off back towards Prestonpans, gesturing to the now-furious crowd. The lads in the boat were hysterical with laughter. They had raided and fooled the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo.  But then their laughter stopped. Emerging from the harbour was a boat filled with angry Kirkcaldy lads who were shouting serious threats. The prank looked as if it might end unpleasantly so the Haddington lads had no choice but to row for their lives.  George took command. His friends had nicknamed him the Commodore at the beginning of their voyage, not so much because of his nautical skills but because of his leadership qualities. They were now desperately needed.  \u0026ldquoRow lads, row, he called on them. To be truthful the Haddington lads were at a disadvantage. They were not skilled seamen and in truth they were more bookish than brawn. But fear can do mighty things to a man\u0026rsquos capabilities, and as the adrenaline pumped through their veins they found levels of strength they didn\u0026rsquot know they had. They rowed like true Vikings, heave ho, heave ho. The sea splashed at their feet, their hearts nearly burst, but they kept the pace.  Slowly they began to pull ahead from the Kirkcaldy boat. \u0026ldquoKeep rowing, lads, dinnae look back, dinnae slow doon, called George, who was himself rowing as hard as he could. The tide was strong, the night was drawing in and the weather was beginning to change. The Kirkcaldy boat turned back, but the Haddington lads dare not attempt a Fife landing. They had no choice but to cross the Firth.  Darkness fell, then a thick haar covered them in freezing mist. They rowed through the night not sure in which direction they were headed. They wondered if their parents would ever know what had happened to them if, as now seemed likely, they were lost at sea.  The morning sun slowly burned off the mist. Thankfully they were still in the Firth, and there in front of them was the smoke coming from the lums and salt works of Prestonpans. They wept with relief and summoned up their last drops of energy to row ashore. Their final few hundred metres to the stony beach was watched by village children and women drying clothes.  Some fishermen helped pull the boat to land and the Haddington lads literally collapsed out of the vessel onto the beach, utterly exhausted but elated to be still alive.  George Neill was later to become a well-respected Baillie in Haddington, a bookseller and publisher of great local repute. He outlived his friends who had shared that day of adventure and danger.  He was often asked by those who knew him less well: \u0026ldquoWhy do people call you the Commodore? He never tired of telling the tale of his teenage adventure."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-secondary-schools-delighted-with-pupils-exam-results","story":"  This year saw the best pass rate in Higher exams across East Lothian for five years.  East Lothian Council said that pupils across its six secondary schools \u0026ndash Musselburgh Grammar School Knox Academy, Haddington North Berwick High School Preston Lodge High School in Prestonpans Ross High School, Tranent and Dunbar Grammar School \u0026ndash improved their performances, with the number of Highers passed going up to more than 79 per cent.  Lauren Rodger, headteacher at North Berwick High School, told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results are brilliant and we\u0026rsquore really pleased with how all the current sixth year pupils have performed.  \u0026ldquoI know schools are judged on their exam results, but for us it\u0026rsquos also about seeing the pupils develop \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos the most pleasing part.  Similarly pleased was Paul Reynolds, the Ross High School headteacher.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted with the exam results.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results have been record-breaking and the sixth-years who have just left us have got really positive results that will allow them to hopefully go to uni or further education.  Meanwhile, Musselburgh Grammar School is celebrating record attainment levels for S5 and S6 pupils at all levels in this year\u0026rsquos exam results.  Headteacher Colin Gerrie said that there were also many \u0026ldquoexcellent results achieved by pupils in S4.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe results achieved by our students this year are exceptionally good and continue the successes of recent years, with school records broken on an annual basis.  \u0026ldquoWe do not underestimate the hard work of our pupils and the commitment of our teachers to make this happen.  His counterpart at Preston Lodge High School, Gavin Clark, also gave his thoughts.  At PL, four S5 pupils achieved six As at Higher, although the number of pupils gaining one, two, three or four Highers dropped from the last set of results.  Mr Clark added: \u0026ldquoWe expected that to happen, as a result of our regular tracking process.  \u0026ldquoThis dip in no way diminishes the achievements of those who performed so impressively in examinations.  At Knox Academy, new headteacher Susan Cook gave an update on how the school was performing.  She said: \u0026ldquoSeventy-four per cent of S4 pupils attained five or more qualifications at National 3 69 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 4 and 47 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 5 at grades A-C and 55 per cent at grades A-D.  \u0026ldquoThere were some outstanding individual performances in S4, with eight of our candidates achieving seven A passes at N5.  \u0026ldquoThese results are a really strong foundation to build S5 performance upon and I would encourage all parents/carers to continue to support their child to study at home as the transition from S4 to S5 in terms of challenge and pace moves up a few gears and much more study is required, especially at Higher level.  Meanwhile, the performance of S5 pupils in their Higher exams was down on the previous three years.  Ms Cook added: \u0026ldquoFifty-five per cent attained one or more Highers 35 per cent three or more and 16 per cent attained five or more Highers.  \u0026ldquoTwenty-two of our pupils achieved five Highers and some with straights As across all subjects.  \u0026ldquoMany other pupils achieved a mixture of Higher and National 5 awards and will build upon these in their sixth year.  Finally, there was \u0026ldquoan improving trend for S6 pupils over the last four years at Higher level, Ms Cook added.  The headteacher said: \u0026ldquoThose attaining one or more Highers was 62 per cent and then added to their results from S4 and S5  this rose to 76.22 per cent having achieved one or more Highers over S5/S6 \u0026ndash one per cent lower than last year, which in terms of statistics is not significant. However, it\u0026rsquos more than 13 per cent more than pupils attained in 2015 and 2016.  \u0026ldquoThirty per cent of the year group attained three or more Highers and the accumulate total was 66 per cent .  Finally, Claire Slowther, headteacher at Dunbar Grammar School, told the Courier that the staff at the school were \u0026ldquovery pleased with the exam results and said: \u0026ldquoAt Dunbar Grammar we are very pleased with the SQA results our students have achieved.  \u0026ldquoIt is wonderful to see the hard work of our students be rewarded with great results.  \u0026ldquoOur excellent team of teachers always work hard to support and challenge students and we were all really delighted to see them do well.  \u0026ldquoWe are incredibly proud of the achievements of our students and are looking forward to celebrating these at our awards evening, which will be held on September 12."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-longniddry-south-to-go-on-display","story":"  Developers Cruden Homes  and ZeroC will be displaying their proposals for development at the Longniddry Inn on Wednesday from 3pm to 8pm.

That project came about following rising safety concerns from drivers who did not feel confident using the unlit road.  Since then, driver confidence has improved by 78 per cent, with the project, which was undertaken by UK-based Clearview Intelligence in partnership with Transport Scotland and Amey, shortlisted in the Road Safety, Traffic Management and Enforcement category at the National Transport Awards, which take place in October.  Councillor Norman Hampshire, a Dunbar ward councillor and deputy leader of East Lothian Council, as well as chairman of the A1 Action Group, was one of those hailing the project as a big success.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe installation of the studs has, in my view, revolutionised the driving experience on the A1 after dark.  \u0026ldquoThe studs have improved night-time visibility beyond all recognition along certain parts of the route.  Concerns about driving conditions on the unlit road were first raised by the A1 Action Group, which comprises councillors from Scottish Borders and East Lothian Councils, transportation groups and community councils.  Transport Scotland met with the action group and, upon investigating the road, recognised that entering or exiting the A1 during the hours of darkness was a key area of concern due to a lack of visibility, junction definition and consistency in signage and road markings.  Clearview Intelligence was then appointed by Amey to make improvements to the road as part of a wider project and installed the road studs to give a visual consistency to the route by ensuring all major junctions were visible and treated similarly.  This included using white, red, amber and green studs to effectively highlight road edges, the centre of the road and junctions.  Andy Salotti, director of solutions at Clearview Intelligence, said: \u0026ldquoWe are immensely proud of the work we did to improve the driving conditions on the A1 and delighted this has been recognised at a national level.

The report adds that the house would be \u0026ldquodesigned so that the proposal provides an acceptable solution, preserving and enhancing the character and appearance of the building, which is category B listed.  The application is for a two-storey house, with disabled access from the first floor and a car park on land adjacent to the ground floor.  It is proposed that the upper floor will contain an entrance hall, family  shower room, three bedrooms and an open-plan kitchen/dining room and sitting room, as well as stairs to the ground floor. On the ground floor, there will be a guest bedroom, family shower room, access to the cellar and garage and a drawing room.  The plans have been submitted by agent Tom Pyemont of Hawick-based firm Pyemont Design greenarchitecture on behalf of applicants James Barbour and Alex Dale.  However, when they were discussed by members of North Berwick Community Council earlier this month, members felt that they did not have enough information to make any detailed comment on the planning application.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, ward member, said: \u0026ldquoI think if this was a straightforward planning application there is enough information but because it is a listed building I do not think that there is."},{"url":null,"title":"housing-plans-rejected-at-tranent-field-of-dreams","story":"  Developer Barratt wanted to put 116 homes and 15 business units on an 11-acre site at Kingslaw, Tranent, north of Haddington Road on the town\u0026rsquos eastern edge.  The agricultural land has been earmarked by East Lothian Council for business use but Barratt claimed the council\u0026rsquos vision was financially unviable.  They said the only way to make the \u0026ldquonumbers add up was to create a mixed use site with housing and industry.  But their claims were rejected by councillors after Provost John McMillan , cabinet spokesman on economic development, insisted: \u0026ldquoIf we build it, they will come.  The quote, paraphrasing one made famous in the US baseball movie Field of Dreams starring Kevin Costner, came as he backed council officials who recommended the plans from Barratt and site owners The Co-operative be thrown out.  Jason Watt, from Barratt, told a meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington last Tuesday that site drainage and geology issues meant it would cost \u0026pound1.5m to get ready for development.  Once general costs were taken into account, the total development bill would be \u0026pound2.25m \u0026ndash yet the value of the land was estimated at only \u0026pound1.1m.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe numbers clearly do not add up and never will unless there is cross subsidising with a mixed use development.  Ward councillor Kenny McLeod  backed the Barratt proposal, highlighting the lack of council housing available for rent in Tranent: the proposed Barratt development included 25 per cent affordable housing.  Mr McLeod said: \u0026ldquoWe need to keep the local connection and they are not building housing for rent in this area.  \u0026ldquoIt must be 50 years since a house was put in the area for rent.  However, fellow Tranent, Wallyford and Macmerry councillor Colin McGinn  said he was concerned about the traffic that would be created by more than 100 homes on the site, which is on the opposite side of the town\u0026rsquos Haddington Road from Steading View.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe have a responsibility within Tranent to increase employment and opportunities for our young people.  Councillor Brian Small , opposition leader, told the committee: \u0026ldquoThere is no point in having a [Local Development] Plan if at the first turn we think we can turn it over. We need to give this business land the opportunity to develop.  The committee was told that while the district valuer had agreed with developers that the land was not financially viable as a single business plot, they had said it could be made financially sound by developing it in phases.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoWe have enough land set aside for housing.  \u0026ldquoPeople want \u0026ndashand need \u0026ndash local employment and if we build it they will come. This is a signal to developers we want to grow the number of jobs around the county.  The committee voted by nine votes to two to support the officials\u0026rsquo recommendation to refuse the plans."},{"url":null,"title":"transport-co2-emissions-on-the-rise-in-east-lothian","story":"  The latest data from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has revealed that CO2 emissions from freight and passenger transport rose by 4.2 per cent in the county between 2011 and 2016.  That means traffic was responsible for 18.5 per cent of the total amount of carbon dioxide released in East Lothian in 2016.  But in total, CO2 emissions in the county fell over the same period.  Jason Rose, from East Lothian Greens, blamed more housing developments in East Lothian for the rise in CO2 from emissions relating to transport.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoTo live [in the new developments], you need a car. More houses means more cars.  Mr Rose also highlighted the fact that nearly half of East Lothian residents commute to Edinburgh every day for work.  \u0026ldquoThe main issue is half the people who live in East Lothian work in Edinburgh, so they have to commute, he said.  \u0026ldquoBuses take a long time, you want cheap and reliable.  \u0026ldquoWith trains, there definitely needs to be more of an effort to improve length and frequency.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council should be trying to increase employment in East Lothian, so people don\u0026rsquot need to commute.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove heard some people say, \u0026lsquooh what if you open a bridge here or build another road?\u0026rsquo but creating more roads just increases traffic and spreads the problem around.  Overall, emissions from transport, both private and for business purposes, increased by 3.5 per cent in the UK over the period between 2011 and 2016.  However, total CO2 emissions fell by 4.6 per cent over the five years in East Lothian.  The county was responsible for releasing 1.1 million tonnes of CO2 in 2016 \u0026ndash down from 1.15 million tonnes five years earlier.  But Mr Rose highlighted that it was not just CO2 emissions that needed to be monitored.  \u0026ldquoWe need to watch for NO2  and PM10  \u0026ndash those are the pollutants that can cause health risks, he added.  In East Lothian, industrial and commercial activities are by far the main producer of CO2 emissions, releasing 63.9 per cent of the total. In 2016, households produced 16 per cent of the CO2 in the county, lower than five years earlier.  The Department also takes into account the amount of CO2 produced by farms and through other rural activities and the CO2 removed from the air by trees.  According to its estimates, these agricultural activities produced more greenhouse gases than forests removed, and so were responsible for 1.6 per cent of the carbon emissions in East Lothian in 2016.  Overall, the UK reduced its carbon emissions by 15.4 per cent over the five years."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  We\u0027ll also reveal the Top 25 in this year\u0027s Pet Idol competition.

Duo Gymnastics, based at the Aubigny Sports Centre, Haddington, is keen to buy a new vaulting table, which costs about \u0026pound1,000.  Jane said: \u0026ldquoWhat I have been really impressed with is the way the club and coaches have adapted to him.  \u0026ldquoThere is mainstream gymnastics but they have adapted lessons for his needs.  \u0026ldquoIt has made him not feel different and he still feels part of the club \u0026ndash he really enjoys it.  \u0026ldquoCameron\u0026rsquos disability comes under Global Development Delay.  \u0026ldquoHe has a real difficulty with comprehension and understanding what is being asked of him, following instructions.  \u0026ldquoHe is also very sensitive to noise and sudden loud noises.  \u0026ldquoThat is what they have managed to do really well, break it down into small parts for him.  \u0026ldquoThrough time, it becomes a routine and he understands what is being asked of him.  Jane, who lives near Gifford, has been a keen swimmer for a number of years and represented Scotland in the 1994 Commonwealth Games, in Canada.  However, after a break from swimming she returned to the pool at the beginning of the year before swapping the pool for the sea earlier this summer.  She said: \u0026ldquoI kept swimming as a hobby and to keep fit.  \u0026ldquoI have always swam but it has always been indoor swimming.  \u0026ldquoI started looking about and had always had an interest in open-water swimming but never did it.  \u0026ldquoI came across the Firth of Forth swim and that quite appeals to me and thought I would give it a go.  The mum-of-two signed up in March for the swim, which sees swimmers head off from Hawes Pier and swim alongside the Forth Bridge towards North Queensferry.  Swimmers set off at 2.10pm and have an hour to complete the 1.4-mile swim.  In preparation for the fundraiser on September 22, Jane has taken to the waters off Dumfries and Galloway\u0026rsquos coast and has also linked up with the Bass Rock Swimmers, who are based in North Berwick.  Despite being an accomplished swimmer, Jane said there were still challenges.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe currents are certainly a big factor.  \u0026ldquoIt is just your awareness and you can go off track very easily and just that anticipation of what is below you and what you are swimming over.  \u0026ldquoI have enjoyed the challenge and it has certainly put me out of my comfort zone.  \u0026ldquoI have really enjoyed it and met some really lovely people.  \u0026ldquoMy thanks go to my husband, Garry, and family for support and encourage to take on the challenge and to Duo Gymnastics Club for the support and help they have given Cameron.  Pamela Fletcher, from the gymnastics club, said: \u0026ldquoThanks to Jane undertaking the swim, the club can purchase a new and much needed vaulting table for the gymnastics at Aubigny Sport Centre. Due to local support we have now met our target however donations continue meaning we can hopefully purchase some more equipment.

I\u0026rsquom now in my late 50s, and 60 is looming ahead of me like a cat waiting to pounce and have cruel fun. Yet I know people who are in their 30s and 40s who are much older than me, and folk in their 60s and above who are younger. My oldest daughter is in her early 20s and is already lamenting the fact she is no longer \u0026lsquoyoung\u0026rsquo.  The truth is that age is a mentality or, as is often said, \u0026lsquojust a number\u0026rsquo. Of course, deteriorating health and pain can come with age, as I have experienced, but even then, getting this far makes me very thankful despite the wear and tear.  I often say that life is like toothpaste: we use it with abandon at first and then, as we realise it\u0026rsquos running out, each squirt becomes increasingly more precious and satisfying.  \u0026ldquoA whole summer seems nothing these days, it\u0026rsquos over before you get used to it, a friend said to me recently. And indeed it is nothing if we measure it by days passed.  Yet if we measure not the passing of hours, days or years but the accumulation of memories and experiences, then time seems longer, both in quantity and quality. The trick, then, is to make those experiences and memories, and to truly live in them as they happen. This means understanding what is truly meaningful to us, and what gives genuine joy and fulfilment.  I think that is the secret to a long life, regardless of what number you reach. It\u0026rsquos not just about how much toothpaste is in your tube, it\u0026rsquos about how much you savour and use the amount you have. All of us savour key moments, of course. The first day at school for our children, our holiday time, time with friends or spent doing things we enjoy.  Yet inevitably such moments are less common than what we might call the daily routine of life. I suppose that\u0026rsquos what makes them stand out. Thus the daily routine of \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo life shoots us by, almost without us noticing. And that\u0026rsquos most of our life.  And so I am now more determined than ever to make my life \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo for as long as I may have left. This isn\u0026rsquot a commitment to hippy living in a campervan  but a conscious decision to savour every day as if it were my last. And what really helped me in this realisation was a conversation one day while waiting for a train. . .  One spring morning just before this summer, I was standing on the platform at Prestonpans station waiting for a train. I was not used to getting this early train and was surprised how busy it was. I was heading into Edinburgh to do some storytelling and so unusually sharing my journey with commuters.  It was a beautiful warm sunny morning, the herald of the heatwave soon to arrive. As I waited for the train I scrolled on my phone. Then I heard a voice behind me saying: \u0026ldquoOn your death bed, will you really look fondly back on the countless hours, equivalent to years of your life, spent scrolling on a phone? Will you remember just one per cent of that activity, or even want to?  I turned round to see who was speaking to me there was nobody. Then I noticed the hawthorn tree.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos better, the hawthorn said. It was resplendent with blossom, leaning over the edge of the side of the bridge which takes the cars below the station.  Perhaps I had seen it before, but this time I really noticed it because it had spoken to me. I studied its flowers and took in the immense beauty of it. It\u0026rsquos perfectly situated to admire, but the hawthorn seemed sad.  \u0026ldquoCan you imagine the effort it takes to get this magnificent and beautiful? it said. \u0026ldquoYet nobody seems to notice me.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure they do, I replied. \u0026ldquoNo, they don\u0026rsquot watch, insisted the tree. And so I did.  The hawthorn was right. People walked past the tree, stood next to it, but nobody seemed to notice it, and certainly nobody took any time to admire it.  \u0026ldquoBut they are busy, I said in our defence.  \u0026ldquoWe are all busy in different ways, said the tree. \u0026ldquoBut we can choose to be \u0026lsquotoo busy\u0026rsquo for some things while being busy doing others. Often you decide what is important to be busy with so you exclude what you think are the less important things.  \u0026ldquoLike looking and admiring you? I replied sarcastically.  \u0026ldquoPrecisely, said the hawthorn, perhaps not understanding a sarcastic tone.  Suddenly the train arrived. People put away their phones and I bade a hasty farewell to the tree. We all crammed into the carriage and it filled up to the brim. I saw the blazing white of the hawthorn\u0026rsquos blossom through the window. Then we headed for Wallyford.  The train ground to a halt and the doors opened. There was a crush and people calling out politely \u0026ldquoplease move up. I wondered if everyone would get on, and I think they did, but only just. Now the train felt overloaded and it literally ground its way out of the station.  When it arrived at Musselburgh, the doors opened to present a human wall made of commuters from the Pans and Wallyford. There was simply no way anyone was getting on. I watched from the privilege of my seat. Two young men with suitcases, obviously going on holiday had no chance, and didn\u0026rsquot even try.  As the train pulled away, leaving dozens of people stranded on the platform, I felt a sense of guilt at having a seat. At Waverley we were trapped in a bottleneck by ticket collectors, ensuring that none of the lucky ones who had actually managed to get onto the train would escape paying for their good fortune.  When I returned I had to cross the bridge to my car. And there was the hawthorn tree, showing off its blossom like a peacock trying to impress a mate with its feather display.  And I have noticed the hawthorn ever since. The blossom faded as summer arrived and now it bears it berries. Its haws glisten where once there was blossom, reminding me that summer has had its course, and asking the question of how I made it memorable.  I am so thankful for the hawthorn\u0026rsquos advice. It was simple but so important. The trick is to live in the moment to notice that which makes the mundane and normal extraordinary or beautiful or special.  We can pepper our daily life with simple but extraordinary moments of connection, so a day never really remains \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo. We just have to truly live in that moment, to come out of our busyness and worries, and savour it.  Maybe the hawthorn tree will speak to you if ever you find yourself at Prestonpans train station. Or maybe someone else will your child, your grandchild, your partner, friends, your grandparents, your work colleague, or perhaps your inner self.  Maybe it wasn\u0026rsquot actually the tree which spoke to me. Perhaps it was my inner self. But then again, perhaps it was a speaking hawthorn, and you have to be \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo to hear it!"},{"url":null,"title":"leader-of-councils-conservative-opposition-steps-down-after-health-issues","story":"  Councillor Brian Small, who has held the position since being one of seven Conservative councillors elected in May 2017, stood down for a brief period last year following a severe bout of sepsis before returning to the post.

Not to be left out, Harry made a \u0026ldquopinky pledge with the seven-year-old during a reception before the awards ceremony began,\u0026nbsphooking his little finger around the girl\u0026rsquos matching digit.  Mrs Booth said the royal urged her daughter, who wants to be a nurse, to\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquonever stop smiling as you\u0026rsquove got a beautiful smile.  When Matilda\u0026nbspbrought out her soft-toy pug, she told the duke and duchess, who wore a trouser suit by Altuzarra and a Deitas blouse, it was named after talent show mogul\u0026nbspSimon Cowell.  Mrs Booth, whose daughter recently turned seven and\u0026nbspwon the inspirational child award in the four to six-year-old category, said: \u0026ldquoHarry said, \u0026lsquoI can see the resemblance\u0026rsquo.  Meghan\u0026rsquos first appearance at the event saw her interacting with all the winners, sharing jokes, a hug and receiving gifts along with her husband.  Melissa Granger, 15, from St Helens,\u0026nbspwho has Angelman syndrome which leaves her needing 24-hour care, hugged the royal couple as her brother Jacob, 18, watched.  He was given the most caring young person award for helping to look after his sister.  Mckenzie Brackley, from Fife, has also been hailed as inspirational.  The four-year-old, who had to learn to speak, swallow, eat and drink and move again due to acute flaccid paralysis, was praised for being there for other children when they are scared or sad.  \u0026ldquoDespite his own problems, Mckenzie cheers up everyone when they are low, and is guaranteed to put a smile on your face, WellChild said.  Harry has been patron of WellChild \u0026ndash the national charity for seriously ill\u0026nbspchildren and their families \u0026ndash since 2007 and regularly attends the annual awards ceremony.  In a foreword for the event\u0026rsquos official programme, he wrote: \u0026ldquoThis evening, we are celebrating remarkable stories of hope, resilience and selflessness.  \u0026ldquoThe children and young people you will meet tonight are coping with challenges few of us can imagine, yet they inspire those around with such positivity and determination every day.  He also\u0026nbsphighlighted the nurses, consultants and other health professionals \u0026ldquowho have dedicated their lives to giving children and young people with serious health needs the very best chance to thrive and flourish.  The duke said about the growing number of young people living with long-term, complex health needs: \u0026ldquoWith WellChild\u0026rsquos help they can be cared for at home instead of living in hospital, and families can be properly supported."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8546609.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"mystery-book-sculptor-strikes-again","story":"  The anonymous artist sent her latest work to St Mary\u0026rsquos Music School on the first day of the new term.

The first of a series of mystery sculptures \u0026ndash in this case a paper tree \u0026ndash was found by staff in the Scottish Poetry Library in March 2011.  Since then they have been left in libraries, bookshops and museums in the Scottish capital, in support of the arts.  St Mary\u0026rsquos said the sculpture was a show of support for the campaign to relocate the school to the former Royal High School building on Calton Hill, according to a note accompanying the work.  Developers want to turn the site into a luxury hotel and an inquiry to determine its future is scheduled to begin this month.  An excerpt from the note reads: \u0026ldquoThe Old Royal High School was designed and built with enlightenment and education in mind, with a hope for the future.  \u0026ldquoAs St Mary\u0026rsquos Music School, that legacy would continue. In the heart of the city, up on the hill, a centre of musical excellence would speak of the importance of music and music education to every child\u0026rsquos life.  The sculpture arrived at the school in a box and was opened by head teacher Dr Kenneth Taylor, who said pupils were \u0026ldquodelighted with the gift.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are greatly encouraged by the support we have received from her, members of the public in Edinburgh and many high-profile figures in the music and arts communities.

Mr Kyl\u0026rsquos appointment will make it possible for him to vote for the nomination.  It is unclear what more the 76-year-old will do in the Senate.  He said he agreed to serve briefly out of a \u0026ldquosense of duty and will not run for the seat in 2020, when Arizona voters will decide who fills the seat until 2022.          Jon Kyl is a dear friend of mine and John\u0026rsquos.

Governor Doug Ducey, also a Republican, said Mr Kyl was \u0026ldquothe best possible person, regardless of politics for the job, and he hopes Mr Kyl serves past the end of the year.  If Mr Kyl does leave the Senate after the end of the current congressional term on January 3, Arizona\u0026rsquos governor can appoint another senator for the remaining year.  By state law the senator will have to be a member of the same party as the departing one, in this case the GOP.  For now, Mr Kyl will pad Republicans\u0026rsquo margin in the narrowly divided Senate.  They hold a 51-49 majority but that dwindled to a single vote while Mr McCain stayed in Arizona for much of this year being treated for the brain cancer that killed him on August 25.  The GOP is hoping Mr Kyl will be a more reliable partisan vote than Mr McCain, whose opposition to a partial repeal of Barack Obama\u0026rsquos healthcare law pitched the party into turmoil last year.  Mr Kyl is well-respected in Arizona and has been able to avoid many of the battles with activists that complicated Mr McCain\u0026rsquos career and that of the state\u0026rsquos other senator, Jeff Flake, who is retiring because his feud with Mr Trump made his re-election impossible.  Mr Kyl\u0026rsquos entire career in Washington overlapped with Mr McCain\u0026rsquos, and he served with the state\u0026rsquos senior senator for three terms before stepping down.  He carved out a profile as a reliable conservative vote and a foreign policy expert.  Mr McCain\u0026rsquos widow, Cindy, tweeted: \u0026ldquoJon Kyl is a dear friend of mine and John\u0026rsquos. It\u0026rsquos a great tribute to John that he is prepared to go back into public service to help the state of Arizona.  Doug Cole, a veteran Republican consultant and former McCain aide, said Mr Kyl was a safe pick.  \u0026ldquoI think McCain would be very happy with the pick. Honours his legacy while putting some major horsepower for Arizona in the seat, at least for now, he said.  A lawyer, Mr Kyl speaks in a formal, reserved manner that is a sharp contrast to Mr Trump, and he belongs to an older, less populist vanguard of the GOP.

During his time back in the Senate, Mr Kyl will have the opportunity to vote on several issues that have been involved in his lobbying activities, from immigration to national security.  Mr Kyl has lobbied on behalf of young immigrants brought to the US illegally as children, often called Dreamers, whose fate is in limbo after Mr Trump tried to end an Obama-era programme protecting them from deportation and Congress deadlocked on a solution.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In lengthy posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be, if not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to return to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But if this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But if Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8486553.jpg?type=article-full","title":"five-women-in-business-speak-out","story":"  All women can think of another woman who has inspired her to try a career in business, education or industry.

It seemed the perfect job Helen didn\u0026rsquot drink yet was interested in finding out more about the process. Little did she know it would take her life in a whole new direction.  Rather than viewing distilling as chemical engineering, Helen found it felt far more artistic - all based on the creative expression of how it looks, smells and tastes. After inheriting an old family book detailing how her relatives used to distil on the family farm, Helen realised distilling was part of her history and heritage.    With derelict out-buildings on her family\u0026rsquos farm, Helen had a fresh appreciation for these old spaces once viewed as a millstone around her neck. Buildings that were near fresh spring water, surrounded by botanicals created a unique opportunity.  Gin attracted Helen initially as the old distilling manual described how people used to flavour spirits with whatever was around them. The farm had a wealth of natural botanicals, including Scottish juniper, so suddenly this untapped heather hill was incredibly valuable.  The gin is named Badvo, after Helen\u0026rsquos family farm where the stories of distilling inspired Helen when starting out. The heron logo represents the fresh spring water used, as only a very pure spring can support enough fish for a heron. To fund the start-up, Helen pre-sold the first batch of 105 bottles collectively for \u0026pound6,500, going on to use the money to unlock match funding, which snowballed until the entire distillery was grant funded.    Helen commented: \u0026ldquoI got a lot of flak for being a solo entrepreneur. Yes, there are downsides to being a one-man band, but it gives you the opportunity to be dynamic. You can make a decision and you don\u0026rsquot have to justify it to anyone or get it past any board.  \u0026ldquoIt hurts occasionally when people assume someone else set up the distillery as I am too young or too female to have accomplished this alone. I just don\u0026rsquot think some people can comprehend how you can cover so much ground at this stage in life, but I think this is the perfect time.

On the contrary, her peer group expected that students of both sexes could progress to further education, and into careers of our choice. This certainly was Julie\u0026rsquos experience.    Graduating from Glasgow University, Bachelor of Laws with Honours in 1993, Julie then went on to complete the required post-graduate Diploma in Legal Practice in 1994. A legal Traineeship commenced immediately, and she was formally admitted as a solicitor in 1995, at the age of 23. By 27, Julie had been promoted to partner. At that time, she was one of the youngest female partners in a law firm in Scotland. By 2015, more than 60 per cent of solicitors under the age of 40, practising in Scotland, were women \u0026ndash unimaginable in 1995, far less in 1918. For the following 11 years, Julie practised a wide range of areas of law and managed three of her firm\u0027s\u0026nbspbranch offices. She was in charge of HR, and worked long hours.  In 2010, Julie decided to leave the relative security of her large firm behind. Seeking a better work/life balance, she set up her own firm \u0026ndash Millen Solicitors.

A fund-raising campaign to continue his legal battle to remain in the UK has raised over \u0026pound17,000 Adoboli who is Ghanaian, but has lived in the UK since the age of 12, does not hold British citizenship.    The 38-year-old, who describes himself as British, has since his release from jail given many talks to students, financial traders and others in the banking industry about how to operate ethically and avoid making the mistakes he made.  He had been reporting once a month to the Home Office and had feared that he may be arrested in preparation for deportation after he was denied permission to judicially review the deportation proceedings.  Adoboli has appealed, asking the home secretary, Sajid Javid, not to deport him because of his longstanding ties with the UK and the fact that he is working hard to educate people to avoid making the same mistakes he made at UBS.

The equivalent figure for the UK was 74 per cent.  Nearly 70 per cent of Scots also want universities to expand the recruitment of international students in future compared to 58 per cent in the rest of the UK.  When asked how long international students should be allowed to stay, 60 per cent of Scots said it should be at least two years.  The survey by Universities UK comes as the body launches new proposal for a post-study work visa for international students.  The proposed arrangements would allow international students to work in the UK for up to two years after graduating.  Currently, there are strict eligibility rules for post-study work in the UK, involving high costs for both students and employers and ious time restrictions.  Universities are also concerned that the impact of Brexit will see fewer students from EU countries.  Universities UK said the scheme would allow more employers in Scotland to access talented graduates from around the word, addressing workforce shortages and skills gaps in many sectors and industries.  It would also make Scotland a more attractive destination for international students and graduates and allow it to compete with countries who have more attractive post-study work policies, such as the USA and Australia.  This summer, Australia overtook the UK\u0026rsquos market share for international students for the first time pushing the UK into third place for international student recruitment.  Professor Richard Williams, principal of Heriot-Watt University and convener of Universities Scotland\u0026rsquos international committee, said: \"Scotland is a sought after study destination and the country benefits educationally, socially, culturally and economically from talented international students.  \"We could all benefit more if students from overseas were allowed to stay on after they graduate and work for a few years before returning home.  \"As a welcoming and inclusive nation, Scotland has much to gain from international students with high-level skills. We know there is support for this amongst employers as well as the public.\"  Universities UK new policy proposal comes in the same month as the Migration Advisory Committee is expected to publish its recommendations on following a length consultation into the impact of international students in the UK.  The study, conducted by ComRes, interviewed 4,302 adults across the UK and Northern Ireland in August this year.  Other findings included the fact only one quarter of respondents viewed an international student coming to study at a UK university as an \"immigrant\".  The study concluded: \"British adults are more likely to think of people other than students or researchers as immigrants.\"  Some 35 per cent of respondents across the UK said they wanted to see more international students, 40 per cent wanted numbers to stay the same and 13 per cent wanted fewer.  In January a report suggested international students generate nearly \u0026pound2 billion to the Scottish economy in tuition fees and wider spending.  The report by London Economics, on behalf of the Higher Education Policy Institute, found overseas students at Scottish universities generated \u0026pound1.94 billion.

He will further explain how Oxford University research estimates that there are around 120,000 undocumented migrant children in the UK, over half of whom were born in the UK.  This, Mr McDonald will argue, suggests many will have a right to register as British citizens and be impacted by the fees.  Amnesty International and The Children\u0027s Society are among those campaigning for an end to the high charges.  \u0026ldquoThe UK Government must scrap the extortionate and ever-increasing fees it is charging children to access their legal right to register as British citizens, declared the SNP MP.  \u0026ldquoIt is deeply immoral for the Home Office to be exploiting and profiteering from young people who have every right to be here as full and equal members of our society.  \u0026ldquoThousands of children, who are born and grow up in the UK, are now facing huge financial barriers to having their rightful citizenship recognised because of soaring fees introduced by Tory ministers, as part of their hostile approach to immigration.  Mr McDonald said the prohibitive fees and legal costs now involved in the application process were putting citizenship out of reach for too many children, particularly those living in disadvantaged and low income families.  \u0026ldquoThis indefensible Tory policy amounts to a citizen tax and risks leaving young people in a precarious status without the vital protections that citizenship affords such as freedom from immigration control and access to student finance, employment, housing, social security, healthcare, and other important services.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe appalling treatment of these children is yet another example of the damaging impact hostile Tory immigration policies are having on our society and another reason why immigration powers must be devolved to the Scottish Parliament, so Scotland can create a system that meets our needs and values.  The Home Office has said that above-cost immigration fees are maintained in order to raise funds for the wider immigration system."},{"url":null,"title":"two-thirds-satisfied-with-public-transport-survey","story":"  The study of transport and travel habits found 69% were very or fairly satisfied with public transport, a decrease from 72% in 2016.  The Scottish Household Survey 2017 found there here were 98 million passengers carried by ScotRail in 2017-18, an increase on 94 million in the previous year.  Train use was found to be more common in higher income households, with 42% of respondents with a household income of more than \u0026pound40,000 using the train in the past month compared with only 23% of survey respondents with a household income of less than \u0026pound10,000.  It was also found that bus use was most common among younger people, with 68% of 16 to 19-year-olds saying they had used the bus in the past month, compared to 53% of those in their 70s and 43% of people in their 80s.  The annual survey found the majority of travellers in Scotland continue to make most of their journeys by car.  Cars and vans were used for 65% of journeys in 2017 - 52% as driver and 13% as a passenger.  The percentage of people who would consider buying an electric car or van increase to 41% in 2017, up 5% from the previous year.  Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said: \"The figures today highlight the work we must continue in order to develop a greener and more sustainable transport network here in Scotland.  \"I am confident that the policies of this government will bring us closer to that goal than ever before. There is much we can welcome in the areas of rail and aviation - and encouraging signs that perceptions around electric vehicles continue to improve.  \"We are matching increasing rail demand with extra capacity and we are continuing to spend over \u0026pound250 million a year to support our vital bus industry, working with operators to keep fares at affordable levels, and providing free bus travel to older and disabled passengers - where we have recently confirmed there will be no change to the age of eligibility for concessionary travel.\"  Walking accounted for another 21% of journeys, public transport 11% and cycling 1.5%.  Most of the journeys people made were short in duration and distance, with more than half under 5km in distance and over two thirds lasting less than 20 minutes.  The median car journey was 6.8km, and the median walking journey was 0.9km.  The main reasons for travel were commuting and shopping but where people had used online shopping to have goods delivered to their home, they reported a reduction in travel made the next day in 73% of cases.  Mr Matheson added: \"While we are maintaining performance for walking and cycling, we are confident that the doubling of the active travel budget will help our partners deliver impactful infrastructure and behavioural change programmes which will revolutionise how we think about getting around, improving how we feel about our urban environment - benefiting our health, communities and our economy.  \"I have witnessed a great deal of commitment and determination on the part of operators to further improve the services we use every day here in Scotland - and I want to thank the commitment of our public transport workers who strive every day to keep Scotland moving.  \"This government will continue to support our essential public transport network and work to bring about a more sustainable transport system for all.\""},{"url":null,"title":"politics-faces-huge-uncertainty-as-new-divisions-emerge-holyroods-presiding-officer-says","story":"  Ken Macintosh, whose role is similar to that of the Speaker of the House of Commons, said it was not for politicians alone to solve the issues facing Scotland and the UK.

Due to past alcohol misuse, coupled with a previous conviction and mobility issues, he has found it difficult to get back in to employment.                                                     Joe has been on Fair Start Scotland for six weeks.  Through his vocational profiling talks with his adviser he identified his Job Goals and opportunities for finding work.         He has a previous experience in construction and contacts in the industry, so he felt he could secure work in this sector with some support. In agreement with his adviser, Joe felt that getting a Construction Skills Certification Scheme  card and gaining skills in Portable Appliance Testing  would be the best start to his journey to find work. With this combined training behind him, he could seek work which would involve inspection for minor defects or omissions in building works coupled with testing electrical equipment. Joe has now passed his CSCS training and got his Site Operative card, completed Control of Substances Hazardous to Health  training and updated his employability skills.                                                                                                          Joe’s Fair Start Scotland advisor helped him in setting up his ‘Find A Job’ account and supported him with job searching. Going forward, Joe will continue his journey to find a job that suits his circumstances. Joe said: “So far I have found Fair Start Scotland helpful and my adviser has been encouraging and supportive. I’ve done training I didn’t know about like basic IT skills, and updated my skills in construction and health and safety.”Fair Start ScotlandFair Start Scotland is Scotland’s new devolved employment support service. It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.                                                                                                        Launched in April this year, the service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is voluntary. This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose – choosing to participate won’t affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions. The service is based on partnership and joint working between the Scottish Government, and the public, third and private sectors to deliver better outcomes for people seeking employment support. Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: “We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential. “As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.”                                                                                                        To find out more and check whether you are eligible, visit www.mygov.scot/fairstart                "},{"url":null,"title":"Bower author helping Norn become the norm","story":"COMMON words and phrases used by Caithnessians may be thought of by locals as slang terms \u0026ndash but, by using them, they may have been reviving a dead language.Bower author Elspeth Grace Hall is doing her bit to revive the language of Norn that was once widely spoken in Caithness.Norn was officially declared a \u0026ldquodead language by world heritage body the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization .However, Grace Hall has been bringing about a revival of the region\u0026rsquos native tongue by writing a series of children\u0026rsquos workbooks to teach kids how to read and write in Norn.If Elspeth is successful in helping to increase the numbers of Norn speakers in Caithness, UNESCO could reverse its death declaration.They had once delivered a similar verdict on Kernowek \u0026ndash the native language of south-west English county, Cornwall.But in 2010, UNESCO announced that its former classification of the language as \u0026ldquoextinct was \u0026ldquono longer accurate.Grace Hall said: \u0026ldquoIf you have ever sat \u0026lsquoO a benk\u0026rsquo, fed the \u0026lsquoscorries\u0026rsquo, told your \u0026lsquomannie\u0026rsquo off for being a \u0026lsquoloon\u0026rsquo or simply popped off \u0026lsquotill\u0026rsquo the shops you have been speaking a second language \u0026ndash one that officially doesn\u0026rsquot even exist.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always been intrigued by languages and the Caithness dialect is wonderfully rich.\u0026ldquoI started to investigate the etymology of words unique to Caithness and found that they weren\u0026rsquot part of Scots, English or Gaelic, they were in fact Norn.

Some reports suggest it may be more than just a fanciful notion.When first contacted by Wick historian Harry Gray about the recent restoration of the \"Iron Wellie\", we had visions of a giant Wellington boot unearthed from the Caithness moors. That theory was firmly booted into touch after a visit to this unearthed marvel on the northern side of Wick Bay.The Iron Wellie is in fact a spring water well situated down a flight of recently restored Caithness flagstone steps close to the Soldiers\u0027 Tower on the North Head.Charlie Bain of Wick Paths Group explained how together with Denny Swanson, Tommy Munro and others from the Royal British Legion Scotland they recently restored the site of the spring.\"The steps down to it were overgrown and damaged,\" he said. \"We also replaced the pipe the water flows through and there is a marker stone at the top of the steps.\"Denny Swanson said he remembered bringing the water to his mother who suffered from arthritis for most of her life.\"She sent me down every second day for a bottle of \u0027Iron Wellie water\u0027, as she called it. She maintained it helped her arthritis and it certainly seemed to take some of her pain away.\"After Harry symbolically cut a ribbon of barricade tape the group, together with Charlie\u0027s dog Jet, went down for a taste of the water that many in the area depended on in bygone times. It is speculated that the inhabitants of nearby Tinkers\u0027 Cave would have consumed the water. The Wick worthy Tudor James resided close to the site and lived to a ripe old age.Harry said that the Iron Wellie was also known as the Chalybeate Spring and its taste has been described like \"sookin\u0027 pennies\".\"Chalybeate waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral waters containing salts of iron \u0026ndash hence the local name Iron Wellie,\" he said.\"There is no written history of this well but it was certainly known in the 18th century and by the turn of the 20th century it was sometimes referred to as \u0027Jocky Simpson\u0027s Wellie\u0027. Who Jocky Simpson was, is lost in time.\"Harry said that \"generations of Wickers\" out for a walk along the braes or exiles home on holiday would nearly always stop for a drink from the wellie.\"We as youngsters firmly believed that the water did us good despite the taste and it was a welcome drink when playing around the North Head or when fishing or swimming from the rocks,\" he said.\"Young lads get hungry and we would sneak a turnip from Bob Cormack\u0027s field above the wellie, dock it on a stab [for the uninitiated that means removing the ends of the neep by striking it against a fence post] and we then cut off the skin and washed the neep in the Iron Wellie water before sitting on a rock and devouring it.\"Harry laughed at how present-day health and safety regulations would make drinking the water seem like a risky act \"but none of us became ill or died from it, perhaps proving the efficacy of the wellie\u0027s water\".Perhaps in the future Wick will host thousands of pilgrims queuing up for a taste of the rejuvenating powers of the Iron Wellie water.Tuesday 4 Sep 2018 9:49

Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Tuesday 4 Sep 2018 9:49 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117256.jpg","title":"Norse era in Caithness was our very own Game of Thrones","story":"He has taken some of the most dramatic events from a time when the county was the southern part of the Orkney earldom and condensed them into a rollicking, fast-moving narrative in The Katanes Saga .It is based on a series of articles published in the John O\u0026rsquoGroat Journal over a decade ago, reinterpreting source material from ious sagas, and follows on from The Raven Banner, published in the mid-1990s and now out of print.

I then discovered Sweyn Asleifarson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being knifed in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Tuesday 4 Sep 2018 9:49 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people. These include social work, police, education, the Scottish Children\u0026rsquos Reporter Administration and Children\u0026rsquos Hearings Scotland.No new panel member begins sitting on hearings without a thorough training being delivered beforehand. For any new Caithness trainees, the training takes place in Inverness.Panel member and trainer Christine Stone said: \u0026ldquoIt has been a great privilege to serve as a volunteer on the Children\u0026rsquos Panel for over 18 years and there are others residing within Caithness who have served for more than 20 years.

Brian, who was awarded a British Empire Medal in June this year in recognition of his services to military history in Orkney said: “Many people have dedicated time and energy to gathering photos over a period of 20 years or more and would like to see the collection completed as far as possible for the centenary of the Armistice on 11 November this year.“Having a nearly complete set of images of all the Orcadians lost would be a most poignant way for our community to mark this anniversary and a wonderful resource for future generations.”It’s believed 578 Orcadians died serving in the Great War and the Legion’s collection, available to view on their website, contains photos of just over half — 297 — of those lost.The council’s call comes as part of Orkney’s First World War commemoration programme, which is being coordinated by the council with invaluable contributions and support from local organisations community groups and individuals.As part of a series of events, on November 11, Orkney will participate in a national commemorative event that involves as many photos of local lives lost in the war as can be found and the participation of their families, a further reason for trying to complete the collection.Lucy Gibbon from the council’s Library and Archive service said there may well be much sought-after photos in people’s attics and family memorabilia collections: “Whilst very few people had a camera during the Great War, nearly all towns had photo studios. Most servicemen visited one of these while training in the UK.”“If you know you lost an Orcadian relative in the war, now is a great time to find out more about them. The Orkney Library \u0026amp Archive might have some items to help shed light on their story.”The Legion’s photo archive has been made possible thanks to the generosity and hard work of many — for example around half of the photos have been sourced from The Orcadian, which has published photos sent in by families in a feature called Our Roll of Honour during the Great War.Other notable contributors and donators over the years include Tom Gibson of Rousay, Beatrice Thomson of North Ronaldsay, Mabel Eunson of Deerness and the late Margaret Watters of Stenness, Bill Miller of Stronsay, Phyllis Gee of Flotta, and George Esson who spent two decades visiting families in South Ronaldsay and Burray seeking photos of loved ones lost in the war, and with the help of and David Mackie and Colin Rendall made copies for the Orkney Library and Archive.These and many more contributors are noted on the project’s website — where people can also view images in the collection by Parish and by significant battles.Anyone with photos they believe are not already included in the Legion’s collection is urged to contact Brian Budge on phone 01856 872225 and email brian.budge@btinternet or to drop into the Orkney Library and Archive in Kirkwall.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This is a deal with one of the biggest names in international air travel, and we see it as the start of a partnership that will develop into a full codeshare agreement later in the year.”Gokhan Haciibrahimoglu, general manager of Turkish Airlines Scotland said: “We are pleased to be working with Loganair for our flights operating from Edinburgh Airport, thus giving Turkish Airlines the opportunity to extend its network and better serve Scotland. Our partnership will allow both of our passengers to easily connect with the regional airports of North and West Scotland to over 304 destinations and 122 countries.”The move is the latest in Loganair’s Better Connected programme, which aims to provide the Scottish airline’s key destinations with a wide range of links both for local community travelling worldwide \u0026#8211 but just as importantly to also enable incoming visitors, whether for tourism or business, to enjoy ease of booking and ease of access.Deals have already been signed with Air France, Dutch giants KLM, Emirates, Thomas Cook Airlines, and customers can through-ticket and through-check baggage where flights connect at Glasgow, Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Inverness and Norwich. Single ticket booking for ongoing flights with more than one carrier offers multiple benefits including through check-in, protected connections in the event of delays and, importantly, the APD saving on flights from the Highlands and Islands which can be as much as £78 per person if connecting onwards to long-haul destinations.The partnerships with KLM and Air France allow passengers from all Loganair’s Highlands \u0026amp Islands destinations to travel via Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow or Inverness onto KLM flights to Amsterdam and from there to destinations worldwide and via Aberdeen and Edinburgh to Air France flights to Paris Charles de Gaulle and again onwards to destinations worldwide.The deal with Thomas Cook Airlines allows holiday connections from the Highlands and Islands via Glasgow to destinations including the USA, and the same will apply to Emirates services to the Middle East and to the Far East and Australia.The Thomas Cook partnership also provides long-haul connections from Inverness and Norwich via Manchester to destinations including New York, Los Angeles, Boston, San Francisco, Seattle, Orlando and Las Vegas on a single ticket.It also complements codeshare arrangements Loganair already has in place with British Airways and its partner airlines at Manchester, offering connectivity to transatlantic routes, including Chicago and Philadelphia, with onward connections throughout the US.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It sounds like a long time, but my experience of these things is that it catches up on you very quickly and there’s a lot of work to do between now and then.”Excellent communication and interpersonal skills, in addition to good team-working are vital attributes. However, notably, an interest in sport is not essential.The voluntary services of personnel with experience in event planning, fundraising and sponsorship, business and project management, procurement, marketing and PR, communication and strategic planning, are also being sought.Mr Deans added: “We’re looking for people with the skills, but they really need that long-term commitment and time to devote to this.”Recruitment information and an online application can be found at www.oiga.org.uk/organising-committee-recruitment-statement/For further information, and any queries, email info@oiga.org.uk.The deadline for applications is Saturday, September 29.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There’s that fudgy sweetness that characterises the more mature Highland Park, but here it’s combined with complex aromatic spices as well as dark chocolate orange and floral peat notes.

This will briefly divert cars onto the adjacent railway track and back again at set windows during the day when trains are not passing by.But motorists who miss one of the windows could face waits of up to two-and-a-half hours for the next one.And this has prompted Highland Council to urge drivers to make sure they plan their journey and allow enough travel time so they are not caught out.A council spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoWe have worked closely with Network Rail and our contractor TRAC Engineering Ltd to keep disruption to road users to a minimum when the road\u0026ldquoBut inevitably there will be times when road users will face longer waits \u0026ndash so we urge people to plan their travel carefully and avoid the periods when the diversion is not going to be available.During the works the road will be closed overnight to all traffic between the two gates between 10pm and 7am.Traffic control measures will operate between 7am and 10pm while the road-to-rail bypass is installed. This could take up to two weeks, but may be finished sooner.Once the temporary bypass is installed, the timetable of opening slots between trains will take effect.Cards showing details of the timetable that will be operating for the road to rail diversion have been distributed among local communities.Copies are also available at the Highland Council website by searching for Stromeferry Bypass at www.highland.gov.ukThe road-to-rail bypass will be available for use between 7am and 10pm, but only by traffic weighing less than seven-and-a-half tonnes .Traffic above those limits will have to divert along the A87, A82, A832 and A890.The council believes the restrictions and roadworks will be finished by November 24, when the A890 will fully reopen.Tuesday 4 Sep 2018 9:50 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Detailed measures will be presented next week.Leaders of the minority independent administration said every attempt would be made to minimise the impact on services but \u0026ldquosome impact on service is inevitable.Budget leader Alister Mackinnon said: \u0026ldquoOur  reserves of \u0026pound8 million are well below the minimum recommended by Audit Scotland and it\u0026rsquos vital that they\u0026rsquore not depleted further. The committee agreed stricter controls on recruitment and overtime, a review of all agency appointments and tighter controls on staff travel.The \u0026pound5.1 million figure equates to one per cent of the total budget and compares with a \u0026pound2.7 million estimate at this stage last year. The potential overspend is blamed on high cost placements for \u0026lsquolooked-after children\u0026rsquo, lower income from new parking charges and fewer savings from toilet closures because those two policies have not yet taken full effect.Council chiefs insisted no staff jobs were at risk.Finance director Derek Yule, however, warned there were \u0026ldquono more rabbits to be pulled from hats to tackle the problems.Black Isle Liberal Democrat Gordon Adam blamed Scottish Government grant cuts while SNP city councillor Richard Laird said the crisis was \u0026ldquoentirely of this council\u0026rsquos making.Council leader Margaret Davidson claimed local government services were \u0026ldquonot a priority for the Scottish Government.The budget leader angered the SNP benches, accusing group leader Maxine Smith of not fully participating in budget discussions. He said he invited her to meetings but had been turned down \u0026ldquobecause she views her private commitments more important than reorganising her diary.She was not in the chamber to respond. In a later statement she said: \u0026ldquoOn Friday, I received a request to attend a meeting on Monday to discuss the budget. I had commitments but they were pre-arranged meetings with constituents. I\u0026rsquove sent him a meeting request for tomorrow. I\u0026rsquom available any time, so hopefully he\u0026rsquoll re-arrange his diary. On the budget, our job in opposition is to scrutinise.A spokesman for the Scottish Government said: \u0026ldquoHighland Council has had more this year despite UK government cuts to our budget. It will receive over \u0026pound487 million Scottish Government funding in 2018-19.n Support was voiced for a city councillor who has quit as the SNP\u0026rsquos deputy leader on Highland Council.Richard Laird  cited health reasons for his decision. He will remain a Central Ward councillor. He said: \u0026ldquoMy health isn\u0026rsquot good enough. That\u0026rsquos the reason I\u0026rsquom stepping down. For the last year or so, both my physical health and my mental health have been in decline. I\u0026rsquove been told by the doctor to reduce my workload a bit.SNP group leader Maxine Smith said: \u0026ldquoI am saddened that Richard has had to step down as depute group leader, as we have worked well together. His illness has been creeping up on him for some time and he feels he needs time to rest, so removing the huge responsibility of chairing a strategic committee is a sensible thing to do. Richard will continue to be a valued member of our group. He is a highly intelligent man, who has lots more to give.Tuesday 4 Sep 2018 9:50 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The campaign was highlighted earlier this year by the Ross-shire Journal when riders revealed their concerns.After meeting campaigners near Cullicudden, Miss Forbes said: \u0026ldquoIn a rural place like the Black Isle it\u0026rsquos not surprising to see horse riders. Despite that, I was really disappointed to hear that drivers usually drive too close and too fast when passing a horse. There is evidently a lot of work to do in educating drivers about overtaking horses and the serious dangers of scaring horses.\u0026ldquoSadly, horse riders told me that they believe the roads are increasingly dangerous for horse riding, despite horse riders having equal access to the road. I support these horse riders on the Black Isle who want to raise awareness of how to overtake horses and ensure that riders don\u0026rsquot fear for their safety when riding in a rural place like the Black Isle.Since 2010, there have been almost 150 incidents on Scottish roads involving both motorists and horse riders \u0026ndash including two rider fatalities and 50 serious injuries.One local rider earlier told the Ross-shire Journal how she had taken to wearing head-mounted cameras in a bid to protect herself and others. Concern over an increasing number of near misses and alarming incidents has prompted calls to the police to intervene.Nel MacDonald-Rolfe, one of the riders, said: \u0026ldquoRural roads are to be treated with respect even by the locals who become complacent and take chances. You never know what is round the corner nor what can suddenly appear from the side of the roads.\u0026ldquoRural roads are there to be used by all, which includes cycles, walkers and horse riders. Patience and respect for all users and educating is the key. As they say, speed kills.The appeal to drivers to rein in their speed and to be aware of other road users followed near-misses on the B9169 Cullicudden straight. Police say they recognise the vulnerability of horses on roads and encourage motorists and riders to show mutual respect for each other.They say all road users should be able to travel safely and drivers should give horses as much room as possible when passing. They want road users to read the Highway Code for guidance.- Email us at newdesk@spp-groupTuesday 4 Sep 2018 9:50 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

That echoes public concerns which prompted a rethink from Highland Council four years ago.Tarbat Community Council is amongst the latest groups backing Craighill, stating that the TRA site \u0026ldquoshould not feature even as a second choice. It has outlined concerns over the lack of space for future expansion, inadequate room to play and the prospect of \u0026ldquotall and ugly buildings more appropriate to terminals at a second-rate airport.It says that \u0026ldquohuge cost advantages could come from using modular building techniques.The new campus will replace Tain Royal Academy, Craighill Primary, Knockbreck and the St Duthus special school. Parent councils have consistently appealed for improved facilities with the existing Craighill building the lowest scoring in the Highlands for educational suitability and condition.Wendy Hennem, of Tain Royal Academy Parent Council, noted that the Craighill site appeared to be the preferred public choice and that the resounding response from young people is: \u0026ldquoJust get it done.Tain and Easter Ross ward councillor Fiona Robertson told the Journal: \u0026ldquoAs we haven\u0026rsquot reached the deadline yet, I am not privy to the results of the consultation. However, I believe from my work with the stakeholder group and from being amongst the communities, that the Craighill site may be the most popular option. This has always been my preferred option as I believe it is much more suitable for a development of the size of a three to 18 campus.\u0026ldquoWhatever the results, it is important that the community works with Highland Council in order to deliver much-needed new schools for Tain. The extremely poor conditions of our primary and secondary schools in Tain is well known and acknowledged by Highland Council, therefore we all need to work hard to prepare an agreed plan in order to be in a position to apply for government funding later in the year.\u0026ldquoI believe the majority of people in Tain and Easter Ross just want to ensure we get fit for purpose schools in Tain to ensure the best possible educational facilities for our children\u0026rsquos futures.Fellow ward councillor Derek Loudon said: \u0026ldquoStudies by the community council, the Highland Council and the Ross-shire Journal have shown a clear preference for Craighill. There is little public support for the TRA site as all three consultations have shown. I hope we can move on now to get a layout on the Craighill site which is along the lines of the study done by Lachie Stewart [chairman of Tain and Easter Ross Civic Trust] and the community council which takes advantage of the space available to deliver great new buildings for primary, secondary, St Duthus, Gaelic and sports and leisure.\u0026ldquoI believe significant savings on cost, quality and time can be made with new construction techniques which are proven and have worked elsewhere. Let\u0026rsquos work with the Scottish Government and the Scottish Future\u0026rsquos Trust to deliver a great result for the people of Easter Ross.The consultation can be accessed at https:www.highland.gov.uk/downloads/file/19305/proposal_paper_tain_final_240518What do you think?

Dreams of American cheese could lead to nightmares for Brexiteers with a row over EU protections for regional brands like Greek feta cheese and Stornoway black pudding threatening to lead to a no-deal Brexit, writes Paris Gourtsoyannis.                It’s a very short list of things blocking a deal on the UK’s withdrawal agreement from the EU, and it’s easy to understand why Northern Ireland is at the top of it.            The future of the Irish border is tied up in centuries-old tensions borne of culture and identity, as well as hard economic and political realities both sides believe they are justified in refusing to give ground.            But the same could be said about the next thing on the list, less talked-about and much less understood: feta cheese. Greece’s salty signature foodstuff could cause the UK’s Brexit deal to crumble, as ridiculous as that sounds.Not on its own, of course: the fate of feta is only part of the row over the EU system of geographical indications , which protect food and drink products linked to specific regions of Europe, or with particular traditions of artisanal production attached.Under EU rules, only feta produced in Greece from the milk of local ewes and goats can call itself feta. A cheese by any other name might taste as salty, but it can’t be marketed using the well-known name, or indeed any imagery suggesting a link to Greece.When the Greek government first sought EU protection for feta in 1996, there were objections from France, Germany and Denmark, with some reason. Feta only means ‘slice’, and there is no particular geographic focus to production like many Mediterranean foodstuffs, it has cousins spread across the former Ottoman empire.But food is as fundamental to identity as any aspect of culture, and the cheese is as much an internationally recognised symbol of Greece as the Parthenon indeed, if Greeks were asked to choose between getting back those missing marbles or giving away their exclusive right to feta, I wouldn’t want to guess which way it would go.            Feta’s history is as old as myth: when he wasn’t gobbling lost sailors, the Cyclops is described making cheese from ewe’s milk in Homer’s Odyssey. Mass production has yet to completely banish memory of the ancient methods.READ MORE: Boris Johnson launches attack on Theresa May’s Brexit approachIn the summer, shepherds would gather their flocks near cool, snow-fed mountain lakes and caverns to milk the ewes and hang the curds in cloth bags. When the young cheeses, salted and matured in brine, were ready for market, the barrels were loaded onto mule trains that plodded into the valleys. The animals knew the path, so watching over the cargo was childsplay: at age eight, my grandfather was put on top of the lead mule for the journey down the slopes of Mount Giona, overlooking the ruins of Delphi, tied with ropes so he didn’t slide off if he fell asleep.Protection for artisanal goods carries real economic significance for producers, but in a world made anxious by rapid globalisation, they also represent an anchor point of reassuring localism. It’s strange, therefore, that Brexiteers find such protections for cheese so ‘grating’.            “Why should we ban eg feta cheese from the USA, which tastes at least as good as EU feta and was introduced into the US by Greek-Americans and with same cultural heritage?” the former trade minister Greg Hands posted on Twitter at the weekend. Another Tory MP, Marcus Fysh, was equally cheesed off. “Brits could be free to eat tasty and cheaper Halloumi and Feta made in America,” he tweeted, before falling into error and tautology by adding that the UK could soon be selling “excellent English sparkling Champagne in Asia and Americas”. All Champagne is sparkling none of it comes from England. It comes from a region called Champagne, in France, hence the name.Neither MP explained how a US import shipped across the Atlantic will manage to undercut a product available in most supermarkets for less than £1.50 – and if cheaper cheese is the Brexit dividend, you’d think they would be a bit sheepish about it.READ MORE: Poll: Brexit will build majority support for Scottish independenceBut as trivial as it sounds, there’s a good reason why recognition of GIs after Brexit remains unresolved while weightier issues like citizens’ rights have been agreed. For the UK Government and Brexiteers, a free trade deal with the USA is the ultimate goal, but that prize is slipping away.Under Theresa May’s Chequers plan, the UK would effectively remain in the European single market for goods, and American agricultural produce in particular has always struggled to clear EU hurdles – think about the controversy over chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-fed beef.            To Downing Street’s embarrassment, ahead of his visit to Britain, Donald Trump himself warned a US-UK trade deal would be much more difficult, if not impossible. So Brexiteers want to dismantle one barrier to US produce – the GI system.It seems an insignificant gesture to a tiny American industry – it’s feta, not Ford. But Trump’s warmongering trade policy makes clear that he values symbolic wins in ‘heartland’ industries more than the economic bottom line.This week, US and Canadian trade negotiators are locked in last-ditch talks to save the North American Free-Trade Agreement. Trump has taken the talks to the wire in order to grind a tiny concession out of the Canadians – the removal of production caps that stabilise dairy prices. Getting American ‘feta’ into British supermarkets would be an even smaller victory, but may still be worth a tweet from the big cheese.Brexiteers like Hands and Fysh should beware, though – and not just because the prize can’t justify collapsing talks with the EU. Not including wines and spirits, 80 British foods have GI protections, and would be open to competition from the US  if the UK ripped them up. ‘Cornish’ pasties are already produced in America could Stornoway black pudding be next?Scotch whisky is also recognised under the EU GI scheme, although it also claims historic legal protections in both the UK and the US. In the uncertain environment of a no-deal Brexit, however, no food and drink producer anywhere in Britain would seek additional competition and an erosion of the brand. On the list of things that could make a meal out of Brexit, the cheese stands alone."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4794970.1536092475!/image/image.jpg","title":"tory mps urge theresa may to chuck chequers brexit plan","story":"        Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab faced a barrage of criticism on the first day of the new parliamentary term at Westminster, with MPs across the chamber telling him the UK government\u0026#8217s negotiation strategy was a failure and must be abandoned.                Two former Tory ministers warned the Prime Minister to “chuck Chequers now” as the Tory revolt against Theresa May’s plan to keep the UK in the European single market for goods was renewed after the summer recess.            And Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer told Mr Raab the plan was a “fudge” as he warned “something is going to have to give”.            There was also pressure on Labour over the party’s resistance to a second referendum on EU membership after one of the UK’s biggest unions called for a public vote on the final Brexit deal.The GMB, which has 620,000 members, said there was widespread support for the public to have a say on the final outcome of negotiations.In a message to members, GMB general secretary Tim Roache said he respected the result of the referendum, but added it was “infuriating” to be “sitting on the sidelines watching the mess this government is making of Brexit”.“As trade unionists, when we negotiate a pay deal with an employer, we go back to our members and ask them if they’re happy with it,” Mr Roache said. “That’s what people deserve now because the promises that were made during the referendum campaign are simply not the reality we are facing.”Calls for a new vote on EU membership were also boosted by a study suggesting 1.6 million more voters would back Remain today compared with the 2016 referendum.            Analysis commissioned by the Best for Britain and Hope not Hate campaign groups points to a shift towards Remain in 93 per cent of the 632 constituencies in England, Scotland and Wales, with 112 seats switching from majority Leave to Remain.All 59 Westminster Scottish constituencies now back staying in the EU, according to the research that looked at two YouGov polls involving a total of more than 15,000 people, taken before and after the release of Mrs May’s Chequers plan.Some 341 seats in Britain now have a majority to stay within the EU against 291 wanting to Leave.In Parliament, MPs from both sides of the Commons pointed to comments from the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier over the weekend in which he lashed out at the Chequers plan as “insane”, “illegal” and an “invitation to fraud”.            Labour’s Hilary Benn, chairman of the Exiting the European Union Committee, said there had been an “emphatic rejection of the central plank of the Chequers proposal” from Mr Barnier.And Tory grandee Sir Christopher Chope warned the Brexit Secretary against “self-delusion”, saying: “[Mr Barnier] understands perfectly what is involved in the Chequers arrangements and he rejects without any qualification the facilitated customs arrangements and also the common rule book and so why doesn’t [Mr Raab] accept his get-out clause and chuck Chequers now?”Mr Raab responded, saying the UK wasn’t going to “roll over for Brussels”.“We’re going to explain them, yes, to Michel Barnier, to answer the questions – the practical and others that he’s raised,” Mr Raab said.Mr Starmer said the government was “in a real fix” over Brexit, without sufficient support in the Commons. He said Mr Raab had “no idea how it will mitigate the impact of no deal when it comes to Northern Ireland”.            “The government has got six weeks to get this right – more of the same will not do,” the shadow Brexit secretary said.Mr Raab hit back: “The Labour Party have shown that they would roll over in Brussels and fail to stand up for this country.”In the face of growing warnings that time is running out, Mr Raab insisted that agreement with Brussels was “within our grasp” and pledged the UK “will be ready for Brexit, deal or no deal”."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4794845.1536087420!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon support for scottish independence is increasing","story":"        An \u0026#8220increasing number\u0026#8221 of Scots believe independence provides the best future for the country, Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs on Holyrood\u0026#8217s return from its summer break.                And the First Minister again made it clear that she will set out plans to stage another referendum in the months ahead  as the UK Government’s “shamefully shambolic” handling of Brexit comes to a head.            “We will continue to make the case for EU membership,” she told MSPs today as she set out her Programme for Government  for next year.            “Short of that, we will press the UK Government to remain in the single market and the customs union.“As the terms of Brexit become clearer in the months ahead, we will consider and set out our view on how Scotland’s interests can best be protected and advanced.”READ MORE: Anger over Union Jack branding on haggisBut the First Minister also highlighted a new poll at the weekend which indicated a majority of Scots would back independence after Brexit.“It is clear an increasing number of our fellow citizens believe, as we do, that the best future for Scotland lies in becoming an independent country.”            But Labour leader Richard Leonard warned indepedence would see Scotland hit by sweeping austerity.“These benches oppose a second independence referendum,” he said.“We urge the First Minister to drop any plans once and for all.”“Brexit throws into sharp relief the challenges of leaving one political and economic union.

Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what, if any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar.

There is certainly great excitement surrounding them and anticipation is high amongst both band and audience.\n“The Stirling concerts will be celebrations of our long musical journey, albeit tinged with the realisation that these are farewell appearances and so naturally emotions will be high – this is something we experienced recently at the farewell concerts in England and Europe – all spectacular events but nevertheless very moving.\n“We’ve been overwhelmed by the response to the announcement of the Stirling concerts – all the positive comments, the stories about what our music has meant to so many people, the sadness as the end approaches. But overall there will be a huge amount of love and positivity at Stirling and that’s what will carry everyone through these days ahead.\u0026#8221\nJones has been with Runrig all his adult life, having first joined the band on stage as a 17-year old at a dance in Portree’s Skye Gathering Hall in late 1977. He hopes the set list – which will be lengthy – will give a full reflection of the groups’s journey from a three -piece Scottish dance band playing island village halls to one which has sold out major venues across Scotland and Europe.\nHe said: “Compiling a set list is always a dilemma, with such a large back catalogue to choose from. Of course, there are certain songs that have to be included, otherwise we’d be lynched – but it’s also nice to pick some lesser-performed songs, possibly giving them a fresh twist.\n“Our set will be a good bit longer than usual – the problem was trying to keep the length down to sensible proportions – in essence, it will hopefully represent the band’s whole career, a celebration of our music and the unique bond with our audience.”\n century – the history of their native communities has shaped Runrig’s lyrics and songs. Jones believes that staying true to their roots – fusing them with the popular rock and pop influences they listened to in their teenage bedrooms \u0026#8211 has made sure the band’s popularity has endured through the generations.\n“We’ve been fortunate that throughout our long career we’ve continually gained new fans of all ages, at home and abroad, which has sustained us, even as fashions come and go around us,” he adds. “I guess there must be something in the lyrics, the melodies and the ethos of the band that has attracted such loyalty amongst fans, something universal that transcends our shared background in the heartland of the Highlands and connects with the wider world.”\nAuthenticity has been the hallmark of a band which can essentially still trace its origins to the three Portree streets of Fraser Crescent, Kitson Crescent, and Balmoral Road.\nThe original Run-rig dance band was founded by the Skye-raised sons of North Uist Calum and Rory MacDonald, along with Blair Douglas in 1973, and a year later the trio were joined by Donnie Munro, who became the band’s singer for more than two decades. Munro, who left in 1997 and was replaced by Canadian singer Bruce Guthro, will be on stage as a special guest this weekend.\n\nJones’ hopes for a legacy of music that people can continue to enjoy, and be inspired by, seem assured.\nHe adds: “Even though the band’s touring and performing life will have finished, I hope that people will continue to enjoy and discover our music for many years to come, perhaps giving inspiration to musicians that will follow on from us, in the knowledge that if you stick to your own path, be true to your musical roots and retain an open mind, great things may happen.”\nAs for the future – the band say it might be the end for Runrig, but it won’t mean retirement or the end of their music-making careers.\nSaid Jones: “The first thing to say is that there will be a long wind-down period – for instance we’ll film and record Stirling, so that will have to be worked on and brought to some sort of completion, plus there is the whole ongoing administration of the band archive and legacy which may lead to some interesting sideline projects.\n“Beyond that, we’ll all still be involved with our own individual performing, writing and music-making projects – that’s something you never retire from.\n“Personally, I’ll miss the band dreadfully but on the positive side I’ll spend more time on Skye plus I’ll have time to learn some new accordion tunes!”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Run-Rig-1977-ADJUST-e1534430676612.jpg","title":"oidhche mhath runrig whfp editorial 24 8","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n night spoke for the Highlands.\nThe unassuming Malcolm has often been a coolly detached figure on stage, concentrating solely on his guitar.\nBut he has been playing with the Run Rig Dance and Ceilidh Band since he was 17 years old and he is now in his 60th year.

Runrig and the legacy of fresh Gaelic musical talent that came in their wake are now bigger than their Highland infancy.\nBut whenever you listen to a Runrig song, there will always be an echo of that dance hall accordion, of Robert MacDonald, of Blair Douglas, of the island fan base that sent them on their way.\nIn the words of the title of their first, vinyl, album, they will always Play Gaelic.\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales.jpg","title":"uig to tarbert service delayed due to medical","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe 2.10 pm sailing from Uig, Skye to Tarbert, Harris on Wednesday  was delayed due to a medical emergency.\nThe announcement was posted on the CalMac Service Info Twitter account around 2.45 pm, and a further post has since stated that subsequent sailings will be delayed.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary  Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27459  ","story":"Sinn Féin spokesperson for Business, Innovation and Enterprise Maurice Quinlivan TD\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The government is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming the apprenticeship system.

We aim toexpand the system into these areas to create different opportunities for allyoung people including more females and people with disabilities.”\n Currently,most apprenticeships are aimed towards male participants with just 160 out of13,589 people in apprenticeship programmes across the state being female in2018.

The attack on the marchers was carried out in front of the news cameras, brining global attention to the civil rights campaign and the the discrimination of the unionist regime at Stormont. \n\nThis Saturday\u0027s march, organised by Sinn Féin, is the first in a series of events planned to mark the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the civil rights campaign. \nMid Ulster Sinn Féin MP, Francie Molloy, who helped organise and took part in the original parade 50 years ago, said that the campaign for rights is as relevant now as it was in 1968 and encouraged people to take part in Saturday\u0027s march. \n\"Presently, with the deliberate denial of rights, a shortage of affordable housing and the ongoing issue of constituency boundary proposals, it is clear there is still a job of work to be done,\" he said. \nWith the DUP\u0027s denial of rights to the LGB\u0026ampT community, Irish language speakers and bereaved families awaiting inquests, it is clear the campaign for rights needs to continue in the north. The onset of the Tory Brexit, backed by the DUP, also represents an attack on the rights of people in the north. \nThe main speaker at the end of the commemoration at the Square in Dungannon will be former Sinn Féin MLA Mitchel McLaughlin. \nSpeaking ahead of Saturday\u0027s march, the former Northern Assembly Speaker called for a huge turnout. \"Let\u0027s exceed those who turned out on the very first civil rights march in August 1968 and let\u0027s ensure that a very clear and committed demand is presented to the governments - the Irish government as much as the British government - to address those issues of a rights based society that are enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement,\" he said. \nThe parade will begin in Coalisland at 3pm on Saturday and make its way to Dungannon. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27461  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago. - Mitchel McLaughlin\nHundreds of people took part in a commemoration in Tyrone yesterday to mark the 50th anniversary of the first civil rights march to be held in the north. \nThe march retraced the steps of the original march from Coalisland to Dungannon and was attended by Sinn Féin representatives from across the north. \nIt was led by Mid Ulster Sinn Féin MP Francie Molloy, who took part in the original march 50 years ago as a steward. \nMarchers carried replicas of the posters carried by the original march, reading \u0027One man, one vote,\u0027 \u0027Equal housing now\u0027 as well as banners referring to the Caledon housing protest which was the motivation for the march. \nContemporary posters on the threat posed to Brexit to rights were also carried by marchers. \n\nIn 1968 the original march was stopped before it reached the Square in Dungannon by the RUC because loyalist protestors staged a counter demonstration. \nThis time, however, the march reached its destination where speeches were made by Francie Molloy, local MLA Colm Gildernew and Fermanagh/South Tyrone MP Michelle Gildernew. \nThe main speaker of the march was veteran republican and civil rights activist Mictchel McLaughlin. \nIn his speech, the former Assembly Speaker said tat much has changed in the last five decades and that we are on the verge of a major shift towards Irish unity. \n\"The Orange state is now gone and we now have a peaceful and democratic way forward. \n“This is a very different place than it was in 1968 and I am convinced that we are now on the verge of another seismic shift towards a new, agreed and united Ireland that will provide a prosperous and shared future for all our citizens,\" he said. \n\nBut Mr McLaughlin also warned that our rights are still under threat today from Brexit and the right wing alliance between the Tories and the DUP. \n“My deep concern is that there are still people who want to deny rights and equality to their fellow citizens today. \n\"People in the north still face attacks on their electoral and civil rights, alongside the continued denial of rights to LGBTQ couples, women, Irish language speakers, and bereaved families seeking a coroner’s inquest.\n“Today, we are experiencing an unacceptable blockade on rights, imposed by the DUP and facilitated by the British government.\n“Rights are also under threat by a right-wing Tory Brexit and there are unwelcome echoes of gerrymandering and the hollowing out of democracy by the recent Boundary Commission proposals.\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago,\" he added. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27462  ","story":"Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0026#039Neill.\n Michael McMonagle\n\n“We must specifically acknowledge the damage done by the Catholic Church to the lives of many women and children in the mother and baby homes, the Magdalene Laundries and a succession of abuse scandals and cover ups.- Michelle O\u0026#039Neill\nThe visit to Ireland by Pope Francis this weekend is an opportunity for the Catholic church to address the ongoing legacy of abuse, Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0027Neill has said. \nMichelle O\u0027Neill made the comments ahead of the historic visit to Ireland of Pope Francis this weekend to attend the World Meeting of Families which is being held in Dublin.

The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north. This could have a chilling impact on rights and representation in the six counties,\" he concluded.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27465  ","story":" Mícheál Mac Donncha\n\nON THE afternoon of Tuesday 30 August 1988, three IRA Volunteers were travelling along the main Omagh to Carrickmore road in County Tyrone. They were on active service and at Drumnakilly, close to their homes, they were ambushed and shot dead by a unit of the British Army’s SAS regiment. The Volunteers were brothers Gerard and Martin Harte and Brian Mullin.\nThe SAS killings brought to an end a month which had been one of the most intense and tragic of the war in Ireland. It began on 1 August with the IRA bombing of Inglis Barracks in London, close to Margaret Thatcher’s Finchley constituency. It was the first IRA attack in England since the bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference four years earlier. A British solider was killed in the Inglis Barracks blast. In the following days, the IRA killed three British soldiers and an RUC detective in the North. \n\nOn 8 August, two young nationalist men were murdered by a loyalist death squad in Belfast. There were two more such sectarian killings of young nationalist men in Belfast, on 17 and 18 August. On 20 August, eight British soldiers were killed at Ballygawley, County Tyrone, when the IRA bombed a bus carrying members of the Light Infantry Regiment returning from England. On 31 August, two civilians were killed in Derry after they triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb intended for British forces. \nPolitically this period was dominated by the issue of extradition and, on 27 August, Robert Russell, one of the IRA prisoners who broke out of the H-Blocks in the mass escape of 1983, was handed across the border to the RUC. This was despite widespread protests, including public dissent from within Fianna Fáil.\nIt was on the Long Bog Road at Drumnakilly, four miles outside Omagh, that the three IRA Volunteers met their deaths.\nAt 4pm on 30 August, they were ambushed by British forces who poured a hail of bullets into their car. The RUC and British Army immediately sealed off the area and the bodies of the three men were left at the scene, within the cordon and inaccessible to grieving relatives, until the following afternoon. \n\nGerard Harte  was the eldest of the three Volunteers and was an experienced IRA activist. With his brother, Martin, he was a prominent member of the Loughmacrory St Theresa’s GAA Club, where he organised youth teams. \nMartin Harte was just 21 but had been in the IRA for four years at the time of his death. A talented football player, he had captained the Loughmacrory team. He was the father of a three-month-old son and, to compound the tragedy, his widow was Briege Mullin, sister of his friend and comrade Brian Mullin. \nVolunteer Brian Mullin  had been singled out for particular harassment by British forces. He was arrested and interrogated in Gough Barrack on numerous occasions and a few weeks before his death he and his brothers were beaten by crown forces outside their family home.\n\n\nHundreds of British soldiers and RUC members saturated the Tyrone countryside as the three Volunteers were laid to rest. Speaking at the graveside of the Harte brothers, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Volunteers were “good, decent, patriotic freedom fighters driven to fight for justice”. \nVolunteers Brian Mullin, Gerard Harte and Martin Harte were killed on 30 August 1988, 30 years ago this week.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27466  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\n“The policy of this government is failing the homeless, failing those renting and those who strive to own a home.

To address this, they have upgraded their AI contingency planning, rewriting the rulebook in the past year to ensure they have a robust plan in place.\n  \nWe have to think carefully how we would react and prevent spread if AI came in to Northern Ireland and together with agencies and Government departments we exchange views regularly with working groups, in order to remain on top of this key issue, Peter said.\n  \n\n  \nCareer Highlight\n  \n\n  \nOver his 40 years with the company Peter said a key highlight has been promoting ownership and pride with the people he works closely with.\n  \nA back to basics approach is one of my fundamental pillars, and I still firmly believe that bird husbandry and welfare are key to producing a high-quality product.\n  \nThere are endless opportunities for those considering a career in agriculture and food production, and as my wife and son also work in the poultry industry, I can definitely vouch for that!\n  \nAs the world population continues to expand, the demand for goods also increases and food production, and those working in the industry, will have to keep up with this development.\n  \nBy strengthening our production capabilities over the past number of years, we are well placed to meet this demand, with poultry a healthy and versatile source of protein which is also good value for money.\n  \n\n  \nPositive outlook\n  \n\n  \nPeter concluded: As I look back on my time in the industry and at Moy Park, I’ve always started each morning the same way, and I think it has stood me in good stead!\n  \nThe first thing I think of is ‘today will bring a new challenge, a new opportunity and I will most likely learn something new’ as every day is a school day!”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_995387.jpg--.jpg?1535635242000\n","title":"superb gcse results for dunclug college","story":"  \nDUNCLUG College is celebrating historic levels of achievement at GCSE level. \n  \nAll students, including those with ious learning challenges sat a minimum of 7 GCSE subjects, including the compulsory core of English, Maths and Science and a range of GCSE optional choices in a balance of General and Applied courses.\n  \n Many gifted and competitive students sat 8, 9 or 10 subjects. The overall result for GCSE English for the whole cohort was 80% in the A – C range, with the overall Mathematics result being almost 60%: in each case this represented the best outcomes in the school’s history. \n  \nOverall, almost 80% of students achieved 5 or more subjects in the A – C range with almost 60% achieving this standard inclusive of English and Maths. This significantly exceeds the National and Northern Ireland averages and places our school and is testimony to the success which can be attained at a non-selective school. \n  \n Many factors contribute to such success, not least the support of parents, the commitment of students and the motivational teaching which is inspirational yet grounded, and which proves that high expectations enable students to push boundaries and indeed predictions. \n  \nSubjects which achieved the outstanding success rate of 100% of pupils gaining Grade C or better were as follows: Art, Construction, Media Studies, Double Award Science, Occupational Studies, Further Maths, Prince’s Trust, Agriculture \u0026amp Community Sport. Other high achieving subjects included: Applied Business 70%, English 80%, English Literature 92%, Engineering 70%, French 75%, Geography 79%, ICT 70%, Single Award Science 78%, Technology \u0026amp Design 91%, Drama 91%, Music 82%, BTEC Sport 91%\n  \nThe Principal noted that amongst the numerous excellent combinations of grades were children with special educational needs, and many personal best achievements. It was also very encouraging to note that 96% of all students in the year group achieved at least 5 grades in the A – E range.\n  \nCongratulations to top achievers: Kirsten McLeister - 5 A* and 3A, Craig Francey - 4A*, 4A, 1B and 1C and Charlotte McKay 1A*, 4A, 2B and 1C.\n  \nOther students with a profile of A - C grades in eight or more subjects included: Stuart Adams, Tori Agnew, Chloe Bleakley, Alan Clarke, Daniel Compton, Megan Davison, Laura Du Bois Pidgeon, Amy Ewart, Joy Forsythe, Rachel Greer, Abigail Harris, Timothy Hill, Korben Houston, Lynn Hughes, Deanna Johnston, Jamie Knox, Danielle Mahaffy, Tamzin McClenaghan, Adam McConnell, Grace McCullough, Emma McDowell, Thomas McFall, Megan McKay, Luke Neeson, Robbie O’Neill, Aimee Penney, David Saunderson, Chad Shaw, Joshua Shaw, Robyn Telford, Charlotte Waide, James Warwick, Leah Young.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying:

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

grateful family of a Ballymoney schoolboy whose life was saved by his older brother\u0027s bone marrow have spoken publicly for the first time.\nA year after seven-year-old Caden Moore received a transplant at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children from his 11-year-old brother Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a difference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such life-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back. We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn          return false                .click .parents.fadeOut          return false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus            return false           else if              password.focus            return false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n               return false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

We have come close in the past, making it to the quarter-finals and the semi-finals, so to go one better this season is a great feeling.\n\u0026#8220There is a real buzz and a belief in the team that we can go and win the Irish Cup in our first final.\n\u0026#8220We have gone up against teams from all over the Province this season to get to the final.\n\u0026#8220We didn\u0027t know too much about any of them, they were all an unknown quantity, but we played to our strengths and we have been rewarded.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn          return false                .click .parents.fadeOut          return false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus            return false           else if              password.focus            return false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n               return false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

The Ballymoney man lost his father, Mervyn Robinson, to the\u0026#160 North West 200 in 1980, while in July his cousin, William Dunlop, was killed during free practice at the Skerries 100 near Dublin.\nAll of these setbacks forced a re-think, says Robinson. My main reason for quitting the sport was my wee boy, Max, he told Chronicle Sport.\n\u0026#8220Road racing is getting very dangerous and there have been too many accidents recently, so I\u0027m not prepared to take the chance any more.\n\u0026#8220My main fear is getting caught up in something outside of my control like, like an accident happening in front of me, or a bike seizing or something.\n\u0026#8220William\u0027s death affected me big time, to be honest I felt like packing it in immediately.\n\u0026#8220The\u0026#160 circumstances surrounding William\u0027s death were just awful. The fact he left behind a\u0026#160 young daughter and Janine [his partner] had a second baby on the way made it so horrible for us all to deal with.\n\u0026#8220I thought about it and I decided I wanted to do myself some justice and finish off the season before calling it a day.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field -

champions","story":"\n\nPAUL\n Munster has been appointed at the Technical Director and first team coach of Indian champions Minerva Punjab FC. \n\nThe former Linfield and Cliftonville striker joins the club after guiding Örebro SK to their maiden U19 Swedish Cup success last year. \n\nMunster had been mulling over whether or not to continue his career in Sweden. In an interview with Belfast Media Group last November, Munster hinted at remaining in European football.\nHowever, those plans are now on the back burner for the Belfast native as he prepares to take charge of the Indian champions, who will embark on their first AFC Champions League campaign this season and Munster says he is excited by the challenge. \n\n“I have always been going up and achieving more and more each time, even in the coaching courses,” said Munster. \n\n“Everything has been going well and now it’s a great time for some new experience, especially in India. \n\n“Joining a club that has been playing in the highest level, are the current champions and the fact that they are going to play in the AFC Champions League, it’s just perfect. I’m moving in the right direction.” \n\nMunster was also well travelled as a player. Having started his career with Celtic Boys in West Belfast, he played for Cliftonville youths before moving to Canada. Munster later linked up with Slavia Prague and, on his return to Belfast, he signed for Linfield and helped the Blues secure the League and Irish Cup double in 2010 and 2011. \n\nMoving to the north Indian club didn’t phase Munster in the slightest and he is relishing the prospect of helping Minerva Punjab FC secure more silverware in the near future.\n\n“I was looking into Minerva Punjab a few months back, doing research on their scores and social media to see how it is and the first thing that I noticed was Mr Ranjit Bajaj, the owner is very passionate about the club,” added Munster. \n\n“He wants the team to be the best at all levels and that is what I liked a lot.” \n\n“For me, it’s a challenge, a new experience but I am coming here to win. As a player, I’m used to winning leagues, cups, individual awards. Coming here as a coach and working at the highest level in India and also playing in the AFC Champions League, it will be a great experience.”\n\nIn a statement posted on the club’s website, Minerva Punjab FC owner Mr Ranjit Bajaj, added: “We are excited to have Paul on board. He comes in with a lot of experience both as a player and as a coach and we believe that he can contribute a lot to this club. \n\n“We believe that both of us together can achieve great things at this club.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"glider goes live","story":"\n\nTHE\n New Belfast Rapid Transit Glider system has become fully operational today. \n\nThe £90million Glider system will travel the new cross-city routes between West and East Belfast  and from the city centre to the Titanic Quarter .\n\nThe new controversial 12-hour bus lanes built to accommodate the service will operate from 7am and 7pm Monday to Saturday.\n\nLast week, the Department for Infrastructure announced that a 12-month scheme allowing private hire taxis to use the lane has been put on hold.\n\nIn West Belfast some parents have expressed concerns that the bus lane that passes one local school have left them with nowhere to drop off or pick up their children.\n\nDrivers have been warned not to park in the new bus lanes, but at St Kevin’s Primary School on the Falls Road, many parents felt they had no choice but to flout the rules.\n\nSt Kevin\u0026#8217s Primary School Principal Fiona Keegan said: “I don\u0026#8217t think it\u0026#8217s an ideal situation at all. It\u0026#8217s very unfortunate that our parents are now in a position where they have nowhere safe to drop their children off in the mornings and are being forced into the local streets, which is causing congestion. \n\n“Not all of my children come from the local surrounding area and therefore can walk to school. We service families from beyond West Belfast, a lot of parents do have to travel. Also, although we are a mainstream school we have a lot of children who have additional learning needs and any change of their morning routine can be detrimental to them and we have to be very aware of that and for children particularly with any sort of autism diagnosis getting out of a car to walk across a main road is very worrying for a parent.”\n\nSchool caretaker Tony Murphy said: “Many of the parents had no choice but to park in the cemetery this morning which isn\u0026#8217t ideal for anyone, also if you look at the bus lane line, our teachers have to break it to get into the staff car park. The side streets were always busy but now they are going to be ten times worse. We put signs out about parking to stop the parents pulling up and then having to reverse out, in case they hit a child. People are getting picked up in taxis in the outside lane and cars are stopping there and the kids are getting out and crossing the road.”\n\nOne local man who did not wish to be named said: “I\u0026#8217m a taxi man but this morning I decided to get my bike out and see what it would be like in the bus lane. I\u0026#8217ve cycled from the Michael Ferguson roundabout to here, it took me 23 minutes and the Glider has yet to pass me. My intention was to stop it by cycling in front of it, I see some cars parked here in the bus lane and I don\u0026#8217t blame them. People would put up with it if it was for the greater good but it\u0026#8217s not.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"markets residents stress the need for social homes at gates of city hall","story":"\n\nRESIDENTS \nfrom the Markets took to the gates of City Hall last night to reiterate their call that land marked for social housing remains so.\nResidents and campaigners gathered on Monday night to mark the first anniversary of Belfast City Council’s vote to earmark land on the Gasworks site – previously zoned for social housing – available instead for a hotel extension and a multistorey carpark.\nMembers from the Homes Now campaign group handed in a petition to Belfast City Council Chief Executive Suzanne Wylie as Belfast Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey and Deputy Lord Mayor, Alliance’s Emmett McDonough-Brown signed the Homes Now pledge.\nHomes Now campaigner Bernie Dobbin said: “The people of the Markets have waited too long for adequate social housing to be built in the area and we are no longer prepared to take verbal assurances from officials and politicians.\n“Time and again, these officials and politicians have broken their word and left residents high and dry. This is why we are asking councillors and officials to sign the Homes Now pledge – for their commitment to become a matter of public record.\n“Belfast City Council have sent out a lot of positive messages since the disgraceful decision of their Planning Committee last September, but still not a brick for new housing has been laid. Meanwhile, families are forced to stay indefinitely in emergency accommodation, share with relatives and ‘sofa surf’ – this cannot continue.\n“Like communities across Belfast and throughout Ireland, we are demanding that those in power recognise the nature of the housing crisis and act accordingly. It’s time to build homes, not carparks.”  \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"west belfast teenager signs for fleetwood town","story":"\n\nA\n WEST BELFAST teenager’s dreams of a career as a professional footballer took a huge step in the right direction this week as he began life with English professional club, Feetwood Town.\nBarry Baggley put pen to paper on a deal last week that will see him contracted with the EFL League One side for the next two years.\nThe 16-year-old former St Mary’s CBGS pupil is the son of the Rosario manager, Barry Baggley Snr, so comes from a fine background in the game.\nBarry Jnr began playing for Newhill when he was six-years-old before moving across the city to Glentoran from U-10 where he played his football until being picked up by Fleetwood last week.\n“Last year our team at Glentoran did the league and cup double, so it was a good way to end,” he said.\n“I have also played in internationals and in the Milk Cup. I’m going to the Euro qualifiers in October with the U-17s and won the Milk Cup with County Antrim last year.”\nBarry is usually found either in midfield or playing out on the wing and as a Liverpool fan growing up, looked up to players such as Steven Gerrard and Philippe Coutinho as well as Barcelona legend, Lionel Messi.\nOf course, he has a long way to go to emulate his idols, but he has done everything right so far to have captured the interest of a professional club in England.\n“They saw me playing for Northern Ireland and asked me over for a trial,” explains the Turf Lodge lad.\n“I went over for two weeks and did well, so they brought me back for another two weeks and asked me to sign at the end of it.”\nBeing away from home is not a problem for the rising star as there are some familiar faces also signed to the Lancashire club.\n“There are two boys I would know from the Northern Ireland team living over there already,” he continued.\n“I already knew them before I went over. That makes it far easier for me to settle in.”\nBarry made the journey across to England at the weekend as he begins life at his new club and he is hoping to make his mark early.\nThe hope is to sufficiently impress in the next two years to earn himself another contract when he turns 18.\n “This is a completely new start with a new team and new players,” he acknowledged.\n“The aim is to get offered to stay for longer after these two years and for now I will be playing with the U-18s and hopefully start to climb the ladder.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Here we look at what the restrictions will mean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n– What is being banned?\n\n\nDrinks with more than 150mg of caffeine per litre, like Red Bull, Monster, and Relentless, will be affected.                    \n\nOne regular 250ml can of energy drink contains around 80mg of caffeine – equivalent to almost three cans of cola.\n\nMany popular energy drinks now come in 500ml cans.\n\nSales will be restricted to either over-16s or over-18s, depending on consultation responses.\n\n\n– What are the concerns?\n\n\nThere are fears children’s health and education are being harmed, with the drinks linked to behavioural issues and poor classroom discipline.\n\nMany also have very high amounts of sugar, contributing to tooth decay and obesity.\n\nStudies have shown regularly consuming large quantities of caffeine can result in increased blood pressure, sleep disturbances, headaches and stomachaches.\n\nCampaigners have also criticised how much children can get their hands on with just pocket money, with four cans of generic 250ml energy drink available for as little as £1.\n\n\n– Why is it relevant to Britain?\n\n\nBritish children consume energy drinks way above the European average, contributing to emotional difficulties and tiredness, public health minister Steve Brine has said.\n\nNearly 70% of UK children aged 10 to 17 years old consume energy drinks, according to the Government’s childhood obesity plan.\n\nAnd those who do so are drinking on average 50% more than the EU average for that age group.\n\nJenny Oldroyd, deputy director for obesity, food and nutrition at the Department of Health and Social Care, has previously warned: “Around a quarter of adolescents are consuming more than three energy drinks in one sitting, so it’s that high level of consumption that concerns us.”\n\n\n– Why has the issue gained prominence?\n\n\nA boom in the energy drinks market, high-profile calls from figures such as TV chef Jamie Oliver, and the relatively low cost of some types compared with general soft drinks.\n\nWhile many major retailers already do not sell to under-16s, just 21% of the UK grocery market, including corner shops, are signed up to voluntary restrictions, No 10 said.\n\nUK energy drink sales jumped by around one-fifth  between 2012 and 2017, with total sales estimated at £1.65 billion last year, according to analysis from market researchers Mintel.\n\nA further 10% growth for the energy drinks market is expected for 2017-22, it added.\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37259698.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/_0608ks18_1143.jpg","title":"primark committed to belfast and to resume trading in city as soon as

not go under on my watch because of the failure to act by successive governments.\n\n“I could have sat on my hands and ignored it and let hundreds of post offices continually close.”\n\nThe minister listed declining mail volumes, eSubstitution and the move to online payments and online banking as major impacts on the sector.\n\n\n\nNo minister wants to be in the position I am in today, but I\u0027ve decided we need to have a viable future for the post office network\nDenis Naughten\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Naughten added: “If politically we shirk decision-making, we potentially ultimately will have no post office network at all.\n\n“No minister wants to be in the position I am in today, but I’ve decided we need to have a viable future for the post office network.\n\n“These are not decisions that have been taken lightly or without good reason.\n\n“At the last general election, postmasters came and asked for a modernisation plan for the post office, we’re doing that, and redundancy package, we’re doing that, and a look at new services, which is happening at the moment.”\n\nThe minister added that it is longstanding policy that postal services will not be directly subsidised by Government.\n\nMr Naughten appeared before the meeting of the Communications, Climate Action and Environment Committee to answer questions on the restructuring plan, worked out between An Post and the Irish Postmasters’ Union .\n\nThe plan has been criticised by some over the anticipated impact on rural Ireland, with some saying the Government had failed in its commitment to rural life.\n\nThe minister refuted the idea that the post office was central to rural communities.\n\nHe said: “The post offices were the nucleus of the community in the past but I don’t believe that today.\n\n“We have not seen new innovative services in the post office, we don’t see young people using services in the post office.\n\n“That can only be done by modernising the post office network.”\n\nThe changes will affect post offices in Carlow, Clare, Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Mayo, Tipperary and Wexford.\n\nThe meeting was attended by representatives from An Post, the Post Office Networks and representatives of An Post mailing centres.\n\nSeamus Maye, chairman of the Public Banking Forum of Ireland, urged the Government to think outside the box in relation to saving the post office network.\n\nHe said: “Ireland’s post office can become a core plank of rebuilding Ireland, but the current narrative is all wrong, we can at the stroke of a pen turn it into a thriving multi-service provider.\n\n“The current An Post proposals are bizarre and ill thought out, and would see the destruction of one of our best institutions.\n\n“Going forward, we need to think outside the box to avoid wanton destruction of our post office network.”\n\nTom O’Callaghan, leader of the forum’s post office unit, said that the Government is attacking its own national asset.\n\nSome of the committee members agreed with the suggestion of a community bank being run by An Post to offer loans to small businesses and low-income households who would be turned away from pillar banks.\n\nThe committee heard the cost of setting up such a bank would be around 160 million euro.\n\n“We have an opportunity to do the right thing for the first time ever,” Mr O’Callaghan added.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"sinn fein looks to develop health service policy in wake of brexit","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n |

Cavan, Louise O’Reilly TD said that in the context of Brexit, the issue of how health services will be affected is one that keeps coming back.\n\n\nHealth spokesperson \n@loreillysf\n said Sinn Féin want a 32 county health service that’s free at the point of delivery and based on need and not ability to pay \npic.twitter/16ekW5Lkjn\n\n— Sinn Féin  \nSeptember 4, 2018\n\n\n\n\nShe said: “We are developing policy on a 32-county health service, which is available for all the citizens on this island.\n\n“Disease does not recognise borders, our health service shouldn’t.\n\n“We have been discussing the level of cooperation that exists currently and how we can deepen and develop that.\n\n“We launched our 32-county women’s health policy document recently, and last week we also launched policy related to nursing and how we will tackle recruitment and retention crisis.\n\n“We will not have a health service if we don’t have the personnel to deliver it.\n\n“This government have failed time and time again, they have let our nurses down.\n\n“We see Fianna Fail protect the government and they believe nurses are very well paid.\n\n“We don’t believe that, pay has to be central to recruitment and retention issue.\n\n“We also have to deal with role development, opportunities for promotion, time off for study, cover for maternity leave, all these issues have to be dealt with.\n\n“In context of a 32-county health service, what we want to see is the development of a health service for people when they need it, based on need and not on ability to pay.”\n\nThe most recent report on recruitment and retention issues in the health sector found that in nursing and midwifery departments difficulties exist in meeting workforce requirements in specific areas.\n\nThe report also recommended that Specialist Qualification Allowance currently paid to nurses and midwives who acquire post-graduate qualifications should be increased by 20%.\n\nCommenting on the release of the Report, the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure \u0026 Reform, Paschal Donohoe said: “There are many viewpoints on the issues.\n\n“There is a commitment between public service employers and staff representatives to meet within four weeks to discuss implementation of the Report.\n\n“It is important that this process is adhered to and that space is afforded to reflect on the details and engage in that process.”\n\nThe announcement comes after Sinn Fein members gathered to discuss their “vision of a new Ireland – what that means in terms of Brexit, the economy and Irish Unity” at the party’s annual “think-in”.\n\n\nSpeaking at the Sinn Féin National Think-In \n@conormurphysf\n said the Good Friday Agreement must be fully honoured and protected \npic.twitter/WQ5QvTgjjr\n\n— Sinn Féin  \nSeptember 4, 2018\n\n\n\n\nOver the course of the two days, party representatives discussed the upcoming budget in the 26 counties and how the party’s alternative budget might “bring about shared prosperity, lift the burden from ordinary people and address the health and housing crises”.\n\nAlso addressed is the issue of powersharing in Northern Ireland, of which Sinn Fein’s Conor Murphy has accused the British government of adopting a policy of “drift” in order to protect their interests in the confidence and supply agreement with the DUP.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"dup mp ian

lives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nMatilda Booth made the first presentation, giving Meghan a bouquet of white blooms, and in return the duchess picked a rose from the bunch for the seven-year-old, who has spina bifida and is paralysed from the chest down.\n\nThe duke and duchess chatted to the youngster when they attended the WellChild Awards – a glittering ceremony recognising the achievements of children and teenagers with serious health conditions and medical staff who care for and treat others with similar illnesses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSharon Booth, 47, who lives with her daughter Matilda in Sowerby Bridge, West Yorkshire, said after the royal encounter: “Matilda chose the flowers, she was shell-shocked to be given the rose, she said she’s going to put it in her memory box.”\n\nNot to be left out, Harry made a “pinky pledge” with the seven-year-old during a reception before the awards ceremony began, hooking his little finger around the girl’s matching digit.\n\nMrs Booth said the royal urged her daughter, who wants to be a nurse, to “never stop smiling as you’ve got a beautiful smile”.\n\nWhen Matilda brought out her soft-toy pug, she told the duke and duchess, who wore a trouser suit by Altuzarra and a Deitas blouse, it was named after talent show mogul Simon Cowell.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex meet seven-year-old Matilda Booth \n\n\n\n\nMrs Booth, whose daughter recently turned seven and won the inspirational child award in the four to six-year-old category, said: “Harry said, ‘I can see the resemblance’.”\n\nMeghan’s first appearance at the event saw her interacting with all the winners, sharing jokes, a hug and receiving gifts along with her husband.\n\nMelissa Granger, 15, from St Helens, who has Angelman syndrome which leaves her needing 24-hour care, hugged the royal couple as her brother Jacob, 18, watched.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex meet Jacob Granger and his sister Melissa \n\n\n\n\nHe was given the most caring young person award for helping to look after his sister.\n\nMckenzie Brackley, from Fife, has also been hailed as inspirational.\n\nThe four-year-old, who had to learn to speak, swallow, eat and drink and move again due to acute flaccid paralysis, was praised for being there for other children when they are scared or sad.\n\n“Despite his own problems, Mckenzie cheers up everyone when they are low, and is guaranteed to put a smile on your face”, WellChild said.\n\nHarry has been patron of WellChild – the national charity for seriously ill children and their families – since 2007 and regularly attends the annual awards ceremony.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nMeghan and Harry meet Mckenzie Brackley during the WellChild Awards in London \n\n\n\n\nIn a foreword for the event’s official programme, he wrote: “This evening, we are celebrating remarkable stories of hope, resilience and selflessness.\n\n“The children and young people you will meet tonight are coping with challenges few of us can imagine, yet they inspire those around with such positivity and determination every day.”\n\nHe also highlighted the nurses, consultants and other health professionals “who have dedicated their lives to giving children and young people with serious health needs the very best chance to thrive and flourish”.\n\nThe duke said about the growing number of young people living with long-term, complex health needs: “With WellChild’s help they can be cared for at home instead of living in hospital, and families can be properly supported.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"playful ruby seven tugs on harrys tie","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC

It’s a great tribute to John that he is prepared to go back into public service to help the state of Arizona.\n— Cindy McCain  \nSeptember 4, 2018\n\n\n\n\nThe seat will then be up again for a full six-year term.\n\nGovernor Doug Ducey, also a Republican, said Mr Kyl was “the best possible person, regardless of politics” for the job, and he hopes Mr Kyl serves past the end of the year.\n\nIf Mr Kyl does leave the Senate after the end of the current congressional term on January 3, Arizona’s governor can appoint another senator for the remaining year.\n\nBy state law the senator will have to be a member of the same party as the departing one, in this case the GOP.\n\nFor now, Mr Kyl will pad Republicans’ margin in the narrowly divided Senate.\n\n\n\nI think McCain would be very happy with the pick.

It’s a great tribute to John that he is prepared to go back into public service to help the state of Arizona.”\n\nDoug Cole, a veteran Republican consultant and former McCain aide, said Mr Kyl was a safe pick.\n\n“I think McCain would be very happy with the pick. Honours his legacy while putting some major horsepower for Arizona in the seat, at least for now,” he said.\n\nA lawyer, Mr Kyl speaks in a formal, reserved manner that is a sharp contrast to Mr Trump, and he belongs to an older, less populist vanguard of the GOP.\n\n\nI look forward to working with Jon Kyl as we continue making progress for the American people \npic.twitter/yAqYcqycAe\n\n— Leader McConnell  \nSeptember 4, 2018\n\n\n\n\nAt a news conference where he was introduced as Mr McCain’s replacement, Mr Kyl said in a response to a question that he has only met Mr Trump once, though he noted he is working for the White House by serving as Judge Kavanaugh’s so-called “sherpa”.\n\nWith a nod towards Mr McCain, Mr Kyl said the president’s “desire to jump into the middle of or be in the middle of a fight – and by the way that reminds me of somebody – can be detrimental in the end to what he’s trying to achieve”.\n\nDuring his time back in the Senate, Mr Kyl will have the opportunity to vote on several issues that have been involved in his lobbying activities, from immigration to national security.\n\nMr Kyl has lobbied on behalf of young immigrants brought to the US illegally as children, often called Dreamers, whose fate is in limbo after Mr Trump tried to end an Obama-era programme protecting them from deportation and Congress deadlocked on a solution.\n\nHe will likely also vote on bills containing tens of billions of dollars for Defence Department programmes after he represented defence giant Northrop Grumman.\n\nHis work was primarily focused on tax issues affecting the company, but his firm Covington \u0026 Burling also lobbied the House and Senate to drum up support for the B-21 bomber, a stealth aircraft Northrop Grumman is building for the Air Force.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"derry counselling group host walk hope memory local man","story":"\nA walk aimed at remembering those who have lost their battle with addiction was held in honour of a Derry man who passed away last year.\n\nThe ‘Walk of Hope’, organised by Heal the Hurt, took place on Derry’s Walls on Saturday, in remembrance of Terence ‘Butch’ Crawley, who passed away in December 2017.\n\nHeal the Hurt, which was founded in 2016 by Derry man Liam Stewart, offers free counselling to those suffering from the effects of alcohol and drug abuse.\n\nSpeaking to the Derry News, Mr Stewart said Saturday’s walk was also aimed at sending out a message to those suffering from addiction that Heal the Hurt would ‘stand with them’, and help them in their battle.\n\n“We wanted to remember every single person who has lost their battle with addiction,” he said.\n\n“We also wanted to show families that regardless of the stigma associated with addiction, we will stand with them, and we will be there for them.\n\n“There is an epidemic here locally which is taking the lives of our loved ones, and we believe that our city is dealing with a mental health crisis.”\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nMr Stewart continued that they have moved into a new premise due to increase in demand for their services, which opened its doors on Monday.\n\n“The numbers pf people coming to us reached the point where we could no longer cope – there’s simply wasn’t enough space for everyone to fit into the room,” he added.\n\n“We’ve now secured a room at Northside Shopping Centre and hopefully we can keep that until Christmas.”\n\nHe added that in addition to helping those suffering from addiction, Heal the Hurt also provides support to those helping loves ones deal with the substance and alcohol abuse.\n\n“We host a ‘Friends and Family’ session on a Wednesday, which is continuing to grow,” he said.\n\n“Families are often forgotten about when a loved one has an addiction, and there needs to be a support network there for them too.”\n\nYou can find out more about Heal the Hurt through the group’s Facebook page, or contact them on 07783910072.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"derry projects among 19 benefitting 3 3m funding international","story":"\nThe International Fund for Ireland today confirmed £3.3m of financial support for 19 community projects in Northern Ireland and the southern border counties of Ireland and a number of Derry projects are among those who benefit. \n\nThe funding, approved at the organisation’s recent Board Meeting in County Louth, includes more than £2.5m that is allocated across 15 projects within the Personal Youth Development Programme .

The risks taken by groups we support cannot be taken for granted. \n\n\"In many difficult areas, the Fund and these groups are delivering the only interventions that are preventing the escalation of tensions and polarisation. In challenging circumstances, their ambition and vision deserve to be equally met with political action and leadership.\n\n“With the limited resources available, the Fund is making important contributions that support stability and progress, particularly among communities that had not previously recognised a peace dividend. However, the Fund alone is not equipped for the scale of challenges that may emerge during an indefinite political vacuum. \n\n\"Each generation should expect a better life than the last.

Some are abstract and some are more detailed.\n\n“She goes through different phases, but landscapes are her favourite.\n\n“Tori’s signature style is colour. People always seem to comment on how the colours are so vivid and bold.”\n\nTori and Karen have now set up a Facebook page ‘Art by Tori’ which quickly established a strong online following and she has since sold several paintings and been commissioned to paint several more.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n“From there we thought that we should do an exhibition,” said Karen.\n\n“The Waterside Theatre are very good at supporting aspiring artists and we now have 50 paintings all ready to go and all framed.”\n\nTori is currently in her second year of a transitional course at the North West Regional College and is also a member of the Foyle Down Syndrome Trust  where she is able to take part in music, art, photography and gardening.\n\n“FDST try to do things that the members are interested in,” said Dara.\n\n“They have been a great support to Tori throughout her life amd I feel like she is living her dream at the minute.”\n\n“Tori can sometimes find social situations difficult, but this has given her so much confidence, through answering people on her Facebook page and talking to people about her art when she is out and about.\n\n“I think it will give other people hope that they can achieve their dreams.\n\nDara added: “All any parent wants for their kids is for them to be happy and she is so happy when she is painting.”\n\nTori\u0027s show will take place at The Waterside Theatre from Friday, September 7 to Friday, September 21.\n\nThere will be an opening night event this Friday, September 7 from 7pm to 9pm.\n\nThe theatre is open from 9.30am to 4.30pm from Monday to Friday and on the evening of theatre performances.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"new radnor pictures knockout fun at new radnor carnival","story":"\nNew Radnor Carnival Queen, Bethan Evans with Princess, Ella Davies, and King, Jo\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gtsh Probert, and atte\u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtndant Jack Hughes.

Following the failure of management to respond to this offer, the unions have been left with no choice but to proceed to a consultative ballot on industrial action.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThis is a historic mark of shame for the council as this is the first time that all four unions representing the workforce have jointly balloted for action.\n\nIn a statement issued yesterday the council said that it was disappointed to learn that the trade unions had issued the press statement without giving pre-notice.\n\nIt says: \u0026ldquoThe statement issued by the Joint Trade Union Side came as a surprise, not least because the council had been in discussions with the unions up until Friday, August 24, where it was agreed by both sides that a meeting would take place on September 3, to be chaired by the Labour Relations Agency.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe were disappointed then to see the unions issue a pre-emptive statement on Bank Holiday Monday that we were given no notice of, nor were we contacted to respond to its contents.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoTrade Union representatives have been part of the job matching process for every post, except one where they declined the invitation to take part.

Such was the demand that people were even contacting me on Saturday night to see if we had any spare tickets, he said.\n\nLocal priests who attended the mass were Fr Gerry McCloskey from Ardglass and Fr Brian Brown of St Patrick\u0026rsquos in Ballynahinch.\n\nChurch of Ireland Dean Henry Hull from Down Cathedral travelled on the coaches with the pilgrims and tweeted after his experience \u0026mdash \u0026ldquoSafely home after a very blessed and uplifting day in Dublin #PapalVisit.\n\nDespite the visit being viewed a difficult one as Pope Francis was being called upon to address the many instances of institutional abuse and clerical sexual abuse of children and women in the island\u0026rsquos recent history, parishioners were still excited to see and eager to listen to the words of their spiritual leader.\n\nDownpatrick man Jackie Breen, who attends St Patrick\u0026rsquos Church, says that the experience of seeing his spiritual leader will stay with him for a lifetime.\n\nHe made sure to make the visit special for his family by personally attending the earlier Festival of Families events on Thursday and Friday, attending the Croke Park concert with his wife Tracey and daughter Lucy and then the Phoenix Park mass on Sunday with his son Dylan.\n\n\u0026ldquoPope John Paul gave us the blessing of peace in Ireland when he spoke here and that was also\u0026nbsp seen in Europe a few years later and I believe that Pope Francis has left us with the special blessing of hope and healing in his visit, said Mr Breen.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a message of hope and healing not just for Catholics but for all Christians.\n\nHe added that the entire Festival of Families and the Pope\u0026rsquos words helped to underline how crucial the role that families have in global society.\n\nMcCartan Digney , says that he felt very emotional about the entire experience.\n\nHe travelled with his mother Louise to Phoenix Park and proudly carried the yellow and white Papal flag that she had when she went to see Pope John Paul at the youth Mass in Galway.\n\n\u0026ldquoEver since I watched a TV documentary about nine years on the 30th anniversary of Pope John Paul\u0026rsquos visit, I\u0026rsquove wanted to see our Holy Father myself and kept the flag for my chance and I couldn\u0026rsquot believe that I got the chance to do so, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt was very emotional from all the singing and the long walk there. There were tears of joy and tears of sadness\u0026nbsp when Pope Francis acknowledged for the first time the hurt that has been done, but it really needed to be said and it was good to hear the words from the head of our church.\n\nFor Mark Ferris from Drumaness and his partner Kathleen Oliver, their attendance in Dublin during the entire Papal visit was the highlight of a very religious week.\n\nEarlier in the week while holidaying in Portugal, the couple visited the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima.\n\nMr Ferris was a boy of eight when he last saw a serving pope in Ireland when Pope John Paul II visited in 1979.\n\nHowever, he watched the mass at Drogheda, estimated to have nearly attracted 1.3m people, on the television at home with his family.\n\nFor this visit, Mr Ferris says he was determined not to miss out.\n\n\u0026ldquoMy partner had arranged for us to go to Dublin for the Pope\u0026rsquos visit as a birthday celebration but I would have been there no matter what.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis experience was something that I would never will forget and well worth the blisters I have on my feet in walking the five or six miles to Phoenix Park.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoWhen the Pope did his tour of Dublin, we were really close when he pass by and I believe he looked directly at me.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe concert was absolutely brilliant as was the Mass and we really enjoyed the entire weekend.\n\nSouth Down MLA Colin McGrath also attended Sunday\u0026rsquos Papal Mass.\n\nWhile he represented the SDLP along with deputy Nicola Mallon, he travelled down as part of the Downpatrick and Lecale parish group.\n\nHe said that the event was notable for the number of young people who attended.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe atmosphere was electric and it was a special moment when the Pope arrived.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe overall theme of his visit was obviously \u0026lsquofamilies\u0026rsquo and it was great to see so many families there together too. There was a great connection amongst the Downpatrick Parish group with over 200 travelling together. \n\nHe added: \u0026ldquoPope Francis also sent a special message of forgiveness and healing for the Church\u0026rsquos involvement in difficult matters in the past which was important too.\n\n\u0026ldquoAll together, it was a fabulous event which will be remembered for a generation.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"}]
