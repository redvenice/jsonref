Mostly, festivals were hugely popularised with small events popping up around the country as a way to celebrate rock music.And this noncompliance battled against the conservationism of the older generations throughout the 1970s as thousands of people descended on the Isle of Wight - to the dismay of upper-class holidaymakers.           Sometime in the 1970s: A band playing a free festival in London. These festivals were organised by those who were desperate to continue the counter culture of the previous decade. Despite being small-scale events, organisers often faced harassment from authorities who saw the festivals as hotbeds of rebellion. They later mutated in to what are now known as illegal raves         1970: Revellers hold their hands up to make peace signs at the Isle of Wight Festival. The Guinness Book of World Records has estimated up to 700,000 people attended this event. But holiday-makers on the island heavily opposed the presence of hippies and moved to block future festivals by introducing the Isle of Wight County Council Act 1971 1980sThe punks, skinheads and New Romantic sub-cultures dominated the 1980s. With the rise of David Bowie came a more gender-fluid style of fashion and makeup taken up by the New Romantics.Others preferred the more aggressive and angry punk and skinhead cultures which by the mid-1980s had almost merged in to one. Both cultures enjoyed a more violent and rebellious style of music.         Sometime in the 1980s: A non-stop graffiti artist in London\u0027s Battersea Park. Inspired by street art in New York City, Londoners used car paint to decorate the walls of the UK\u0027s capital early in the 1980s. Artists wanted to leave a mark on the city landscape and break through what was socially acceptable. Here three teenagers pose in front of a heavily-graffitied wall         Sometime in the 1980s: Heavy Metal fans at Monsters of Rock in Donnington. Revellers descended on the Leicestershire motor racing track for a one-day event that challenged Reading Festival for the top spot for metal venues. The heavy metal subculture was another anti-establishment movement that saw young people tease out their hair and dance more violently         1981: As part of the efforts to collect as many photographs from British people\u0027s youths as possible this image of the photographer\u0027s girlfriend has been captured. The woman is wearing a yellow Fred Perry t-shirt while sitting on a stool in front of the television. Fred Perry was a symbol of skin head culture - with shirt colours often showing a favoured football team               Sometime in the 1980s: Skinhead culture stems from the lower classes alienation from the rest of society. The skinhead craze emerged on the council estates of East London at the precise moment the hippy look was invading the High Street. Skins were defined by their shaven heads, Dr Martens boots, braces, Fred Perry polo shirts, tight jeans, and smart shirts         1981: Punk and Skinhead girls at a gig in Hastings. Punk was an overtly political youth culture that enjoyed a particular genre of fast-paced and aggressive music. Women wore ripped tights and band t-shirts and mo-hawks were popular. The two sub-cultures were close by the 1980s and many skinhead\u0027s were ex-punks. Fashion in this decade echoed mod\u0027s clean-cut styles         Sometime in the 1980s: A group of young punks on King\u0027s Road in London. Punk fashion was heavily politicised with mohawks, tattoos, tartan and studded chokers. They wore ripped t-shirts, safety pins, zips, studs and armbands that were used to make political statements. Punks believed in inidual freedom and fought against conservative views         Sometime in the 1980s: Twisted Sister on stage in Donnington. This American heavy metal band are known for slap-stick comedic music videos and their songs explored child vs parent conflict and criticised the educational system. Formed in 1973 they toured London before becoming big during the mid-1980s. They wore traditionally women\u0027s clothing and heavy makeup         1983: Revellers set up a Java Sound System at Notting Hill Carnival. Large boom boxes brought reggae music to the streets. Known as Europe\u0027s biggest street party the carnival originated as a celebration of black British culture after race riots in 1958. The week-long festival included pageants, food stalls and music, and the celebrations ended with a parade         1983: A group of revellers move speakers to create a large sound system which will blast music out on to the streets. Before its gentrification Notting Hill\u0027s ersity was celebrated with the carnival. And the tradition carries on today. Claudia Jones, a Trinidadian political activist, was central to organising the first event on January 30, 1959, at St Pancras Town Hall         1985: George, a New Romantic, poses with two women at the Bastille club in Bristol. Influenced by David Bowie, New Romantics mixed rock and pop music to create sythnpop. They wore heavy, dramatic makeup, big hair and glamorous outfits. Clothing was made in expensive-looking fabrics to create an over-the-top look. Most iconically, genders were mixed          1986: A young punk, Shane Hanley, sits in the street with a girl while they listen to music on a portable stereo in Guernsey. Starting off as an underground scene, the aggressively spiked hair, studs and chains of the punk style took off when it was brought into popular culture by The Ramones and The Sex Pistols in 1976. Their clothes were often written on with markers         1989: Revellers at a rave in the UK. The shift from the 1980s into the 1990s is apparent here as the small festivals that littered the 1970s shifts in to the rave scene Britain still has today. The Second Summer of Love is a name given to the period in 1988 and 1989. There was a rise of acid house music and an explosion of unlicensed MDMA-fuelled rave parties1990s As the popularity of illegal raves reached an all-time high the Government stepped in to try to curb the youth\u0027s passion for MDMA-fuelled shenanigans.But retaliation against the 1994 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act saw The Mother Earth festival in Somerset in 1995 and the rise of London\u0027s club scene.The 1990s was also when Northern Soul was at its most popular - but it\u0027s still difficult to define what exactly this genre of music is, as its entire point was that it was elusive.           Sometime in the 1990s: Three men dance at the Northern Soul Club in London. Northern Soul was a musical movement born in the industrial north of England. Thought to have evolved from mod clubs, northern soul was about finding obscure soul records. Soul twisting and dancing was often as important as the music itself, and tracks were never played on the radio         1994: Velvet Revolution tour, a protest against the 1994 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act that criminalised raves, free parties, free festivals, squatters and those living a mobile lifestyle. Raves and parties were held in various locations including The Hacienda in Manchester,  Brighton University, and an abandoned Sainsburys in the centre of Brighton          1995: Facepainting at The Mother Festival in Somerset. Unauthorised dance parties were under threat when Government legislation was passed to make them illegal. The free festivals that had characterised youth culture for the last 30 years were at risk of disappearing. So hundreds of revellers gathered in Somerset for a festival that was a lifeline for emerging forms of youth culture and identity after Thatcherism         1996: Youth culture is starting to form in to what it is today as clubbers pose for the camera at a rave in Bagley\u0027s in London. The club was a multi-room warehouse that opened in 1991 and held some of London\u0027s biggest late night parties until it closed in 2007. The building, in King\u0027s Cross, currently stands empty but is being redeveloped in to shops2000sFree parties made a comeback in the noughties - a decade after the 1994 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act criminalised raves. The organisers brought their own sound systems as revellers acted outside of the law.And then heavy metal artists and bands including Slipknot and Marilyn Manson introduced and popularised the goth - with Slipknot fans\u0027 baggy jeans and chains branching in to its own sub-culture.           Sometime in the 2000s: A Slipknot fan at a festival. Large, baggy jeans, chains, and band t-shirts were an amalgamation of the skater boy, emo and heavy metal subcultures that dominate the years between 2000 and 2010. A Slipknot fan was a subculture that fought against mainstream. The idea was fans only cared about Slipknot. The rest of the world was irrelevant         2001: The crowd at the front of a Marilyn Manson show in London. Mainstream media viewed Manson as a negative influence on young people. His fans were members of the gothic subculture and black was the preferred clothing colour for those who listened to the darker version of rock and roll that emerged. His fans were the lonely, the misunderstood and the alienated         2003: A fancy dress free party in Goodwood. A decade after the 1994 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act criminalised raves and free parties they\u0027re back. Free parties moved away from the conventions of an organised rave. Organisers brought a sound system and drugs were usually readily available. They were thought of as autonomous zones where the rules of society did not apply.

Scotland is being ripped out of the EU against its will by the most dangerous Tory government in modern history.\u0027It is worth remembering that nobody born this century had a say in 2014, or indeed a say in the UK\u0027s ill-fated EU referendum.

The first was the release, in October 2016, of the #Pussygate tape, on which presidential candidate Donald Trump was recorded boasting about his seduction technique: “When you’re a star, they let you do it.” A year later, the New York Times published a story about the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein’s decades of sexual aggression against both A-list actors and junior employees. (He lost his job, but still denies many of the allegations.) In the autumn of 2018, an academic called Christine Blasey Ford testified to a Congressional committee – and the world’s media – that the Republican supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh had assaulted her at a drunken college party, in front of a male friend. “Indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter,” she said. Kavanaugh sobbed openly, lied about small details, and denied the accusation. His nomination was confirmed.The #MeToo movement has a mixed record, and Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, who broke the Weinstein story, embrace that complexity in She Said. Painstakingly researched, their account is less interested in Weinstein the Monster than the structures that enabled him to flourish.The story starts with actor Rose McGowan refusing to talk to Kantor. She had publicly alleged that she was raped by a Hollywood producer, but refused to name him. “Here’s the thing, I have been treated quite shabbily by your paper at times and I believe the root of it is sexism,” McGowan wrote in an email. The reporters persisted: the first and best section of this book is an All The President’s Men-style thriller, describing the lead-up to publication. It is a hymn to old-fashioned investigative reporting. Kantor and Twohey trawl through complex document trails, trying to find old non-disclosure agreements. They chase down tips and, more than anything, form relationships with sources, texting them dozens of times a day to coax them on to the record.The women at the other end of the phone are nervous, and are right to be. It is discovered later that Weinstein was using a security firm, Black Cube, to try to halt the publication of the story. Two agents from Black Cube, using false identities, met McGowan to pump her for information. One of the same agents posed as a Weinstein victim to meet and spy on the reporters.Everywhere Kantor and Twohey go, women don’t want to speak to them. Their reluctance is not just born of intimidation, but the threat of financial ruin. The journalists gradually realise that Weinstein’s harassment has been covered up through pay-offs, accompanied by gagging clauses. The terms are often absurdly strict, preventing accusers from speaking not just to the media about the allegations, but to their spouses and family. Crucially, the NDAs also prevent accusers from hearing other stories. As Kantor and Twohey finally get through to sources, they hear the same details again and again. The bathrobes. The massages. The pot plant. This unique texture is what makes the Weinstein story ring true: how could so many people invent such similar lies?The bravest women are not the big names. Of the dozens of actors who later spoke out, only Ashley Judd went on the record in the initial story, when it was truly dangerous to go public. Gwyneth Paltrow helped the reporters behind the scenes, but held back because of her close association with Weinstein – he produced Shakespeare in Love, for which she won the best actress Oscar. She was also afraid of bad publicity because she had recently received a roasting over her wellness website, Goop, which sold $66 jade eggs to put in your vagina. (Kantor and Twohey are too professional to diss their sources, but you detect a note of frustration that the exposure of a serial predator was nearly derailed by Paltrow’s side-hustle.)The real heroes are women such as Zelda Perkins, a former Miramax assistant who was harassed by Weinstein in 1998. When Perkins learned another woman in the company, Rowena Chiu, had suffered a similar experience, she confronted the producer. He appeared “docile” but his lawyers were ferocious. There was no physical evidence, and so both women were talked into agreeing to a £125,000 settlement. Perkins was not even allowed to keep a copy of the document: she had to see it at her lawyer’s office.Another Miramax employee, Laura Madden, had a typical story – hotel, bathrobe, masturbation. When the reporters tracked her down, she was a single mother to four children, about to undergo a second mastectomy. She never signed an NDA. She left the film industry. She went on the record straight away.By definition, everyone with power in modern Hollywood has succeeded within the current toxic, compromising system. No wonder so few wanted to speak out. Some of them must have taken Weinstein’s bathrobe bargain. Others said no and kept quiet about it. Others passed on a warning – don’t be alone with him – and considered their job done.Sometimes, acquiescence shades into outright villainy. At one point, the Weinstein Company proposes a system of fines to be levied on Harvey every time he has to settle a harassment case. In effect, they are trying to bribe him out of assaulting women. His brother Bob is a key source for Kantor and Twohey, but his late repentance can’t erase his years of complicity. Ditto Irwin Reiter, his accountant – who hands over an internal memo written by a junior female employee accusing Weinstein of harassment. Special mention must be reserved for attorney Lisa Bloom, a longtime advocate for victims’ rights, who appears to have sold her soul for $895 an hour and the promise of a movie deal. In a memo printed here in full, she tells Weinstein, “I feel equipped to help you against the Roses of the world, because I have represented so many of them.” She recommends paying a company to trash McGowan’s Google results, discrediting her as a witness. (Bloom now calls her actions a “colossal mistake”.)The second section of the book, describing the Kavanaugh hearings, is shorter and less satisfying, because the reporters were less involved. Nonetheless, it vividly depicts the shortcomings of a system that has no way to treat Blasey Ford’s accusations except as a partisan intervention. She needs lawyers, and advisers, to go up against the might of Washington. The Democrats can give them to her. Yet instantly the case becomes less about the truth and more about political point-scoring. Blasey Ford emerges, as she did at the hearings, as deeply impressive, polished and precise. But her story happened long ago, and believing it depends on taking her word over Kavanaugh’s. The saga exposes the brutal binary of such allegations: winner takes all. He wins.Pussygate. Weinstein. The Kavanaugh hearings. All three incidents pose the same question: what does it take for victims of sexual assault and harassment to be believed? On the evidence of She Said, the answer is a bleak one. It brought back David Simon’s description of juries. “The average juror doesn’t want to spend time contemplating the inconsistencies in a defendant’s statement, or the complex web of testimony that systematically destroys an alibi,” he wrote in his account of the Baltimore criminal justice system, Homicide. “The average juror wants three upstanding citizens to say that they were eyeball witnesses to the crime and another two who can assure them of the killer’s motivation.”The #MeToo story is about power. Early on, the writers note that by the time their investigation started, Weinstein’s career was already on the slide: he was not knocking out hits as in the early 2000s. This is the missing piece of the puzzle when we try to reconcile his downfall with Trump’s survival. Rich men accused of being sex pests are like banks: they are mostly too big to fail. But when enough investors finally get nervous, the “sell” sign suddenly flicks on. There is an unedifying stampede for the door. You now can’t find anyone in the film industry with a good word to say about Weinstein. He is the Lehman Brothers of groping.The final section of the book is oddly dissonant. Kantor and Twohey gather a dozen of their sources to share stories and compare the effect on their lives. Paltrow volunteers her home in California, strewn with cushions. The women are bruised, but mostly relieved, to have been heard. Some are struggling financially one, who spoke about harassment in McDonalds, had recently been made homeless. Paltrow, meanwhile, is troubled by her unwitting complicity in Weinstein’s strategy. She denies having acquiesced to his harassment, but she was the example he used when offering his squalid bargain: don’t you want what she’s got? The ambiguity of her story defines this book. • Helen Lewis is a staff writer at the Atlantic. Her book Difficult Women: A History of Feminism in 11 Fights is out from Cape in February.

But as a writer of both, I have come to find that fiction and non-fiction are simply two sides of the same coin.My YA Nordic thriller, The Sharp Edge of a Snowflake, was inspired by two of the biggest news stories of last year and the fearless women behind them. In 2018, the journalist Carole Cadwalladr revealed that a British company called Cambridge Analytica had harvested the personal data of millions of Facebook users without their consent and used it to influence elections. Around the same time the #MeToo movement was gaining momentum. In 2018, the actor and activist Rose McGowan released her captivating book, Brave, in which she exposed the predatory misogyny within the film industry and told of how the most influential man in Hollywood sexually assaulted her.Reality is complicated. Working both as a novelist and a journalist, I often feel there is greater truth in fiction than facts. But how can fiction be truth?Writing fiction is like knitting. Reality is a tangled ball of yarn. It’s a mess. Bringing order to the confused mess that is human existence and turning it into a story does not make it any less authentic, any less true. Our times are like a tangled ball of yarn. When you knit a sweater out of it, it is still yarn.Good fiction helps us make sense of the world around us while still enabling us to lose ourselves in the story. Below are my top 10 novels for young adults about current affairs.1. The Hate U Give by Angie ThomasA reassuring trivia for all aspiring writers: before Angie Thomas wrote The Hate U Give, she’d written another book that was rejected by more than 150 agents. In 2017, Thomas’s debut became a publishing sensation. It went straight into the bestseller chart and stayed there for a year. It’s a powerful look at the Black Lives Matter movement. A mandatory read that should be on the syllabus of every school, everywhere.2. Fated by Teri TerryWe need to talk about Brexit … no, wait, don’t stop reading. Years before the Brexit referendum, Teri Terry wrote the dystopian Slated trilogy, set in a world where the UK has left the European Union and closed its borders. A brutal government wipes clean the minds of young people suspected of crimes against the state. Now Terry is back with a brand-new prequel to the trilogy that is actually inspired by the real-life Brexit. In Fated, she explores how her fictional post-Brexit world came to be. It’s eerie to see how life sometimes imitates art.3. The Casket of Time by Andri Snær MagnasonThis book is a hybrid of sci-fi and fairytale. The world is in an economic crisis. But instead of facing it, people turn to a new invention. The TimeBox halts time for the person inside it. You don’t like Mondays or the Trump era? Just skip right over them. But what happens when everyone just hides away in their TimeBoxes, burying their heads in the sand? Just like in real life, the problems keep piling up. And just like in real life, it’s the young who come to the rescue (think climate change and Greta Thunberg). Rebecca Solnit described the book as “the love child of Chomsky and Lewis Carroll”.4. Meat Market by Juno DawsonHaving worked on the fringes of the fashion industry as a journalist, Juno Dawson started to realise there was a problem. The models, often very young girls, nameless faces and bodies of the global fashion industry, were not always treated well by photographers, agents and designers. Meat Market tells the story of an ordinary girl from a south London estate who is thrust into the world of high fashion where she discovers the seedy underbelly of the beauty industry.5. A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder by Holly JacksonWhat is news? Well, how long is a piece of string? Is true crime news? I don’t know. But it certainly has become a popular form of entertainment. We seem to have an unquenchable thirst for podcasts such as Serial and documentaries such as Making a Murderer. A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder is a novel inspired by true crime. The format of the book mimics the form of the true crime shows we know and love though the book isn’t based on any one case, almost everything that happens is partly inspired by an actual crime.6. Burial Rites by Hannah KentA young woman accused of murder is sent to a remote farm where she is to wait for her execution. The book is based on a true story, and I have a confession to make: I’m a descendant of the man who beheaded her, Iceland’s last executioner. In 1829, Agnes Magnúsdóttir and Friðrik Sigurðsson were sentenced to death for the murder of Natan Ketilsson. When it came down to it no one wanted to do the beheading. My forefather, Guðmundur Ketilsson, the brother of the murder victim, was persuaded to do it. It’s a murder case that has captivated Icelanders for 200 years. Did they really do it? Why did they do it? Was Agnes really the evil temptress the courts made her out to be? It was the news story of the 18th century, and if they’d had televisions back then, people would have been following the case on true crime specials over a bowl of popcorn.7. Crossfire by Malorie BlackmanIt’s almost 20 years since the first book in the groundbreaking Noughts \u0026amp Crosses series was published. The series, which explores racism through alternative history and is set in a world where black people rule over white people, was inspired by the Stephen Lawrence murder case. This fifth book in the series, however, is influenced by the dystopian feel of our current political climate. “The results of the UK Brexit referendum and the US presidential election in 2016,” Blackman writes in the preface to Crossfire, “brought home to me just how potent the politics of fear and ision can be.”8. American Wife by Curtis SittenfeldIf it weren’t for Donald Trump, we’d still be gasping over what an awful president George W Bush turned out to be. American Wife is the literary reimagining of one man’s journey to the White House seen through the eyes of his long-suffering wife – a woman who bears an uncanny resemblance to Laura Bush.9. Illegal by Eoin Colfer, Andrew Donkin and Giovanni RiganoIllegal is a thought-provoking graphic novel that explores the plight of immigrants embarking on perilous journeys in the hope of a better life. According to Donkin, the inspiration for Illegal was a newspaper article “about the size of a postage stamp” that haunted him about a boat sinking in the Mediterranean with 215 people on board. “Eoin and I talked about it, and waited for the follow-up report with the names of the people lost, but no report ever came.”10. Oranges in No Man’s Land by Elizabeth LairdA couple of months ago, the UN asked: “Is the world becoming numb to the killing of children in Syria?” Oranges in No Man’s Land is set in Lebanon during the civil war. The book is based on Laird’s personal story: she stayed on the green line in Beirut in 1977 in a war-damaged flat with her husband and six-month-old son, who slept in a suitcase on the floor and took his first steps on their bullet-riddled balcony. It’s a touching book that reminds us that we’re not allowed to shield ourselves with apathy when it comes to children and war."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8dd0770973b5fd7d87af772914acfb3c92c8b89/459_1301_4346_2607/master/4346.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab363123cedde9710e087945d84d38c2","title":"year of the monkey by patti smith review","story":"At the start of 2016, Patti Smith’s friend the producer, manager and rock critic Sandy Pearlman was hospitalised after suffering a brain haemorrhage. She first met him in 1971 when he attended one of her performances during which she read poetry against a backdrop of feedback, courtesy of guitarist Lenny Kaye. Pearlman approached Smith after the show and suggested she front a rock band, but, as she recalls in her new memoir: “I just laughed and told him I had a good job working in a bookstore.” Later she took his advice and went on to make the landmark punk album Horses. Their friendship endured, leading her and Kaye to his bedside nearly 50 years later as he lay in a coma. “We stood on either side of him, promising to mentally hold on to him, keep an open channel, ready to intercept and accept any signal,” Smith writes. But the signal never came six months later, Pearlman died.Her account of 2016 shows it was a difficult year all round. Along with the loss of friends, she is poleaxed by the rise of populism, the dirtiness of the US election battle and looming environmental catastrophe. She is also discomforted by her impending 70th birthday. And so, after a run of New Year gigs at the Fillmore in San Francisco, and a stretch back in her leaky New York flat, Smith engages in what she calls “passive wandering, a small respite from the clamouring, the cries of the world”. She travels to Arizona, California, Virginia and Kentucky.In the latter, she visits her friend and former partner, the playwright Sam Shepard, who is almost bedbound and nearing the end of his life. Shepard’s final book The One Inside is close to completion but, as the act of writing becomes increasingly difficult, he calls on Smith to be his amanuensis. Elsewhere, she goes to Lisbon, where she visits the poet Fernando Pessoa’s house, and looks through his personal library, and to her bungalow in New York’s Rockaway Beach where she clears out the dust, sits on the porch and gazes at the insects and the flowers.Typically for Smith, portents and symbols lurk in unexpected places, and everyday objects become freighted with meaning. Photographing them with her trusty Polaroid camera, she basks in the memories evoked by her father’s cup, a motel sign, a suit worn by the artist Joseph Beuys and a book of poems by Allen Ginsberg. She imagines her old chum Ginsberg fearlessly grappling with the current political turmoil. He “would have jumped right in, using his voice in its full capacity, encouraging all to be vigilant, to mobilise, to vote, and if need be, dragged into a paddy wagon, peacefully disobedient”.Year of the Monkey is often maudlin, a reflection both on mortality and of the times in which Smith finds herself, but rich in detail. She reads endlessly, strikes up conversations with strangers, takes walks in the middle of the night and drinks gallons of coffee. At one stage she lists the contents of her suitcase – “six Electric Lady T-shirts, six pair of underwear, six of bee socks, two notebooks, herbal cough remedies, my camera, the last packs of slightly expired Polaroid film and one book” – which reveals much about her day-to-day needs. She cadges lifts from oddball types, among them the couple who forbid her to talk while they are driving and abandon her at a gas station when it becomes clear she can’t stay silent, and the garrulous Cammy, who has a car boot full of pickling jars. Smith also dreams vividly, leading to seemingly normal scenes suddenly bending out of shape as you realise she has slipped into unconsciousness. Indeed, the narrative moves constantly between reverie and memory it’s invariably left up to us to work out which is which.Both mundane and magical, this book is a world away from Just Kids, Smith’s award-winning 2010 account of her relationship with the photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, though the unique artistry of her prose remains. There are greater similarities to M Train, Smith’s previous memoir which found her staying in hotels or shuffling around her apartment, watching Inspector Morse and Midsomer Murders reruns on TV. Here she once again cuts a solitary figure prone to forgetfulness, who falls asleep in her coat a lot, and holds conversations with inanimate objects. The ghosts of those she has lost – her mother, her husband, her brother – remain close.Smith lives much of her life in the past but her account of her wanderings shows us who she is now, and the stories and dreams that occupy her. She is not without optimism – “Our quiet rage gives us wings, the possibility to negotiate the gears winding backwards” – but exists with a keen awareness that there is no overcoming the passing of time or the limits of the imagination. As she notes in the epilogue, “the trouble with dreaming is that we eventually wake up”.• Year of the Monkey is published by Bloomsbury (£12.99). To order a copy go to bookshop or call 0330 333 6846.

Britain is the biggest export market for champagne, buying more than 26m bottles a year, helping support the French economy and a champagne market worth €4.9bn (£4.3bn).The Comité Interprofessionnel du Vin de Champagne trade body told Reuters last week that growers and champagne houses had overstocked in Britain to avoid Brexit disruption.Wine critic Antoine Gerbelle told the news agency there was enough stockpiled to meet British demand for at least a year. “There won’t be a champagne crisis at Christmas,” he said.More than half of UK firms are not ready to trade with the EU under a no-deal scenario, according to the Cips survey of 817 supply chain managers at firms across 11 sectors of the British economy,Glen said companies were fearful about their ability to survive the busy Christmas period. “Mass border disruption during this time could have a catastrophic impact. Businesses need to be provided with as much detail and support as possible to ensure they can survive the festive period.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/147b8be6ffbc25fd1cd9c111c0db748d71adc55f/0_99_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1f11b3e4dd366a891401a23533eb964","title":"leadsom intervenes cobham takeover security advent","story":"National security cited after investors accept offer from America’s AdventThe government has intervened in the £4bn takeover of Cobham, a UK aerospace and defence supplier, by a US private equity firm on the grounds of national security.Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, has instructed the Competition and Markets Authority to investigate the takeover of Cobham, a world leader in systems for planes to refuel in mid-air, by Advent International.Leadsom said: “Following careful consideration of the proposed takeover of Cobham, I have issued an intervention notice on the grounds of national security. The government’s goals are to support private sector innovation whilst safeguarding the public interest.”Shareholders on Monday approved the sale of Cobham, established 85 years ago by the aviation pioneer Sir Alan Cobham, against the wishes of the founding family. The deal, announced in July, is one of a series of foreign takeovers of UK companies made attractive by the weak pound.When the takeover was unveiled it was seen as a test of the new government’s tolerance of foreign takeovers as the UK seeks to define its role post-Brexit. Advent believed that the deal would overcome national security hurdles because Cobham is a small supplier to the Ministry of Defence.Cobham employs about 10,000 people, including 2,000 in the UK, and operates in more than 100 countries. The company supplies radar and other electronic products for the defence and aviation industries, including the mid-air refuelling technology that gave RAF planes the range they needed to help Britain win the 1982 Falklands war.The takeover was opposed by some shareholders, opposition MPs and Nadine Cobham, the widow of Sir Alan’s son. After shareholders approved the deal, she called on Leadsom to step in to protect the business. Advent had said it would review Cobham’s businesses, suggesting a breakup of the company was the likely outcome of its investment.Cobham has only recently steadied itself after five profit warnings between 2015 and 2017 and critics have accused Advent, one of the biggest US buyout firms, of snapping up the company cheaply as it recovers. Its chief executive, David Lockwood, said he regretted the sale when the company was showing signs of revival.• Sign up to the daily Business Today email here or follow  Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d3764a417a444a56b8ca4ebb62fdab965490f63/0_118_2966_1779/master/2966.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40231f9f52d889cb0d64ce3d793bef5a","title":"markets uk inflation house prices brexit fed rate decision business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news, including new data showing the cost of living in BritainDespite the slowdown in the south, English house prices are significantly higher than the rest of the UK.Here’s the details from the ONS:Share in UK building firms have been knocked by the slowdown in house price growth.Jean-Claude Juncker’s warning of a “palpable” risk of a no-deal Brexit is also weighing on UK-focused companies.We now know that UK wages are rising more than twice as fast as inflation.Marina Mensah-Afoakwah, senior economist at the CEBR, says:The figures mean more good news for households following last week’s wage data.Economist and Conservative Party councillor Olive Cooper agrees:Core inflation, which strips out volatile items, also fell to a near three-year low.This is from the Resolution Foundation:The NIESR thinktank have crunched through today’s inflation data, and concluded that Brexit uncertainty is holding prices down.Consumer price inflation was lower than expected at 1.7 per cent in the year to August 2019. Our analysis of 130,000 goods and services included in the basket suggests that fewer firms raised prices than is typical for this time of year.Firms are probably waiting to see beyond 31 October before adjusting prices. The slowing of inflation was widespread, falling in 10 of the 12 regions of the United Kingdom with the biggest drops in Northern Ireland and Wales.”“Sharply lower inflation is great news for the UK economy. Along with soaring earnings, low inflation boosts consumer spending power just when the economy needs it.Falling inflation gives the Bank of England more headroom to loosen monetary policy. Corporate investment and manufacturing are weakening, and consumers need to keep consuming to keep UK growth going - lower inflation will help them do just that.”But...Yael Selfin, Chief Economist at KPMG UK, fears it could show the economy is weakening:“Recent falls in the value of the pound and the spike in oil prices over the weekend should boost the headline rate in the coming months, with higher prices for fuel and for imported goods putting pressure on households’ purchasing power and business margins, and further curtailing demand.” PwC economist Jing Teow points out that the recent fall in the pound, and rising tensions in the Middle East, could push inflation up again However, there remain a number of short-term risks to inflation, particularly from external supply shocks. The recent disruption to Saudi oil supplies could manifest as higher energy costs with knock-on impacts on non-oil sectors and UK households if they persist. This, combined with recent sterling weakness in August, could contribute to higher input costs and imported inflation. There is also the possibility that additional supply side shocks could materialise from a no deal Brexit, which could result in higher tariffs and supply disruptions, thus exerting further upward pressure on the price of consumer goods.Across England, house prices are now falling in nearly half of all regions.The average house prices fell in London, South East England, the East of England and the South East in July, compared to July 2018, the ONS reports.It’s a sign that economic and political uncertainty is putting people off from moving house.However, they did rise strongly in Yorkshire and the North West, helping to close the North-South ide.Over the past three years, there has been a general slowdown in UK house price growth, driven mainly by a slowdown in the south and east of England.The drop in inflation last month, to a 32-month low, is welcome news for consumers, says economist Howard Archer of the EY Item Club.Improved consumer purchasing power is particularly welcome news for an economy currently struggling markedly amid major Brexit, domestic political and global economic uncertainties – consumers have been the most resilient sector of the economy and their purchasing power will be critical to whether this resilience can continue."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/448a1fbcde7df090c6a9adfcbe56781e75a24816/0_118_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d428c822756427847cff96e9e6045525","title":"hot properties how oslo went wild for floating saunas","story":"When the city’s first floating sauna was banned by port authorities, its owners took it on the run, sparking a public crazeIt all began in September 2011, when Martin Lundberg sailed his boat into the marina in the fashionable Aker Brygge district in central Oslo, Norway.A native of Malmö, Sweden, Lundberg had spent the summer on his boat moored off one of Oslo’s islands. He didn’t have a job, or a home other than the boat.Lundberg was hugely disappointed. Most ports in Sweden have saunas, where it is part of the popular culture in neighbouring Finland saunas are practically a way of life. “And we didn’t have that in Norway.”Hamre, a proud Osloite, suggested what he assumed would be a logical conclusion: that they build a floating sauna themselves. He found a group of people who were visiting Norway for temporary seasonal work, established a camp on a beach in nearby Hovedøya island, and set about the construction as a kind of gift to the city. After all, he reasoned, Oslo was in the process of transforming its waterfront.Like many cities, Oslo has seen the fortunes of its harbour change dramatically. Forty years ago the area was full of warehouses and shipyards, and the water was heavily polluted. Then, in 1982, “our shipbuilding industry was shut down due to competition from Japan and Korea”, said Stein Kolstø of the city’s Waterfront Planning Office during the recent Urban Future global conference in Oslo.The city faced a dilemma: keep a working port with several port terminals, or open the harbour and fjord to the public. In January 2000, Oslo city council chose the latter. Its “fjord city” plan has seen former port areas redeveloped, creating around 52 hectares of parks and public spaces, 9,000 apartments and 50,000 workplaces. A major highway that had acted as a physical barrier between the city and the fjord was closed, and rebuilt underground. Polluted soil was dredged from the fjord, and the cargo terminal was moved round the coastline.Hamre assumed his DIY sauna would be welcome in this new, friendlier Oslo harbour. “On the outside of the sauna we used driftwood so it looked like it came out of the ocean,” he says, adding that the team sourced high-quality sauna wood from a local carpenter in exchange for doing some work for him. The idea was to make the sauna look like it had been washed up from the sea, but to create a clean, cosy, modern interior.The result was a striking and charmingly odd sight: a low ramshackle shed made from a patchwork of mismatched wooden planks, with a large black chimney and a palm plant on one side, it fit just 12 people. Unlike many modern Scandinavian saunas, which are sleek, contemporary and tasteful, designed by architects rather than anarchists, the small vessel was made with “more of an artistic approach”, says Hamre.Speaking at the Urban Future conference, Kolstø recalled the reaction from the planning lawyers: “No, it’s forbidden, it looks too bad, it can’t be here.”So Hamre and his team went on the run. They moved the sauna 14 times over the course of the year to different parts of the waterfront where it wouldn’t be seized. “We put it places that we knew the authorities didn’t have an eye on,” he says. Then they anchored it along a border between the jurisdiction of the municipality and the port authority, so that each thought it was the other’s problem.“I was surprised we weren’t welcome,” says Hamre. “But the bureaucrats weren’t ready for initiatives like this sauna. It wasn’t in the regulations to receive floating saunas. It’s an industrial harbour and they’re supposed to handle industrial ships and they don’t like all this recreational bullshit.”One day, however, the sauna’s fortunes changed: former footballer Freddy dos Santos Instagrammed a selfie next to it.Suddenly it was hot property. The team met an urban developer working for the municipality who became an advocate, and a cold water swimming group of workers from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs suggested they could help file paperwork to legalise the construction.One of those swimmers was Ragna Marie Fjeld, now director of the nonprofit Oslo Fjord Sauna (Sørenga Badstuflåte): “They didn’t have the resources to fight the bureaucracy, and do the applications, so we helped them. It’s difficult to get permission to stay in downtown Oslo, but we made it, because we know the bureaucracy. We know how to write applications and who to talk to.”The sauna, called Måken (“Seagull”), was eventually legalised, and is run as a co-operative by Oslo Fjord Sauna. “We were the first to have a sauna for public use in modern times in Oslo,” says Hamre, a historian.Others began to seize on the idea, and suddenly pop-up saunas – previously a typically private affair, something enjoyed at home with family or at a spa – were a public craze. Today Oslo Fjord Sauna now runs two floating saunas in the Bjørvika area, and has another two in the pipeline, while another business, KOK, runs three sauna boats. Further round the inlet is Salt, a cluster of tall wooden pyramids with food shacks, a bar, a concert venue and four saunas – the largest a huge glass-fronted amphitheatre where guests can listen to DJs and bands while they sweat.“In the next few years there will be 10-15 saunas by the harbour for the public,” predicts Lasse Eriksen, Norwegian member of the International Sauna Association.The new breed of public pop-up saunas is urban, social and popular with a younger crowd – Måken attracts a morning crowd of professionals in their 30s and 40s who head to work after an invigorating dip in the fjord. They have formed a key part of the reinvention of Oslo’s waterfront: the new Munch Museum, a 13-floor building covered in perforated aluminium, is due to open next year, as is the new public library, and a 9km harbour promenade and outdoor swimming area at nearby Sørenga is helping make this area busy with tourists and locals alike.Eriksen believes the ritualistic and ancient nature of sauna has been adopted as a tonic by the city’s younger people because of the pressures of modern life. “Sweat rituals are the oldest rituals we have,” he says. “The millennials want something real. They have all these worries. I believe for them it’s about authenticity and finding something true and real. There’s so much fake in the world.”KOK, meanwhile, is exporting the floating sauna idea with a franchise model. “Our motto is, a bit jokingly, ‘Make the ports clean again,’ as we believe modern societies acceptance of sub-par water quality in our cities ports should come to an end,” says the firm’s founder, Kristin Lorange.There remains an uneasiness around the recreational use of Oslo’s water: huge ferries and cruise ships dock on one side, at Vippetangen, and while the port of Oslo encourages swimming, paddling and sailing, safety is a major concern when people stray too close to docking areas. “It might be dangerous to be close to the ship fairway and docking areas,” says a spokesperson. “If you’re a big ferry you don’t expect people in your dock. We try to encourage people not to do that.”The licences for the floating saunas are also temporary: Oslo Fjord Sauna, for example, has permission for its saunas to stay for one more year, though “we hope we’ll be able to stay here permanently”, says Fjeld.Hamre is amused by how things have worked out. “What can I say? It’s the last laugh and all that. I go there all the time – I get a discount!”As for Lundberg, who’s only contactable on his boat his via VHF radio, he’s now in the town of Moss, south of Oslo, building another sauna.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3957e6fdd858e65ba02c8c7da0a475a59383c66/279_0_2561_1537/master/2561.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9eb571b2a79d7a9740d3a94bc43f28af","title":"ice rinks rides and rodeos wembleys early history in pictures","story":"Though perhaps now best known for its football stadium and its concerts, Wembley Park has held many attractions over the years.

Others raise two boys single-handedly in a market town in Essex, carry a smartphone with a perma-cracked screen, and do their best work in the dead of the night when the kids have gone to bed and there’s finally a bit of peace and quiet. Like Shaunagh Roberts.Not that Roberts saw herself playing any such role in the spring of 2018 when she and other parents at Waltham Holy Cross primary learned that the school had been judged inadequate by Ofsted inspectors and would be handed over to Net Academies Trust. It was only as Roberts began looking into those put in charge of her sons’ education that she learned that three Net schools had already been given to other trusts: evidence of Net being itself a failing trust.As she and other parents kept digging, they found that other locally known trusts had been recommended by Waltham Holy Cross but turned down – for no apparent reason. And they began to see the contempt for democracy that runs through the system for forcing “inadequate” locally run schools to convert to academies.More than 300 other primaries have been given to private trusts under this system in the past three years, yet neither parents nor staff are given any details about why a trust has been picked to run their local school – and this system affords them no say. Public meetings, parents’ marches and days of strikes (unheard of at Waltham Holy Cross, where barely any of the teachers were union members before) made no difference. No one wanted Net, and the transfer date kept getting pushed back, yet still the officials at the council and in Whitehall were adamant: the primary was going to Net.The way in which our school system has been transformed this decade has been, in its ugliest political facets, a rehearsal for the way in which our democratic norms are now being trashed. With academy schools, as with suspension of parliament, two of the key figures were Michael Gove and Dominic Cummings. In the face of widespread protest, Gove used procedures meant for emergencies like anti-terrorist laws to shove the Academies Act through parliament in just five working days.Around half of all children in state-funded schools are now taught by an academy trust. In this new system that is hostile to democracy, one select committee complained in January that “parents and local people have to fight to obtain even basic information about their children’s schools”. And the schools are accountable not to local councillors but only to officials in Whitehall.It was to those officials at the Department for Education (DfE) that staff and parents at Waltham Holy Cross went, after discovering the most damaging revelation a few weeks ago. Two sets of Ofsted-employed inspectors had visited the primary and found evidence that Net’s English teaching was tantamount to cheating, staff say. In some of the most egregious allegations, it is claimed that Net employees instructed teachers to go through children’s coursebooks and correct spelling and punctuation, using Post-it notes. The children would then copy the corrections, and the Post-its would be binned. According to legal correspondence I have seen, senior Net employees claimed in school meetings that this “helped” the children’s work “look good”.The allegations were reported twice to Department for Education officials and no material action appears to have been taken. Roberts then found a solicitor to write to Williamson. Government lawyers replied at the end of July saying that, in effect, officials had taken evidence from the head of Net, Jo Coton, and were satisfied there was no charge to investigate. For the next few weeks, Roberts and her lawyer collected evidence from staff at Waltham Holy Cross and other Net academies. They sent a sample of what they had found to the DfE – and last week the government conceded that they would conduct an urgent investigation, during which there would be no transfer. Neither the DfE nor Net will comment on what is now an official investigation, but Net does make the point that “there is no evidence to support the accusation that cheating happens in other Net Academies”.Roberts’s lawyer at Simpson Millar, Dan Rosenberg, has been an education law specialist for 14 years and has never before seen the government cave in to parents’ demands and call an investigation. He says: “The government’s reflex is normally to back the academy trust over parents.”Yet this is the kind of amazing victory that shows how much we have lost. While fighting this battle, Roberts and her two boys have been moved through different temporary accommodation four times. She has had to use food banks. She and other parents have stayed up night after night, investigating and organising. And, amid all the uncertainty, the staff at the formerly troubled school have turned it around so that it is bang in line with the national average – even while the British state has given tens of thousands to the incoming trust and to the consultants on the interim board of governors. Barely any of that money has reached the children, of course, but that is perhaps the point of British democracy today: a pantomime of concern, while directing all the power and cash elsewhere."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/509b59b2a2d27f483ebd41dcbef1f7b6dc5f5693/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ddf8e55a9e369cae48347eb2f312afdf","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of market","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘market’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘market’.Share your photos of what market means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 18 September at 10am.

They then asked the teens for advice on how Congress might combat one of the most urgent and politically contentious threats confronting world leaders: climate change.Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish activist who has galvanized young people across the world to strike for more action to combat the impact of global warming, politely reminded them that she was a student, not a scientist – or a senator.“Please save your praise. We don’t want it,” she said. “Don’t invite us here to just tell us how inspiring we are without actually doing anything about it because it doesn’t lead to anything.“If you want advice for what you should do, invite scientists, ask scientists for their expertise. We don’t want to be heard. We want the science to be heard.”In remarks meant for Congress as a whole, she said: “I know you are trying but just not hard enough. Sorry.”The audience laughed. Supporters broke into applause. Senator Ed Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who co-sponsored the Green New Deal and leads the Senate task force, was perhaps surprised by her bluntness. But he smiled.Seated at the table with the teens were some of the most sympathetic and vocal supporters of bold action on climate change in Congress. But facing a Republican-controlled Senate and a hostile White House, the prospect of enacting reforms at the scale and scope called for by activists – and many scientists – is bleak.“We need your leadership,” he told Thunberg. “Young people are the army politically, which has arrived in the United States. You put a spotlight on this issue in a way that it has never been before. And that is creating a new X factor.”Still, Markey vowed to try: “We hear you. We hear what you’re saying and we will redouble our efforts.”Thunberg was one of several youth activists invited to address the task force during two days of action and speeches aimed at urging lawmakers to support “transformative climate action”. She was joined by activists from across the US and South America, part of a “multiracial, intergenerational” effort to combat climate change.The meetings and speeches in Washington are intended to raise awareness ahead of a global climate strike on Friday in which students and workers will walk out of schools and offices to pressure their governments to act as world leaders gather in New York for the annual United Nations summit.“The generation of the Green New Deal will not only survive but we will thrive,” said Nadia Nazar, co-founder of the advocacy group Zero Hour, at a news conference earlier on Tuesday.“We will no longer be known as the kids fighting the apocalypse. We will be known as the solution to the climate crisis.”In the US, support for sweeping action on climate change is polarized. Many Republicans – among them Donald Trump – are still openly skeptical of the science behind global warming. Republican leaders have mocked Democrats for introducing a Green New Deal and have used the proposal as a cudgel against lawmakers and presidential candidates.Markey said their movement is shifting the political landscape. The senator pointed to the 2020 presidential debates as evidence of what has changed. Candidates are being asked about climate change and pushed to introduce plans to combat global warming. This is in stark contrast to 2016.“What has happened? You have happened,” he told the activists. “You are giving this extra level of energy to the political process that is absolutely changing the dynamics of politics in the United States.”The 2020 election, Markey said, will in many ways be a “referendum on climate change”.Thunberg arrived in the US after crossing the Atlantic on a solar-powered yacht.

At an ice station on a remote Arctic glacier, scientists are looking to the smallest of life forms to predict the pace of species extinctionby  Dan McDougall in Sermilik, 65˚40’ N and 38˚10’ W photographs by Carsten EgevangBehind the remote research huts of Sermilik ice station, a vast sheet of ice stretches north for 1,480 miles, ning an area three times the size of France.Across a narrow granite ravine separating the visitors’ hut from the main living quarters of the 40-year-old international scientists’ base, lab machines click and whirr through the night.The day’s samples – water, air, carbon, algae – spin frantically around curious-looking aluminium discs. Melting ice drips slowly into assorted beakers. Struggling to adjust to the midnight sun, a team of international research scientists from Aarhus University and Germany’s national research centre for solid earth sciences peer into microscopes at clues to the planet’s future. These are samples of glacial past and present, retrieved from the belly of the Mittivakkat glacier, which is in mortal retreat on the plateau above. To understand our origins, scientists look to the stars. To understand our eventual demise, the glacier is ground zero.Long hours are spent on the glacier and even more in the makeshift labs set up in a decrepit series of huts built in the late 1960s on the edge of this lonely archipelago some 40 miles away from the nearest settlement.Archive photographs in Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, show that the Mittivakkat glacier’s vast icy mouth opened out to the Arctic Ocean as recently as the 1950s. But to reach its heart in 2019 is a hike many miles inland, crossing rocky terrain in entirely unexpected 23-degree heat. Lichen and unseasonal arctic flowers line the route, as do thirsty mosquitoes, who feast on the moisture of human eyeballs, relenting only at the ice line.Flying over a glacier by helicopter it’s easy to dismiss the landscape as devoid of life, but for the seven scientists at Sermilik hiking over the ice, it is a source of constant fascination for animal and plant life.Alexandre Anesio is a professor in Arctic biogeochemistry from Aarhus University. A charismatic Brazilian, he has a rifle slung over his shoulders – one of four armed researchers, all on constant vigil for the polar bears who stalk the coastline here. He is also probably the worst shot. His young doctoral students, Eva Doting and Laura Halbach, look more keen-eyed, having spent the last month preparing by shooting polar bear targets at a rifle range in Copenhagen.On the ’s first evening, over supper, Anesio explains with earnest patience that snow isn’t universally white. Some of the last snow to lie on the surface of the earth, long after the human race is gone, might even be red. Not blood-red – more a watermelon hue.He also talks about how, in the end, the fate of our glaciers, sea-level rises and bioersity loss, will not only come down to the excesses of the industrial age and our unbridled consumer life, but also to the influence of algae.The sticky green residue familiar from childhood tadpole ponds, as it turns out, could be a microscopic bellwether for this age of extinction.Each year, high on Greenland’s glaciers, algae perform a remarkable migration. After spending winter deep in the snowpack as dormant cysts, they awake in spring and swim through snowmelt, iding and photosynthesising along the route.When they reach the surface, the algae turn black, dark green and crimson – colours that come from astaxanthin, a molecular cousin of the chemical that makes sweet potato orange.The algae produce it as a sunscreen, as it absorbs UV light. As a consequence the humble algae dramatically reduce the amount of sunlight reflected by Greenland’s glaciers and increase the sunlight they absorb, darkening the snow and ice.Most concerning for the researchers out on the glacier is the fact the algae that live on the ice surface in summer are increasingly dark brown, leading them to absorb more sunlight and exacerbate melting.Along with his colleague Professor Liane Benning, Anesio leads a team responsible for this breakthrough discovery.As algae spread, the effect will be compounded, leading to even more melting. Benning, of the German Research Centre for Geosciences or GFZ in Potsdam, was previously part of the Black and Bloom project to understand how and why the Greenland ice sheet is melting. She says algae-discoloured snow isn’t just an Arctic phenomenon.“It’s a global occurrence,” she says. “This is increasingly a problem in the Arctic, Alpine and Himalayan glaciers. Blooms of red snow and brown ice are turning up in Antarctica also. What we hope to do is spread our research out further because we believe this is a significant factor in ice melt. This is why we are back here in Greenland but we believe the work also needs to be done elsewhere.”The sound of a city block-sized portion of ice as it separates from Greenland’s ice shelf is unique. A violent sonic boom is followed by an echoing machine-gun style “ak-ak-ak-ak” as the iceberg turns on its axis, before surrendering to the ocean with an eerie silence. There is a sadness to it. On one single day last month, Nasa’s Oceans Melting Greenland project announced that Greenland’s ice sheet had suffered its most substantial single-day volume loss on record, sending an estimated 12.5bn tonnes of ice pouring into the Arctic Ocean – a body of water that could cover the whole of England in five inches of water. If the Greenland ice sheet disappeared tomorrow, sea levels around the world would rise by seven metres and life, as we know it, would come to an end.Sermilik’s scientists argue for serious thinking and funding to understand glacier loss. For Anesio, who left his job at Bristol University, transferring to Denmark because of the potential impact of Brexit on his research, science has to be “something collaborative”.“Our job as scientists is to create more accurate models and add to our global understanding of the climate crisis so that it can be used for politicians to take action – we hope, a little bit faster than is happening now.”As glaciers retreat from India to Greenland, bioersity is being lost. According to the UN one million species face extinction due to human influence. Such a collapse in bioersity would wreak havoc on the interconnected ecosystems of the planet, putting humans at risk by compromising food sources, fouling clean water and air, and eroding defences against extreme weather such as hurricanes and floods.As Greenland’s ice melt has been adopted by the world as a global bellwether for climate crisis, less focus is being placed on the impact on bioersity.This ice sheet is not just being melted by algae bloom and from above by warmer air temperatures. Arctic waters are reaching record high temperatures and warmer water is lapping against these great glaciers.For Greenland, one of the least densely populated countries in the world, the impact will be felt on land by the nation’s flowers, plants, bushes and heather, its polar bears, caribous, arctic hares, foxes and wolves and at sea by narwhals, seals, bowhead whales and the large variety of unique sea birds.This is bioersity that actually faces few direct pressures from human activities – the major threat is glacial melt and climate crisis. The shrinking of the sea ice area is already having a significant impact on marine ecosystems. It’s an essential habitat and breeding ground for many species, ranging from micro-algae to marine mammals.This is now a hungry time for polar bears struggling to access the sea ice to hunt for seals. An estimated 3,500 of the bears stalk the coastline of Greenland and at Sermilik, stories are swapped of close encounters with the animals.Scientific labours in the chill winds and high seas of the Arctic summer seem wrapped in an unusual sense of urgency this year. The scientists working in Greenland are keen to communicate their new, emerging understanding of the dynamics of the declining ice sheet to the broader world.According to Christopher Trivedi, a US member of the scientific team, communicating the work of the many scientists active across Greenland to local people is a vital and often overlooked part of the job. “I think science communication matters. We need to include the local community here with the work we are doing, and we also have a responsibility to explain the work we are doing here. What we are finding impacts the immediate environment more than anywhere else.”For the younger members of the Sermilik team, the bleakest conversation held at the ice station is around the plastic being discovered.“We are finding plastics in the atmosphere at the centre of Greenland’s ice sheet,” says Dr James Bradley, assistant professor at the Queen Mary University of London. “Millions of tonnes of plastic are discarded into the environment every year and are broken down into small particles and fibres that do not biodegrade. These particles, known as microplastics, have now been found everywhere from high mountains to deep oceans and can carry toxic chemicals and harmful microbes. Microplastics are tiny pieces of plastic waste. Their presence in oceans and waterways has received a great deal of scientific and media attention in recent years, but our growing concern is their presence in the atmosphere.”It is evident that all the scientists feel a growing responsibility on their shoulders to answer questions that have been ignored for too long. This summer, in the face of record ice melt, there is a deeper purpose and an urgency to their work. They want more resources and new technologies to map the details of ice loss with greater precision. They want better global monitoring of nutrients and contaminants that are now trickling at ever higher rates from glaciers into downstream waterways. They want to expand their work to Antarctica and other parts of the glacial world.“To be honest, I’m massively worried,” says Anesio. “I just hope that we are not crossing that tipping point because I don’t think humans can adapt to the rates of changing climates at the moment.”He says that he also has hope, “because I can see a new movement in the young generation that cares. I think that everyone inidually can contribute, by pressing politicians, but also by making their contribution in terms of the reduction of CO2.”Leaving the ice station by boat, negotiating the same narrow channel of icebergs that brought us here, we pass over the shattered remnants of a glacier and stop to scoop a 1,000-year-old chunk of ice from the water. These lumps of ice can only meet one path, drifting out into the Arctic sea at the mercy of winds and warm currents until they break apart into the ocean.Days later, further north of the island, a local ship’s captain summed things up with his Greenlandic dark humour. “That noise you hear out there. The fizzing and cracking,” he tells me, cupping his ear to the wind for dramatic effect as his old wooden ship passes through a fjord filled with decaying mountains of ice.“That noise is the end of the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26cc43a37e8117f559534f306a9a3e4b92c064a8/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39d5f92bce2223f7a35c6072a18857fa","title":"uks best sea view photography competition 2019","story":"National maritime charity, the Shipwrecked Mariners’ Society, has revealed the eagerly awaited results of its seventh annual photography competition, showcasing images relating to all aspects of the UK’s historic relationship with the sea.Having reviewed more than 800 fantastic entries, the judges decided to award Laurence Hartwell the prize for overall winner for 2019, with his entry ‘Landing Mackerel’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41dcc22c2101aa340818ea95571c01b9f9451b1f/0_0_4800_3200/master/4800.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=371bbbca56dd665b6221edea43c69013 660w","title":"walk on the wild side animal prints stalk the streets in pictures","story":"From leopard to zebra, take inspiration from these menswear looks this season.

It would be a pity to damage this one’There’s no official news that a Princess Bride remake is in the works – don’t panic – but the mere mention of the idea has been descended on by fans of the original, with the actor Jamie Lee Curtis, the film’s original star Cary Elwes, and even the US senator Ted Cruz among those declaring it “inconceivable”.The drama began with a Variety profile of the film’s producer Norman Lear. In the article, Sony Pictures Entertainment’s chief executive, Tony Vinciquerra, was quoted as saying: “Very famous people whose names I won’t use, but they want to redo The Princess Bride … Not a month goes by when we don’t have an idea coming from some very big name wanting to do things with Norman.”It was a tiny sentence in a small paragraph of a large profile but it was also the quote that Variety used to share the piece. This led to an outcry, with Elwes – who played Westley in the 1987 Rob Reiner cult classic – among many who took to Twitter to lament the idea.“There’s a shortage of perfect movies in this world,” he tweeted. “It would be a pity to damage this one.” Curtis, who married another of the film’s stars, Christopher Guest, also joined the fray, saying “there is only ONE The Princess Bride”.And Cruz called the film “the greatest thing in the world”, adding his own quote from the original.Climbing further up the Cliffs of Insanity, Seth Rogen was forced to deny his involvement in the project.Others noted that attempting to remake the widely beloved and famously quotable film, which the  said was the 23rd best sci-fi and fantasy film of all time, was inadvisable in the extreme.Based on the 1973 novel by William Goldman, the original film wasn’t a box office hit when it debuted in 1987 but has since become beloved as a cult classic.To do it over, many believe, would add insult to injury to a generation who have been smothered by remakes. Aladdin, The Lion King, Dumbo and The Dark Crystal – whose original was released four years before The Princess Bride – are among the latest examples of the film industry’s pitch for the nostalgia buck, a strategy which has mixed success.As one Twitter user put it: “I like that in these chaotic times we can all put aside our differences and agree that no one should remake The Princess Bride.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a706bd8f15a879f8bb66efc57050d8ba95ad712b/0_1171_6712_4028/master/6712.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0929f4d5cb2ac3b91fef2653ce2d02ab","title":"how to make summer pudding recipe felicity cloake","story":"Snap up bargain berries and snaffle the last of the crop from the hedgerows and make this seasonal filling, fruity classicSummer pudding is an old-fashioned and peculiarly British pleasure – a solid lump of stodge designed to be enjoyed when our berries are at their world-class peak. Well chilled, however, it’s surprisingly refreshing stuff, and refreshingly thrifty as well – the perfect home for that stale loaf and those over-ripe berries going cheap at the market.Butter, to greaseHalf a loaf of slightly stale, good-quality white bread225g redcurrants675g raspberries2–3 tbsp caster sugarIf your bread is obstinately fresh, very lightly toast it before use, or it may disintegrate under the weight of the fruit juices. There are advocates for cheap white sliced here, but, like brioche, I find it too soft and squidgy for the purpose. Decent white bread is the way to go, but do try to get it machine-sliced, if possible, because it will make for a neater finish.If you can’t get machine-sliced, cut the loaf into medium slices, then cut off the crusts and set aside to make breadcrumbs (or feed them to the dog). With a little butter, grease a pudding basin or a deep bowl with a capacity of about a litre (measure this by filling it with water, then tipping it into a measuring jug).Line the inside of the basin all over with a single layer of bread, cutting it as necessary to make a base and fitting it around the sides without any gaps. Finally, make a lid in the same way, but leave this off for the time being. Set the basin aside while you prepare the filling.After removing any stalks, put the fruit (sweet raspberries and sharp redcurrants are the classic combo here, but they’re not the only choice – see step 9) in a small pan with the sugar and bring to a very gentle simmer over a medium-low heat – give it a bit of a stir now and then, to help dissolve the sugar, but try to keep the berries intact.Taste and add more sugar, or a squeeze of lemon juice or wine vinegar, if you think it necessary (remember, the bread is fairly bland, so you can get away with strong flavours here). Then, gently spoon the fruit into the bread-lined basin and pour over most of the syrup, reserving any excess fruit or juices for serving.Put the bread lid on top of the fruit filling, then put a plate on top of that and weigh it down with some tins or something else heavy. Once it feels cool to the touch, transfer to the fridge, still weighted down, and chill for at least four hours, and ideally overnight, to give the fruit and bread a chance to mingle.Remove the weight and plate, and put a large serving plate (one with a pronounced lip is advisable, to keep all the juices in check) over the top. Very carefully turn over the basin, give it a sharp tap on the base and around the sides, then lift off to reveal the pudding.Pour the reserved syrup over the top of the pudding (this is particularly useful for covering any pale patches where the juices haven’t quite soaked in evenly) and arrange any leftover fruit artistically on top a few mint leaves also look nice, if you have some to hand. Serve at once with a generous jug of cool double cream.Summer pudding can be made with a variety of fruit, including blackcurrants and blackberries, and even defrosted frozen fruit, though that will tend to break down into a coulis on heating, so fresh is preferable. I also like to add a dash of rosewater to the fruit, but you could substitute liqueur (sloe gin, for example), orange zest or vanilla sugar."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/807cd592c6604dfc2db8bb0f7d19f893dc2d5eb1/207_311_3884_2330/master/3884.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4923992e059ccdfb1ca3a4b168377c3b","title":"chelsea ross barkley vows step up again penalty miss valencia champions league","story":"Ross Barkley will not shy away from taking another penalty after arguing with Willian before his costly miss during Chelsea’s defeat by Valencia at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday.Chelsea were handed a chance to rescue a point from their opening Champions League game when they won a late penalty but there was confusion when Willian, who has confirmed he wanted to take the spot-kick, unsuccessfully tried to convince Barkley to give him the ball. Jorginho also spoke to Barkley, who ignored his teammates before sending his effort over via the top of the bar.Frank Lampard defended Barkley after a defeat that leaves his side’s hopes of reaching the last 16 in doubt, saying that spot-kick duties fall to the 25-year-old when he is on the pitch. The England midfielder came on for Mateo Kovacic in the 80th minute and he insists that he will not hesitate to step up again in similar circumstances, even though he has only scored three penalties outside shootouts.“If there was another penalty in the game I would have been confident of taking it,” Barkley said. “You can miss penalties. It’s not the end of the world. We’ve got five more group games to go that we’re aiming to win. Today just didn’t go our way. It’s disappointing really.”Barkley played down his discussions with Jorginho and Willian and said that he was following Lampard’s orders.“They were just encouraging me, encouraging me to score the goal,” the former Everton player said. “They are confident of taking penalties as well but I take penalties every day, I don’t miss them in training and in pre-season I was scoring penalties. I’ve missed penalties before, when I was at Everton. I’m gutted I missed but these things happen.“We’ve got a lot of good penalty-takers in the squad. On a sheet in the changing room it says I’m on penalties when I’m on the pitch, otherwise it’s Jorginho. It’s more: ‘Good luck with the penalty’ type of thing, encouraging me. They would have been willing to take it as well but I felt confident.”Chelsea are under pressure in Group H before visiting Ajax and Lille next month and Lampard also has concerns over Mason Mount’s fitness after the midfielder limped off with an ankle injury against Valencia. Mount, who was caught by an ugly foul from Francis Coquelin, is a doubt to face the Premier League leaders Liverpool at Stamford Bridge on Sunday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54a6ac5aefb5770316ed459408daa60a8b612b30/377_341_1283_770/master/1283.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db239713808cc0ebd024f2bbad015c37","title":"erling braut haaland red bull salzburg champions league hat trick","story":"The 19-year-old son of Alfie Håland scored a hat-trick on his Champions League debut on Tuesday and has 17 goals in nine games for Red Bull Salzburg this season“This year I’ve only grown five centimetres,” Erling Braut Haaland said in an interview in November 2017, a statement which, understandably, led the journalist to query the “only” part. “Well, last year I grew 11-12 centimetres,” came the reply from the then 17-year-old.No wonder they called him “the manchild” at Molde, where he had his breakthrough that year. “He must have put on 10-12 kilos since he arrived here at the start of the year,” said his then manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjær, before adding “it’s all muscles of course – as well as a lot of confidence”.Haaland, son of the former Manchester City and Leeds United midfielder Alfie Håland and born in Yorkshire, was not always destined for success. “The first time he turned up at Molde I didn’t think he was all that,” Ruben Gabrielsen, a former teammate, told Nettavisen recently. “But then he developed in a way I’ve never seen in my whole life. He is stronger than he looks and he is a lot quicker than he looks – he is a beast.”A beast is not a bad description. Just ask the Genk defenders who felt the force of the now 19-year-old Red Bull Salzburg striker on Tuesday as he scored a hat-trick on his Champions League debut, a feat not achieved since Wayne Rooney in 2004. The first goal arrived after 102 seconds, the Norwegian rifling a low shot underneath Gaëtan Coucke in the Genk goal. The second was scored with his left foot and the third was an opportunistic stab past Coucke from inside the six-yard box.The game finished 6-2 and afterwards Haaland’s teammate Maximilian Wöber could hardly contain his glee, saying: “He is phenomenal. With his height, to be so nimble and have such command of the ball. It’s really hard to play against him in training – you just have to foul him. Once again he proved why he’s definitely going to become one of the best strikers in the world.”It may sound a ridiculous statement, but this is one extremely talented and hard-working young man. His career is being meticulously planned by his father and, almost inevitably, Mino Raiola and he has already changed his name from Håland to Haaland, one suspects to make it more international. “One step ahead,” he said with a smile when asked about it.One step ahead indeed. He arrived at Molde in January 2017 after 16 games and no goals for Bryne in the second tier. Then he got to work. Along with the centimetres and the kilos came the goals. He scored four in 20 games in 2017 before hitting 12 in 25 appearances the following year, including a remarkable four-goal haul against league leaders Brann in July. Before the game Brann had conceded five goals in 14 games but Haaland took only 20 minutes to destroy that defence.His decision to join Salzburg in January 2019 raised eyebrows as he had offers from Juventus and Bayer Leverkusen among others. Salzburg had to pay around £8m but that already seems like one of the deals of the decade.“I was obviously flattered by Juventus being interested,” he said in January, before adding “but I thought that it was to early to go there. Salzburg was the club that suited me the best and they were the ones who wanted me the most. I also think it was very important to look at how important a part I was going to play for the club I joined. There is more of a chance of playing here.”Haaland has a remarkable 17 goals in nine games for Salzburg this season and in May he scored nine goals in an Under-20 World Cup game against Honduras. Afterwards he said that he should have got 10 and no one was quite sure whether he was joking.Like many talented 19-year-olds he does want to become the best player on the planet but he is taking one step at the time. “That’s the dream yes, but a dream I share with a million other young players in the world,” he said this year. “First of all I got to become better than my dad and he had 181 Premier League games so that is one aim for example: to get more games there than him.”Manchester United are one of several clubs who have been linked with Haaland, who has praised Solskjær for the role the manager played in his development, but considering his father’s City past and that horrible Roy Keane tackle on his father that may be an unlikely destination. Haaland is a Leeds fan, having been born in the city, and has said he would like to win the Premier League with the club, although they will have to improve drastically for Haaland to contemplate a move to Elland Road (and he has played for Norway’s senior side so there is no chance of him declaring for the country of his birth).For now, though, he is fully focused on Red Bull Salzburg. “It is not right to talk about other clubs when you are with a team and they are paying your wages,” Alfie Håland said recently. “You have to focus on your current club and give everything for them.”For Haaland that means Austrian Bundesliga games against LASK, Rapid Vienna and Austria Vienna before the next Champions League game, against Liverpool at Anfield on 2 October. And the chances of this latest success going to his head appear remote. His Salzburg manager, Jesse Marsch, praised Haaland after the game against Genk, saying what a genuine and down-to-earth person he is. “He is a great player but even more important for me is that he’s a great young man,” the American said. “He shows up every day, he works hard and takes nothing for granted. He gives everything for his teammates every day and does it with a smile.”According to Haaland his approach to life and football stems from his early years in Norway. “Without my upbringing in Bryne I would not be where I am today,” he said recently. “We have a special environment there. It has always contributed towards me not thinking that I am not something special. I have always been humble, worked hard and not thought much about other things.”Humble yet devastating, Haaland could become one of the best in the world.

The notion had been put to the manager that Liverpool are, in a snapshot, the best football team out there: convincing Champions League winners last season and five points clear in the Premier League.Even a stopped clock tells the right time twice a day and for once Uefa’s cheese-laden anthem – the soundtrack down the years to so much autumn mediocrity – had seemed to strike the right note at the start of this thrillingly full-throttle Group E opener. Sie sind die Besten!Well, not playing like this. At which point, enter the reality of Champions League football against the genuine club elite of defending a title and of an opponent with the capacity to seek out Liverpool’s own weak spots, in particular the space behind those rampaging full-backs.At the end of this 2-0 victory for Carlo Ancelotti’s well-drilled team, the Stadio San Paolo produced a great barrelling wave of noise around its crumbling concrete tiers. The blue-shirted players fell to their knees, then went to applaud the curva sud like a team of trophy winners. Never mind the champion talk. Napoli had played entirely without fear from the start, a quality that is occasionally missing in some Premier League teams.It should be said Liverpool will not face many better sides this season. But the ones they do will have been watching and taking notes. Napoli matched Liverpool’s intensity. But they also came for their tender spots. It seemed fitting the penalty that in effect decided this game should come from a foul (as seen by the referee: it was soft) by one of Liverpool’s full-backs.It was Andrew Robertson who appeared to trip José Callejón as he skipped inside with 80 minutes gone and from the start Napoli had looked to play quick lateral passes into the spaces on those flanks, seeking the weakness that accompanies Liverpool’s great attacking strength. This is still essentially a team that tries to win by running forwards, by making the game happen in other spaces far from their own goal. There was an element of theatrics to the fall. But it had been coming, in a rollicking game of counterattack, of sudden yawning spaces and high-speed forward combinations.From the start Liverpool were tested by a Napoli gameplan that involved breaking the press and springing forward in numbers. This will be the pattern now. Europe has had two years to study the way Klopp’s red machine operates.For his part, Klopp had spoken about intensity rather than tactics before the game, with the suggestion Liverpool’s defeat here last season had been down to their own lack of vigour more than anything else. It is a variation on the old Alex Ferguson line: his teams were never beaten, they just ran out of time. Klopp also likes to suggest Liverpool’s winning or losing is a function of how correctly they can pitch their own level, from the controlled style of the more routine Premier League victories to the full face-melting fury press and counter-press.Early on Liverpool were comfortable, right up until the first Napoli raid down the right side, Trent Alexander-Arnold paddling suddenly, stuck miles upfield as the blue shirts stormed into the space behind. Hirving Lozano ended up putting the ball in the net from an offside position after a fine double save from Adrián.It is a huge strength that Liverpool’s full-backs go toe-to-toe. But Alexander-Arnold’s flank was overrun at times in the first half, the combination with Mohamed Salah as defensively secure as a beaded door curtain.Liverpool’s hard-graft midfield chased and held Napoli but rarely found it easy to rest on the ball. In front of them the attacking three worked and shifted position, but Kalidou Koulibaly in particular produced a masterful display of one-on-one defending.The spaces never quite seemed to open up. The blue shirts sat off their men, then pressed with a real mania. There were some poor decisions: Sadio Mané in particular waited an age as Salah surged through in space, then pushed him wide of goal with a heavy pass.Napoli’s second goal came with the game falling apart slightly. Virgil van Dijk played a poor pass, Fernando Llorente took advantage and finished neatly. And perhaps Napoli did Liverpool a favour here. This is what happens to champions: their opponents come prepared.Klopp will adapt. This is a Liverpool team built out of graft, out of players performing for the collective and refining their strengths. But the warning was there in Naples: nothing is ever fixed, nothing is ever done just as Klopp is right to feel this team will always have to keep running to move forward."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ffeac2e0923b2d15ea9af0b985ea4d0218ccd1c/0_0_1731_1039/master/1731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10f69bb1d4d9c32a325322db821a8e04","title":"celebrate the day how to plan a gathering at the last minute","story":"Summer is the season for spontaneity, so why not make the most of bright days and long nights with a spur-of-the-moment do? Here’s our guide to making it a night to rememberWhen was the last time you had an impromptu get-together? There’s always a good reason not to. On Friday night, you’re tired from work. Saturday comes, and you just want to relax after a busy week. And on Sunday, well, it’s Monday tomorrow!But there are really so many reasons to organise a do at short notice, from a surprise bank holiday heatwave to keeping the holiday vibes going after you’ve returned from a sunny beach trip abroad. To make sure your last-minute shindig is one to remember, here are a few tips to elevate your soiree without breaking a sweat.Curate the guest listForget Facebook. In 2019 we WhatsApp. Forming a WhatsApp group for your party creates a space for invitees who don’t know each other to break the ice, and keeps your guest list to only people who know you well enough to have their number, not whoever you feel obliged to add as you scroll through every person you’ve ever met since 2006. If two invitees are exes, invite both, tell them to discuss who (if not both) should attend, and assure them they’ll both be ejected if they start rowing in the kitchen. As far as inviting colleagues goes, best to limit it to people in your after-work drinks crew.Choose a second-in-commandPerhaps the most important tip is to select a good friend to help you keep an eye on food and drink, playlist coups, general tidying and other party admin to keep your own stress levels low. They can even subtly begin the party exodus on your command, so long as they’re the sort of pal you can turn to and say: “Right, I’ve had enough, get everyone out now.” We all need a friend like that.Democratise the playlistThere’s nothing more irritating than guests commandeering the music, but once the drinks have started flowing, people will inevitably try their luck. Avoid this by inviting your guests to help with the playlist. Ask each to send a couple of suggestions when they confirm they’re coming, whack it all together on Spotify and then dilute it with your own picks – it’s your party, you deserve that.Don’t be precious over glassesYou can get those plastic throwaway champagne flutes and martini glasses nowadays, but frankly it’s a waste of money and plastic. We’re in Britain, so chances are your household will have at least 20 perfectly useable mugs of varying taste levels in your cupboards, and anyone who judges you for using these shouldn’t be on the guestlist in the first place. There’s enough plastic being dumped into the world without you adding extra because you can’t be bothered to wash up at the end of your do – and that’s what the aforementioned second-in-command is for, anyway.Encourage photography, not selfiesInstagram is a wonderful thing, but in the age of Stories, selfies and #squadlife, it’s easy to forget that photos used to be something you had to wait for. That is, you had to finish a roll of film, then go and get it developed, and all with no idea of what the results would look like. But that was part of the fun of course, and – dare I say it – encouraged people to take better, more spontaneous and authentic photos. So, rather than posing for endless posts, why not pick up four or five disposable cameras and distribute them among your friends to take pics throughout the evening? The classic Kodak single-use is still great for colour shots, or for a touch of perennial monochrome cool, try Ilford’s range of black and white disposables.Make some nibbles to rememberIt’s really easy to make simple food feel a bit fancy with just a few additions. Fill paper cups with salted popcorn mixed with spices like za’atar and sumac for a warming, Middle Eastern twist, or toss some walnut halves in a pan with soy sauce to make a crunchy salad topping brimming with umami. You can also roast broccoli with olive oil, salt, garlic, fresh chilli and lemon juice for plant-based finger food that’s surprisingly tasty – and won’t have your guests feeling lethargic a couple of hours after eating. A homemade dip is an easy way to impress too – tzatziki is a personal favourite, and I like to use Nigel Slater’s recipe, minus the dill.Don’t forget the detailsIt’s the little things that make a party flow: lime wedges stored in the fridge, waiting to be plopped into drinks wifi password shared before guests arrive extra toilet paper lots of – and I can’t stress this enough – kitchen roll and sun cream! Try and pre-empt the sorts of details guests might need during the party, and have them out, ready and signposted. If nothing else, it’ll stop them interrupting you in the middle of dancing to Beyoncé.Check out some more cocktail recipes at greygoose"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc82f3153cf44cac67da6e0a97f0fb59fea9a838/59_0_834_500/master/834.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b8a0a393d903616c74bd519b77eed59","title":"its about the morning afters why the joy of friendship isnt found in the big moments","story":"Great friendships aren’t forged on the big nights out, but the spontaneous moments when the phones are forgotten about, and conversation and laughter flows freely, says Lauren BravoMy best friend and I live on opposite sides of London, but we share a hairdresser. Once every two months, she makes the 90-minute journey to my flat and we both have our highlights done by Lesley, the fastest bleaching brush in the west. While she works, we gossip and cackle and unpack every idle thought and silly piece of trivia we’ve forgotten to tell each other during the intervening weeks. Afterwards we preen, we put music on and she goes through my bedroom and tries on my clothes. For a few hours it feels as though we’re teenagers again. Only with much better hair.Increasingly I’m realising it’s these small, informal moments-between-moments that really make a friendship. The getting-readys. The morning-afters. The shall-we-just-stay-ins.Far and away my favourite moment of freshers’ week at university was the night I spent holed up in a halls of residence dorm room watching a DVD of Fawlty Towers, with a group of new friends who, like me, had elected to skip the Crazy Wild West Hoedown happening in the campus bar downstairs. While everyone else cavorted in panic-bought Stetsons to Cotton Eye Joe, we watched Basil being hit unconscious by the falling moose’s head and congratulated ourselves on our choices.Those new friends went on to become my housemates, my pub quiz team, my unofficial counsellors and confidantes. They’re the people with whom I have staged a gleeful fake Christmas every December for the past 12 years, the festivities growing marginally more civilised as our lives have (we eat our turkey dinner around a table now – not, as in 2009, out of saucepans while sat on the stairs). And when we reminisce, our favourite memories are never the big-ticket items. End of year balls? Fine. Graduation? Cool, I suppose. But the spontaneous kitchen dance parties? Legendary. Likewise the best part of a big night out was rarely the night itself it was the Bloody Marys with brunch the next day, that clink of ice and hit of pepper, as we pieced together everyone’s juicy titbits from the night before like a great big gossip jigsaw.It’s how so many of my most cherished friendships were forged – not in life-changing experiences, but in leisurely hours spent talking nonsense, howling with laughter at nothing in particular. It’s easy to feel affection for everyone in the dazzle of a Big Life Moment, or the warmth of its afterglow. But it’s on the ordinary days, the rainy days and Mondays, that you find your true ride-or-dies.And that’s especially true as you get older. As people disperse across cities, counties, even countries, and friendship has to be increasingly meted out between the Big Life Moments the weddings, the birthday drinks, the housewarmings and baby showers. When the casual, everyday chit-chat we used to take for granted gets relegated to WhatsApp groups and Instagram likes, and IRL meet-ups have to be scheduled weeks in advance. Idling away time together becomes a rare luxury, while savouring it becomes all the more important. No longer the easy proximity and empty diaries, which meant you could fill an evening with one magic word: “pub?”The significant milestones can give you lovely reasons to celebrate, sure – but they can also pile on the pressure. How many times have you heard happy couples lament that they barely had a chance to exchange more than two words with their friends on their wedding day, before being swept away by a wave of excitable aunts? The hen weekends where you’re so stressed about the logistics of getting everyone from the pottery class to the knicker-making workshop that you forget to have a good time. The dinners where it takes so long to catch up on everyone’s top-line news that you’re still discussing mortgage rates and maternity leave by the time the bill comes. If we rely on the Big Life Moments to bring us together, we risk missing out on the deeper conversations and the daft interludes, both of which can make even the most ordinary of days feel like a special occasion.So it’s important to remember all of the other ways you connect with people – and the other people you connect with. Maybe it’s the friend who drags you to their weird evening class once a month, and rewards you with a good cocktail afterwards. The pal who will get up at dawn to drive to a car boot sale, then talk you out of buying a three-foot high stuffed fox (“it’s kitsch!”). Your film buff mate who will come over to watch arty foreign-language flicks with an armful of continental cheeses, knowing you’re both going to talk the whole way through, Espresso Martinis in hand. Your Eurovision crew, your board games gang, your summer solstice picnic posse. Here’s an idea: every time you say “we should do this every weekmonthyear!”, why not try … actually doing that? Leave your phone in your bag. Skip the administrative catch-up and talk about whatever crosses your mind instead. Let a nothingy Tuesday night mean as much, if not more than celebrating a birthday, an engagement or promotion – and mix up some suitably convivial cocktails to match. Blood Orange Sangrias, anyone?Don’t hang around waiting for the next Big Life Moment to get together with your friends. Because every shared evening, every new in-joke and every Seemingly Inconsequential Pow-wow (SIP?) is absolutely worth toasting, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/258bc46846eae776a80ede4827b7dcb7c17d7d39/809_0_4943_2966/master/4943.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33015724939e602b3365bc972200848c","title":"travelex atm cash receipt out of order","story":"I got a receipt from the machine but no money … and no actionI used a Travelex cash machine to withdraw €100 at Heathrow Terminal 4 at the beginning of July. It returned my debit card, but issued no cash. Worryingly, however, it did issue a receipt. Staff at the adjacent Travelex desk nonchalantly told me that “this happens sometimes” if the machine is jammed or has run out of bank notes and that I would not be debited. My bank confirmed the transaction had gone through and I would be refunded. The Travelex manager at Heathrow would only speak to me over the phone and could offer no further advice. Twelve days later, I had still not been refunded. My experience of Travelex customer services was dismal. The assistant wouldn’t even put up an “out of order” sign on the machine in case it still issued other currencies. SA, LondonMy experience is just as dismal. Its press office stirred itself to promise a response over three weeks after I alerted it to your experience, then fell silent again. My subsequent reminders have been ignored. Its insouciance is scandalous given the potential scale of customer losses.Luckily, your bank refunded you two weeks after the withdrawal, but it can be a long, fruitless battle to get your money back when cash machines fail to deliver. In future, steer clear of currency exchange ATMs, and not just because they may not issue the money.A bank cash machine used abroad will supply the requested euros, then your bank will convert the sum to sterling using a published conversion rate, plus a small fee. A Travelex ATM will convert the amount of your withdrawal to sterling at its own higher exchange rate, before notifying your bank. You also pay significantly more to exchange currency at airports, whether using a machine or a human, so always research the best deals online and buy before you travel.If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

Senior shadow cabinet figures – John McDonnell, Emily Thornberry, Tom Watson and Nick Brown – have all said they would want to campaign to stay in the bloc regardless of any Brexit deal negotiated by Labour.However, Corbyn’s statement is the strongest sign yet that he will resist demands to pick a side and would opt to stay out of campaigning in a second referendum on a Labour-negotiated Brexit deal, allowing him to pitch himself as the neutral referee who pledges to carry out whatever the public decides.This would help avoid the situation David Cameron found himself in as prime minister in 2016, when he resigned from No 10 after ending up on the losing side.Writing in the , Corbyn laid down a marker of his determination to seek a better Brexit deal from the EU, which the party believes it could negotiate quickly based on conversations already undertaken with Brussels.“A Labour government would secure a sensible deal based on the terms we have long advocated, including a new customs union with the EU a close single market relationship and guarantees of workers’ rights and environmental protections,” he said. “We would then put that to a public vote alongside remain. I pledge to carry out whatever the people decide, as a Labour prime minister.”This would form the basis of what Corbyn describes as a “credible leave option” which would be offered at a referendum against the option of remaining in the EU.Corbyn also positioned Labour as “the only UK-wide party ready to put our trust in the people of Britain to make the decision”, after the Liberal Democrats changed their position to campaigning for a revocation of article 50 in a bid to attract remain voters.He said: “Johnson wants to crash out with no deal. That is something opposed by business, industry, the trade unions and most of the public – and even by the Vote Leave campaign’s co-convener, Michael Gove, who said earlier this year: ‘We didn’t vote to leave without a deal.’“And now the Liberal Democrats want MPs to overturn the referendum result by revoking article 50 in a parliamentary stitch-up. It is simply undemocratic to override the decision of a majority of the voters without going back to the people.“Labour is the only party determined to bring people together. Only a vote for Labour will deliver a public vote on Brexit. Only a Labour government will put the power back into the hands of the people. Let’s stop a no-deal Brexit – and let the people decide.”Corbyn’s decision to set out his stall in favour of negotiating a Brexit deal and then putting that to a referendum presents a challenge to conference delegates over whether to back his stance or a more pro-remain position if it comes to a vote.An effort to change Labour’s Brexit position will start on Saturday in Brighton, where delegates will discuss 80 motions submitted by local parties in favour of campaigning to remain in a second referendum.After a process called “compositing”, one or two motions will emerge to be voted on by the wider conference later in the week. This may end up as a battle between largely remain-supporting activists and trade unions who favour Corbyn’s position, unless the two sides can agree on a compromise motion that avoids a public row.A majority of the Brexit motions submitted have been put forward either by Another Europe is Possible (AEP) or two other groups, Labour for a Socialist Europe and Open Labour.Last week, Watson, the party’s deputy leader, used a speech to argue that Labour should “unambiguously and unequivocally back remain” and also seek a second Brexit referendum before a general election. The idea was swiftly rejected by Corbyn, who called it “Tom’s view”.In his article, Corbyn promised that he would back a general election as soon as Boris Johnson’s threat of a no deal Brexit is avoided through an extension to article 50.The issue of Brexit is likely to dominate Labour’s conference in Brighton but there will also be debate over the campaign pushing for the party to adopt a “Green New Deal”, involving a zero carbon target by 2030 and more green jobs.Separately, the party’s national executive committee met on Tuesday to agree rule changes to speed up expulsions from Labour in serious cases of wrongdoing, which will be put to a vote at conference.Jon Lansman, the founder of Momentum and a key Corbyn ally, won the NEC’s backing to effectively abolish its 40-year-old student wing, which is dominated by the more centrist side of the party. The motion said Labour Students was not officially affiliated and should be replaced, claiming it had not paid its fees. This was disputed by Rania Ramli, its chair. The NEC also agreed to consider ways to speed up selections for parliamentary candidates in key seats. Some MPs believe this will lead to candidates being parachuted in from the centre rather than letting local parties decide in all circumstances, although proposals have not yet been worked up by party officials."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1db1b2095dfe4a1443fe8041e242fbe42b37820/422_0_2825_1695/master/2825.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b2473d2f0d4f38de9fba82a8ee71f4e","title":"labour purges its student wing ahead of party conference","story":"Momentum founder and Corbyn ally Jon Lansman wins NEC backing to effectively abolish Labour StudentsThe founder of Momentum, a key ally of Jeremy Corbyn, has succeeded in a bid to make the party effectively abolish its 40-year-old student wing, which is dominated by the more centrist side of the party.Jon Lansman won the backing of Labour’s ruling national executive committee (NEC) for a motion that argued Labour Students was not officially affiliated and should be replaced.The motion said Labour Students had not paid affiliation fees but this was disputed by Rania Ramli, its chair, who wrote to Jennie Formby, the party’s general secretary, setting out its case. Labour Students could now look at a legal challenge on the grounds it has been excluded on the basis of inaccurate information.The move against Labour Students was condemned by a number of MPs as counterproductive at a time when the party should be focusing on preparing for an election rather than internal rows.Several accused the NEC of targeting Labour Students because it has links with MPs on the more centrist side of the party and is not associated with Corbyn’s politics.Wes Streeting, a Labour MP and former president of the National Union of Students as a Labour Students candidate, said: “The Labour party should be focusing all its energies on winning the next general election, not Jon Lansman’s factional vendettas against Labour Students. It is literally student politicking, when we’re in the fight our lives for the future of the country.”Stella Creasy, another Labour MP, added: “Why at such a critical time in our country, and with an election on the horizon, does anyone who wants Labour to be an effective force for good think this is the time for such attempts to silence parts of our youth movement ,when we need them to be seen and heard campaigning?”The motion put to the NEC said that the “organisation which currently describes itself as ‘Labour Students’ claims to be an organisation affiliated to the Labour party” but in fact did not meet all the terms required for affiliation. “The NEC therefore asks general secretary to urgently devise a plan to establish a Labour Students organisation which does meet its obligations,” it said.The motion passed after a lengthy meeting of the NEC before next week’s party conference in Brighton.A Labour party source said: “The NEC has asked staff to draw up proposals for a reformed student organisation that complies with the rules and represents the tens of thousands of students in our party.”Labour Students reacted to the motion with dismay, saying it was based on “false and inaccurate claims which we have not had the opportunity to address”.A Momentum source said: “It’s a victory for democracy that the rotten borough of Labour Students has finally been reformed. There are 30,000 students in the party and Labour students had just 507 students take part in their last election. It’s always been a bunker for a tiny clique who don’t care about building a broad student movement in Labour, and it’s right that the NEC have decided to overhaul it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72b8672bf57d2310fd761ffbb8f388fa6562e0a3/305_450_4845_2907/master/4845.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9423e84a24155cbb40bcbfd88758a589","title":"polish ambassador urges poles to seriously consider leaving uk","story":"Poland’s ambassador to the UK has written to 800,000 Poles advising them to “seriously consider” returning home, and expressed concern about the application process for getting settled status in the UK after Brexit.Arkady Rzegocki said that while the process was straightforward, he was concerned. “Forty-two percent of EU citizens who have applied to achieve settled status have had problems. Many have received pre-settled status,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday.He said many Polish people did not realise they had to register as they had lived here for many years. “Even if they have resident status, they still have to register,” he said.“There are quite a lot of problems with people trying to receive settled status. People who have been here five or 10 years have also had problems.”The Polish ambassador had earlier written to his compatriots encouraging them to “seriously consider the possibility of returning to their homeland” post-Brexit. Rzegocki, who has represented Warsaw in the UK since 2016, said Poland “regrets” Britain’s departure from the bloc, scheduled for 31 October.He said: “I also encourage you to seriously consider the possibility of returning to your homeland. The rapidly growing economy of our country creates more and more opportunities for citizens for development and good living conditions in the country.“Soon, Great Britain, which has been home to thousands of Poles for generations, will most likely cease to be a member of the European Union – which we regret, but we also see this process as an opportunity to strengthen the bond between our two countries.”Rzegocki told the Today programme: “Poland and the Polish economy is growing, life standards are improving – they are much different compared with five to 10 years ago. I think it is a very good opportunity to come back to Poland. I think you can achieve your goals in both Britain and Poland.” He said that while there was still time to apply to the settled status scheme, he expected those who wanted to would have already done so, adding: “On one hand there is still a lot of time to apply, on the other hand because of Brexit it is better to achieve settled status soon.”When asked how many Poles may choose to return home, Rzegocki said: “It is difficult to predict. Last year, 116,000 left the country. There are still about a million here but you can see there is a discussion being had. We are doing the best to keep our relationship as close as possible as there is a long friendship between our countries.”A Home Office spokesperson said the EU settlement scheme was performing well and that it was processing up to 20,000 applications a day. “Nobody applying to the EU settlement scheme has been granted pre-settled status without first being offered the opportunity to submit evidence that they qualify for settled status.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ecf768006b6e2e1e24c6517bdd392a5a3366e54/0_92_2800_1680/master/2800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1c721606278418887f06c59b404692a","title":"rugby world cup all blacks cover up tattoos japan culture yakuza","story":"With body ink associated with yakuza gangsters, New Zealand’s Rugby World Cup stars are happy to hide their artwork The All Blacks are gamely braving Japan’s humidity and covering up their considerable collection of tattoos as they prepare for their defence of the Rugby World Cup at the weekend.The All Blacks, who have a huge following in Japan, are covering up so as not to fall foul of local cultural sensitivities about public displays of body ink.Despite the growing popularity of fashion tattoos in Japan, many people associate them with membership of the yakuza – the country’s network of crime syndicates.The players have been covering up in onsen hot springs, hotel lobbies and other places where they are likely to encounter the public.Smith said he and his teammates were happy to conceal their tattoos to avoid causing offence. “And that’s OK. We are in Japan, you have to embrace their way, their culture. And most people with tattoos were happy to cover up,” the New Zealand Herald quoted him as saying.Samoa’s players too, have said they will hide their tattoos with skin suits when they are not playing.“There’s a lot of similarities in our cultures but when it comes to the tattoos we have obviously got a lot of tattoos, it’s quite normal in our culture,” the Samoan captain, Jack Lam, told the Herald.“But we are respectful and mindful to what the Japanese way is. We will be making sure that what we are showing will be OK.”Tattoos are commonplace in New Zealand, especially amongst the country’s Māori and Pacific Islands communities. Many All Blacks players have traditional inkings, known in Māori as Tā moko.The ban on displaying tattoos ranks alongside beer shortages as two potential sources of embarrassment at the tournament, which opens on Friday when Japan play Russia at Tokyo Stadium.But many onsen and other facilities that usually frown on tattoos have indicated they will take a more relaxed approach, as Japan prepares for the arrival of an estimated 400,000 overseas rugby fans.Tourism officials near Sapporo, which will host England v Tonga on Saturday, said they would leave inidual onsen owners to decide whether to admit tattooed bathers.Oita prefecture, a region of south-west Japan famed for its hot springs, published English-language guidelines on onsen etiquette and an online map of dozens of facilities in the onsen towns of Beppu and Yufuin that will accept tattooed bathers during the six-week tournament.Last September, World Rugby warned players and supporters to keep their tattoos covered when visiting gyms and pools to avoid causing offence. The guidelines will not apply to players during games, however.The hotel near Tokyo where the All Blacks are staying at while they prepare for their opening match against South Africa in Yokohama on Saturday is happy for the players to show off tattoos on their arms and legs.“It was only this hotel (that) don’t mind,” Smith said, according to Stuff.co.nz. “Every hotel we go to, we get a little message around that.”The players have also had to adapt to the Japanese custom of not wearing shoes inside homes and some other buildings.“The only other thing that is similar around the hotel is shoes,” Smith said. “The gym we go to today, we have got to take indoor shoes. The ones you walk to the gym in, you can’t wear in the gym.“We just have to respect that and adapt as All Blacks. We are grateful to be here and we don’t want to act anything bigger than we are.”Additional reporting by Angela Cuming"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7483386bec1b115db76ac28d6410d8e4ac4e090b/217_0_2489_1495/master/2489.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=607154a2ef056756aef109615ec07533","title":"talking horses solving the mystery of the disappearing guineas one two","story":"King Of Change returns to the track, 137 days after finishing runner-up in the Guineas, but where is Magna Grecia?One of many great things about the 2,000 Guineas is that it identifies the most classy young milers so we can have fun following them through the summer, right? But not this year! Neither Magna Grecia nor King Of Change, who finished first and second in the Newmarket Classic, have been seen since May.Now, 137 days after the Guineas, King Of Change will return to the track at Sandown this afternoon and we’ll get some idea as to whether his effort at 66-1 last time was a fluke or not. But the mystery of Magna Grecia remains unsolved, as Aidan O’Brien’s colt has not run since he was a disappointing fifth in the Irish Guineas on 25 May.It was soon reported that he had pulled a hamstring in that race but it wasn’t supposed to be the end of his year, or, let’s hope, his career. “It’s just taking its time,” the trainer said in June. “It can be slow sometimes. It either responds very quickly or it takes its time, these hamstrings.”In July, it was reported that he was back in training with the Juddmonte International as his “first option” and the Irish Champion Stakes as a backup option. Both of those races have, of course, whistled past us.More recently, O’Brien has mentioned returning to a mile for the QEII at Ascot on Champions Day if the colt wasn’t ready in time for the Irish Champion. If you expect Magna Grecia to make a triumphant return on 19 October, those generous bookies will let you have 14-1.It reminds me a bit of Gleneagles, who was on fire at the start of 2015, won both the Guineas and the St James’s Palace Stakes, but then went missing and was a ground-related withdrawal at York in August and Leopardstown in September before flopping in the QEII and at the Breeders’ Cup.Magna Grecia has already secured his place at stud, of course, and we all understand that O’Brien has a responsibility to the owners not to run him in circumstances where he can only dent his reputation. But the QEII has an open look, especially if O’Brien finds a different target for Circus Maximus. Let’s hope it’s not over yet for the first Classic winner of the season.There remains the suspicion that Magna Grecia and King Of Change were assisted by the way the Guineas panned out, either by racing on a fast strip of ground up the near rail or by tracking the strong pace set by Shine So Bright. Skardu, the Guineas third, has done little for the form, finishing fourth in all three runs since.So I’m inclined to oppose King Of Change as he steps down in class for the Listed race at Sandown, for all the encouraging noises supplied by Richard Hannon. “He had a hard race in the Guineas, so we gave him a nice break,” the trainer says in the Racing Post. “He looks a million dollars.”But the betting market prefers Turgenev (3.25) and that looks right to me. You might remember him shooting three lengths clear of 27 rivals at Royal Ascot when Frankie Dettori was trying to go through the card and possibly got a bit too trigger happy. He folded up in the final furlong that day but cheekpieces helped him go close in the Celebration Mile (Skardu a length behind) under Rab Havlin last time.Dettori returns to the saddle and, with the ground still quick, this looks a good opportunity for the Italian to atone for going too soon in June. They’re available at 7-4.Gosden and Dettori could be in for a good day, as Byzantine Empire (2.20) appeals at 9-4 in an earlier novice race. By Golden Horn, he’s a half-brother to a Gosden-trained Chesham winner and should come on a lot for his debut second, when he blew the start. I’d rather have him than the current favourite, Heaven Forfend, who hasn’t been seen since running sixth in this year’s Chesham.Later, I like the look of a William Jarvis handicap debutant in Lady Bowthorpe (4.00). She’s nicely bred and might be able to do a lot better than when making all in her Lingfield novice last time. This step up to a mile ought to help. She’s 5-1.Pick of the card at Yarmouth might be the 7-2 shot Khuzaam (3.45), carrying the second Hamdan colours. Montatham, carrying the first colours, comes from the William Haggas yard that has gone a bit quiet lately."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0684b91f7810496c465f661c3a702441d27320ea/0_0_500_300/master/500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4025e550058dc6aba6faebd4f4cbbcf","title":"rugby world cup 2019 uruguay team guide","story":"Uruguay’s improvement has been dramatic over the last four years, with many of their players turning proUruguay’s improvement has been dramatic over the last four years, with many of their players turning proIn the four years since the Rugby World Cup was last held in England, Uruguay has undergone the most dramatic transformation in its history and will be pitching up in Japan better prepared than ever before. In 2015, the country had the romantic distinction of being the only amateur team in the tournament, boasting as it did a mere four professional players. Since then, however, Los Teros have embarked on an accelerated professionalisation process and now have 18 professionals. The key to all this growth has been the Charrúa Stadium’s High Performance Centre – a project funded partly by World Rugby, the Uruguayan Rugby Union (URU), the Uruguayan government and private companies – which has been hailed by World Rugby as a model for other Tier 2 countries. Although the centre started its work in 2013, it wasn’t until 2016 that it helped produce an explosion in quality for Uruguay’s senior and youth teams. That work paid off with fast-track qualification after Uruguay beat Canada in the play-off between South and North America in February 2018. In doing so, they managed to avoid the winding repechage route through which they had qualified in 1999 and 2015 but which has also seen the team eliminated in 2007 and 2011. Early qualifying also allowed 15 players to sign their first centralised contracts with the Union. This year, 11 of them headed off to Major League Rugby, the new US professional league. The past four years have also seen Los Teros change the way they play. The defensive mentality evident in the 2015 side under coach Pablo Lemoine was swapped out following the arrival of the Argentinian Estéban Meneses, who came recommended by the former Pumas coach Daniel Hourcade. That was no coincidence: Argentina have helped Uruguay a lot over recent years. But while it has been a dramatic period of growth, that’s no guarantee of results in itself. Compared with the professional level of some of the sides they will face – Wales or Australia – Uruguay are still a fledgling in international terms, as indeed they still are when it comes to the Tier 2 countries in their pool, Fiji and Georgia. Does professionalism help? Yes. But it won’t mask the 20 years many players spent as amateurs. The most obvious absence will be that of Rodrigo Capó Ortega, a Top 14 star at Castres, who underwent surgery for a herniated disc in May and has opted to focus on his recovery at his club. Also missing will be the former Munster prop Mario Sagario, who returned to Uruguay to resume his university studies after playing in Ireland and who has now got an office job. He had planned to stay with Los Teros but the demands of training led him to pull out of the team. But putting aside these absences, Los Teros have a lot of talent, like the fly-half Felipe Berchesi (Dax), Agustín Ormaechea (Stade Montois), Manuel Leindekar (Oyonnax), and Andrés Vilaseca (Austin Elite). Los Teros are focusing on the first two matches, against Fiji and Georgia, and are convinced that all the hard work they’ve put in will allow them to surprise their first two opponents and do themselves justice when it comes to facing Wales and Australia. But as well as not arriving as favourites, the big disadvantage will be the very narrow gap between their first and second matches – barely four days. To make up for it, Meneses has gone with a squad that contains eight front row players among the 18 forwards, and 13 backs. One or two victories may look tricky to pull off, but in the past three years, Los Teros have beaten the USA at home for the first time (2019), triumphed over Romania (2018), beaten Canada four times in a row and seen off Namibia at home (2017). All that gives them the right to dream of what could be. • Ignacio Chans is a journalist for El Observador"},{"url":null,"title":"best dance 21st century","story":"Ferocious flamenco, bittersweet ballet and a harrowing masterpiece are among our pick of the best new dance productions since 2000Alexei Ratmansky is a choreographer in thrall to classical ballet, but he reflects imaginatively on the form and on his own Russian heritage. His Shostakovich Trilogy dances in tandem with a composer for whom Ratmansky feels deep affinity and it’s a consummate achievement, packing in emotive biography, arch humour, audacious virtuosity, claustrophobic fear and stirring displays of power and unity. The moods shift as frequently as the attitudes of the Soviet censors who dogged Shostakovich’s career. A fitting tribute to a great composer. LW Read the interviewMatthew Bourne will forever be identified with his clever reworkings of blockbuster ballets (Swan Lake, Cinderella, Nutcracker), but the real gem of the last two decades is a piece that’s far from the land of fairytales. Set in swinging 60s London, Play Without Words is based loosely on Joseph Losey’s 1963 film The Servant, and it’s a tightly choreographed, seductive piece of dance-theatre, playing with power dynamics and choreographic structure to slick, sizzling effect. LW Read the reviewMade for historic churches, Shobana Jeyasingh’s TooMortal places the audience at the altar, six female dancers half hidden in the pews, and fills the nave with dissonant chimes, tenebrous voices and murky light. The action is spare, but its images loom large: pews as cradles or coffins, the aisle as abyss, elementally evoking the tribulations, desolations and consolations of life’s journey. This is a small, seemingly simple work that holds big ideas. SR Read the reviewThe minimalist composer Steve Reich has been a longtime muse for Belgian choreographer Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker, and she immersed herself in his Music for 18 Musicians to make this shimmering dance. De Keersmaeker’s choreography is meticulously precise but the result looks like joyful, carefree abandon, the dancers bounding and skipping in a winding, looping skein of movement. A hugely sophisticated work that bathes the audience in a dreamlike glow. LW Read the reviewAs with all of Mark Morris’s best work, V does more than take inspiration from its accompanying score it allows you to see, feel and hear the genius of Schumann’s Piano Quintet in E flat major with a piercing clarity. From its passages of brightly crafted invention – floated on music of rapt and tender lyricism – to the stark, even abject melancholy of its darker sections, this is pure dance at its most emotionally and physically distilled. JM Read the reviewA formative figure of British dance, Siobhan Davies has for many years eschewed the stage as a platform for creation perhaps, after Bird Song, she could go no further in this direction. Meshing astonishingly fine detail within a sweeping compositional frame – a kind of choreographic vortex that spirals into, then out of, a hushed central solo – the work feels cosmic in reach and intimate in effect, like a galaxy with the song of a bird at its centre. SR Read the reviewLin Hwai-min’s final work for Cloud Gate Dance Theatre, the company he founded in 1973, shows both the sure hand of long experience and an imagination still fresh and full of wonder. A tribute to Lin’s native Taiwan that deftly weaves choreography, scenography, voiceover and typography, its nine numinously poetic scenes are as distilled, elegant and dense with imagery as the Chinese script itself, whether Lin is contemplating an egret, a war, city life or the sea. SR Read the reviewLondon-born Akram Khan is one of the most captivating dancers of his generation, his childhood training in the Indian classical dance form kathak underpinning explorations in contemporary dance and performance. Following powerful pure dance works and experiments with text, Desh is the solo that most successfully synthesised Khan’s mix of awe-inspiring physicality and funny, searching monologue, as Khan journeys into his Bangladeshi heritage with Tim Yip’s designs creating a magical visual feast. LW Read the reviewFlamenco firecracker Rocío Molina makes actual sparks fly with her ferocious feet (and some clever props). A dancer capable of immense grace but also beautiful spikiness, awkward angles and compelling physical contrariness, Molina produces work that blazes with feminism, even when she doesn’t overtly state it. Bosque Ardora casts her as a creature of the woods, both hunter and hunted in a capricious game with the men on stage. It’s an audacious, inventive, blistering piece. LW Read the reviewAfter two decades in New York’s underground scene, Pam Tanowitz seemingly conquered the dance world with a single work. In the first authorised dance version of TS Eliot’s Four Quartets, Tanowitz’s movement gets inside Eliot’s musings on time in the strong internal rhythms of its richly textured choreography. As well as a real clarity of line and voice, it has beautiful craft and is always unpredictable, as fascinating threads of movement unspool, taking the viewer in unexpected directions. LW Read the reviewAn inspired fantasia on Milton’s Paradise Lost by the writer, performer and choreographer Ben Duke. In this witty but profound solo show, Duke uses a mix of text, movement and bewildered charm to tackle the labours and horrors of creation, playing wild and free with the source text. The genius comes in drawing parallels between God’s task and Duke’s own more commonplace, but no less mind blowing, act of creation: parenthood. Duke’s follow-up, riffing on Romeo and Juliet, is just as accomplished. LW Read the reviewCommunity dance often has a celebratory or affirmative remit, but East Wall – a collaboration between choreographer Hofesh Shechter and East London Dance, staged in front of a postcard-perfect Tower of London – feels more like sticking your finger in a socket and being jolted by the vitality and violence of a place and its people. Krump vies with gospel and Bowie, a band of Beefeaters march over a civilian, clowns caper with executioners and hallowed heritage clashes with messy, multiracial histories. Scrappy it may be, but oh – the force, the life. SR Read the reviewUnderstandably, Maguy Marin’s Umwelt always induces walkouts. Nine mirrored panels rotate slowly, for an hour. Nine performers emerge at each turn to execute an action – all deadpan, whether it’s mopping the floor, pointing a gun or chucking out a baby doll. There’s a pervasive noise, as blank as the wind. A rope winches across the stage, at paint-drying pace. The entire process remains indifferent to our thoughts, feelings, wishes or indeed presence. Painful to watch, yes, but there it is: an unblinking glimpse into the void at the core of our existence. SR Read the reviewWayne McGregor’s three-act work for the Royal Ballet makes characteristically brilliant mayhem with the conventions of narrative dance. Inspired by the life and writings of Virginia Woolf, it ranges in style and content from the inner emotional dramas of Mrs Dalloway to the time-bending fantasy of Orlando and the limpid reflections on mortality in The Waves. With a lavishly atmospheric score from Max Richter, mind-altering lighting by Lucy Carter, and a deeply affecting central performance from Alessandra Ferri, Woolf Works takes McGregor to a freer choreographic space than he’d seemingly inhabited before. JM Read the reviewFrench provocateur Jérôme Bel illuminates the life of ballet’s worker bees, the corps de ballet, in a solo for Paris Opera Ballet’s Véronique Doisneau (later released as a film). Forty-one and nearing retirement, Doisneau stands centre stage and talks of her career, the parts she danced, and most poignantly the ones she didn’t – she floats through a scene from Giselle, humming the music to herself, haunting the role. It’s a bittersweet story of almost, but not quite, achieving one’s dream. LW Read more about BelWhen it comes to hushed, hypnotic beauty, Russell Maliphant has created a few contenders for this list (notably 2009’s AfterLight, his solo for Daniel Proietto). However, Push is not only an exceptional piece of dance, but a reinvention for legendary ballerina Sylvie Guillem, shifting her career from classical to contemporary. In shadows and spotlights, with Maliphant’s Zen-like martial arts-inspired choreography, the pair build an equal partnership of tension, fluidity and deep trust a masterclass in understated intensity. LW Read the reviewIt’s hard to think of another performance where dance, design and location coincided to such serendipitously beautiful effect. Framed by the cosmic sorcery of Olafur Eliasson’s Weather Project, the dancers from Cunningham’s company took possession of the vast Turbine Hall, sometimes moving so close to those of us watching that we felt the whiplash passing of their bodies, sometimes receding into the outer edges of hall, silhouetted against the giant glowing radiance of Eliasson’s sun. Both intensely intimate and spectacularly awesome – it feels as though the universe were dancing around us. JM Read the reviewIn this funny, charismatic and profoundly humane collaboration between Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui and the monks from Shaolin Temple, there is not a whiff of fake “exoticism” or cultural appropriation. Cherkaoui’s choreography revels in the maniacal danger and beauty of the monks’ kung fu heritage – shamelessly displaying their shadow-boxing, backflips and flying kicks – but it also explores the spiritual and social heart of the Shaolin’s monastic world. A journey of joyous exchange for Cherkaoui as well for as his audience. JM Read the reviewRarely does dance address specific social issues with the imagination and sophistication of Michael Keegan-Dolan’s Loch Na hEala, unpicking Swan Lake’s simplistic view of good and evil via a story of sexual abuse in the Catholic church. There’s always been a bristling undercurrent of scorn in the Irish choreographer’s work, but the power of this piece is the marriage of blunt detail and disgust with moments of mythical transcendence, all swirled together like the mist on a lake. LW Read the reviewOne of the most thrilling dance stories of the new century has been the rise and rise of Crystal Pite. With a steadfast belief in her own choreographic principles, Pite has created true and startling works for both classical and contemporary companies. Her language has taken flight in epic compositions of abstract dance but, as in her harrowing masterpiece Betroffenheit, it has also plumbed depths of human experience. Created in collaboration with actor and writer Jonathon Young, this 2015 work explores the hellhole of grief into which Young was plunged by the accidental deaths of his daughter, nephew and niece. The pain, humiliation and sheer ugliness of that experience is given searing physical embodiment in Pite’s choreography but so too is the slow process of recovery and redemption. As raw and unflinching as Betroffenheit is, however, you come away from it with a wild feeling of exhilaration – uplifted by its courage, its coruscating beauty and by the faith it affirms in the power of art to address emotions that lie beyond reason or words.

This is a starry but insipid revival of the 1996 wish-fulfilment musical, based on the hit 80s body-swap movie that mis-sold a generation the idea that growing up meant turning into Tom Hanks. For all its additional dance breaks, this soulless show feels both flatter and more uptight than its source material.Jay McGuiness (formerly of the Wanted, perhaps best known for that jive on Strictly) brings a wide-eyed wonder to the role of Josh Baskin, a child who feels invisibile until he is granted his wish to be big. Gawky in his new body, he quickly falls into fortune when the boss of a toy company (a growling Matthew Kelly) is drawn to his refreshingly playful attitude. Job sorted, he soon finds love with Girls Aloud’s Kimberley Walsh as Susan Lawrence, a workaholic who long ago suffocated her inner child.Josh’s firecracker best friend Billy (Joe Hart) is a scene-stealer. McGuiness and Walsh are a neat pairing with panto-style chemistry, but the songs by David Shire and Richard Maltby Jr hardly bounce out of the theatre, and it’s a shame Walsh’s lines rarely take her away from the topic of men. It isn’t always useful to unpick the problematic plotlines of revivals, but surely shows should justify their place on stage, regardless of age. And while this romcom attempts to wash over the murky sexual politics with a jokey aside, it feels naive not to grapple with the fact that it is the story of a 13-year-old boy in a sexual relationship with a thirtysomething woman the adult body does not cancel out the child’s mind.Doing much of the aesthetic heavy-lifting, a huge rotating screen feels closer to cheating than innovation. Around it, the stage is lined with the New York skyline arranged like broken piano keys, a nod to the famous floor-piano scene in which Josh and his boss play Heart and Soul. Even this scene is dampened, with a prerecorded lit-up keyboard and some out-of-time leaping ridding the scene of thrill and risk. As Josh says in his toy department’s product analysis meetings: what’s fun about that?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b721c9c0dd08dea4cc2e04192d90b7cf0054f23a/501_456_3926_2356/master/3926.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ae92c762c76a093c18c21bd32258483","title":"fairphone 3 review ethical phone","story":"Dutch firm asks £200 above the norm for a smartphone that might help change the industryWhat if you could buy a phone that will last five years, can be easily repaired and is made as ethically as possible? That’s the aim of the latest Fairphone 3 – and on many counts it succeeds.Ethically creating a phone is a lot harder than it may sound, but you have to start somewhere. Amsterdam-based Fairphone turned from an awareness campaign about conflict minerals into a phone company in 2013, and aims to source as many materials as possible in both human and environmentally kind ways.Now in its third iteration, the £420 Fairphone 3 is making progress, not only in responsible sourcing of materials, but in manufacturing and longevity, with a modular, repairable design. It even comes with its own screwdriver.There’s no two ways about it: the Fairphone 3 has a dated design. Big chunks of body at the top and bottom of the screen are reminiscent of smartphones from five years ago. The LCD display is fairly small by today’s standards at 5.7in, but is reasonable with pretty good colours and excellent viewing angles, and is just about bright enough – most of the time you’ll see the brightness cranked up to maximum. It’s covered by Gorilla Glass 5, which isn’t the latest, but at least should make it fairly scratch-resistant.The rest of the body is utilitarian and boxy. At almost 1cm thick, the Fairphone 3 is certainly a chunky beast. The big chin and forehead, as well as fairly thick bezels each side of the screen, make the phone a lot larger than its small screen dimensions might suggest too. It’s closer in size to a phone with a screen over 6.4in, and so requires similar hand-stretching to use it.The translucent black plastic body feels well made and hard-wearing. Being able to see the usually hidden components through the plastic makes it all the more interesting. There’s very little flex or give anywhere on the phone, which is all the more impressive give you can take the back off and remove modules.The volume buttons and power button are all on the left side of the phone, which took some getting used to. The speaker, too, is mounted in the left side of the phone, which means you’re more likely to block it with an errant finger.Through the back of the phone you can see the phrase “Change is in your hands” written on the battery, which is a little bit self-congratulatory for my tastes.A USB-C socket in the bottom handles charging, while there is a (now rare) headphone socket in the top. There’s also a fingerprint scanner on the back, which works fairly well but is a bit high up the back to be easily reachable without moving the phone down your hand a little each time you need to touch it.The Fairphone 3 won’t win any prizes for performance. It has Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 632 chip from last year, which is a lower-performance mid-range processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, plus a microSD card slot for adding more.General performance isn’t terrible, but it certainly isn’t fast, even compared with mid-range smartphones costing less. There are elements of lag and stutter all over the system. You quickly run into slowdown when simply trying to find your way to a meeting, as launching the calendar app to find an address, then Google Maps and Citymapper to compare directions was enough to repeatedly introduce significant lag. Press a button and nothing happens long enough to make you question whether you managed to actually activate the button.Battery life is equally middle of the road at about 26 hours between charges, meaning it lasts from 7am on day one until 9am on day two. That is while using the Fairphone 3 as my primary device with a total screen time of just over four hours, lots of email and messages, browsing in Chrome, four hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones, 40 minutes of offline Amazon Prime Video and a few photos.The Fairphone 3 doesn’t ship with a charger or cable. It charges in about 2 hours 10 minutes using a standard 30W USB-C charger, or faster using one that supports Qualcomm’s QuickCharge 3 (€19.95 from Fairphone). But there’s also the possibility of just swapping in another charged battery, given you can remove it in less than five seconds.The Fairphone 3 ships with its own Fairphone OS, which is a standard version of Android, free of bloat or duplicated apps and all the better for it. The only minor disappointment is that it ships on Android 9, not the new Android 10, although Fairphone aims to provide security and software updates for five years from release.Anyone who has used Android in the last five years will be familiar with it, while switching to it from an iPhone is fairly straightforward. It’s clear that Fairphone needs to do a better job at optimising the performance of the software, however, as the issues of lag are likely to be avoidable with a bit of work.The Fairphone 3 has a fairly standard 12-megapixel camera on the back, which is technically the same as that fitted to Google’s Pixel 3a, but doesn’t come anywhere close, lacking the software magic that makes Google’s camera so good.In good lighting the Fairphone 3 shoots reasonable pictures with a solid amount of detail and colour. The same goes for selfies and portraits. Unfortunately that’s not the case in middling to low light conditions. Shots taken indoors at night with a mixture of overhead and lamp lighting produced dark, grainy and indistinct images.Overall, the Fairphone 3’s camera performance is similar to today’s budget phones: fine on a sunny day, but poor indoors.Other than efforts from the company to source materials ethically, and to pay the factory workers who put together the phone a top-up to a living wage, the most exciting thing about the Fairphone 3 is its modular nature. It’s not some Google Ara reinvention of the wheel, but rather the ability to take out and replace or repair parts when they go wrong.Starting from the removable back and battery, the rest of the phone can be pulled apart with standard screws. Fairphone even includes the correct screwdriver in the box. If a part breaks, buy a replacement module, screw it in place and away you go. That’s the idea, anyway, and repair guide masters iFixit gave it a big thumbs up recently.The inidual parts aren’t that cheap, of course, but given you can place them yourself without breaking everything else in the process it seems like a fair trade-off. A replacement camera costs €49.95, the speaker €19.95, the bottom module with the USB-C socket in it costs €19.95 and the top module with the selfie camera, headphone socket and other bits costs €29.95. Probably more widely used parts are the screen for €89.95, the battery for €29.95 or the back cover for €24.95.The Fairphone 3 is a device full of compromises with one massive advantage: being ethical.The design is a bit more interesting thanks to its translucent finish, but it’s chunky and dated-looking. The 5.7in screen is pretty good, but the big chin and bezels make the phone considerably larger and harder to use than it could be. It has USB-C and a headphone socket, both of which are welcome, but the odd speaker placement makes it easy to block.The inside is the same. The clean, bloat-free Android software is good, but it’s only Android 9 not the new Android 10, and it has performance issues. Dual-sim and microSD card support is great too, but Bluetooth performance was pretty poor.If you were to look at the Fairphone 3 simply as a £420 smartphone, you’d say it costs about £200 too much and isn’t even a great £220 phone at that. You can buy a phone with more modern design, similar specifications, performance and software for around £220 such as the Motorola Moto G7, or phones that are infinitely better at £420.But the Fairphone 3 isn’t just another smartphone: it’s an entirely different way of thinking about how a phone and its creation fits into the world.You can genuinely repair this phone yourself with modular components you simply unscrew and replace. If the battery is worn out, swap it out for a new one in less than 10 seconds. The Fairphone 3 is arguably the most sustainable phone you can buy, and that’s without even looking at the firm’s efforts to source all materials and manufacture the phone in as ethical manner as possible.But I worry that a phone that has performance issues now won’t be serviceable in five years, and so all the reparability in the world won’t make it a device people still want to use in 2024. If buyers use the Fairphone 3 for two years, then dump it for a new one, that defeats the object of the exercise.Until now it’s not been possible to put a real price on the ethical side of a smartphone in the same way you can with a Fairtrade chocolate bar. Thanks to the Fairphone 3, we now know it’s about £200. So the question is whether people are prepared to pay £200 extra to support a worthy movement. I hope they are.Pros: ethical manufacturing, sustainable materials, truly repairable, solidly built, dual-sim, microSD card slot, headphones socket, removable battery, bloat-free, software support for five yearsCons: only Android 9, middling performance, chunky, expensive for the specs, average camera, poor Bluetooth This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Not to mention the fact that it’s been an extremely successful export.Combining the best of Deadwood, Black Mirror and Star Trek, Firefly, as well as being the greatest TV show of any era, may claim to be the greatest cultural artefact humanity has ever produced. Joss Whedon never wrote better, its stars never appeared in anything better, there never was anything better. Cowboys in space – how could anyone resist?‘This show was so good’: AllergicToTrollsI can remember critics singing the usual praises of this being “the best TV show ever” for a few years? Remember the hype around The Final Five? Everybody seemed to be on tenterhooks to find out who the disguised Cylons were. This show was so good.‘Rarely a dull moment’: sparky36I’d like to have seen the Spanish language La Casa de Papel (Money Heist) in the list. The series is a tense, intricately plotted drama that combines police procedural, melodrama and heist movie with rarely a dull moment in any episode without ever outfoxing its own logic. Its strength rests entirely in the attention the showrunner has given to establishing meaningful relationships between the criminals and the audience – for me, the charismatic Berlin steals the show with his sophisticated malevolence. The first two series are its likely high watermark, and it would be entirely deserving of a wider viewership in the English speaking world.‘Made a tough old broad like me cry’: grumpyoldgirlEven if only for Sean Bean’s spine-tinglingly superb acting, Broken was a brilliant serial. Each character was clearly defined and deeply human. It was impossible not to sympathise with the dilemmas of the working-class characters, and it made even a tough old broad like me cry, and the ending was deeply moving. This should have featured in this list, right at the top.‘Lots of gutwrenching moments’: MomentaryClarityIt started out looking as if it was a slight twist on The Equalizer but it quickly became apparent it was much, much more, exploring issues of free will, morality, ethics in politics, intelligence services and technology, political expediency, possible consequences of strong general AI etc. Brilliant performances from a very strong cast with lots of gutwrenching moments.‘It started it all’: tenientesnafuThough short-lived, it started it all. Rome defined all the hallmarks of a good contemporary TV show: high value production, elaborate settings, excellent cast, good story, top-notch writing and cinematography. It also created kind of a ‘default cast’ for high-quality TV shows: superb actors that are recognisable but never hijack their roles.‘It made me laugh very loudly’: FlightGuileAndPiesIt’s probably very unfashionable to say that Phoenix Nights is one of my favourite programmes of the last 20 years, but it made me laugh very loudly and was very gentle and loving and warm. Some of the humour was a bit unreconstructed, but it was a reflection on real working-class attitudes and life, albeit “dafted up”.‘Really impressive TV-budget animation’: VariousThingsSeriously. Yeah it’s, you know, for kids, but it stands up to anything on the list. It does so many things superbly well, such as: consistent, believable fantasy world-building with great attention to detail sympathetic villains with extremely effective long-term redemption arcs moments of really impressive TV-budget animation and great voice acting, from both the adults (Mako!) and the child actors. Also it has Toph Beifong, the best character in anything ever.‘Very funny but fearless’: JohnnybiLast Week Tonight with John Oliver really should go on any best 100 series – very funny but fearless and very informative, often about subjects that aren’t normally covered in depth by serious television news, such as one fascinating piece on how US immigration works in practice. It’s astonishing how much they cram into half an hour.‘Beautifully shot and superb performances’: RadioPartizanA brilliantly realised drama combining taut investigative thriller, edge-of-the-seat tension, desperate heroism and a powerful denunciation of a secretive, authoritarian society. All the more effective because of its commitment to the real-life events and its understated approach. Beautifully shot and superb performances too. Should be in anybody’s top 10.‘A gentle and warming exploration of mortality’: Gary Bowden, 55, Newcastle upon TyneA programme about fishing in some beautiful river locations across the UK, but really about the longstanding friendship of two ageing comedians who have had major life-saving surgery. A gentle and heartwarming exploration of mortality, friendship, empathy and humanity with added laughs, tears and Bob Mortimer’s “heart healthy” cookery."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1a8901212d628e84ab9516ff130f978966cc610/0_380_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5ae19d52526b19249c168e22d1a1704","title":"china auction pork reserves","story":"Release of food staple comes amid soaring prices and African swine flu epidemicChina will auction 10,000 tonnes of pork from its state reserves as surging prices threaten to mar an important political holiday.The sale on Thursday will be limited to 300 tonnes a bidder, according to the China Merchandise Reserve Management Centre.The announcement comes in the run-up to the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China on 1 October. The national celebrations will include a military parade and a week-long holiday during which pork will be a mainstay of family gatherings.China faces growing discontent over the food staple, exacerbated by an African swine flu epidemic that wiped out at least a third of the country’s pigs. Pork is an important product in China and national and local governments have maintained strategic reserves of it since the 1970s. The exact amount in the reserves is a state secret.Chinese officials have sought to reassure the public about pork supplies. The vice-premier, Hu Chunhua, said in August: “We should ensure pork supply by all means ... and strictly rein in market speculation, actively boost production of alternative meat products and increase frozen pork reserves,” according to the state news agency, Xinhua.Over the past year, China has been hit hard by African swine flu, a highly contagious disease that does not affect humans but is fatal to pigs. According to China’s official declared inventory, up to 100 million pigs have died as a result, said Adam Speck, a senior commodity analyst at IHS Markit’s Agribusiness Intelligence.Analysts say deploying the pork reserves will not be enough to lower prices, which are expected to continue rising in the run-up to Chinese new year in January.To shore up supplies, Beijing has called on local governments to reverse earlier policies of closing smaller pig farms. The Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, said in August quotas for pig production should be established and subsidies allocated to larger farmers.Officials have tried to quash negative debate on the topic, even humorous ones. The term “pork freedom”, which describes someone so wealthy they do not need to worry about the price of the meat, appears to be censored on the popular microblog Weibo.After Li’s speech, an article on the WeChat social media network that accused the government of toying with the livelihoods of farmers. generated more than 100,000 views and thousands of comments.One comment, which received more than 15,000 likes, said: “Today you forced the farmers to tear down their farms, then you change your mind and encourage people to raise more pigs. You criticised Donald Trump for being unreasonable. Why not spend some time to reflect on whether your policy is reasonable?”The epidemic is affecting global markets. “ASF in China is turning out to be the largest global event for animal protein,” Speck said. “The impacts are going to completely change the global trade in animal protein over the next 10 years, and those changes will be permanent.“China is home to half the world’s hogs. It is not an exporter of product – they consume half the world’s pork. When you have devastation like the devastation that ASF has released, you reduce the world’s supply. We don’t have enough globally to replace what China has lost.”Alistair Driver, the editor of the UK magazine Pig World, said: “China’s ASF crisis has already had a significant impact on global meat trade. The massive hole in pork production has resulted in large volumes of pork being exported to China from all over the world, led by Spain and Germany, and this has contributed to higher pork prices globally, although the impact has barely been felt in the UK.”In the past week, African swine fever has also been detected in the Philippines and South Korea. Vietnam has been dealing with a serious outbreak for several months.Additional reporting by Jiahui Huang"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c66d6989c0ad3c981fc1c47f5ec3815c0f09fa37/160_33_2044_1226/master/2044.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4ca2b68bcc07af35d6804c8c55d4bd9","title":"remove hook nose sign language gesture jewish group demands","story":"Calls for ‘racist and humiliating’ gesture to be removed from online guide to Flemish signingAn organisation representing Jewish communities in Europe are demanding the removal of a “racist and humiliating” depiction of Jews as having large hooked noses from an online dictionary of Flemish sign language.The portrayal is one of more than 10,000 signs on a visual online guide recognised by the Flemish government as a “knowledge and coordination centre” for sign language in the Flanders region of Belgium.The dictionary has been recently updated to indicate that the latter two signs have negative connotations but the University of Ghent, which hosts the Flemish sign language centre on its website, is facing calls for the signs’ removal.Menachem Margolin of the European Jewish Association said: “The one with the hair strands is acceptable, although misleading. The videos using a gesture of a big and crocheted nose to define a Jew are just racist and humiliating for Jews.”Lisa Rombouts, from the Flemish Sign Language Centre, said a new edition of the dictionary would be published that would “clarify these matters”.She told De Morgen newspaper: “The gesture in question is probably the oldest variant of that gesture in the dictionary. The video has been on our site for 15 years. We don’t want to delete that, because a dictionary describes the current situation.“Unfortunately, it has not been possible to completely renew the dictionary in recent years because we only received subsidies for that last year.”Last month, the sign language dictionary in New Zealand came under criticism for a series of portrayals of minority communities.Such representations were removed from signed television in the UK in 2004, a year after British sign language was adopted as one of the country’s indigenous languages."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4021573.1568757846!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"almost 3 000 leaving cert results upgraded in record year","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMost upgrades were awarded in higher-level subjects, including biology (392), followed by maths (325), Irish (256), English (245) and French (205). Photograph: Bryan O’BrienAlmost 3,000 Leaving Cert exam results have been upgraded after students successfully sought rechecks of their papers.The record number follows a surge in the number of rechecks this year, due mainly to reforms that have speeded up the appeals process and given students greater access to their exam papers online.In all, 17 per cent – or 2,916 of the 16,965 exam appeals – were upgraded. This is twice the number of last year’s appeals. Just two results were downgraded.It is likely that several hundred of these students will now secure higher preference college offers through the CAO system.This is likely to pose a headache for some third-level institutions, which will have to find additional places on courses that began earlier this month.University sources say the vast majority of these students will be accommodated, but concede there may be difficulties offering places in certain courses such as medicine.College applicants are being advised to contact inidual college registrars’ offices for further information.This year’s upgrades include 45 students who did not appeal their grades but were upgraded nonetheless following “quality assurance checks” during the appeals process.The bulk of these students - 26 - benefitted from a change in the marking scheme for the higher-level maths paper.This was due to a question that some candidates were found to have been unfairly penalised by a single mark.The issue was highlighted in the course of the appeals process and led to a recheck of all candidates where a single mark could have made a difference to their final grade.Upgrades breakdownMost upgrades were awarded in higher-level subjects, including biology (392),\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspmaths (325), Irish (256), English (245) and French (205).When upgrades are broken down by the percentages\u0026nbspof all exams sat in inidual subjects, they were most likely for Japanese (2.4 per cent of exams sat), followed by Spanish (1.9 per cent), agricultural science and maths (both 1.8 per cent) and biology (1.4 per cent).The State Examinations Commission has said that any candidates who are still unhappy may appeal their result to a panel of independent appeal scrutineers.These scrutineers review the entire processing of the appeal so as to provide assurance to the candidate that it has been correctly carried out.They also check that all issues raised by the candidate have been properly dealt with by the chief examiner, to whom the script will have been referred if there are any such outstanding issues."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4022281.1568799650!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"labour would put sensible brexit deal to voters in new referendum","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn is expected to come under increased pressure to explicitly back staying in the EU. Photograph: Ben StansallAFPGetty ImagesBritish Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has insisted his party would put a “sensible” Leave option to voters in a new Brexit referendum and abide by the result.The comments come ahead of Labour’s annual conference, where Mr Corbyn is expected to come under increased pressure to explicitly back staying in the EU.The Labour leader said that the party would negotiate a new Leave agreement with the EU if it wins the next general election and then put that to the popular vote along with a Remain option.Writing in , Mr Corbyn said: “A Labour government would secure a sensible deal based on the terms we have long advocated, including a new customs union with the EU a close single market relationship and guarantees of workers’ rights and environmental protections.“We would then put that to a public vote against remain, and I pledge to carry out whatever the people decide, as a Labour prime minister.“We are the only UK-wide party ready to put our trust in the people of Britain to make the decision.“(Boris) Johnson wants to crash out with no deal. That is something opposed by business, industry, the trade unions and most of the public — and even by the Vote Leave campaign’s co-convener, Michael Gove, who said earlier this year: ‘We didn’t vote to leave without a deal.‘“And now the Liberal Democrats want MPs to overturn the referendum result by revoking article 50 in a parliamentary stitch-up.“It is simply undemocratic to override the decision of a majority of the voters without going back to the people.”The comments appeared to signal that Mr Corbyn could adopt a neutral position in any future referendum if he became prime minister.A number of senior shadow cabinet figures, such as Emily Thornberry and John McDonnell, have said they would back Remain in a new referendum.Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson has gone further by calling for another national poll on Brexit before any general election is held.Conservative party chairman James Cleverly said: “Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party want to ignore the largest democratic vote in our country’s history and cancel the referendum result.“They had the chance to let the public decide how to resolve Brexit via a general election — but Jeremy Corbyn doesn’t trust the people.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Its kit can be found in just about every Airbus jet, for example.\u0026nbspMinisters have stopped asking if business deals are good for Britain\u0026nbspGambling adverts bannedThe advertising watchdog has banned two gambling ads which it said could encourage harmful behaviour.In a YouTube video advert, BetIndex described its football gambling product as “basically the football stock market, where you buy and sell shares in footballers with real money and you can win daily pay-outs which we call idends.One viewer complained to the Advertising Standards Authority, saying that the ad implied that the product was an investment opportunity and potentially a reliable source of income.A second advert for Coral has been banned for encouraging repetitive participation in gambling.The television promotion aired in June said: Free £5 bet every Sunday.

The promise has helped it win support from local residents in a region with one of the highest unemployment rates in the country.The project is already a vital source of jobs in the area, directly employing 1,200 people.A government spokesman said: “We cannot comment on commercially sensitive matters. All requests for financial support must meet necessary lending criteria. When examining any request for financing, we have to assess the potential of a project against the need to protect taxpayers’ money.”Sirius shares\u0026nbspslumped 64 per cent on Tuesday morning before recovering slightly.

The average monthly shortfall for these clients was £365.Unexpected life events were the biggest causes of problem debt.Those experiencing a reduction in income (18 per cent), injury or illness (16 per cent) or unemployment or redundancy (16 per cent) made up the bulk of new clients.StepChange said its figures “underline the growing number of households in the United Kingdom struggling to keep their heads above water, particularly when faced with a sudden change in personal circumstances”.Phil Andrew, chief executive of StepChange Debt Charity, said: “These statistics provide a sobering assessment of the scale of problem debt in this country.Surge in councils using bailiffs to chase debts“Across the board, we are seeing red flags, including worrying proportions of new clients falling into debt due to reduced income, illness or because they rely on credit to pay for day-to-day living expenses.“Clearly more and more households are struggling to hang on and are ill-equipped to deal with any economic shocks the future may hold.He said the figures “must act as a wake-up call to the Government”, with issues around bailiff behaviour and the five-week wait people have before they receive their first Universal Credit payments.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This proportion has risen by a third since 2014, when 18 per cent of new clients were single parents.Nine in 10 single parent clients were renters. Single parents were also particularly likely to have higher outgoings than incomes.StepChange said the rapid growth in single-parent clients suggests they are being squeezed by benefits payments and the rising cost of living.A Government spokeswoman said: “We are determined to help families improve their lives through work, while continuing to support them with the cost of living.“But we know some families need more support, which is why we spend more than £95 billion a year on working age benefits.“With Universal Credit, people can get paid urgently if they need it, and 700,000 families will get on average £285 more a month because the system is simpler.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

He added that the lower clothing prices may be due to unusually wet weather keeping shoppers away and prompting discounting by retailers.Slower inflation may be good for consumers in the short term but it also rings alarm bells for economists.\u0026nbsp“The falling inflation rate could be an early signal of a cooling economy, in line with what we have seen in the US and the euro area,” said\u0026nbspYael\u0026nbspSelfin, chief economist at\u0026nbspKPMG\u0026nbspUK.“Recent falls in the value of the pound and the spike in oil prices over the weekend should boost the headline rate in the coming months, with higher prices for fuel and for imported goods putting pressure on households’ purchasing power and business margins, and further curtailing demand.”Separate data from the ONS showed that average house prices increased by 0.7 per cent\u0026nbspin July compared with a year earlier, only half the rate in June and the weakest pace of growth since September 2012.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Rival taxi app Lyft, which floated in March, is about 40 per cent down.Beyond tech stocks, SmileDirectClub, which sells alternatives to orthodontic braces, managed to raise $1.35bn (£1bn) from investors before its shares plummeted 28 per cent in their first day’s trading last week.WeWork has been criticised in some quarters as an extreme example of hype over substance, having already racked up losses in excess of $3bn\u0026nbsp(£2.4bn) while spending freely on expansion. The firm leases offices on long-term contracts before renting them out on short-term contracts to companies and freelancers.That leaves it potentially vulnerable in a downturn when its customers seek to cut costs by ending their tenancy. Despite the simple business model, WeWork markets itself as a technology company that is changing the way people work and has attempted to value itself accordingly.Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, summed up a widely held view: “It would appear that WeWork has missed the boat when it comes to getting investors to buy into an idea that has yet to prove profitable.”With the company losing $2 for every $1 it makes, even a valuation as low as $15bn\u0026nbsp(£12bn) and $18bn (£14.4bn)\u0026nbsphasn’t been enough to whet investor appetite, particularly since a number of this year’s unicorns are now languishing below their IPO launch prices.“As Uber can attest, a popular business model doesn’t always translate into a realistic valuation and looking at WeWork’s numbers it is hard to make a case for the type of valuation being asked for now, let alone the one we saw at the beginning of the year.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Within that grouping, games, toys and hobbies fell 5 per cent between July and August 2019.\u0026nbspAir fares rose by more in 2019 than in 2018 but sea fares rose by less.\u0026nbspA number of essential costs have also risen in price, including\u0026nbspthe cost of owning a home, energy bills, and council tax.\u0026nbspClothes and shoes rose in price by 1.8 per cent.UK inflation slows in temporary respite for consumers\u0026nbspInflation in Britain fell to 1.7 per cent last month - the slowest pace of price growth since December 2016 - after a surprisingly high rate of 2.1 per cent in July, writes The Independent\u0027s business and economics editor, Olesya Dmitracova.Economists had expected inflation to slow to 1.9 per cent in August.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAccording to the Office for National Statistics, the largest pressure on inflation came from a drop in the prices of clothing and shoes and much slower inflation in recreational and cultural goods and services, which include toys and computer games, as well as in sea fares.\u0026nbspHere\u0027s the full story:\u0026nbspUK inflation slows in temporary respite for consumers\u0026nbsp\u0027Helpful news for consumers\u0027\u0026nbspConsumer price\u0026nbsprises slowed down from an annual rate of 2.1 per cent in July to 1.7 per cent in August.\u0026nbspThat\u0027s good for UK households, says Howard Archer of the EY Item Club.\u0026nbspAugust’s moderation in inflation to 1.7 per cent\u0026nbspadds to the improvement in consumer purchasing power coming from annual earnings growth rising to an 11-year high of 4 per cent\u0026nbspin the three months to July.\u0026nbspImproved consumer purchasing power is particularly welcome news for an economy currently struggling markedly amid major Brexit, domestic political and global economic uncertainties – consumers have been the most resilient sector of the economy and their purchasing power will be critical to whether this resilience can continue.Poorer areas hit hardest by disappearance of free-to-use cash machines\u0026nbspFree-to-use cash machines are vanishing more quickly in deprived areas than in affluent ones, according to consumer campaigners who are pressing Chancellor Sajid Javid to implement a cash guarantee.Which? said its analysis shows nearly one in 10 (9 per cent) free cashpoints across the country had closed or switched to fee-paying during a 17-month period after changes to how the network is funded were set out.\u0026nbspThe consumer group used data from ATM network Link to make the findings.\u0026nbspReductions to the fees card issuers pay to ATM operators have sparked fears that cash deserts could be created, with bank branches also closing.\u0026nbspPress AssociationPound falls after inflation data\u0026nbspThe pound is down 0.42\u0026nbspper cent against the dollar on the back of lower-than-expected-inflation.\u0026nbspSterling is at $1.245 and has dropped 0.27 per cent against the euro to €1.104.\u0026nbspFood and drink prices rise\u0026nbspThe ONS explains:Food and non-alcoholic beverage prices rose by more between July and August 2019 than between the same two months of 2018.\u0026nbspThe effects were relatively small from all categories within this heading, with the largest upward ones coming from bread and cereals (from products such as dried potted snacks, breakfast cereal and packs of inidual cakes), and meat (principally cooked ham).Ryanair and BA strikes latest\u0026nbspIn what is turning into an autumn of discontent for the travel industry, passengers are once again caught in the middle of another bitter dispute between an airline and its pilots, writes Travel Correspondent\u0026nbspSimon Calder.British Airways\u0026nbspis expected to cancel nearly 1,000 flights because of a strike by members of the\u0026nbspBritish Airline Pilots’ Association\u0026nbsp(Balpa) on 27 September.Before that, Balpa members employed by\u0026nbspRyanair\u0026nbspin the UK are about to begin another seven days of\u0026nbspstrikes.\u0026nbspFind out the latest on whether your flight might be affected here:\u0026nbspRyanair strike: will my flight be affected?Breaking: Inflation drops to 1.7 per cent in August - it\u0027s lowest since December 2016\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThat\u0027s below economists expectations of 1.9 per cent and well within the Bank of England\u0027s target of 2 per cent.Not enough robots, say MPs\u0026nbsp“The problem for the UK labour market and our economy is not that we have too many robots in the workplace, but that we have too few,” say MPs on the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee.\u0026nbspTheir report published today after months of research says the UK lags behind G7 competitors in adopting robots.\u0026nbspBusiness and Economics Editor, Olesya Dmitracova:\u0026nbspFuture of work: UK’s problem is not too many robots but too few, MPs sayRecord numbers seek debt help\u0026nbspDebt charity StepChange says a record number of people - some 331,337 -\u0026nbspmade contact to seek help in the first half of the year.\u0026nbspOf all those who contacted the charity, 190,484 went on to receive full debt advice.\u0026nbspPhil Andrew, chief executive of StepChange Debt Charity, said: “These statistics provide a sobering assessment of the scale of problem debt in this country.\u0026nbsp“Across the board, we are seeing red flags, including worrying proportions of new clients falling into debt due to reduced income, illness or because they rely on credit to pay for day-to-day living expenses.“Clearly more and more households are struggling to hang on and are ill-equipped to deal with any economic shocks the future may hold.\u0026nbspFull story:\u0026nbspRecord numbers of people now seeking help with their debt, says charity\u0026nbspShould the government step in to scrutinise deals like the Cobham takeover more often?\u0026nbspOur chief business commentator James Moore thinks so.\u0026nbspThere are so many bad things happening in Britain right now that the overseas takeover of yet another big British business, one that actually makes things and sells them overseas, seems barely to have been noticed, he writes.\u0026nbspAnother reason is perhaps that Cobham, an aerospace and defence business that has agreed to a £4bn bid from American buyout firm Advent International, is hardly a household name.\u0026nbspIt is perhaps best known as a pioneer of air to air refuelling tech, but it also supplies electronic and radar equipment to the civilian aerospace as well as the defence industry. Its kit can be found in just about every Airbus jet, for example.\u0026nbspMinisters have stopped asking if business deals are good for Britain\u0026nbspGambling adverts bannedThe advertising watchdog has banned two gambling ads which it said could encourage harmful behaviour.In a YouTube video advert, BetIndex described its football gambling product as “basically the football stock market, where you buy and sell shares in footballers with real money and you can win daily pay-outs which we call idends.One viewer complained to the Advertising Standards Authority, saying that the ad implied that the product was an investment opportunity and potentially a reliable source of income.A second advert for Coral has been banned for encouraging repetitive participation in gambling.The television promotion aired in June said: Free £5 bet every Sunday.

They helped researchers confirm what kind of object the mysterious rock was – and that it was unlike anything we had ever seen before.The images show the clear tail streaming out the back of the comet, which is what identifies it as such. The tail is the result of outgassing, caused by material being spewed out the back of the object and propelling it through the universe.It is the first time any visitor to our solar system has shown such a behaviour. The only other known interstellar tourist was the object known as \u0027Oumuamua, which did not show any tail – a fact that continues to perplex astronomers to this day.The picture was nearly missed, researchers said, but was the result of astronomers rushing to take the picture soon after the msterious object was identified.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month - August 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.When stars like the Sun grow advanced in age, they expand and glow red.

However, we really had to scramble for this one since we got the final details at 3:00 am and were observing it by 4:45!Comet speeding towards Earth could have come from another solar systemThe newly discovered object has been called\u0026nbspC2019 Q4 (Borisov), after the Russian amateur astronomer who first spotted its unusual orbit. The photo was taken soon after it was first seen, on the night of 9-10 September, by a telescope on\u0026nbspHawaii\u0027s\u0026nbspMaunakea.To take the images, researchers took observations in two different colour bands or filters and combined them into a colour image.For now, it is difficult for researchers to see more of the comet, because it has moved near to the Sun and is therefore difficult to see. But it is expected to swing into a better position in the coming months, as it continues its mysterious journey around the solar system.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

David Phelan has been testing the iPhone 11 for the\u0026nbsplast weekThree iPhones go on sale in a matter of days, promising improved photography, tweaked design, faster speed and something which may mean more than all of those to many: improved battery life.The new phones are the iPhone 11, the iPhone 11 Pro and the iPhone 11 Pro Max, replacing the iPhone XR, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max respectively.There’s a new naming system, then. Last year, it was the iPhone XS that was the standard iPhone, with the XR seen as a cut-price alternative. Now, the successor to the XR is the definitive iPhone, simply called iPhone 11, with the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max being presented as upscale versions. It’s a subtle repositioning.All of which is fine, if the iPhone itself earns its consideration as the mainstream phone.The iPhone 11 is a direct successor to the iPhone XR in design terms. From the front, it looks identical to last year’s models, with a 6.1-inch LCD screen that goes to the edges all the way around. This is a significant achievement in itself – most LCD screens require wide bezels at top and bottom at least. Apple found a way to reach the edges with what it calls a Liquid Retina display on last year’s iPhone XR and it’s the same here. The screen looks great, though at 326 pixels per inch, it’s much less detailed than the Pro models. Sometimes text can look a little less sharp than you’d like but Apple’s new software design, such as the gleaming wallpapers, for instance, emphasise the strengths of the LCD so well, so it’s rarely an issue.The newness in the design becomes apparent when you turn the iPhone 11 so you can see the sides. The XR was available in multiple colourful finishes and that’s the same here. This is visible from the edge because the aluminium antenna band which wraps around the phone is colour-matched to what’s on the rear of the phone.The colours this time are all new. Four of the six are gently updated from last year’s black, white, yellow and red, all of which are slightly different from the iPhone XR. The other two are completely new: a green that has a minty vibrancy and a striking purple. It’s nothing like purple, in my book, but is a mouth-wateringly appealing lavender shade that looks great. It’s the standout among this year’s colours, I’d say.The other changes to the design are on the back of the phone. First, the colours shine out brilliantly, with a polished-glass finish. Gloss all over apart from the camera bump which has a matte finish.How Apple’s new iPhones compare to the competitionThe camera bump had leaked in advance, or so we thought. But it turns out it’s very different from what was expected. The general belief was that it would be a deep, solid black bump with three flush cameras in, like the iPhone XS.In fact, the lenses protrude, so the bump is much less dominant than expected and the area around the lenses is coloured to match the rest of the back of the phone, not black as on earlier multi-camera phones. These two design choices make the camera area look significantly better.By the way, yes, multi-camera. Unlike the iPhone XR, with its single snapper, there are two lenses here – of which, more later. That’s the other big change to the look of the back of the phone, though there’s one more noticeable difference.On iPhones up until now, the back has always featured the Apple logo, the word iPhone and the words “Designed in California” and “Assembled in China”. In some “S” years, that letter would be there, too. There was also the CE mark and a do not recycle graphic.Theater at Apple Park in Cupertino, California, USA, 10 September 2019 (EPAJOHN G. MABANGLO)Apart from the Apple logo itself, everything else has now gone. The logo has moved down the back to a more central position. As a result, it looks much cleaner, more elegant.In the hand, the iPhone 11 feels great. Despite its large display, it’s comfortable even in smaller hands and the smooth edges mean you can roll it through your fingers satisfyingly.The detailing is remarkable, as you would expect from Apple. The volume buttons, power button, mute switch and even the inside of the Lightning charging socket are perfectly colour-matched to the rest of the phone.The cameras here are both 12MP sensors, one wide and one ultra-wide. The iPhone 11 is significantly cheaper, £270 less than the iPhone 11 Pro, with pricing starting at £729. Last year’s iPhone XR, by the way, is still available and has dropped in price to £699.Despite the price difference there is a lot the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro share and that includes the cameras. These are identical to two of the iPhone 11 Pro’s three cameras – the Pro also has a telephoto lens.Two lenses mean that portrait mode with its sharp-focus-subject-blurred-background effect is now here with a vengeance. It was possible on the iPhone XR through software but that meant objects and, more importantly, pets didn’t register. It needed a pair of human eyes to work. Now, portrait mode works for everything. There’s also a high-contrast black-and-white mode that’s especially eye-catching.A new camera interface means the phone shows you what the wide lens sees and around the edges to fill the display with what the ultra-wide would see, if you were using that. If you decide it’s a better shot, you can switch to it. It’s a useful system and my only disappointment is that when you do flick to the ultra-wide, it no longer occupies the whole screen. However, that wouldn’t show everything the camera can see, so it’s unavoidable.Edelson  AFP)JOSH EDELSONAFPGetty Images)There’s also a new night mode which activates automatically when light is low. You can turn it off, but the results are mostly outstanding, so it’s worth letting the iPhone do its stuff. It takes multiple shots and puts them together to create an improved result. The shots are taken over a second, sometimes longer and a slider counts it down for you.The images are realistic, not impossibly bright and still catch the feeling of the moment. On a couple of occasions I found the colours were a little different from what my eyes saw but this was the exceptional, not the commonplace, result.The camera interface is also improved with a swipe mechanic on the screen to reveal extra menu options.The front-facing camera is now 12MP, too and comes with a wider field of view. When you turn the iPhone to landscape orientation, the camera knows to automatically choose that wider view. Apple also announced the slofie (I know, I know) which stands for slow-motion selfie video shot at 120 frames per second. These are actually quite fun.All these features are on the Pro phones, too, but for many, the iPhone 11 camera will be more than good enough.This is a major upgrade on all the new iPhones. The iPhone XR already had the best battery life of any iPhone and this one adds an extra hour to that. It’s hard to pin down exactly how many hours that really means, but in my testing, it has lasted from early to late every single day. This is a super-refreshing change. I’d still recommend nightly charges for peace of mind, but this is a big step forward. Anyone nursing an iPhone 7, say, whose battery may be needing a little boost during the day, will enjoy what the iPhone 11 has to offer.The release of iOS 13 on Thursday 19 September brings more features. There’s the dark mode which has proved highly popular, offering a less in-your-face design with black backgrounds instead of white. On the Pro phones with their OLED screens that will offer power saving, but not with LCD. Here it’s a clean, attractive look.Face ID, the fast, reliable and secure facial recognition system introduced on the iPhone X, is more effective now and works at more angles, so you don’t have to crane your neck forward when it’s on your desk, say – though you do still have to lean in. This improvement will also happen on the other Face ID iPhone models as it’s software-based.iPhones on 10 September, 2019, and slashed prices of older models (Apple)The processor, called A13 Bionic, is blisteringly fast. Right now, it’s easy to notice how quickly apps launch and respond when in use but as developers create more demanding apps, expect the new processor to step up to the plate.Note that the splendid 3D Touch effect of the iPhone X and XS is not here. That’s the subtle haptic feedback you get when you touch certain menus. It was replaced on the iPhone XR by Haptic Touch which works in a different way. Previously, Haptic Touch was limited in what it did but it’s now been expanded to wherever 3D Touch went. Haptic Touch is now on the Pro iPhones, too. You can feel a difference and it doesn’t feel quite as nippy as 3D Touch, but on the whole, I forgot about the change pretty much instantaneously.The new design is a gentle update, but the new iPhone is still a triumph thanks to its snazzy colours, great feel and super-fast performance. Though the display isn’t a match for the Pro models it’s still fine and works well. The considerably extended battery life will be enough to justify an upgrade for many, and the extra upgrades such as the truly excellent cameras may seal the deal.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If I don’t earn the money, I won’t be investing.“If I’m not investing, that has a cumulative impact on jobs, on buying parts from suppliers, on the success of the company, on taxes we pay on everything.”Mr Flewitt also said he “hates the idea of a no-deal Brexit” due to the lack of clarity anyone can offer, describing it as “no deal with no understanding of the consequences of no deal”.He also said: “The politicians need to lead us. Fine, if the country has mandated that we leave, and that’s what we decide to do, but then their job is to make sure the rules, the guidelines, the processes are in place to manage that exit in an orderly way –\u0026nbspnot to damage, not to undermine the country because we didn’t manage it well.“If the outcome isn’t a great one that’s a consequence of the fact we had a referendum and we voted to leave.“But for the consequence to be a damaging one because we don’t manage it properly, that’s downright irresponsible – and it won’t just be supercars.“Your headlines won’t be ‘McLaren can’t build supercars’ on 4 November.“It’ll be: we can’t get medicines, we can’t get food, we can’t get clothes the chaos that could ensue – because there won’t be a differentiation between this component and that component coming in, cross-border trade – that’s the bit I think is irresponsible, to lead us into that.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

In Sesotho, the South African language of the region in which the dinosaur was discovered, its name means a giant thunderclap at dawn1320 Birth of a planet Scientists have witnessed the birth of a planet for the first time ever. 1420 New human organ discovered that was previously missed by scientistsLayers long thought to be dense, connective tissue are actually a series of fluid-filled compartments researchers have termed the “interstitium”. 1520 Previously unknown society lived in Amazon rainforest before Europeans arrived, say archaeologistsWorking in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, a team led by archaeologists at the University of Exeter unearthed hundreds of villages hidden in the depths of the rainforest. 1620 One in 10 people have traces of cocaine or heroin on fingerprints, study findsMore than one in 10 people were found to have traces of class A drugs on their fingers by scientists developing a new fingerprint-based drug test.1720 Nasa releases stunning images of Jupiter\u0027s great red spotThe storm bigger than the Earth, has been swhirling for 350 years.

The tallest of the skeletons uncovered measured at 1.9mGiant salamanders, which typically live in rocky, mountainous river systems, were once widespread across central, southern and eastern China.Scientists concluded that Chinese giant salamanders erged into three distinct species between 3.1 and 2.4 million years ago, which coincides with a period of mountain formation when the Tibetan plateau rose rapidly.But their meat is considered a delicacy in China and they have historically been used for medicinal purposes, which has created a vast farming industry. Habitat loss and poaching also pose severe threats.‘Frozen Dragon of the North’: New species of flying creature foundWhile millions are now kept on farms, these appear to overwhelmingly be members of the most common species, while wild populations are at great risk of extinction.“These findings come at a time where urgent interventions are required to save Chinese giant salamanders in the wild,” said Melissa Marr, a PhD researcher at the Natural History Museum.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Zookeepers hope to one day introduce another animal to Professor Lew as a mate.Scientists believe that in light of the recent study, published on Monday in Ecology and Evolution, future conservation efforts could\u0026nbspinvolve\u0026nbspscreening farmed giant salamanders to determine their species before encouraging them to mate and reintroducing\u0026nbspthem into the wild among their own species.Dr Turvey added:\u0026nbsp“We hope that this new understanding of their species ersity has arrived in time to support their successful conservation, but urgent measures are required to protect any viable giant salamander populations that might remain.”Additional reporting by PAShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The company needed the additional funding from investors to complete work on the mine to extract polyhalite potash, a type of fertilizer, in North Yorkshire, as well as on a transportation tunnel to Teesside.The company originally expected to obtain loans guaranteed by Britain’s Infrastructure and Projects Authority. After postponing the bond sale last month, Sirius went back to the government asking for help with raising money from investors, but the government declined, the firm said.\u0026nbspIt added that it will now slow the development of the project – which includes boring a mine more than a mile deep – as it looks for alternative sources of funding.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Protesters dressed as the Incredible Hulk and Robocop outside the Supreme Court in London where judges are due to consider legal challenges to Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u0027s decision to suspend Parliament.

The average monthly shortfall for these clients was £365.Unexpected life events were the biggest causes of problem debt.Those experiencing a reduction in income (18 per cent), injury or illness (16 per cent) or unemployment or redundancy (16 per cent) made up the bulk of new clients.StepChange said its figures “underline the growing number of households in the United Kingdom struggling to keep their heads above water, particularly when faced with a sudden change in personal circumstances”.Phil Andrew, chief executive of StepChange Debt Charity, said: “These statistics provide a sobering assessment of the scale of problem debt in this country.Surge in councils using bailiffs to chase debts“Across the board, we are seeing red flags, including worrying proportions of new clients falling into debt due to reduced income, illness or because they rely on credit to pay for day-to-day living expenses.“Clearly more and more households are struggling to hang on and are ill-equipped to deal with any economic shocks the future may hold.He said the figures “must act as a wake-up call to the Government”, with issues around bailiff behaviour and the five-week wait people have before they receive their first Universal Credit payments.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This proportion has risen by a third since 2014, when 18 per cent of new clients were single parents.Nine in 10 single parent clients were renters. Single parents were also particularly likely to have higher outgoings than incomes.StepChange said the rapid growth in single-parent clients suggests they are being squeezed by benefits payments and the rising cost of living.A Government spokeswoman said: “We are determined to help families improve their lives through work, while continuing to support them with the cost of living.“But we know some families need more support, which is why we spend more than £95 billion a year on working age benefits.“With Universal Credit, people can get paid urgently if they need it, and 700,000 families will get on average £285 more a month because the system is simpler.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

He added that the lower clothing prices may be due to unusually wet weather keeping shoppers away and prompting discounting by retailers.Slower inflation may be good for consumers in the short term but it also rings alarm bells for economists.\u0026nbsp“The falling inflation rate could be an early signal of a cooling economy, in line with what we have seen in the US and the euro area,” said\u0026nbspYael\u0026nbspSelfin, chief economist at\u0026nbspKPMG\u0026nbspUK.“Recent falls in the value of the pound and the spike in oil prices over the weekend should boost the headline rate in the coming months, with higher prices for fuel and for imported goods putting pressure on households’ purchasing power and business margins, and further curtailing demand.”Separate data from the ONS showed that average house prices increased by 0.7 per cent\u0026nbspin July compared with a year earlier, only half the rate in June and the weakest pace of growth since September 2012.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Rival taxi app Lyft, which floated in March, is about 40 per cent down.Beyond tech stocks, SmileDirectClub, which sells alternatives to orthodontic braces, managed to raise $1.35bn (£1bn) from investors before its shares plummeted 28 per cent in their first day’s trading last week.WeWork has been criticised in some quarters as an extreme example of hype over substance, having already racked up losses in excess of $3bn\u0026nbsp(£2.4bn) while spending freely on expansion. The firm leases offices on long-term contracts before renting them out on short-term contracts to companies and freelancers.That leaves it potentially vulnerable in a downturn when its customers seek to cut costs by ending their tenancy. Despite the simple business model, WeWork markets itself as a technology company that is changing the way people work and has attempted to value itself accordingly.Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, summed up a widely held view: “It would appear that WeWork has missed the boat when it comes to getting investors to buy into an idea that has yet to prove profitable.”With the company losing $2 for every $1 it makes, even a valuation as low as $15bn\u0026nbsp(£12bn) and $18bn (£14.4bn)\u0026nbsphasn’t been enough to whet investor appetite, particularly since a number of this year’s unicorns are now languishing below their IPO launch prices.“As Uber can attest, a popular business model doesn’t always translate into a realistic valuation and looking at WeWork’s numbers it is hard to make a case for the type of valuation being asked for now, let alone the one we saw at the beginning of the year.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Is there somebody in the room who wants to live the Chinese way of life? Somebody in the room who wants to live the African way of life? Or the American way of life? he told a press conference at the European Parliament.I want to live the European way of life, with solidarity, with democracy, with protecting human rights - especially when it\u0027s about migrants. It\u0027s absolutely crystal clear.EU accused of adopting ‘fascist rhetoric’ with new immigration jobIncoming European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen came under pressure to drop the title, which she unveiled with her new cabinet earlier this month. She however\u0026nbspinstead defended it in an op-ed this weekend, warning that\u0026nbspadversaries of Europe were threatening these values of tolerance and nondiscrimination.Speaking in Strasbourg on Tuesday, Mr Weber added: I am proud to be a European, and frankly speaking I cannot understand why politicians are attacking a title to protect or defend the European way of life.I think it was a very important step from Ursula von der Leyen now to clarify with her tweet last week referring to Article 2 of the Lisbon treaty, and also with the op-ed she did over the weekend to clarify the content.Mr Weber\u0027s comments attracted strong criticism from other MEPs.

Callejon played the situation. Another description would be that he outright ed, and cheated.Whether it was thereafter a penalty is a more difficult debate.That the referee actually saw it that way and gave it was just unfortunate, since it could have gone the other way.

Some decisions will forever remain unchangingly subjective.Henderson explains what cost Liverpool against NapoliFive things we learned from Liverpool’s late defeat at NapoliLiverpool stunned by Napoli as title defence begins with defeatIn that sense, it was just just rank bad luck that the penalty was given.That was what decided this opening Champions League match, even if the e itself was genuinely an extension of Napoli’s overall sharpness.It’s far from the first time they’ve caused Liverpool problems. That’s been the case in all of their three meetings Champions League so far in the Klopp era. There is a suggestion that Ancelotti’s specific tactics might just be suited to unsettling Liverpool’s, which is why they’ve won two of those meetings.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So, maybe does the entire path of this team.Allison’s save might have been irrelevant, forgotten in the way that Adrian’s here largely will because it no longer meant the same thing.But they didn’t go a different way. They were borderline incidents, and it was that very knife-edge nature of them that actually helped Liverpool get a fuller sense of themselves as a team in the long term. They helped them become European champions, and not just in terms of actually getting through.That was one of the more interesting elements of this defeat, even if it won’t really have any influence on the season.Liverpool should still breeze through the group, and will of course be favourites to win the trophy again, but this was not really a display that suggested why. It felt more like one from the side when it was much earlier in development.You could see the general shape was there, and the core idea, with Fabinho particularly executing it perfectly – but he was one of the few. Liverpool were just lacking a sharpness, and felt off in so many moments when it came right down to it. Be that finishing, attacking moves and occasional defensive play.How else to explain Robertson’s clumsiness, or Virgil van Dijk’s rare error.In short, they were quite short of the standards they set for themselves.It was not the performance of European champions.This of course isn’t any cause for concern. It’s just one of those games, decided by one of those moments.But it did emphasise that we maybe have got a little too used to them being utterly brilliant. That’s how good they’ve been.This reminded us that their mortal, and the very capriciousness of the game can be the killer.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Mr Gantz’s party has previously ruled out a coalition with Likud while Mr Netanyahu remains leader.In a speech to the Likud party faithful, Mr Netanyahu made no claim of victory or concession of defeat, saying he was awaiting a vote tally. The results could see him and his party ousted after a decade in power.Follow the latest updatesOpposition leader Benny Gantz\u0026nbspsays exit polls suggest prime minister \u0027did not succeed in his mission\u0027Ali Jaffaly, an Arab who owns a store in Jaffa, said he was voting for the joint list of Arab parties.\u0026nbspHe told\u0026nbspBel Trew:\u0026nbspLast time I voted for Blue and White because there wasn’t a united Arab list, it was ided.\u0026nbspI thought, my purpose is to replace Bibi, there needs to be a change. This time I’ll vote the joint list, because now they’re united.I really hope that even if Bibi won’t be replaced, the joint list will somehow make a difference in the government. If they have 11, 12 mandates it’ll really make a difference.If Ayman Oudeh joins Gantz, I’d be supportive. So that there will be someone to make a difference to move things there. There are pros and cons but I think there will be more benefit for them to join the government than to stay alone.The joint list of Arab parties, who have never sat in an Israeli government, also finished strong according to the partial results, which indicated they had earned 12 seats to become the third-largest party in parliament.\u0026nbspShould a unity government be formed, its leader Ayman Odeh\u0026nbspwould become the country\u0027s next opposition leader, an official state position that would grant him an audience with visiting dignitaries, a state-funded bodyguard, monthly consultations with the prime minister and a platform to rebut his speeches in parliament.Eliran Ben Iolo, 32, a taxi driver in Tel Aviv, said he was voting for the Blue and White party.He told Bel Trew:The partial results released on Wednesday by the Central Election Commission were based on a tally of 56 per cent\u0026nbspof the potential electorate. Overall turnout was 69.4 per cent.According to the partial results, Likud with its natural allies of religious and ultra-nationalist parties mustered just 56 seats — or five short of the required majority.Mr Gantz\u0027s Blue and White and its center-left allies garnered 55 seats, placing Mr Lieberman\u0027s Yisrael Beiteinu and its nine seats in the middle as the deciding factor.Mr\u0026nbspLiberman is now the linchpin, wrote Nahum Barnea, a prominent columnist in the Yediot Ahronot daily.I don\u0027t think that anyone is prepared to risk a third election, not even for Netanyahu, Mr Barnea added. Maybe the time has come to say goodbye.As the results came in, the election\u0027s apparent kingmaker, Avigdor Lieberman, insisted the overall picture was unlikely to change.\u0026nbspHe also demanded a secular liberal government shorn of the religious and ultra-Orthodox allies the prime minister has long relied upon.\u0026nbspThe conclusion is clear, everything we said throughout the campaign is coming true, he said outside his home in the West Bank settlement of Nokdim. There is one and only option: a national unity government that is broad and liberal and we will not join any other option.\u0026nbspMr Gantz, a former military chief, has ruled out sitting with a Likud party led by Mr Netanyahu at a time when the prime minister is expected to be indicted on corruption charges in the coming weeks. It raised the specter of an alternate Likud candidate rising to challenge Mr Netanyahu, though most of its senior officials have thus far pledged to stand solidly behind their leader.Mr Netanyahu\u0027s main challenger, centrist Benny Gantz, said it appeared from the exit polls Israel\u0027s longest-serving leader was defeated, but only official results would tell.\u0026nbspMr\u0026nbspGantz, a former armed forces chief, beamed with confidence as he told a rally of his Blue and White Party it appeared we fulfilled our mission, and he pledged to work towards formation of a unity government.\u0026nbspMr Netanyahu, he said, apparently did not succeed in his mission to win a fifth term. We will await the actual results, Mr Gantz, 60, said.Here is some analysis of the exit polls and the election so far\u0026nbspfrom Bel Trew, our correspondent in Tel Aviv:Israel\u0027s two main political parties were deadlocked on Wednesday after an unprecedented repeat election.\u0026nbspBenjamin Netanyahu was fighting to hold on to his job as prime minister after exit polls showed the race was too close to call.Please allow a moment for the live blog to loadOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We do not eat them, and that is a very important message to send to the rest of the world.“It’s not culturally insensitive because we’re not telling them what to do – we’re just telling them what we do.“We shouldn’t be worrying about that, so I was surprised that was the MoJ’s objection.”Justice officials also argued that it would be dficult to enforce the law and the current ban on transporting or exporting dog and cat meat suffices.Eating dog is already banned in Germany, Austria, Taiwan, South Australia and Hong Kong.An estimated  million dogs a year are slaughtered to be eaten, across China, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia.Most are stolen off the street.Their meat it is considered both a delicacy and a health tonic.The World Dog Alliance mounted a campaign in the UK last year for a full ban on any activity relating to the eating of dogs.A series of MPs back a ban, including former Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan who dubbed it “a disgusting habit”.A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: “We currently have some of the strongest animal welfare laws in the world.The government is currently considering whether any changes are needed in this area in the UK and will set out any plans in due course.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I am fully aware, however, how the right-on conspiracy theories play out here.That is, I’m only saying this because The Mash Report goes against my own political prejudicesand am part of a right-wing media group trying to destroy the working-class via Brexit.The same right-wing media group that broke the Yellowhammer No Deal crisis story, off which The Mash Report has been leeching material all series.Above and beyond my own obvious desire to enslave the proletariat, through dumb quiz show answers, though, I am also a comedy fan, and the remarkable thing about the Brexit circus is that not once, in more than three years, has The Mash Report, Have I Got News For You, The Last Leg or Frankie Boyle’s New World Order said anything so funny it’s worth repeating.Hardly surprising really when, rather than being part of the comedy process, all of those shows are such an entrenched and slanted part of the left-of-centre political process they’ve all removed deserving Labour targets, like Diane Abbott, John McDonnell and Emily Thornberry, from any sort of firing line.It’s natural BBC Channel  bias and stupidity that’s led them to that sorry pass, I think, not orders from above.But the chances of those two networks ever changing their tone and playing fair Take the exact number of angry rants Nish Kumar’s aimed at Labour’s anti-Semites, on The Mash Report, multiply it by the number of times he’s mentioned the actual result of the Brexit referendum and your answer’s still zero.THE height of optimism  Britain’s Got Talent: The Champions host Ant McPartlin announcing: “We’ll be back with the winners of Holland’s Got Talent . See you in a few minutes.”Remarkably, though, they did, and I quickly regretted the decision, as even Simon Cowell had lost patience with the process by then and was taking it all out on some Dutch dance troupe called Fire.“It lacked imagination and creativity. I’ve seen this a million times. You’ve wasted a massive opportunity, guys.”The miracle was he didn’t snap earlier and far more often, as there were plenty of other acts absolutely begging for the red buzzers.Prime targets included: Mrs screechy pants, from Spain, Christina Ramos, DJ Arch, who won South Africa’s Got Talent aged three, presumably beating a two-year-old ventriloquist, and those Lebanese caterpillar dancers, Mayyas, from Beirut, whose reception owed a lot more to good manners than entertainment value.Picking two winners was, by contrast, a much harder task. But David Walliams’ golden buzzer went to Nico And Paddy, an -year-old salsa dancer whose signature move is the unravelling toilet roll drop, while the overall Wembley Arena winner was correctly judged to be Canadian escapologist Darcy Oake, who now faces the usual BGT challenge of doing something “even more dangerous” for the final. A simple solution presents itself.Get the Lebanese dancers to handcuff you inside that box, then see how quickly you escape, smart-a**e.CALLING out around the world, are you ready for a cookery heat Summer’s here and the time is right for basting turkey meat.Apologies to Marvin Gaye, William “Mickey” Stevenson and Ivy Jo Hunter for the dreadful liberties just taken with their Motown classic, but it’s not every day a genuine music legend rocks up in the BBC Celebrity MasterChef kitchen.And as well as Kiss FM DJ Rickie Haywood-Williams, Grammy-nominated singer Martha Reeves was also present, marinading cod and being told off by Gregg Wallace for over-seasoning a turkey burger for her troubles.She seemed to enjoy the experience as well.I just hope Martha was paying proper attention to the health and safety lecture head chef at the Kricket restaurant, Will Bowlby, gave fellow team member Greg Rutherford at the tandoor oven.“It rises in temperature to between  and  degrees.“You do not want to look over it, ’cos . . . ”It’s like a heatwave.MEANWHILE, on EastEnders, Ade Edmondson has reappeared, on Jean’s cancer ward, in a characteristically happy-go-lucky mood as Daniel.“I’ve got absolutely nothing to live for. I can’t even get aroused when Fiona Bruce comes on telly.”And Jenner Saunders  No. Silly question.Kane Robinson and Ashley Walters’ mesmerising performances as Sully and Dushane, on Netflix’s Top Boy.Mark Wright’s genuinely fascinating Who Do You Think You Are  drawing a direct line between Towie and the Spanish inquisition.GMB’s hungover host Piers Morgan making such a perfect Brexit idiot of shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, on my favourite show, she did the left-wing equivalent of pressing the ejector seat button and yelped: “Food banks.”S Club ’s Paul Cattermole appearing at the First Dates Hotel, looking uncannily like Charlie Higson.And Goggleboxer Pete giving brilliant context to the claim the singer had been, “Beaten around by the industry”, by pointing out: “For £. an hour I had my arm shoulder deep in s***. And HE’S been ‘beaten around by the industry ’”Gemma Collins, Arg and all those other Z-list celebrities who think turning up late for everything is a charming personality quirk.Planner-knackering programmes that last exactly one hour . . . and five minutes.An advert for Britain’s smuggest and touchiest television network, Channel , maintaining, “complaints welcome”.First Dates maitre d’ Fred Sirieix being a little bit more in love with fame than is healthy.And Odd One Out, with Jesy Nelson of Little Mix, which really wasn’t the replacement for the Paul Daniels’ masterpiece I was hoping for or expecting.Well, fairly sure.DAVE, Wednesday, pm: Comedians Giving Lectures.THIS week’s winner is football pundit Danny Murphy and That Yellow B*stard from Sin City.Sent in by Dean Edmunds.

Money does not cushion grief.I find it hard to imagine how anyone could read the excerpt of Cameron’s biography published at the weekend discussing the short le of his son and not be incredibly moved on the human level that should unite us all — regardless of politics. It brought tears to my eyes, although I had heard it all before from him and his we, as well as living through  years of similar traumatic experiences.His anguish at carrying his adored son in his arms for the last time was palpable.Perhaps I am just someone who shares some of Cameron’s “privileged pain” as the privately educated parent of a child with profound disability.Thankfully my daughter has survived complex epilepsy, among other problems, to reach adulthood.Yet like Cameron, I was plunged into the darkness of despair after the birth of a child with disabilities disrupted my le. Only later did I learn this was a form of grief as parents mourn the child they expected and come to terms with changed realities.We met soon after Ivan’s birth, a routine lunch between a journalist and MP turning into an intense discussion of shared experiences. Later we spoke about the impact on our lives and politics, even swapping notes on trusted doctors and schools.Cameron told me of struggling to take in diagnosis of Ivan’s Ohtahara syndrome, when a doctor said their son faced, “very serious dficulties”. He askedthis meant Ivan might have trouble with maths or much worse “I’m afraid it means he probably won’t walk or talk,” replied the paediatrician.For any family, rich or poor, this moment is a shock as dreams are shattered. Then comes a struggle to hold a family together, to retain jobs and relationships, to fight for education, respite and support in a system that seems often so uncaring.Your background makes little dference when filling in endless forms with the same details, searching for a school that might take your sick child, struggling with a seizure in a park, trying to find a public toilet to change a soiled pad or banging your head against blasé bureaucrats to win a few hours of respite care to retain sanity.Even at the world-famous Great Ormond Street Hospital we endured doctors who never read case notes, ed phone calls or responded to emails. One lost key files at a critical time another was a le-saver I will never forget.Exhausted families cling to such saviours as they navigate an overloaded, maze-like system filled with officials feuding over budgets. It seems almost asit is designed to inflame the distress of parents struggling under intense stress.This is recognised by this newspaper’s Give It Back campaign, demanding the Government plugs a £million-a-year funding gap and calling for a joined-up care system to help ensure families can live some semblance of normal le.Cameron wrote about the “torture” of seeing his son’s “small frame racked with spasms and what looked like searing pain” and feeling so helpless to stop the distress.However many times you see such seizures, the suffering never stops — as I felt again on Sunday afternoon watching my beautul daughter endure a series of fits that eventually needed emergency medication.As any parent knows all too well — hearing the hideously familiar screams while seeing the flailing limbs and rolling eyes — epilepsy can be a fatal condition.There are joys too, of course — but the pain of such parenthood is profound, the agonies seared deep in the soul, the struggles seem remorseless.And that is for everyone — whether rich or poor.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Only a Marxist Labour Party would disagree.“Abolishing it would cost billions and cause utter chaos.”He added: “It is popular and it works. Otherwise why do we have so many people going back into work “Labour persists with this ludicrous idea they can come up with some kind of Nirvana.“Universal Credit is a much better system than anything that came before it.”UC brings together six welfare payments and tapers the amount of cash paid so claimants are not penalised and suddenly cut offthey find a job.It has been hit by criticisms, and the six week wait for payments was reduced to five after a big campaign.But Tory MPs warned that tearing up the system altogether will end up backfiring and saddling the country with an even bigger welfare bill.Tory MP and ex Welfare Secretary Damian Green said: “If Labour will put [universal credit] at risk, they will be damaging the opportunities of people to get into work and move up the ladder, and that would be unbelievably stupid.”Matthew Lesh, from the free-market Adam Smith Institute said: “There is always room for reform.“But dismantling universal credit will cost billions, mean higher taxes, and undermine our record low unemployment.”A Labour source told The Daily Mirror UC cannot be scrapped overnight.But they added that there was “an absolute determination that Universal Credit will become history”. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Public Accounts Committeesaid the department had a flawed reaction to the systemic failure, and revoking visas before verying evidence led to injustice and hardship for many thousands of international students. The report said: It is entirely unacceptable that, despite now recognising that hundreds of people still maintain their innocence, the Home Office has not acted to put right the wrongs caused by its actions. As with the Windrush scandal, the Home Office has once again not done enough to identy the innocent and potentially vulnerable people who have been affected. In , while Theresa May was Home Secretary, BBC Panorama broadcast footage showing organised cheating in two English language test centres run by third parties on behalf of non-profit organisation the Educational Testing Service .    Voice recognition technology was used by ETS to detect who had cheated by having someone  sit their test. It found % of UK tests taken between  and  as suspicious, with % of , tests classied as invalid and % as questionable. The Home Office investigated colleges, test centres and students, cancelling the visas of those it considered to have cheated in the Test Of English for International Communication . But a number of people have protested their innocence. The report said the Home Office rushed to penalise students without establishing whether ETS was involved in fraud orit had reliable evidence of people cheating. The department has consistently argued that there was only a aposvery smallapos risk that its actions would affect innocent people and claims that it is concerned that hundreds of people continue to maintain their innocence. However, the department has taken no action to proactively identy innocent people. Those who are affected by the departmentaposs action against them can go through the courts to try to demonstrate their innocence. But this can have a substantial financial and personal cost for those involved. It is shameful that the department knows it could have acted against innocent people but has not established a clear mechanism for them to raise concerns outside of the appeals process.  But it said it was encouraged the Home Secretary had pledged to look into the matter. Nazek Ramadan, director of the charity Migrant Voice, told the PA news agency the report would shame any government that claims to value justice and fairness, adding: Working alongside many of the students affected, we have seen first hand the extreme hardship they face every single day as a direct result of the Home Officeaposs deeply flawed reaction. aposWeaposre living in an open prisonapos, they tell us, aposand our hope of ever being released is fadingapos. We urge the Home Secretary to read this report and take the necessary action to end this injustice and demonstrate that international students truly are welcome in this country. The report also criticised the department for having insufficient recourse to claim compensation, adding: The Home Officeaposs flawed reaction to a systemic failure by a private company has had a detrimental impact on the lives of more than , overseas students accused of cheating. The system it designed left it with limited means to seek compensation from ETS Global BV, securing just £. million in compensation for taxpayers, despite spending an estimated £ million to respond to the cheating.Committee chairwoman Labour MP Meg Hillier said: The Home Officeaposs flawed reaction to a systemic failure by a private company has led to real injustice for many thousands of overseas students taking English Language tests.It is staggering that the Home Office thinks it is acceptable to have so little regard for the impact its actions might have on innocent people.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMum Hannah McSween gazes at her daughter Poppy as she plays happily in the sunshine with her toy bunny. That cuddly rabbit has been with her for every day of the two and a half years she has battled  for survival. Each time Hannah sees the little white toy her heart feels like it could burst.Because when she bought the bunny it was for an altogether more tragic reason – so Poppy would never be alone in her coffin. “I look at her now and think,I didn’t follow my intuition she wouldn’t be here. Every year instead of celebrating her birthday, I’d be mourning her,” Hannah says. Poppy was born on March , , by emergency caesarean at  weeks – one week past the abortion limit – and doctors told her devastated parents she ­probably wouldn’t survive. She weighed just  ounces and was the same size as a tennis ball , making her one of the tiniest babies in the UK.    But incredible Poppy has beaten the odds and is thriving at home after finally being discharged from ­Southmead Hospital in Bristol for the first time in her le. “Going from being one of the tiniest babies born to being this strong and intelligent girl is amazing,” says -year-old Hannah, from Chepstow, South Wales. “I had mixed emotions when we were told she was going to be discharged. The people we met on the newborn intensive care unit were like part of the family in a way. “It was very sad leaving the friends I’ve met there – but it feels amazing to have her home for good. “Although it’s been a bit scary, being able to teach her everything ourselves and seeing her flourish without having constant checks is amazing. “It does make me scared that no one is there to constantly watch over us, but even in the last two weeks she’s come along ­amazingly – she’s catching up so quickly. “I can’t wait to finally start her le properly and teach her to do everything by ourselves.”  It is hopefully the beginning of the end of a long road for the family, which began  weeks into the pregnancy when Hannah and her husband Steve, also , were warned their baby would not live. One day they were taken into a small room and told Poppy wasn’t growing. “I knew it was bad news because there was a box of tissues on the table,” she recalls.“All along we were told, ‘She’s not going to be alive at the next scan. The likelihood of you having a positive outcome to this pregnancy is very slim’.”Doctors explained their unborn baby suffered from foetal growth restriction and Hannah says that they were advised to ­terminate. “We were told that we’d be better terminating the pregnancy asnot I’d have to go through labour to have a stillborn baby,” she says. In that dark time, the heartbroken couple thought about plans for their little girl’s death. But they were determined not to give up and, despite advice from consultants and doctors, decided to continue with the pregnancy.Hannah says: “Our consultants kept telling us before every scan that she wouldn’t be alive for the next one, and every time she was. “I couldn’t give up on her because then I wouldn’t have her in my le. At the time I thought,I don’t give up on her, the likelihood is that I won’t have her anyway. But there is this small chance it will pay off. And it did.” Hannah recalls the day Poppy finally arrived, saying: “When they said they had to deliver, I burst into tears. That’s when it hit me, ‘She’s either going to make it or not’.” They were told the hospital medical equipment to save Poppy’s le after birth was too big for her and they wouldn’t be able to help her.But day by day, Poppy defied the odds and her strength grew. Hannah says she now barely remembers “that dark time”.“I was just wrapped up in a bubble,” she admits. “I just got on with things, taking her brother to school, going in and out of hospital. It became everyday le.” Now, however, Poppy is enjoying her newfound freedom playing catch with her two big brothers, seven-year-old Oliver and six-year-old Oli. “It’s so funny, she loves that tennis ball,” Hannah says. “She even grabs fruit from the bowl and tries to throw it because she thinks it’s a ball.”    As the family settle into their new normal le, Hannah says: “She’s still very small and wears nine to -month-old clothes, but the fact she’s still here and doing so well is all that matters. Thinking about the fact we were told to abort her breaks my heart, but also makes me so happy that we took the risk. “She looked so tiny in her incubator when her arms and legs were all curled up, we compared her to a tennis ball. That’s how small she looked. I used to have to ring up the unit every night to check in on her to say goodnight. “Now I go into her room every night myself to check on her. “Poppy really is our miracle baby. She’s just fought and fought and fought against all the odds. But she’s made it. “Poppy is truly getting better each day – every time we are told she won’t be able to do something or won’t reach a milestone she absolutely smashes it.” Poppy is just beginning to speak, which fills her mum with pride. “Her first word was ‘Mummy’. It was incredible. Now she is talking more and more each day. “Whenever we see a dog she has to stop and point to say, ‘woof woof!’. She took her first steps in January as well, which was just amazing.She is such a determined little girl. If she can’t do something, she gets frustrated but will keep going until she’s got it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"horror cruel woman drags rabbit","story":"NewsHorror as cruel woman drags rabbit across car park on leashEXCLUSIVE A woman has been captured in a video dragging her distressed pet rabbit by its paws across a London car-parkShareByCameron WardTalia ShadwellRosaleen Fenton:,  SEP Updated:,  SEP Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video horror-woman-drags-rabbit-across-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Baby Ellie was diagnosed with the condition that affects the pigmentation of her skin, hair and eyes, as well as her sight - meaning she is likely to be classed as legally blind.

Little Ellie was diagnosed with Oculocutaneous Albinism at just  weeks old after her birth on October , .    She couldnapost see shadows until she was six months old. Her mum, from Cork, has revealed her initial dismay when confronted with her babyaposs medical condition. She said: “The diagnosis was made  weeks after her birth andI’m honest, I was devastated. “I will never forget my midwe telling us ‘weaposre having a blonde baby’ and Ronan, Ellieaposs dad repeating it while giving me a kiss. Next thing, the nurse followed on with ‘actually, it’s kind of white.’ Not reading into it, Ellie was placed on my chest and my Mom was called in. She says to this day, she knew Ellie was ‘albino’ the minute she set eyes on her white head. The next morning doctors, nurses, students, midwives, you name it - we had it, came to see ‘the baby with the white hair.’ This was what she was known as around the ward.”    The -year-old found her daughteraposs diagnosis dficult to deal with revealing: “It was asI mourned the ‘perfect child’. Whether it be your first child or your fth, we all want nothing more than our babies to be happy and healthy. To think of any harm or dficulties coming their way would kill any mom. I know there is so much worse out there. But this, for me, was heartbreaking to hear.” Soon after the birth, Hollie noticed that she was starting to hide her daughters Albinism: “I didn’t want people to now look at her as ‘the Albino’. I just wanted people to see her as ‘the baby with the white hair’. I think these days, when there is a name for something, people instantly think that they’re sick or they won’t have a ‘normal’ le. You find people saying ‘oh I’m sorry to hear’ because doctors have diagnosed your child with something. I didn’t want that to be the case for Ellie. Sight or no sight, she is my little girl and I want nothing but the best for her. People can be so nasty.” The part time model hopes that daughter Ellie will grow up knowing dferent is good: “When people asked me before ‘is she Albino’  It was asthey hit me in the stomach. Straight away I put up a defense. Now, I am trying to say ‘yes she is, isn’t her hair amazing ’. I want it to be a positive thing. Because it’s certainly not a negative.    She continued: “Although Ellie can see us when we’re close by, she can still be classed as ‘legally blind’, meaning she will never be able to drive, she may even need a cane when she’s older, she will have to wear sunscreen for most of the year. Simple things like going to the cinema, or going into Penney’s may be more of a challenge than others but we’ll deal with them when we get there.” The mother-of-one is determined her daughter will be like every other child her age: “I was told to raise Ellie like any ‘normal’ child.

But when her mother Angela Miah saw the footage, her iPad developed a fault as she attempted to press the aposlikeapos button - and an angry emoji face appeared instead under the video. Mrs Miah, an operations manageress, tried desperately to remove the angry emoji - but it is thought the icon froze and unexpectedly multiplied. Shabina then took the shower of angry emojis she received the wrong way and blocked her unwitting mother and refused to take her subsequent phone calls.    Mrs Miah went round to her daughteraposs home in an attempt to explain but left after the pair had an argument. Shabina was found dead in bed at her home in Macclesfield the following day after her mother went to check on her following a work appointment. Tests shown she had suffered congestive cardiac failure. An inquest heard former barmaid Shabina known as Shaz had a history of medical issues including depression and diabetes and had previously taken two overdoses of insulin. She got engaged to motorcycle technician Luke Tomlinson in November  and moved into a flat together but they split up in January this year amid claims she was unfaithful and she started seeing Dave Brown. Two days before her death on February , Mr Tomlinson moved back into the property although they slept in separate bedrooms.    Her mother told the Macclesfield hearing: aposaposIn the last three to four years Shabina had met Luke and he had a positive effect on her le. He was patient with her and looked after her but in January all seemed to change - her mental state more than anything she was out a lot and didn’t feel as close to me. aposaposShe was spending a lot of time with Dave and I thought something was going wrong and there was a problem with her relationship with Luke. I tried to talk to her about it but she wasn’t in a very good place and I pressed her to start taking her anti depressant medication again. aposaposDuring that last week of her le she started taking it again and got an appointment with a counsellor but she seemed very very confused and was in a very dark place very confused. On the Saturday night a band was on whom she regularly watched and really liked. aposaposLuke had askedshe wanted to take the dog to the beach but she was worried they wouldn’t be back in time - although Luke said they would go early to get back on time. On the Saturday night she had gone out to see the band and the following day she went to the circus with Dave.  She continued: aposaposMy iPad was playing up and I saw she posted on Facebook a little video of part of the circus. I went to put a aposlikeapos on it but an angry face came up. I pressed it again and it wouldn’t go. There were s of angry faces and she had taken it the wrong way. aposaposShe blocked me and I tried to ring her and text her but wouldn’t answer. I was upset that she was upset with me. Because she wouldn’t answer I went round and we ended up having an argument and I was very distressed. aposaposI left and thought I would let her calm down and speak to her the next day. Next morning I arrived at work and knew Luke would be going to work and I rang him before he left the house to check on her. aposaposHe phoned me back and I thought she was okay. But I later tried to ring her a couple of times and then asked her sister who was in Australia to seeshe could contact her but I thought she was still not talking to me. aposaposI started to get worried and looked on social media to see is she had been active she hadn’t been. At the time I was doing an induction for a new member of staff at work and I called a break and said I had to check my daughteraposs alright. aposaposI let myself inside, shouted and then I just went straight upstairs into bedroom and realised something was really wrong. I was quite hysterical at the time and I knew that she had gone. The emergency man on the phone telling me to do CPR but I knew it was too late. Two weeks before all this happens Shabina’s mental state was really really bad.aposapos  Mr Tomlinson said in a statement: aposaposJust after new year  she started to deteriorate, acted strangely and confused and it was not like her. Started to hang around with another man called Dave Brown. She started to stay out all night and she and I split up in January - she was cheating on me. aposaposI still came round after work to see her and on February , I moved back - although me and Shabina had separate bedrooms and I didn’t really see her. On February , we went to the beach and that night she went out all night and didn’thome and didn’t see her till the next day. She said was going to the circus and I ed later that evening she was in the kitchen. aposaposI went to bed around .pm. Later Shabina had an argument with Angela and it was irate. They went into the bedroom and she was trying to collect some belongings. Eventually Angela came down stairs and I heard Shabina slam her bedroom door. aposaposThat morning at am I walked the dog and Shabina was lying face down and crying.

The report cited the  Spanish flu pandemic, which killed an estimated million people. If a similar outbreak happened now the death toll would be even worse and the disease would spread much faster given the vast numbers of people crossing the world on planes every day, the experts warned.    An equivalent air-borne outbreak now could spread globally in less than  hours and kill an estimated million to million people. Such a pandemic would wipe out nearly five per cent of the global economy and destabilise security in the affected countries, according to the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board . In the case of a pandemic, many national health systems - particularly in poor countries - would collapse. The report contained a world map showing examples of emerging and re-emerging diseases which could trigger an outbreak - from human monkeypox and HN influenza to Ebola and plague.    Governments should work to prepare for and mitigate that risk, said the GPMB, co-convened by the World Bank and the World Health Organisation . It warned that epidemic-prone viral diseases like Ebola, flu and SARS are increasingly tough to manage in a world dominated by y conflicts, fragile states and forced migration. The report, named A World At Risk, stated: The threat of a pandemic spreading around the globe is a real one. A quick-moving pathogen has the potential to kill tens of millions of people, disrupt economies and destabilise national security.

Polls showed the embattled Prime Ministeraposs decade-long grip on power is slipping and he admitted he apparently did not succeed in his mission for a record fth term. His main election challenger, centrist Benny Gantz, said it appeared from the exit polls that Israelaposs longest-serving leader was defeated. In his own speech to right-wing Likud party faithful, Netanyahu, sipping water frequently and speaking in a hoarse voice, made no claim of victory or concession of defeat, saying he was awaiting a vote tally.    Netanyahuaposs appearance in the dead of night at Likud election headquarters was a far cry from his triumphant declaration five months ago that he had won a close election. His failure to form a government after the April ballot led to the new election on Tuesday, with official results expected to come on Wednesday morning. He is Israelaposs longest-serving leader, having been in the role since  with a previous term between  and . Gantz, a former armed forces chief, beamed with confidence as he told a rally of his Blue and White Party that it appeared we fulfilled our mission, and he pledged to work towards formation of a unity government.  We will await the actual results, Gantz, , said in the early hours of Wednesday. The final election results can take more than a week, but partial results are published by the Knesset - Israelaposs legislative body - as the vote-counting proceeds, so a clearer picture will likely emerge within a day before the final tally. Exit polls gave Likud  to  of parliamentaposs  seats, a slight drop from earlier forecasts, versus  to  for Blue and White. Neither had enough support, at first glance, for a governing coalition of  legislators, and Netanyahuaposs ally-turned-rival, former Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman, emerged as a likely kingmaker as head of the far-right Yisrael Beitenu party.  The updated polls showed that without Yisrael Beitenuaposs projected eight to nine seats, stalemate could ensue: Likud would have the support of only up to  legislators, down from  in the earlier exit polls, for a right-wing coalition. Blue and White could enlist the backing of no more than  for a centre-left government. Netanyahu, who highlighted his close relationship with US President Donald Trump during the campaign, had pledged to annex Jewish settlements and other territory in the occupied West Bankhe received a fth term. But Palestinians have warned such a move would kill any hopes for peace. Gantz has not advocated for any form of annexation, but his position on the creation of a Palestinian state is unclear.  Netanyahu said in his am speech at Likud election headquarters in Tel Aviv that he intended to establish a strong Zionist government that would reflect the views of many of the nationaposs people. His description of a future administration appeared to open the way for Jewish parties not part of his current government to join. It also seemed to be a swipe at Gantz, and the possibility that Netanyahuaposs rival might try for a governing coalition with the tacit support of an Arab party, which many right-wingers see as disloyal to Israel. The Joint Arab List made a strong showing in Tuesdayaposs election and was projected to capture  to  seats in the legislature, compared with  won by ious Arab factions in Aprilaposs election.

The part of town where Dundee Harp was founded is long removed, but that section of town was still there in the s.”Rob continued as he traced Dundee Harp’s once fertile source of talent: “We can start at Pat Cassady’s barber shop, or across the street at the premises of Terry McMahon’s pub – The Harp.“Both were on Brook Street in the Westport area of Dundee, otherwise known as The Burn. Heading east towards City Square, to the right past Daniels brae, you pass the Burn Bar.“A quick look inside would probably see brothers Pat and Jim Sturrock pouring sumptuous pints of heavy, and Eddie Greenan would normally be standing at the far end of the bar.“A bit further on, you would be at the Blackness Road junction before heading down the Blackie past the Blue Mountains, and now entering the bustling shopping expanse of the West Port.“With the Globe Bar visible in a rear-view mirror, crossing over Tay Street reveals the Overgate.

That was good momentum but it’s also a reminder that it can so easily just be dashed.“We just need to keep going the course. We’ve always spoken about one game at a time and I think that works both ways – you don’t get too high when it’s going well and you don’t get too low when it’s going against you.“We’ve looked at it early this week and seen why we weren’t as good as we should have been.“As we have done with everything, we’ve looked at all the details to see what we can do better and to stop that happening again.“We’ll be looking for a reaction on Saturday.”United host the Red Lichties just a fortnight after Dick Campbell’s side dumped them out of the Tunnock’s Caramel Wafer Challenge Cup on penalties.Although United fielded a makesht team that day, defender Reynolds is wary of the quality Arbroath possess and has warned they must be on their game to see them off this time.“Arbroath are a good side, they’re going well and picking up results,” he added.“We saw that first hand in the cup – we still put out a decent enough team and we’ll need to be on our game.“If we turn up and play the way we did on Saturday, we’ll be in trouble. We’ll go away, look at the tapes from the cup game and see what we need to do to beat them.“We’ll re-group and go again. We said at the start, even after winning the first four games on the spin, it’s a long season and it’s a hard league.“People will drop points when you don’t expect it and there’ll be twists and turns. All we can do is focus on ourselves and we’ll focus on the Arbroath game on Saturday. That’s as far as we’ll look.”Former Aberdeen man Reynolds lined up alongside his third central-defensive partner of the league season last weekend as Troy Brown made his debut.And Reynolds admits he is hoping to find a settled relationship with Brown or Calum Butcher while Mark Connolly remains out injured.“You can see there’s a quality player there but, as with anyone that comes in, it’s going to take a bit of time to get used to the way we play and what the manager wants us to do.“I’m sure he’ll get there, he’s settled in well and the more game time he gets the better he will become.“It’s been dficult but, when Butch has come in, we’ve done well. Obviously Troy’s in there now and it’s about trying to get a relationship as quick as we can.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/oor-wullies-inverness.jpg ","title":"more than 300k raised in second oor wullie big bucket trail auction","story":"More than £, has been raised for the Archie Foundation thanks to fans of Scotland’s favourite schoolboy, Oor Wullie.Fty statues went under the hammer at an auction in Thainstone last night, raising an incredible £, was raised at the event.The Oor Wullies up for grabs last night had been based in Aberdeen and Inverness.Oor Wullie BIG Bucket Trail: £, raised for Archie Foundation at Aberdeenshire auction\" src\"https:www.pressandjournal fp news aberdeenshire  oor-wullie-big-bucket-trail--raised-for-archie-foundation-at-aberdeenshire-auction embed # secretuhXHvOb\" data-secret\"uhXHvOb\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"It follows on from the £, raised at auction in Dundee on Monday .The momentum is set to continue with the bidding on the statues based in Edinburgh and Glasgow tomorrow and Friday, respectively."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"podcast twa teams one street dundee seek back to back wins as united aim to bounce back","story":"This week Tele sports reporters Calum Woodger, George Cran and Graeme Finnan askDundee can make it two wins in a row as they travel to Morton and will United come back from defeat at Ayr  Elsewhere, former Tangerines boss Craig Levein is feeling the heat.Call the #Twa Teams, One Street# fan line on   to leave a message for the boys about all things Dundee and United.For iTunes: click hereFor Spoty: click hereOr search #Tele Twa Teams, One Street# in the podcast app of your choice."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/KMil_Bee-005-846x564.jpg ","title":"the first thing i did in the morning was make myself a double vodka and water dundee man turns his life around with the help of community group","story":"“The first thing I did in the morning was make myself a double vodka and water,” said Ian Thomas, speaking of his -year alcohol addiction.“I’d have a few of those for my breakfast.“I would wake up and vomit, have diarrhoea.“I was delirious, tremors, no appetite. I was drinking to knock myself out.”Ian, , of Earn Crescent, said his le was so low he had suicidal thoughts of slitting his wrists and jumping off the Tay Road Bridge.He said: “I kept a diary. I wrote in it every day the amount of times I was sick, bleeding, diarrhoea, then wrote that I just wanted to go to sleep and not wake up.”Ian desperately wanted out of the le of alcoholism but he did not know how he could escape it without dying.He said: “I was hospitalised dozens of times.“I wasn’t the master of my le anymore, alcohol was the master of me, everything I did revolved around it.“I lived in a slum.“There was blood everywhere, spewing everywhere, mouldy drink cans, pee all over the place – I knew it was a slum but I didn’t care.”It got so bad that Ian could not walk or talk and was checked into former psychiatric hospital Sunnyside in Montrose three times for detoxication by his family.But it was only following the third time Ian made the conscious decision to stay sober – a feat he’s managed for  years now.He said: “I’m not proud of myself.“I don’t look at the past, I just take each day at a time.“I tell myself I’m sober today and the rest slowly takes care of itself.”Ian now keeps himself busy with activities such as drawing and creative projects at Just Bee Productions.The community group offers people a safe space to be creative and connect with others at vulnerable times in their lives.Ian said: “Getting involved with Just Bee is one of the best things that’s ever happened to me.“It keeps my mind busy and gives me something positive to focus on and it’s good to be around people again, instead of sitting in the house on my own all day with just my thoughts.”Ian and about  other participants in the group are gearing up to start working on a musical theatre show called This is a Mental Musical.Claire Bee, founder of Just Bee Productions, said: “The show is about mental health and everything that goes along with that.“It’s also about giving people a  to have a voice to say what they want to say.”The show will be performed in Dundee and the group hopes to take it to Edinburgh Fringe Festival next year.Former plays performed by Just Bee include Drink, The Musical which toured community venues in Dundee, including nearby prisons, and another musical called Next Stop Please.Former heroin addict Cheryl Ferguson, , said: “Doing the musicals has helped to build up my confidence, self worth and a feeling that I belong.“It’s opened up opportunities which I wouldn’t have thought were possible and I’ve met loads of brilliant people who are like family now.“I love it. No drugs can give that sort of feeling.“The first time I did it, I came off stage and felt brilliant and it wasn’t brought on by any substance.”"},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

With the world championship they also secured the Champion of Champions accolade for the fourth year in a row.The band#s success has been remarkable since being formed with Inveraray  youngsters just  years ago by current leaders Pipe Major Stuart Liddell and lead drummer Steven McWhirter. The band rose rapidly through the ranks, winning the world title, and many others besides, at every grade in which it competed.Inveraray is now established as the Grade  band to beat and players are attracted from around the world # but regardless of its international make-up, Inveraray still lies at its heart.That fact was clearly in evidence as the reception was crowned by a magical performance by the world champions, enjoyed by all and captured for posterity on the many mobile phones raised to the heavens.Speaking as he presented the quaich, Councillor MacMillan congratulated the band on its success, achieved in a relatively short period of time thanks to the dedication of all concerned.Argyll and Bute MP Brenan O#Hara said the band#s success has been #absolutely remarkable# and quipped that Inveraray#s success had turned him into a #born-again piper#, so inspired has he been.Pipe Major Stuart Liddell, Inveraray born and bred and from a line of superb pipers, said: #I want to thank all band members for their hard work over the past several years, and of course their families who have put up with so much and made sacrices for it to happen # particularly those with young families. It is greatly appreciated.#He added: #Thanks to the town of Inveraray and everyone  who has supported us. We couldn#t have done it without you.#And it was on to a selection of brilliant tunes to entertain the adoring fans clustered around the green.Speaking after the event, Inveraray Community Council convenor Linda Divers said: #Thanks to everyone who came out to show their support to Inveraray and District Pipe Band, and to Councillor Donnie MacMillan for coming along tonight.#The community council would like to thank all helpers as well as the British Legion and the band for the use of their tents.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

This occurs when cats come in contact with chemicals such as fuels, lubricants and some solvents.Usually, self-grooming causes the cat to ingest the toxin, or in some cases they inhale it which can cause a severe pneumonia.The toxin can cause problems throughout the body and on the skin too.When Jonny had examined Tikka, he immediately sent her to our Tranent surgery for blood tests and intravenous fluids as she was dehydrated.Fortunately, Tikkarsquos blood tests were normal so she did not have kidney damage.She tolerated her fluid therapy well and was soon looking much happier however several areas of her skin had become red and she was losing hair especially on her front legs.Tikka did not want to eat or drink. She was given analgesics, antibiotics and soothing cream was applied to her skin.Our nursing staff ensured she was as comfortable as possible and as she was not eating by herself, they fed her via a feeding tube several times a day.Her skin became red and thickened and some areas sloughed off.She had to have cream applied frequently to the damaged skin, just asshe had suffered burns.Tikka was finally well enough to go home where Mrs Taylor continued to treat her skin. Tikka started eating well again and is improving daily. Her fur is regrowing and soon she will have her beautul coat again.Now Mrs Taylor was very vigilant and realised she had to do something to help Tikka immediately.If you suspect your cat may have had contact with petroleum-based substances, please contact your vet as soon as possible.Often the first sign you may have is your pet smells of petrol or diesel.There may be vomiting or diarrhoea. They may actually be dizzy or confused or showing other neurological problems such as staggering and trembling. There may be respiratory signs such as coughing or wheezingthey have inhaled the chemical.Do not try to make your pet vomit as this can exacerbate the toxicity.The first thing you should do is try to remove the chemical from the fur.In many cases, it is best to bring your pet straight to your vets as soon as possible. The nursing staff at veterinary practices are well trained in dealing with intoxication emergencies.With petroleum products there are three main areas where the body can be affected: l The internal organs especially the kidneys, so your vet will want to blood sample your pet to check for any damage to the kidneys or other organsl The respiratory system can be affected especiallythe toxin is inhaled. This often happensthe patient vomits then inhales some resulting in a very severe pneumonia. Your vet may wish to take x-rays to check for this.l The animalrsquos skin can also be affected. The petroleum products sit on the fur then soaks through to the skin where they are held in contact by the fur. This causes them to act as a caustic substance, damaging the skin and hair follicles. Often the first sign before the skin damage is seen is hair loss due to the follicle damage.The treatment for these causes is supportive at all times. There are no specic antidotes. Intravenous fluids are administered, this helps overcome dehydration and helps eliminate toxins from the body.Analgesics are given to help keep pain from damaged skin and internal organs to a minimum.Antibiotics are given, as damaged skin is very prone to secondary infection and they are always givenpneumonia is present. Skin treatment has to be intense to keep infection to a minimum and encourage damaged skin to recover.Thankfully Tikka has made an excellent recovery, thanks to Mrs Taylorrsquos quick thinking and the intense nursing care given by the nursing team at Dunedin Vets."},{"url":null,"title":"tim-39-s-tales-magic-real-39-s-around-us","story":"Of course, in stories magic is very real a frog or beast can transform into a prince, dragons and witches can fly, animals can talk, wishes can be granted by faeries and spells cast by wizards.

Itrsquos just that we have stopped noticing the magic that is real.In our world, a frog may not turn into a prince with a kiss, but a caterpillar turns into a butterfly, a tadpole into a frog.And such magic is all around us. Leaves change colour with the seasons, magic transformation is everywhere. Animals do talk, any dog lover will tell us that.Have you ever seen a hare and made eye contact and felt the connection or watched a squirrel hide nuts, and then come up to you asking for more Walk in a wood, or by a riverbank, or just sit in your garden or a park and the magic is all around you. We watched wood pigeons nest in a small elder tree outside our front window over the summer. Two eggs hatched and we watched as they were fed and finally flew the nest. It was, truly, magic.The magic all around us is still vast, and we could all make our own list the sound of birdsong, watching a butterfly flutter, a spiderrsquos web decorated with dew, the glimpse of a deer in a wood, the mist wrapped mountains, a red sparkling cloud during sunset, a wee beastie under a rock as it scampers for cover, the whisper of an ancient tree and the sweet smell of a wood.But I believe that sadly too many of us donrsquot notice real magic anymore.And when we donrsquot notice something we donrsquot feel connected to it, so we donrsquot care about it. And when we donrsquot care about it we donrsquot protect or value it.And when we donrsquot value it, we canrsquot feel the wonder and sense of awe it creates. And so we trash it, ignore and neglect it, exploit it. And we forget we are part of this magic that we are sons and daughters of nature too. And so we disconnect ourselves from what can truly make us feel happy, and instead drug ourselves with the articial magic of our own technology which makes us feel all powerful.But the truth is we are not.Ultimately we rely on the natural environment for our physical and emotional well-being, as much as the creatures we are making extinct.We need nature, it doesnrsquot need us, and eventually it is in control. Asto make this point huge waves hit the rocks of Prestonpans in a storm not so long ago, drenching the nearby houses in a display of naturersquos power. It was scary but also spectacular.In  such a storm was believed to have been the result of magic conjured by the ldquoNorth Berwick Witches.That storm, like the recent one, was indeed magic, conjured by nature, which can whip up a whirlwind more effectively than any wizard or witch.Magic is real.

For instance, much to the great surprise of public opinion, David Cameron won a majority at the  election. This allowed him to hold the in out EU referendum the following year, and as a result of this the UK will shortly leave the EU. However, not only was the EU vote determined by four per cent of the votes cast, but Mr Cameron won his majority in the  election with . per cent of the vote. Yet when the SNP won a majority of seats in Scotland in  with . per cent of the votewe were told this represented a setback to the independence cause.For instance, the Liberal Democrats have chided the country for a year about a ldquoPeoplersquos Vote but now consider this unnecessary ndash a general election success would be enough. However, Mr Smith refers positively to a suggestion that independence should as a matter of course be confirmed in two successive referenda. ldquoSuccess has become malleable, what the speakerrsquos interests need it to be.But, for the Unionist side, all obstacles increasingly lead to independence.

As Nick Clegg could remind him, campaign promises can come back to bite political parties. Sir Nick \"promised\" not to increase university tuition fees. He did. Better Together \"promised\" that voting No would secure Scotlandrsquos place in Europe. It didnrsquot. The SNPrsquos promise in its  Holyrood manesto was conditional: the Scottish Government should have the right to hold a democratic event \" there is a signicant and material change in the circumstanceshellip such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will\". Dragging Scotland out of the EU defies the  percent who voted to remain. No democrat should deny Holyrood the means of honouring such a clear vote.: A pro-independence majority at Holyrood is not a mandate for another referendumSimply setting aside the EU referendum result might be the LibDems latest style but Mr Rennie would do better to observe the Edinburgh Agreementrsquos aspirations for the referendum. Its terms sought a process that \"should deliver a fair test and a decisive expression of the views of people in Scotland and a result that everyone will respect\". The  loss of the referendum was followed by an unprecedented SNP landslide in  SNP majority of seats in  and  an overwhelming SNP majority in rsquos EU election. These indicators, plus opinion poll increases in support for both independence and a second ballot, suggest that the people of Scotland ndash to whom politicians are accountable ndash appear increasingly minded not to respect the result from . If the single expectation was that the result would command respect there was no indication that that respect would be mandatory. The \"settled will\" of . percent in Scotland who voted to reconvene the Scottish Parliament has been respected the No vote settled nothing.Before Mr Rennie boxes himself into a \"no deal\" position he should reflect on Scottish historical intellectual flexibility. Hugh MacDiarmid observed that the \"constant effort\" of Patrick Geddes was \"to help people to think for themselves, and to think round the whole circle, not in scraps and bits\". Scotlandrsquos independent future maps onto that \"whole circle\" of which collaborative, broad and cross-community consensus will form part. As MacDiarmid observed of Geddes \"he knew that watertight compartments are useful only to a sinking ship\".

The narrative is one of uneasiness, simmering anger, growing distrust, and a sense that, as things stand, wersquod probably be best going our own separate ways before it gets worse.That three-word hashtag is in essence the public expression of a signicant slice of popular opinion. A vocal group in one part of the union - England - is telling an entire other part of the union - Scotland - to sling its hook in no uncertain terms. England is sick of Scotland, and the Scots are no longer wanted.

UK-wide surveys show widespread support for a second independence referendum and a poll on a united Ireland. When Donrsquot Knows are removed,  per cent favour a second Scottish independence ballot, and  per cent support a vote on Irish unity.

Back then, the EU was certainly not on the side of independence. Scotland was told by Spanish premier Mariano Rajoy that the country ldquowould remain outside the European Unionit voted for independence.

If you are anything like me then you might be pretty angry. Sadly, that is the reality for many older people across Scotland on low and fixed incomes whose only convenient option for withdrawing cash is from a fee charging machine. This is all too common in areas of deprivation and rural Scotland. For some it is the dference between eating for  days or .The pace of banking change in Scotland and across the UK has been staggering with a concerted push towards digital, cashless and app based personal finances. The result has meant that, on large, the trend has been away from cash as those who are willing, able and technically savvy embrace this.But for the , pensioners in Scotland living in poverty, the many thousands more just above this threshold, the half million over s who do not use the internet, those with disabilities or have a cognitive impairment it is not that easy.If you are over the age of , you are much more likely to be targeted for scams, so itrsquos important that the option for a face-to-face conversation about their finances is available. Indeed, banks should be future proofing their facilities such as branches and cash machines ensuring theyrsquore age and dementia friendly in order to not alienate our ageing population.There are signicant parts of Scotland where cash is king. Not least in the rural economy where the only option for people to withdraw cash is through a fee charging cash machine. There have also been well documented examples of free cash machines in the Highlands, where it is the last machine in town, running dry during the peak tourist season.Poor mobility and a lack of public transport can make it even harder for older people. Many are left with no choice but to pay extortionate fees of up to pound. for pay-to-use cash machines. This will have the biggest impact on those who can least afford it and donrsquot have the option of driving to the nearest free machine.With the equivalent of  free to use cash machines disappearing from Scottish communities each month it can feel that we are being bounced into accepting the switch away from cash.But it is not just cash machine access which is vanishing. Bank branches have been closing at alarming rate throughout Scotland despite repeated complaints from customers, politicians, and organisations such as Age Scotland. For context, wersquore talking about nearly , branches being closed across the UK over the last  years.

The only problem was that she lived in rural Perthshire and the closest one involved a journey of almost two hours on two dferent buses!Bank closures coupled with the removal of free to use cash machines will see older peoplersquos choice severely limited as to how they choose to manage their finances. We know that many older people, particularly those on low and fixed incomes prefer to use cash as a means of effective budgeting. Restricting their ability to access cash, not to mention free access, is having a negative impact on their day to day lives.There are towns in Scotland where there are no banks whatsoever. Lochgelly in Fe is one. Dornoch in the Highlands another. It is likely that this will keep happening, creating banking deserts unless action is taken.This is why, just last month, Age Scotland joined calls from the House of Commonsrsquo Scottish Affairs Committee and others to seek a commitment from banks that they will not close the last bank in town. If that is not forthcoming then the option of legislation to stop them doing so could become a very real prospect.One solution to prevent these banking deserts could very well be an idea Age Scotland, and some politicians, have been promoting. Joint bank branches, or a shared banking hub, would see banks sharing a physical space to keep a high street or community presence. This would mean that people can interact with staff face-to-face, discuss their banking needs and find out more about improving their financial health.The idea of Shared Banking Hubs in smaller communities where there is less footfall is gaining support from older people and politicians. Most recently the UK Parliamentrsquos Treasury Committee recommended that shared Bank Branch facilities should be considered in their inquiry on Consumersrsquo access to financial services.We have also had discussions with one bank who are interested in the idea, but it still requires others to join in and trial this.We are not against the proleration of convenient digital banking options. It works brilliantly for many older people who have access to technology and choose to do so, but we cannot just brush aside the needs of those it does not suit.Itrsquos not progress when the poorest and most vulnerable are left behind, which is exactly what is happening and why organisations like Age Scotland will campaign relentlessly to ensure that no one is financially

But since that politician is her, between  and now, I imagine she can.Even so, her partyrsquos current position may, in political terms, be their best bet since, despite the previous range of opinion in both parties, the Conservatives under Boris Johnson are the party of Brexit come hell or high water while Labour under Jeremy Corbyn have become, well, frankly, anyonersquos guess.Indeed, itrsquos mystying that the Lib Dems have not hoovered up more of the remain vote which was, after all,  per cent of the result. Yet polling has them at about  per cent . Being the Stop Brexit Party may be neither liberal nor democratic and, despite the impression given by Holyrood, Westminster, social and mainstream media, may even still be a minority view, but itrsquos certainly the one that ought to maximise the Lib Dem vote.The principal argument against it is that it wonrsquot happen, or as Niall Hodson, a brave dissenting delegate at the party conference, put it, lead to the Lib Dems ldquopromising something and doing something .The reason is that there is no prospect that the party will be the largest one at the next election, and Ms Swinson has already ruled out a coalition with either the Tories or Labour ndash something that this particular policy would, in any case, make extremely dficult.Itrsquos also an interesting inversion of the partyrsquos position in relation to the SNP, which criticised the Lib Dems for arguing against a second independence referendum, eventhe Nationalists geta majority of Scottish seats.Interesting because it seems reasonable to claim that, were the Lib Dems to win a majority of UK seats, that would look like a mandate to halt Brexit, while itrsquos highly contentious to claim that an SNP majority at either Holyrood or in Scottish Westminster seats automatically indicates a preference for independence, or even a second go at a referendum. Thatrsquos because the SNP are Scotlandrsquos Lib Dems.Of course, both parties have their true believers, who wholeheartedly support their respective policies. You can tell thatrsquos true, because they do so even when the policies are the polar opposite of what they were a decade ago. But both also attract support from people who canrsquot bring themselves to vote Conservative or Labour at any given moment. Particularly because lots of people who formerly supported one of the two largest parties wonrsquot, in any circumstances, vote for the other. Naturally, that goes double for defecting MPs, who almost all, Tory or Labour, discover theyrsquove secretly been Liberal Democrats all along.But the electoral arithmetic translates the SNP voteinto majorities and real power. It doesnrsquot do the same for the Lib Dems ndash one reason why they are, reasonably enough, obsessed by the mechanics of the electoral system ndash except in by-elections, where they are famously dirty and successful campaigners.In Scotland, the anti-Brexitvote is SNP, unless the other Union is an even greater priority. But itrsquos not clear where the Lib Dems can make major gains in England and Wales, even though there should, one would think, be loads of people bursting to vote for them. Many key swing seats are straight Tory Labour marginals, while the traditional Lib Dem heartland of the South West of England is, oddly enough, a Leave-voting area.Voters who want above all to stop Brexit will, and indeed probably should, vote Lib Dem. In England, it may be their only option. If they believe in other Lib Dem policies, or at least prefer them to Tory and Labour ones, thatrsquos a bonus. ButBrexit is halted or reversed, it wonrsquot be by a Lib Dem government, because there isnrsquot going to be one."},{"url":null,"title":"papers-let-bbc-crew-film-herald-newsroom","story":"ldquoItrsquos great publicity. ldquoWorked brilliantly for us.ldquoYour readers will love the insight.When viewers, media commentators, family and friends tune in tonight, I would be surprisedtheir reactions donrsquot match those already offered pre-screening.After all, it is not every day you open up your newsroom to a rival media organisation and put your trust in them. And trust, in this world of fake news, is at the heart of The Herald brand and one of the main reasons we chose to do this.You trust us to deliver the news impartially, with honesty and integrity. The documentary is a quality production, like all our titles, and provides unique analysis, insight and opinionndash the cornerstones of The Heraldrsquos daily coverage.So, just as we strive to deliver in print and online on a daily basis, the TV show strips bare the gloss and spin and reveals the realities of the challenges we face.: Spotlight falls on Herald in new documentaryUnderpinning all this is our passionate, professional and dedicated team doing a superb job, in often dficult circumstances, to deliver quality coverage across news, politics, business, sport andthe arts.Welcome to The Herald, warts and all.TV fame and stardom beckonsThe media world was abuzz withchat about the imminent launch of two new Sunday titles, The Herald on Sunday and Sunday National when Maurice Smith of TVI Vision got in touch seeking to produce a documentary about the newspaper industry and The Heraldin particular. The timing could not have been better.We were days away from implementing a strategic decision to extend both The Herald and sister title The National across seven days. For The Herald brand, there had been confusion in the market place, including online, over an apolitical editorial stance Monday to Saturday and a left-wing, independence supporting Sunday Herald.The National championed an independent Scotland and catered for a market committed to that cause, but did not have a Sunday offering. Readers turned instead to The Sunday Herald but many Monday to Saturday Herald readers were alienated by The Sunday Heraldrsquos political stance. That impacted on sales and our online audiences.The solution was to rebrand The Sunday Herald and launch a Sunday National to cater for an independence-supporting audience seven days, and to produce a Herald on Sunday fully aligned with the political stance and values of Monday to Saturdayrsquos Herald.A unique marketing opportunity beckoned.A Bafta winner I had a positive response to allowing the cameras in when, as Editor of The Sunday Post, we celebrated its centenary, and the experience of others in the spotlight, such as Glasgow Central Station and Edinburgh Airport, shows that providing the public with a unique insight helps provide a welcome understanding of our roles, responsibilities and challenges.However, it was important for our brands, The Herald, Evening Times and The National, to ensure that the production company had a track record of excellent work.Documentary producer director Sarah Howitt made the first series of ldquoScotlandrsquos Superhospital ndash following the move to the new hospital and more recently The Force: The Story of Scotlandrsquos police, which was nominated for a Scottish Bafta for Best Factual Series and for a Royal Television Society award for the same.Maurice and Sarah first worked together in  on a documentary entitled The Bridge: Fty Years Across The Forth, which won the Bafta Scotland best single documentary in . They also collaborated on The Town That Thread Built and Six Weeks To Save The World.Importantly, it was commissioned for the BBC, where context and impartiality are regarded as critical. Again, in the same way, we ask our public to trust our journalists to be fair and balanced, there is an expectation of the same from the BBC.So in rolled the camerashellip but for much longer than expected. More of that later.: Jeane Freeman announces public inquiry into building flaws at QEUH and Edinburgh Sick KidsTrust, credibility andfake newsSadly, despite our remarkable -year history, The Herald is not immune from the same criticism levelled at all mediandashthat we produce fake news, suppress and distort the truth. We are the worldrsquos longest-running national newspaper, but that counts for little amongst the online trolls who only want an echo chamber fort views.Our critics often use it as to beat us with. What better opportunity to show our integrity, balance, fairness and lack of bias.In addition, like most journalists, nothing irritates me more than seeing our profession and industry portrayed in dramas, soap and films as insensitive, intrusive and reckless with the truth.I am sure when you sit down to enjoy the shows you will see professional, dedicated and caring staff interested only in their audiences quality journalism.The Herald is staunchly apolitical. Importantly, audiences will see how wrong accusations of any political bias are. We represent all views and have brilliant columnists ndash given complete freedom to express their opinions.Insight and understandingThe news industry is challenged by growing digital consumption and declining print readership. We reach record overall audiences and are getting ever closer to the point where digital revenues and growing commercial partnerships exceed the more traditional revenue s in print. As we make that seismic transition, we need to manage our costs to allow us to continue to invest in the multi-media offering that will protect our long-term futureQuality journalism, be it in print or online, is expensive. Balancing that equation means streamlining processes, increasing efficiencies, structural changes and dficult conversations. The cameras were there to capture it all ndash painful though it was.Almost every industry has its own challenges and as journalists, we report without fear or favour. For viewers to have trust in us and our brand to have credibility it was important to be open and honest. Our readers will have a better insight and understanding of the complexities and dficulties of delivering quality content across many s and see that our commitment remains as strong as ever.Brexit madnessThe documentary features our comprehensive coverage of Brexit, free of any partisan agenda, and delivered for a Scottish audience. It shows our specialist teams at Holyrood and Westminster providing insight and analysis amid the chaos and confusion.It was to be a three-month period where we had to mind our language as the cameras covered the build-up to the UKrsquos exit from the EU.

nationrsquos countryside, often leaving victims with hundreds, sometimes thousands, of bites.And now scientists have discovered that the pesky beasties are actually carrying scores of diseases we never knew about.For the first time, researchers have looked at the total collection of viruses midges carry and discovered some interesting results.: Further loan deal helps to pay poundm Glasgow equal pay dealThe team, from the Medical Research Council and University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research , discovered several new viruses in the \"virome\" of the midges, including an alphanodavirus, two rhabdo-like viruses and a chuvirus.Some of the viruses can prove deadly to animals such as pigs and herons, but the scientists say there is no evidence that they pose a threat to humans.Sejal Modha, lead author of the study, published in the journal Viruses, said: \"The technology we used allowed us to look at the viruses carried by midges in a way that canrsquot be done in the lab, expanding our knowledge of the insect viruses in a way that could be very useful in future.\"What we found is important because biting midges can be carriers of arboviruses and although midges are not currently a public health concern in Scotland - and we stress there is nothing for the public to be concerned about - our research gives us a better understanding of midges and the viruses they may carry, helping us prepare for any possible future emerging risks through improved surveillance and knowledge.\"The midge Culicoides impunctatus breeds in vast numbers across large swathes of Scotland, and feasts on blood.Usually emerging at dawn or dusk, they come out in force, leaving their human victims itching for days.However, despite their prevalence in Scotland, midges are currently understudied.Carriers of arboviruses, viral infections transmitted to humans from a group of insects, midges were responsible for the emergence and spread of Schmallenberg virus , which affected cattle, sheep and goats in Europe in , and are likely to be involved in the emergence of other arboviruses in Europe.: Prisoners get the chance to worship relics of lsquolittle flowerrsquo saintThere are at least  dferent species of biting midge described in the UK, of which  are present in Scotland.The midges studied were collected at the University of Glasgowrsquos Scottish Centre for Ecology and the Natural Environment , located within the Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park.Joseph Hughes, co-author of the study, claimed there are likely to be many more undiscovered insect viruses across the world.He said: ldquoWhat we found is the tip of the iceberg in terms of discovering new viruses.ldquoWith an estimated . million insect species on Earth, there are likely to be several million more insect viruses to be discovered.\"What we are seeing globally, due to several factors including climate change, is the movement of virus vectors -- or carriers -- to new regions.\"Our research is important because the emergence of SBV in Europe, which is transmitted by biting midges, and the incursion of multiple strains of bluetongue virus into Europe, means we need to understand more about the ersity of viruses carried by biting midges.\"By increasing our understanding, we can hopefully be better prepared for viruses that may emerge in the midge population in future.\"In recent years, Scots have been warned of growing numbers of midges, with last year described as the ldquoworst year ever.They arrive late in the season sue to severe snow storms, but experts said rising temperatures later in the year had brought out the highest levels ever recorded.Midges typically begin to emerge during the end of May, and in June the female biting midges arrive

Itrsquos certainly an excellent start, but the electricity still has to come from somewhere, and the charging choices that consumers make will affect the environmental impact of their vehicles.

Essentially, cars can be plugged in, and will then be automatically charged at the most cost-efficient and grid-efficient times.Smart meters can also unlock smart time-of-use tarfs that reward EV owners who use energy at off-peak times.Unlike standard electricity tarfs, where the same rate is paid at all times, a smart tarf works in conjunction with a smart meter to supply electricity at dferent prices, depending upon the time of day. This could mean that people could take advantage of cheaper electricity overnight, when demand is low, which is very beneficial for electric car drivers.Smart meters are a vital investment in the energy infrastructure of Scotland, England and Wales, delivering benefits beyond personal energy savings.And with over  million already installed across Great Britain, many consumers are already playing their part in helping to create a more sustainable energy system for the future.This article was paid for by Smart Energy GB.

All energy consumers pay for the cost of investment in new network capacity so the regulator ensures that it obtains the best deal possible for them.Ofgem launched a consultation in December last year on proposed changes to SSEN’s plan in an effort to ensure value for money for consumers.Following consideration of consultation responses and further analysis, the regulator has decided to approve the plan subject to the conditions set out in its decision.Approval is conditional on a total of at least MW of new wind farm projects on Orkney either being awarded a Contract for Dferenceor being judged likely to be developed by December .Ofgem would expect to be satisfied that new wind farm projects are likely to be developed despite not being awarded a CfDan independent audit states that the project is financially viable, has signed a relevant grid connection agreement and has been granted planning permission.However, SSEN has stated disappointment that the regulator is maintaining its position that the MW of new renewable electricity generation needs to secure planning permission and demonstrate financial viability prior to granting approval for the construction of the link.Ofgem has extended the date in which developers need to meet these conditions from December  to December . SSEN has said this means, in turn, that the construction of the transmission link may be delayed for at least a two-year period,the full time is required to secure the MW target, or shorterthe need is met at an earlier stage.SSEN’s Transmission and Distribution businesses now intend to consult with Orkney developers and other stakeholders to help establish the optimal #whole system# solution in an effort to make the most of Orkney’s renewable potential.Talking about Ofgem#s decision, Rob McDonald, managing director for transmission with SSEN, said: “Whilst we are clearly disappointed with today’s decision, our commitment to work with Orkney developers and other stakeholders to unlock Orkney’s vast renewable potential has not changed.“With both the UK and Scottish Government committed to net zero emissions, we firmly believe Orkney and Scotland’s other two major island groups will have a key role to play in the fight to prevent the worst effects of climate change.“We now look forward to working with developers and other stakeholders on Orkney to collectively explore the best way forward to unlock Orkney’s renewable potential.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Concepts that we now treat as universal, and take for granted, such as the essential dignity of le, innate human rights, and the need to care for others less fortunate than ourselves, are widely held only because they derive from Christian teaching.Despite the sophistication of their societies, and their interest in philosophy, the ancient Greeks and Romans had no belief in notions such as equality under the law. These were, after all, civilisations built on conquest and slavery. It was only with the coming of Christianity that attitudes started to change.When the Apostle Paul wrote to the Galatians, “There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus”, this was a revolutionary statement of Earth-shattering proportions. Never before had the world heard a message that everyone was to be treated equally never before had any religion been open to all, regardless of race, sex, or place in society.: Ruth Davidson: I was ‘hopelessly conflicted’ as Scots Tory leaderFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereValues that we hold in common today, whether Christian or not, such as the need to care for the less fortunate, to “love our neighbour as ourselves”, derive directly from Christ’s teachings and Paul’s letters. Along with this goes a warning against excess, a need for sobriety and self-control.Paul wrote to the citizens of Philippi: “Let your moderation be known unto all men.” This particular thought is not necessarily a Christian one. The saying “Observe due measure moderation is best in all things” is attributed to the Greek poet Hesiod from around BC. But whether its roots are Greek or Christian, it is a sentiment as relevant today as it was centuries ago.We are in an era when it looks asthe common ground in politics is being deserted. Everywhere we see a drive to extremes, with a rise in identity politics. Increasingly voters are in camps, either Leavers or Remainers, unionists or nationalists, left or right, with little space for subtlety in between. It is the easiest thing in the world for a politician to plant a flag and say “Here I stand, no surrender!” to dismiss, even ignore, the arguments of others and to refuse to countenance any compromise. This unwillingness to bend, to show grace, and to see the other argument, blights our politics and ides our society.: Brexit: It’s time to stop this dangerous madness now – Christine Jardine: How Supreme Court judgement on suspension of parliament could undermine the UK – Ian SwansonHistory recognises as truly great figures not those who dug themselves into trenches, but those who were prepared to reach out across the ides. Whether it is figures like Nelson Mandela, David Trimble or even Martin McGuinness, leaders who were prepared to climb down from the barricades and extend the hand of friendship to those who were once bitter enemies are types of the role models that we need today.This is not a plea for the abandonment of principle or strongly held positions which are supported by evidence. Rather it is a recognition that the greatest advances we make as society are achieved when we are at least prepared to consider the other point of view.In , Winston Churchill, then Secretary of State for War and Air, warned of the consequences of the punitive terms in the Treaty of Versailles, which imposed enormous reparations on the defeated Germans. Advocating a policy of reconciliation, he argued that a harsh approach would simply increase the fear and hatred between France and Germany, and would lead to another war.We know today that Churchill was correct. The rise of Hitler could be directly attributed to the treatment of the German nation by the victorious Allies. The history of the th century might well have been very dferent, and much tragedy avoided, had the winners adopted a spirit of forgiveness.A century later, our challenges are very dferent from those of that time, and yet in our febrile debates around Brexit we see something of the spirit of : a digging of trenches, a placing of blame, and a refusal to find common ground.We have had the Prime Minister withdrawing the Conservative whip from  MPs who refused to back his line, and we have had a Liberal Democrat Leader, Jo Swinson, saying that the former Prime Minister David Cameron can never be forgiven for calling a Brexit referendum, despite that having been a Liberal Democrat policy for years. That spirit, on all sides, will not help us find a way forward.It does now look like the Government is very serious, even at this late hour, about finding a new deal with the EU to deliver an orderly Brexit. I sincerely hope that it will be successful. But whatever the terms of any deal, for some it won’t be enough. Those looking to see some political advantage, more interested in promoting conflict than finding common ground, will denounce any deal as imperfect. Words such as ‘traitor’, ‘Quisling’, and ‘collaborator’ will be thrown around.I hope that politicians on all sides will see the need for compromise. The country is heartily sick of the Brexit debate, not least because of the manner in which it has consumed the energy of the entire political class, leaving so little space for other more vital issues to be addressed.We need a new spirit of moderation, of generosity, and of putting the national interest and unity before narrow political considerations, because the alternative is yet more bitterness and ision. Whether Christian or not, our citizens deserve it of their leaders.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"victorian plan for scotland northern ireland bridge may have been a wild ride leader comment","story":"Boris Johnson#s plan for a bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland was suggested as long ago as , although passengers on the proposed submerged tubular bridge would have had to be made of stern stuff.The judgement of history upon the Victorians has not been kind.

This would be completed over the next two or three months, he said.On the issue of smell, the two sources are from the -metre chimney and from the hatches of the fish meal boats.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree.

Gareth’s identity was revealed in a News Letter article and the story was picked up by This Morning who invited him and his we Kirsty to appear on the show this morning.Lea also appeared on the show along with her sister Shannon and niece Akeelah, who slept soundly throughout the interview. Gareth Bronte on This MorningIt was to be the first time the family had met Gareth and his we Kirsty in the flesh.It made for an emotional segment on the show as presenters Phil Scholfield and Holly Willoughby introduced the story which was captioned ‘A Random ‘Slice’ Of Birthday Kindness’. Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces. Their baby girl lost her brave fight for le after eight days in ICU.Gareth told the show: “In the lead up to what would have been Hannah’s birthday my we and I wanted to do something to mark it. Our little boy Caleb, who is four, came up with the idea of letting a helium balloon go so that it would make its way up to heaven. That was something we had planned.“I’d said to Kirsty I wanted to do something dferent, maybe a little random act of kindness to share a little joy.

We were contacted by the show on Sunday and the next morning we were on the This Morning sofa.“We had so much more we wanted to say but it was tight for time but so nice to continue to be able to talk about Hannah. It was lovely to meet Akeelah, Lea and Shannon too.”Last week Gareth and Kirsty presented a cheque to the neo-natal unit for £,. raised during a series of K walks the couple did in May in memory of Hannah."},{"url":null,"title":"neighbourhood sergeants to return says dup","story":"Moves toneighbourhood sergeants to Lurgan, Banbridge and Lagan River have been welcomed.DUP MLA Carla Lockhart along side Cllr Paul Greenfield and Cllr Junior McCrum have been liaising with senior police officials over the past number of years regarding the need for aof the neighbourhood policing team to the three areas.She pointed out that corporately it was the intention of the previous senior team to reduce the number of neighbourhood sergeants owing to diminishing funds “but recent happenings have highlighted clearly the benefits and the need for a local team engaging and policing the area”.In a joint statement the three DUP representatives said: “We are delighted with the confirmation that neighbourhood sergeants will take up permanent position again in Banbridge, Lurgan and Lagan River.“For too long these areas have operated dferently to that of Portadown and Craigavon.“This will align them all to the effective neighbourhood policing model that previously worked. The announcement of the new appointments was made at the monthly Policing and Community Partnership meeting. “The new Chief Constable is focused on this style of policing and Ms McAllister who is the District Commander has been proactive in adhering to this corporate change in policy.

Bangladesh finally won its freedom from East Pakistan in  after a bloody, -month war of independence which left up to three million dead.Of late the developing country has been in the headlines for providing shelter to , Rohingya who have fled persecution in neighbouring Myanmar.“Coláiste Feirste was honoured to welcome the Bangladeshi delegation,” said Seán Mistéil. “Minister Chowdhuryexplained the importance of mother languages to nation building and economic well-being. That resonated powerfully with our students.”Minister Chowdhury toured the site of the Gaeltacht Quarter’s next development project: a triangle of disused land which represents one of the last building sites fronting the Falls Road.“We have bold plans to transform this triangle of land into a Gaeltacht housing and tourism project,” added the Coláiste Feirste Chairman. “This vibrant and visionary social development initiative will promote the collective economic capacity of the wider Spórtlann na hÉireann and Coláiste Feirste site. We believe that maximising this hub of interdependent and unique elements is best achieved through a one site vision that connects all of its parts. We have this coordinating vision in place and it has enterprise and exchange at its heart. It is infused with environmental and economic promise and includes a wealth of cultural, sporting and human potential.”The visit of the Bangladeshi delegation was hosted by London-based Study Circle and facilitated by the growing Bangladeshi population of Belfast."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"bone man at key palestine hearing","story":"A BONE man is in the Hague this week as an international observer at a historic hearing on the Palestine-Israeli conflict.Eddie Whyte, who has lived in Norway for over thirty years, is also a member of the Palestine Justice Campaign.Eddie attended the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands as the case got underway yesterday .The case has been brought by Dutch citizen Ismail Ziada against the former Chief of General Staff of the Israeli Defence Force , Benny Gantz, and former Commander of the IDF Air Force, Amir Eshel, over the bombing of the Ziada family home in Gaza.The attack in July  killed six family members from three generations of the Ziada family, including Ismail’s -year-old mother, three brothers, his sister-in-law, a -year-old nephew and a visiting friend. Mr Ziada, who is of Palestinian origin, contends that the attack on the family home was a violation of international humanitarian law and constituted a gross violation of internationally recognised human rights principles.Mr Gantz and Mr Eshel claim immunity from the Dutch court and contend that Mr Ziada should have presented his claim in an Israeli court. Mr Gantz is running for office against Benjamin Netanyahu in the Israeli national elections this week.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Eddie said: “The case is historical in that it is the first time a Palestinian has been able to make use of civil litigation on the basis of universal jurisdiction to gain access to justice for war crimes.“The pursuance of the case has been made possible by an online crowdfunder which received widespread support in Ireland from iniduals, trade unions and human rights organisations and prominent people like Senator Frances Black, award-winning filmmaker Seán Murray and musician Mick Blake.

In truth, the margin of defeat flattered St John’s who, for the second game running, failed to fire.They got out of jail at the weekend when an injury-time Pearse Donnelly goal almost plundered an unlikely victory before Conal Delargy kicked the equaliser. The general consensus was that Casements had missed the boat and that the Johnnies would win the replay, but Portglenone boss Barry Dillon said he knew his players could better Sunday’s performance. “We sat back too deep on Sunday, it was our own fault,” said Dillon. “Maybe the fear of winning made them a bit apprehensive, but we knew we had more in us. “In the first half of the drawn game, we showed we are the better team and we had that belief coming into this game that we could go and finish it.” While Portglenone fielded an unchanged team from Sunday’s drawn game, St John’s started Domhnall Nugent, Brian ‘Bam’ Neeson and Sunday’s goal-scorer Donnelly. Yet, as was the case on Sunday, it was Casements who made the brighter start with a hat-trick of frees from Conal Delargy and Ronan Kellyhelping them establish a - to no score lead after a cagey opening  minutes. It took the Johnnies  minutes to open their account following a well-worked move finished by Matthew Fitzpatrick, but Paddy Kelly responded in kind for Portglenone minutes later. Peter McCallin got his side’s second score on  minutes with St John’s struggling to break down a well-organised Portglenone defence. The Whiterock Road men then lost Donnelly to a black card and Delargy converted another free to move his side - to - ahead. When Kieron McKenna added another from play, Portglenone looked in a strong position approaching half-time and a Paddy McBride free with the last kick of the half was badly needed by the under-par West Belfast outfit. The second half was just four minutes old when Portglenone cut a dash through the heart of the St John’s defence to score a brilliant goal with full-forward Michael Donnelly firing past Padraig Nugent. Less than a minute later, St John’s hit back with a goal of their own. Having been off-target with a few efforts from frees,Neeson’s fortunes changed when an attempt at a point dipped under the crossbar and beyond the reach of Portglenone goalkeeper Ryan O’Neill. That should have been the catalyst for St John’s to kick on, but instead it was Portglenone who regained control of proceedings as another Delargy score moved them four clear once more. St John’s continued to squander chances at the other end with Neesonand Fitzpatrick firing wide of the posts. McBride converted a free before Dermot McAleese broke forward to score for Casements. Ryan McNulty landed a stunning point from play with  minutes of normal time remaining, yet their hopes of another rousing comeback were dented when they lost centre-forward Conal Kelly to a second booking. McBride briefly reduced the gap to two points while Nugent was forced to make a great save to deny Niall McKeever at the other end. Michael Kelly scored an excellent point moments after his introduction for Portglenone and a Ronan Kelly free gave them a four-point cushion approaching full-time. Rather than sit back and defend their lead as they did last Sunday, Dillon’s men went for the jugular and further points from McKeever and midfielder Fergal O’Kane put them six clear. There was one last surge from St John’s with Michael Bradley’s sideline being fisted into the net by Fitzpatrick deep into stoppage time and the Antrim star had a second goal-bound shot blocked with the final play of the game. Yet Portglenone were the better team over the two games and they progress to a semi-final meeting with Lámh Dhearg on Saturday, September  at Creggan.

Two of the leaders at the time Orla Nic Shíomóin and Orla Nig Fhearraigh thought I could sing and had a lovely voice. They approached my dad and askedit was okay for me to sing in the Scór na nÓg. I’ve been singing every year since.”Méabh spoke of how the club’s Cultural Officer, Ronan McHugh “asked me to come back last year to teach the kids how to sing the anthem”. “That is the thing about our club, the kids that attend the summer schemes, and there are now three running, end up coaching younger kids coming through which is fantastic,especially the U- girls.”“I then started singing the national anthem at club events such as juvenile and senior dinners. “Antrim Cultural Officer Bronagh Lennon asked my dadI could sing at some championship games and then onto County Antrim league games. Bronagh has been a great influence and mentor, not only to me but to other kids in the county with her encouragement.”Méabh’s extremely proud dad Joe said all the family will be travelling down to Dublin to support her on Sunday.“There is a big festival on at the club on Sunday and the game will be on in the club after that. We are just so proud.”The Blessed Trinity College student has always had a passion for the performing arts and has performed lead roles in New Lodge Arts High School Musical and Belfast Musical Drama Society’s Hairspray. Following her momentous pitch debut at the Jones’ Road stadium on Sunday, Méabh will be straight into rehearsals for her school’s production of Beauty and the Beast of which she will perform the role of Belle. “I sang the national anthem in front of the Artane Band at Clones, that was a huge honour and an amazing day so imagine what it was like when my dad broke the news to me that I had been invited to sing our national anthem in Croke Park in front of an estimated , people. I’m just so excited.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"one womans journey of discovery on lyric stage","story":"HOUSE lights dim, stage lights up and our scene is set. Gingham tablecloth, matching curtains, egg and chips on the hob and Tara Lynne O’Neill’s Shirley Valentine invites us into her kitchen.Willy Russell’s iconic play, later a film, has been relocated from s Liverpool to Belfast in this winning new production by Patrick J O’Reilly – the artistic director of Tinderbox Theatre Company.Shirley keeps telling us that she is “ years old”, which doesn’t seem that old at all but the character, at this stage in her le, is already done. She and her husband Joe have grown apart, both wounded by their marriage. Shirley is there to peel the spuds, put dinner on the table and tend to the grown-up children, Millandra and Brian, asthey are still toddlers. Shirley talks to the wall as there is no-one  to talk to.Her friend Jane has bought her a ticket for two weeks in Greece and the first act is the will she won’t she build-up to getting there.Shirley tells us how she wanted to be a “courier or air hostess” but was discouraged by less-than-patient teachers at school – “Only the clever ones get to do that.”Shirley Valentine has “disappeared,” we are told, worn down by routine and repetition and now “frightened of le beyond the walls.”By the time the interval came the audience was rooting for Shirley as she gets ready for her two weeks in Corfu.In Act Two, gone is the mousy dress, apron and sensible shoes of the first half and in its place is a striking Shirley: colourful bathing suit, tanned skin, feet encased in bright pink shoes. We learn that Shirley’s friend Jane abandoned her for four days ”to shack up with a man she met on the plane. “I was alone but it was lovely” – Shirley took her table down to the beach most nights to watch the sunset and sip her wine.Shirley Valentine is a timeless story – a woman stuck within four walls who needs to break out and break free. Tara Lynne triumphantly portrays a woman who was a prisoner in her own kitchen but learns that there is “le beyond the walls” and drags us along with her, cheering in her wake.As the lights dim, she’s on the beach and waiting for Joe – who she believes probably won’t recognise her – to come and talk at the crossroads they have found themselves at.In a poignant touch, there was a standing ovation for actor and “hugely talented” assistant director of the production Julie Maxwellwho tragically passed away last month.Shirley Valentine runs at the Lyric Theatre until October .

He attended Holy Cross Boys Primary School in the district and is also a past pupil of the old St Gabriel’s school.Leaving school at , Thomas admits that the academic world was not for him and he left home soon after to work in England.“School just wasn’t for me,” he explained.“I wasn’t academic but always fascinated by art and photos in newspapers and magazines such as The Observer and Sunday Times magazines.“I left home at  and went to England. There wasn’t much work here at the time and I just wanted to get away from Belfast with all the conflict going on.“I saw so much trouble and bloodshed on the streets. My community was under siege.“You couldn’t get in or out of Ardoyne without getting checked by British Army or RUC.“I was away for a year and worked in construction on building sites in London. I decided to come back because to be honest, I missed the place.“I didn’t really like London at all. It was far too quiet compared to back home.”Thomas ed to Belfast and turned his attention back to one of his hobbies and interests he had from a young age – photography.“I wanted to pursue a career in photography,” he added.“I went to night school where I learnt the basics but I wanted a job so I could work for the community using photography.“I managed to get an interview with the founder of Andersonstown News in West Belfast, Basil McLaughlin and Máirtín Ó Muilleoir who told me they were starting a new newspaper for North Belfast.“I was familiar with the Andersonstown News and liked the fact that they provided a voice for the community in West Belfast during the Troubles.“My interview was  years ago and I haven’t looked back since.”In  years, Thomas has established himself as a well-known and talented photographer and there wouldn’t be many in North Belfast who haven’t recognised him out and about doing the job he loves.Still, much has changed over the years in North Belfast and in photography.“North Belfast has changed in some ways but many issues remain today like housing and the unfair points system.“Community relations have improved with integrated education but even today, there are still sectarian attacks and peace walls remain up iding communities.“There are still people out there fighting for peace.“As for photography, I started off developing my own black and white images before it moved on to the digital age which takes up a lot less time and I can produce more photos.”Thomas has enjoyed many successes over the years and in , showcased  years of his work in the local media at an exhibition for Féile an Phobail.Back in May of this year, he scooped four awards at the Northern Ireland Press Photographers Awards, including first place in the Inidual Study and Sports Action categories along with a Provincial Merit Award. He has been recognised multiple times over the years in the awards.“It is great to be recognised for the daily work that I do. It is great for the North Belfast News and Belfast Media Group to show we put our best efforts into the product.“It was a proud moment for me and the paper.”Away from his daily working le, Thomas may also be seen on his motorcycle on the road and he also enjoys music. Thomas is also a busy grandad to two grandchildren and has three children – two daughters and a son.Asked for any advice for any budding photographers out there, Thomas would encourage them to join a camera club – the long-running CB Camera Club on the Antrim Road who meet every Thursday night at pm.As for the future, Thomas concluded, “I am content with the job I do now – representing people in the local community.“I am proud of where I am from.

These arrangements cannot wait for the re-establishment of Stormont or the settling of Brexit. This is much too important an issue.The momentum is with the North West and with the campaign for an independent university."},{"url":null,"title":"government report casts doubt magee expansion","story":"A report published by the Secretary of State for NI has cast further doubt over expansion at Magee by raising a number of concernsThe report states that in , DfE received a joint proposal from Ulster Universityand Council for a scaled expansion of the University’s Magee Campus to , full-time students from its existing ,, as well as an additional  full time students delivered via the North West Regional College .The proposition was the delivery of an increased supply of skilled graduates, togetherwith regional benefits that could flow to the North West.Planned expansion of the university campus is largely dependent on City Deal funding.At a recent Council meeting, it was revealed that projects linked to Ulster University will receive £m, at least a third of the City Deal funding, which currently stands at £m but is projected to be £m-£m with the Council expected to contribute £m and other partners making up the shortfall.The UU projects include the Graduate Entry Medical School, whose financial viability has been cast into doubt by Head of the NI Civil Service David Sterling. Alongside that are centres of innovation and excellence in data analyticsand robotics and automationand a Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence .Julian Smiths report says the proposals to expand Magee had signicant funding consequences from a capital infrastructure perspective, approximately £m, and from a resource funding perspective.The proposal would require Higher Education in NI to be placed on a sustainable footing, comparable with England, from which expansion would take place.According to the report, there would also be, as with any requested expansion or increase to student numbers, resource grant consequences of funding the proposed additional places at UU and NWRC, and associated student support costs, circa £m.\"The £m capital cost was highly indicative and based on an assumed cost per square metre per student.\"The Department for the Economyundertook initial work to determine how it would look at the case,there was an agreement on how the sector as a whole could be sustainably funded, as any expansion in student numbers would not make sense without this in place,\" it said.In February , DfE wrote to, and is awaiting a response from, UU requesting that an update be made to the case, according to the report.DfE asked for a more accurate assessment of capital need, which was \"very theoretical\" in the original proposal and created a signicant cost requirement. It wants a review of the number and subject level mix of additional students required to ensure an underpinning alignment with graduate postgraduate economic need in subject areas proposed.Furthermore, the department requested information around phasing of the project to assessthere are \"more suitable break points\" in the proposal and a potential to scale any expansion both in terms of student numbers and capital development.And sought the \"rationale\" for locating additional higher education places in the Magee Campus, as opposed to other geographical locations with further and more detailed explanation in relation to sub-regional economic benefits.This information will be critical to enabling a strategic approach to HE provision and in feeding into any final business case that might be put forward for this proposal, it concluded.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot

asked does UU have any update or response regarding the medical school and concerns raised by David Sterling around the need for ongoing funding which UU is not prepared to invest   A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"Following cross-party political and health and social care support in  for Ulster University’s Graduate Entry Medical School, the University has continued to proactively develop the project, working closely with the Department and other relevant partners. Our responses to any remaining clarications within the Graduate Entry Medical School business case were submitted to the Department of Health at the start of July, following prompt and close engagement with the Department and other relevant partners. Our proposed first academic year of projected enrolments outlined within the updated business case is  .“As the Department of Health has previously confirmed that any decision on funding can only be made by Ministers, the University is not actively recruiting medical students as yet for  entry until that decision on funding can be reached.· If funding was confirmed, all other elements of the proposal for our medical undergraduate degree programme have been firmly on track including continued progress with the GMC, clinical placement opportunities and the development of a curriculum to meet the needs of healthcare locally.“We value the continued support of all those who share our vision for medical education and we continue to work with the General Medical Council, St George’s University of London and local clinicians and partners building on our existing leadership in medical and healthcare provision to take forward graduate entry medical education for Northern Ireland.\"What does UU say in response to local councillors representatives who have claimed that UU has neglected the Magee campus for decades and should not be given money as part of the City Deal but should instead invest its own money in Derry   A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"Ulster University continues to invest in the Magee campus, most recently with the state-of-the-art £m teaching block which signals our ambition for higher education in the city, already enhancing campus le and paving the way for enhanced future capacity at Magee.    This and other investment priorities for students have resulted in a very strong performance for the Magee campus across all elements of the  National Student Survey, reflecting the very positive reaction from our students to these recent investments in University le at Magee.  With all four faculties of the University represented on the Magee campus – across health sciences, arts and humanities, business and computing and engineering, we are pushing boundaries and breaking new ground in emerging sectors as a progressive university, shortlisted for the prestigious Times Higher Education University of the Year Award, .“Our contribution to the City Deal opportunity is a signicant step forward in our collective opportunity to realise the full ambitions of this vibrant university city.  Our City Deals proposal will see us apply our expertise to help maximize the city’s potential in this unparalleled opportunity to boost economic growth and prosperity.  In our continued collaboration with industry partners, we look forward to driving innovation in personalised medicine, cognitive analytics, robotics and automation, leading to both new research posts and learning opportunities for additional students.  The proposed riverfront innovation hub will build upon the expertise of our first data analytics Institute, opened in  and headquartered at Magee campus, and which cemented our reputation as a global leader in this field. Also integral to the City Deal remains our commitment to establishing a Graduate Entry Medical School in a bid to address the challenges of a healthcare system at breaking point.   City Deal recognises the crucial role our University can play as an economic engine in the North West and is a major boost to the collective ambitions of the city and region.  We look forward to the development of our projects in partnership with industry, civic and educational partners.\"How much money will be needed in total to fund the projects put forward as part of the City Deal A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"The funding contributions by project across City Deal and the Inclusive Futures Funds are indicative at this stage, based on the allocations provided by Council, and subject to adjustment as we go forward.  Our contribution of % University funding to the Magee projects within City Deal reflects our belief in the impact they will make, and our commitment to playing our part in the collective ambitions of City Deal.“City Deal enables us to build further on our academic strengths that are signicant for the region’s growth, and to make sure that this expertise across world class research and progressive student learning works hard for the benefit of all in the city region. The City Deal bid has education, innovation, job creation and skills development at its core and each of these priorities are also central to our work across both teaching and research.  We are therefore a natural fit and a committed partner in this ambitious bid.  A continued collaborative approach is essential as we prepare to take forward the projects through planning and design and development of the business cases.”"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures llanfair caereinion celebrates deri woods centenary","story":"Caereinion High School Sixth Form students give a helping hand on the barefoot wltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtalking trail at Deriltspan classtruncate-full-screengt Woods.

The proposed new school will also be in the trusteeship of the De La Salle Congregation.St Patrickrsquos Grammar has maintained its opposition to the merger proposal since it was muted in , while both De La Salle and St Maryrsquos support the merger.Mr Joe McCann, St Patrickrsquos Grammar principal, said he is ldquodisappointed that an apparent EA source had broken the news of the merger plan locally before his and the other schools were formally notied.St Patrickrsquos parent body mdash The Parents and Friends Associationmdash said that it will ldquovehemently fight these proposals with every means necessary, through the courts and, unfortunately, in the media.PFA spokesperson, Cormac Artt, criticised the EA on how the news was leaked ahead of the schools being notied last Thursday and the argument that local children will be educated together and the likelihood of capital funding for a single-site school build.Mr Artt continued: ldquoThis proposal cites an enrolment of  pupils and alleges that this yearly intake will be made up of up to % who will be admitted by academic selection.ldquoHowever, the census figures suggest thatall those who live within a three-mile radius and those for whom the school is the nearest Catholic grammar are admitted automatically without sitting the GL entrance assessment, there will be very few,any, places for those applicants seeking admission via academic selection.Mr Artt suggested that the outworking of this means that the rural communities and primary schools who have been an integral part of the grammar schoolrsquos -year history, will no longer have a place in this proposed super school, including those in Teconnaught, Loughinisland, Strangford, Kilclief, Dundrum, the Ards peninsula, Castlewellan and Newcastle.ldquoThe choice for boys in these areas who wish an academically selective education will therefore be travel to Newry or Belfast to try to secure a selective grammar school place in Catholic schools that are already heavily oversubscribed, he said.ldquoThe alternative for those who wish to keep the tradition and connection with Downpatrick will be to attend the state academically selective, Down High School. Aside from the injustice of this on the rural communities, is the impact this will have on families.While the EA said that the proposals have ldquoalready been subject to formal stakeholder consultation with parents, staff, governors and pupils, Mr Artt disputed that.ldquoParents of students from St Patrickrsquos Grammar requested a meeting with the De La Salle Trustees in April to discuss the Trusteesrsquo vision going forward. They finally responded in June by refusing to meet the parents citing rsquoit is not clear what,anything, will be gained by a meeting,rsquo which clearly makes the parents think that they do not care about the pupils of the school where they are Trustees.ldquoThe Board of Governors, staff and parents are overwhelmingly opposed to this proposal and for the De La Salle Trustees, who are the only stakeholder supporting this vision, to refuse to speak to the current parents is a disgrace.De La Salle principal, Ciaran Maguire, said he was ldquodelighted to see the proposal going to full public consultation.He told the Recorder: ldquoItrsquos been a long time coming. I am reassured now that the families of the greater Downpatrick area will have an opportunity to finally get behind the vision to secure the town as a model of good practice, where childrenrsquos education is a priority.ldquoThe De La Salle Congregation have been working on bringing post primary education in Downpatrick into the st century. In , they first proposed that St Patrickrsquos Grammar should become a co-educational school.ldquoThe Department of Education at the time wanted to see a proposal that was reflective and inclusive of all schools in the Downpatrick area. That advice was taken by the De La Salle congregation and they have been working, in partnership, on a solution to ensure that all children in the greater Downpatrick area have an education system that they can be proud of.Mr Maguire said the origin of the transfer test ldquowas a solution to a problem back then, suggesting the problem is dferent now and a new solution is needed.He added: ldquoWhat we need now for our children is something radical and exciting for all those involved. If we are the child-centred schools we say we are, then this is undeniably the right thing to do, not just for my pupils, but for the St Maryrsquos girls and St Patrickrsquos boys.Mr Maguire contended that while some may see the proposal as ldquoas an attempt to wipe out a schoolrsquos history and tradition, itrsquos an opportunity for them to continue their great work in preparing our children for le.He said that it will cater for all children from the local feeder schools, without the fear of having to sit and possibly fail a test.Mr Maguire added: ldquoWe are removing barriers those same barriers that our children currently struggle with, the fear and anxiety of not fitting in, not being good enough.

Over the past three years Irish Lights has proactively engaged with the local community and relevant state agencies to establish the best approach to the site. he continued.ldquoWe have now developed and tested new technology to achieve a sustainable solution that will enable retention of the historic lens and sweeping beam at St. Johnrsquos Point. I look forward to meeting with the community to discuss these plans in more detail.The Lecale Lightkeepers say that while they accept there is some concession on CILrsquos part in proposing to keep the sweeping beam at the lighthouse, they have been informed by the Commissioner that the range of the beam will be reduced by up to nine miles. They also claim that the beamrsquos iconic ldquoloom will be lost, robbing the lighthouse of what they describe as its ldquointangible heritage.A spokesperson for campaigners said that through their freedom of information requests for communication between CIL and others, they have found a ldquolack of appreciation for the intangible heritage of lighthouses and a disregard of the views of coastal communities.ldquoWe have seen examples of modernised lights and none have retained their original characteristics. The new light source proposed for St Johnrsquos Point would be an LED which, in itself is suspect, as according to the Royal Society Publication April , LEDs have detrimental effects on Epaunal Marine Communities.Campaigners say Newry Mourne and Down Council has already voted unanimously to protect the sweeping beamrsquos current mechanism and trustsrsquos that CIL will not be given planning permission to proceed with its proposal.ldquoThe lighthouse is a listed building and its character, the light, must be protected, declared the campaignersrsquo spokesperson.ldquoWith the loss of the historic lights at Fastnet, Mew and Tory it is even more vital that St Johnrsquos Point should be kept for heritage purposes. Moreover, it is a beautul feature of our nocturnal landscape, much loved by the local communities.Turning to concerns about the mercury in the current lighthouse mechanism, the spokesperson said mercury vapour is a known toxic substance, arguing that vaporisation only occurs in certain circumstances, notably in very warm conditions where there is poor ventilation.ldquoThe St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse is fully automated and the lantern room is well ventilated.ldquoAccording to the late attendant Henry Henvey, the mercury had not needed any attention in at least  years nor were there ever any concerns about its safety.Next Wednesday eveningrsquos meeting in Ardglass starts at pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th September 2019 Red.jpg","title":"Red High 25 group in fundraising drive  ","story":"NEARLY  years on, the loss of Ballynahinch teenager Mark Quinn is still keenly felt today mdash by his grieving family, schoolmates and his fellow soccer players.The  year-old took his own le on December , , with his funeral service one of the biggest his home town has ever seen.Earlier this year, Markrsquos former classmates at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School in Downpatrick joined together to fundraise in support of community mental health initiatives in his memory coming up to his anniversary.The former students, now grown men, many with sons of their own, all found that Markrsquos death hit them in dferent ways then and throughout the following years.The group, known as Red High , decided that they wanted to raise money to help support other young men who may feel in despair.Markrsquos family is fully behind the initiative and other planned events which will go to support Ballynahinch Counselling Services and The Edge Youth and Community Centre.The gesture comes with the knowledge that Ballynahinch has one of the highest suicide rates in the district.World Suicide Prevention Day was marked yesterday and Department of Health officials announced plans to reduce suicide rates in Northern Ireland by % over the next five years.Speaking of behalf of her parents, Peg, and the late Hugh Quinn, and siblings Lynda, Michael, John, Patrick, Jarlath, David and Jemma, Markrsquos sister Katie Cassidy said they were ldquooverwhelmed to have been contacted during the summer holidays by Markrsquos school friends from the Red High.Katie said: ldquoTheir effort to keep Markrsquos memory alive while also raising awareness about mental health issues is more relevant now than ever. We as a family remember Mark everyday but to know that these young men thought about him often too brings us a great deal of comfort.Mark was the youngest of the family of nine. He showed great promise as a soccer player, playing locally for Ballynahinch Olympic and catching the eye of Norwich City.Well-liked and respected, and much loved, Katie says that her family never realised that Mark was suffering with mental health issues.Katie said: ldquoMark was an extremely engaging young man who got an A in his  plus. We called him the brain box of the family, teasing him about going to the grammar school which after the eight of us, that was quite a novelty.ldquoOur wee manrsquos funeral was one of the largest ever seen in Ballynahinch and held on New Yearrsquos Eve. If he only knew how much he was loved. It was truly heartbreaking.ldquoWhy, why, why was our overwhelming thoughts  Before Mark died, we had rarely heard of the word suicide. Now, sadly, any of us would struggle to speak to anyone who hasnrsquot been affected in some way.ldquoMark was outwardly a happy young man, who always had a smile on his face. He was always laughing and his friends knew him as Quinny. He loved his family and friends.Katie said that Mark was buried in his Olympic strip and his jersey number  was retired by the club shortly afterwards.Ballynahinch Olympic has continued to honour Mark every year at their awards night presenting the Mark Quinn memorial cup to the young player of the year.Katie has also made a plea for those who feel le is a struggle to talk to someone.She said: ldquoIf anyone reading this is struggling, please let someone know. Talking can make all the dference, we wish we knew then what we know now.ldquoThe pain and devastating reality of living without your son, brother, nephew or uncle truly causes physical pain. But there is also help in dealing with the loss of someone to suicide. In the early days after Markrsquos death when our faith was extremely tested, we received tremendous support from our parish community.Katie also asked for support for the upcoming football tournament at St Patrickrsquos Grammar next Saturday, September  and for Ballynahinch Olympicrsquos annual fundraising effort.She said: ldquoWe hope everyone will come along to the Red High next weekend to enjoy the football tournament. Itrsquos sure to be good day and all money raised will go to Ballynahinch counselling services and The Edge, as we feel that the Edge contributes enormously to the youth of our town. Ironically, Mark would have been  years old on September  a week after tournament.Former schoolmate, Conor MacNamara, spoke on behalf of the men involved in the fund-raising initiative.   He said: ldquoSo far the lads have raised over pound, with great support from past pupils, ex-teachers and of course Quinnyrsquos family.ldquoThese are dferent times now compared to . Mental health awareness is something that people are much more open about these days. It has a high profile in the media too which makes it easier for people to hold up their hands and admit that they are struggling with their own mental health.ldquoIn particular, young people feel a lot of pressure from unhealthy relationships with social media.ldquoBut still, suicide is still very high in Ballynahinch, Downpatrick and other parts of the county.

What I said was totally misrepresented. When I played for Armagh, before the ball was thrown in, it was always a very special moment to stand for the anthem of my country.”We can never talk down the fears of the unionist people and what they suffered down through the yearsJarlath BurnsIn a more in-depth interview for a Joe.ie podcast, the former GAA rules committee chairman spoke of the “counter-productive” nature of the IRA campaign of violence and how the murder of Protestants made the prospect of a united Ireland more remote – particularly the Kingsmills and Tullyvallen massacres within a mile of his school.“That really bites deep into the heart of the very small Protestant community in south Armagh,” he said.Mr Burns said his own view of the IRA’s campaign was reflected in a conversation with a Silverbridge GAA club stalwart back in the early s.Recalling the conversation, Mr Burns said: “He said the problem is that republicans think that they are fighting England, Britain, but they’re not – they’re fighting their neighbours, they are fighting the Protestants, and when it’s all over, they will realise thatyou shoot an RUC mandead, you alienate his immediate family and all of his loved ones against the idea of what you want, which is a united Ireland.“Now you are left with a unionism that is very easily hurt.”He went on to say: “I do have an obsession with unionism. I read so much about the Orange Order and so much about unionism and try to understand it as much as I can.“You have to understand unionist fears.

who finds it “offensive” and “embarrassing” when Coleraine darts player Daryl Gurney gets jeered when playing in Dublin, and how any cameras erected on the border in south Armagh post-Brexit “won’t

Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces.

Our little boy Caleb, who is four, came up with the idea of letting a helium balloon go so that it would make its way up to heaven. That was something we had planned.“I’d said to Kirsty I wanted to do something dferent, maybe a little random act of kindness to share a little joy.

In particular, he agreed that whatever economic approach was taken to unication, it would be “problematic”.Mr Birnie told the News Letter last year that NI receives about £bn in net funding annually from the UK exchequer.

There is a tendency for some commentators to assume the UK would continue to subsidise NI, he added. “But is that a realistic assumption ”Last year DUP MP and former finance minister Sammy Wilson said that unication is “not viable” in economic terms.However, it was understood at that time that Dublin had never published a formal feasibility study on the matter. Asked to comment last year by the News Letter, the Irish government declined to offer any comment on a feasibility study.Sinn Fein, however, dismissed the “unaffordability myth” of unication and claimed that the annual UK subvention to NI could be as low as £.billion.But Fianna Fail Senator Mark Daly, who had been leading research into unication, went further, claiming that NI actually “comes close to a balanced budget”.Mr Wilson added: “Sinn Fein’s fantasy figures will convince only themselves. When HM Treasury produces evidence Sinn Fein does not like it is simply dismissed by a party who held the finance department [at Stormont] but could not even produce a budget.”try catch  TrendingU.K.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief.

is encouraging schools here to take advantage of beneficial dog safety and responsible dog ownership lessons for their students. Their free dog welfare workshops, delivered as part of the Charity’s ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, enhance the National Curriculum and seek to provide children between the ages of seven and  years with the knowledge and understanding they need to act responsibly and safely around dogs in their homes and those they may see out and about.Each workshop benefits pupils by involving a pretend dog as its focus, with the aim of developing compassion and consideration for all living beings.Not only do children - whether dog owners or not - learn how to behave safely around dogs, they also learn all about the commitment involved in owning a dog through a creative and interactive learning experience.Last year, Cathy Clyde, Dogs Trust’s NI Education and Community Officer delivered workshops to , children. This year they are on track to improve on this number yet again. With the growing success of the ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, Dogs Trust now employs  education and community officers across the UK to provide workshops in their designated regions.Cathy said: “Through debate and discussion, our responsible dog ownership workshops encourage learners to embody important values around dog ownership such choosing the right breed or type of dog for your le style, as well as understanding that dogs are a lelong commitment and not a disposable commodity. I would welcome the opportunity to work with schools in the area and encourage them to get in touch, as pupils really do get a lot out of the workshops as do their dogs.”For more information about ‘Be Dog Smart’ visit www.bedogsmart.org.ukFor more information or to book a ‘Be Dog Smart’ workshop, contact Cathy Clyde on    or email cathy.clyde@dogstrust.org.ukFuneral details for Francis McCarville

graduated as a doctor in February this year and has been working at McCabe’s Pharmacy in the Northwood area of Dublin since May.The former St Michael’s Grammar School pupil explained: “The lady came into the shop struggling to breathe, she was in full-blown anaphylactic shock.”Emmett acted quickly and gave the woman an adrenaline shot: “I could see the rash on her neck so I knew she had an allergy.“I thought I’d have to do CPR. I gave her a shot of adrenaline and it didn’t really do anything.“Then I gave her a second adrenaline pen and it seemed to work until the ambulance arrived.“She required two more in the ambulance but from what I’ve heard she seems to be good now, thank God.“I’m also trained as a doctor so I think that certainly helped.”He added: “It’s not the sort of thing you expect to see and I’m glad I was able to help.”Emmett, whose long term ambition is to work in anaesthesia, has been in touch with the lady’s family who expressed their gratitude for his lesaving actions: “Her daughter contacted me and said she couldn’t thank me enough.”Emmett’s family back in Lurgan have expressed their pride in the young doctor’s heroic actions.His aunt Margaret McManus said: “We are very proud of him. He lost his twin brother, Finbar, three years ago and he has worked so hard. His mum dad and granny Eilish and sister Emma are so proud of him.”Emmett said: “My family has been through a tough time, I lost my brother when I was studying for my medical degree, I couldn’t focus on my exams.

Several motorists were warned about their speed but the sad thing was that two motorists received Fixed Penalty Notices for speeding.“On top of this one motorist obviously didn’t see us driving behind him when he decided to lt his mobile and start chatting to a friend instead of concentrating on the road. As a result this motorist also received a Fixed Penalty Notice for his misjudged action.“I would prefer to inform you that we had a successful day and caught nobody as it truly saddens me to issue these fixed penalty notices but some people just will not learn.“What I also noticed today was that not one person waved to us.

The medical teams were incredibly calm, and it was very helpful in such a frightening situation.” Trevor continued, “I was in hospital for five days. I knew it would be traumatic for my two young boys to visit, so we waited a few days before bringing them to the hospital.“I have had surgery on two occasions already with more to follow.“As a joiner this has of course had a massive impact on my livelihood and while I would love nothing more than to be back at work, I’m also aware that it will take some time. “I am very grateful that my limb has been saved and I now want to give something back to this charity as I know it takes £, a day to keep it going.“It was fantastic to be able to visit the air ambulance base recently to meet with the HEMS team who treated me at the scene. I have two sons and they thoroughly enjoyed being able to finish school a bit early for the important visit to the base and see the helicopter and meet the team. “I’m so grateful to them and also to the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service and all of the other medical professionals who have treated me so far.”Dr Darren Monaghan said: “It was great for the team to be able to welcome Trevor and his family to the base.

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jm_1.jpg","title":"how do you retain staff and keep them enjoying their job","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business With such intense competition for talent, the challenge for employers isn’t just finding prospective candidates, it’s also keeping them, writes John Moore, managing director of Hays NI Astonishingly, almost half of professionals surveyed in the Hays What Workers Want Report said that they left at least one new job within the first  months because it didn’t match expectations formed during the application process. A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/greggssss.jpg","title":"greggs to open new belfast city centre store","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Greggs looks set to open a new store in the heart of Belfast city centre, it can be revealed.

We want a reboot of the economic policy of Northern Ireland, in order to benefit our economy and safeguard our growing business community.” “We need to be bold and ambitious about creating % or even % growth over the next few years, but that requires decision makers to be pressed into action and a series of policy and legislative decisions to be taken and driven through. Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer.” “Our Vision  document sets out a bold new ten-year plan for creating , new jobs and creating a high growth economy.
