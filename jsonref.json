Photograph: iStockPrivate schools have warned they would have to double their fees or face potential closure under proposals to withdraw State funding for the sector.Sinn Féin’s pledge to remove State funding worth €111 million a year has sparked alarm among fee-charging schools, with plans being drawn up to fight the Irish School Heads’ Association – which represents most fee-charging Protestant schools – has been meeting over recent weeks to form a joint campaign to highlight what principals say would be “discriminatory” treatment.Some principals are exploring legal options and argue that the Constitution enshrines the right of parents to a choice of school for their children, especially those from a minority faith background.Public funding goes towards paying the salaries of the majority of teachers and special needs assistants in fee-charging schools.A number of schools estimate fees would climb from about €7,000-€8,000 to about €15,000 if this State funding was removed.A Sinn Féin spokesman confirmed it was the party’s policy to “phase out State subsidies to fee-paying schools over a number of years”.“With regards to minority faith schools, we would of course work closely with them to safeguard their future,” he said.“There are already minority faith schools that are not fee-paying, and they are themselves perfectly sustainable there’s no reason to believe that the future of all minority faith schools could not be safeguarded within the public-funded system, and we would work with them to see that to fruition.”Private schools are also concerned over their reduced access to funding grants over recent years under successive governments.Compared with the “free sector”, fee-charging schools receive fewer State-funded teachers, reduced guidance and counselling allocations and did not automatically get Covid-19 supports.Teachers are allocated at a ratio of one for every 19 students in “free” secondary schools, compared with one for every 23 students in the fee-charging sector.The policy was first introduced as a cost-cutting measure in 2009.A spokesman for the Department of Education said what differentiates fee-charging schools from others was their capacity to raise funds through mandatory fees, while also being in receipt of exchequer funding.The funding provided to fee-charging schools recognises that if the parents of children in the fee-charging sector chose to send their children to the non-fee-charging sector, the State would have to fund those school places, the spokesman said.Of the €111 million in funding for private schools last year, the vast bulk went on staff salaries. A total of €4 million was provided for Covid supports – such as enhanced cleaning and personal protective equipment (PPE) – which was available on application if schools demonstrated a need for it.Latest enrolment and admission statistics show most private schools, especially those in the Dublin area, are heavily oversubscribed and have long waiting lists for places.While numbers slipped during the recession, with some private schools opting to enter the free education scheme, enrolments in the fee-paying sector are back at levels last seen during the economic boom.St Columba’s in Dublin remains the most expensive day school in the country, at €9,174 this year. It is followed by Sutton Park, Dublin 13 (€7,995) Cistercian College in Roscrea (€7,850) Alexandra College, Dublin 6 (€7,685) St Gerard’s, Bray, Co Wicklow (€7,590) and the King’s Hospital, Co Dublin (€7,550)."},{"url":null,"title":"goodbye to nphet zeal and commitment of team never in doubt","story":"In autumn 2020 chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan clashed with the Government over the planned reopening of society. Photograph: Nick Bradshaw Modern Irish society has never experienced anything as invasive and, arguably, as isive as the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet), so there is unlikely ever to be a consensus on its legacy.While the initial response of a jaded public today may be to bid good riddance to the officials who controlled so much of their life for two years, the longer-term verdict of history is likely to be more favourable. Nphet should ultimately be judged on its performance on how Ireland managed during the pandemic, relative to other, similar countries. By that yardstick it has done reasonably well.Ireland has had fewer Covid-19 deaths, less excess death during the pandemic and fewer hospitalisations relative to population than most of our neighbours.For instance, Ireland has so far recorded 1,262 Covid-19 deaths per million of population, according to Our World in Data, the lowest figure in Europe apart from the Netherlands. We also have the second-lowest hospitalisations relative to population.This is largely due to us having one of the highest rates of Covid-19 vaccination, and that in turn was the product of the trust the broad mass of the population placed in our pandemic leadership, ie Nphet.If we have had more cases over recent months, that mattered less because virtually everyone in the adult population was benefitting from the protective effect of vaccines.True, there are countries that managed to minimise mortality more successfully, but Ireland is neither as remote as New Zealand nor as centrally controlled as China. You only have to look north on the island to see how much worse things could have been.Deep fissuresIn the early days of the pandemic, Nphet was the hastily-applied sticking plaster that covered over the deep fissures exposed by the pandemic and the bewilderment of the political class.With only an interim administration in place in Government Buildings, following the February 2020 general election, Nphet was effectively running the country. “I think that was by default because of a power vacuum. In the beginning, when they were an interim government, it suited them to hide behind Nphet,” one of its members, Dr Mary Favier, told Richard Chambers in his book, A State of Emergency.And while a Government was appointed in June 2020, Nphet stayed calling the shots, and the politicians stayed hiding, for much of that year.It was an unhealthy situation not of the officials’ own making. Over time, the shortcomings of this ad hoc body became evident: the preponderance of civil servants and lack of frontline clinicians in Nphet’s ranks a lack of transparency clumsy decision-making and reporting processes a warped relationship with its political masters, and an exclusively public health-oriented approach that seemed to pay insufficient heed to the wider impacts of the pandemic.As a result, Ireland suffered successive long lockdowns, each one less effective than the previous. Public opinion had fractured badly one fringe advocated against any restrictions, while another group called for a “zero-Covid” approach entailing even stiffer lockdown. Nphet was left to plead for a middle way and to promise salvation with the arrival of the newly developed vaccines.Its caution has often been criticised, sometimes with good reason, but was justified in autumn 2020 when chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan clashed with the Government over the planned reopening of society. With the spread of a new, more virulent strain of the virus, the politicians’ desire for a “meaningful Christmas” that year was to have catastrophic results as thousands died.SpatsOnce the vaccines were developed and distributed as last year progressed, the officials relaxed. But even as a solution to Covid-19 was being found, they found themselves embroiled in a series of damaging and ultimately unnecessary spats on antigen testing, ventilation and the nitty-gritty of regulations.Pandemic fatigue may have contributed to the officials sweating the small stuff on these issues. Or perhaps it was being given a pulpit so often that led to gaffes, such as when antigen tests were equated with “snake oil”.The politicians grew more assertive and impatient in 2021, but successive new variants came along to frustrate plans for winding up the emergency operation. U-turns on antigen tests and other issues were duly performed, sometimes with gritted teeth, after Nphet’s membership was expanded to include a wider breadth of opinion.Even as the arguments raged, though, no one ever had cause to doubt the zeal and commitment of Dr Holohan and his team. In other countries, those imposing the restrictions were sometimes caught infringing them, but not in Ireland.With more than 30 members, Nphet is too big and unwieldy. And yet it lacked ersity, especially at the start, though it was able to call on scientific expertise through numerous subgroups.Some have suggested the national emergency management team, currently dealing with Storm Eunice, should be the vehicle for tackling future public-health crises. Maybe, but it is hard to see how this approach would make the process more transparent or inclusive.We probably will need another crisis-type body again, possibly even for another wave in the pandemic, but one thing is clear: we will not see the likes of this Nphet again.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord it s like the lyrics board in leinster house","story":"Sure what else would you be doing of a Thursday afternoon only listening to 3½ hours of Dáil statements on the National Retrofitting Scheme?Two hours in and you might well be thinking there’s a lot to be said for drinking during the day, or wondering if you’re hallucinating because one of the TDs is telling the near-empty chamber about retrofitting while quoting lyrics from a song by The Frames.The deputy is Marc Ó Cathasaigh of the Green Party, who informs the tumbleweed: “I often think, when I’m stood in here or sat in here, I often think of The Frames’ song Star Star. And there’s a lyric in it: ‘Cause I don’t understand these people Who say the hill’s too steep Well they talk and talk forever But they just never climb.’”Easy to see why those lines might pop into Marc’s head while people hold forth around him in the chamber. It must be a very demoralising experience for the Waterford TD. The Frames have nailed it for him when it comes to opinionated politicians holding back on meaningfully addressing climate change.Or The Climbing Frames, in this case.“And the hill is steep. I mean, the targeted emissions reductions that we’ve put in front of us, that’s as steep a hill as anyone has ever faced. This retrofit scheme is part of us climbing that hill. Rather than moving around the Opposition fridge magnets of missed opportunity or whatever else, this is us getting on with the job of work that’s in front of us – an exceptionally important job of work. And one that provides huge opportunities.”Of course, his party leader has form on the lyrics front. In the early days of the pandemic, after the Government introduced strict social distancing rules, a disgusted Eamon Ryan described scenes of merrymaking in a packed pub in Temple Bar where the crowd was belting out Sweet Caroline.Reaching out his hand like a preacher, he quavered: “Hands touching hands, touching me, touching you – sweet Jesus, you could not make it up for being out of tune for where we all were.”Good attempt, Eamon, but you’re no Thomas Pringle. (Same goes for deputy Ó Cathasaigh).In November 2020, the Independent TD for Donegal managed to sneak rapper Coolio into the Dáil record during a speech on political lobbying.“The power and the money, the money and the power – minute after minute, hour after hour,” said Thomas in a rather disappointing monotone. “Coolio might have been rapping about Gangsta’s Paradise back in 1995 but he could just as easily have been referring to politics around the world – and especially Irish politics and lobbying.”Ó Cathasaigh gave us the phrase of the week, though, with his splendid “Opposition fridge magnets of missed opportunity”.Deputies seeing redDáil rows aren’t what they used to be.A couple of weeks ago, Sinn Féin’s Eoin Ó Broin crossed swords with the Taoiseach over the housing crisis. It was a rather tame affair. The usual sniping ensued but then deputy Ó Broin accused the Taoiseach of lying and that is most definitely not allowed.Cue the obligatory bout of pearl-clutching from Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl and a request to the offending deputy to withdraw his disgraceful claim. After some indignant squawking from both sides the Sinn Féin frontbencher backed down.“I am more than happy to substitute ‘willingly misleading the House’ for ‘lying’ said Eoin, sweetly.“Thank you,” said the Ceann.“It’s the same thing, Taoiseach,” shrugged Ó Broin. Which is true. And that was the end of what passes for ructions these days.This week, Labour leader Alan Kelly introduced the official record to the word “batsh*t”, apologising in advance before he said it. He was merely quoting somebody else.For all his scolding and the occasional suspension of business to allow passions to cool, the Ceann Comhairle takes a more relaxed approach to the rules than his combative predecessor, Seán Barrett. Since ascending the Chair in 2016 (he is into his second term) Ó Fearghaíl has not suspended any TDs from the House. When feelings are high and tempers boil over or when one of the Healy-Raes is hellbent on breaking the sound barrier, he gives a few rattles of the bell and shuts up shop for a short while.The alternative would be to “name” the offending deputy and invite the Dáil to vote on their suspension for a period of time.In his five-year tenure, Barrett gave deputies their marching orders on 14 occasions.The last politician to be given that dubious honour was Clare TD Michael McNamara, who now sits in the Dáil as an Independent but was a Labour member of the Fine Gael-led coalition when he was kicked out in December of 2015. He got into a blazing row with ceann comhairle Barrett over the government curbing debates by guillotining legislation, complaining that it went against what deputies were elected to do.When he refused to back down, Barrett called a vote to suspend him whereupon the government voted to expel one of its own TDs from the chamber. McNamara was given a three-day suspension.The runner-up position is held by Social Democrats co-leader and Mother of the Dáil (longest-serving female TD) Róisín Shortall, who got the order of the boot from Barrett a year earlier, in December 2014, after she accused him of shutting down debate on the funding of Irish Water.In the course of their lengthy row, the ceann comhairle told the fuming Shortall: “You’re a senior deputy, don’t be making a show of yourself.”That didn’t go down well.Third place on the podium goes to Mary Lou McDonald, who was ordered out the previous month after protesting that the then tánaiste was not answering her questions (a perennial Opposition complaint and one which Mary Lou, now leader of her party, makes to this day). But on this occasion for some reason, the then deputy leader of Sinn Féin refused to sit down and was duly named by the ceann comhairle and suspended after a vote.This led to her famous four-hour sit-in in the chamber, one of the most bizarre episodes in recent Dáil history. Mary Lou later denied it was a political stunt, although it did not go unnoticed that her headline-grabbing one-woman occupation of the Dáil chamber happened the day after an intense and highly critical five-hour debate on Sinn Féin’s handling of sexual abuse allegations, particularly in the case of Maíría Cahill.But back to Ceann Comhairle Ó Fearghaíl and his clean sheet.By nature, TDs are competitive beasts. Let the race for that first red card begin.Six-pack celebrationTwo politicians celebrated big milestones this week – one of them personal, the other political.Congratulations to People Before ProfitSolidarity TD Gino Kenny, who finally got to hold his 50th birthday bash on Friday night.“I turned 50 on January 20th but couldn’t do anything because of the Covid restrictions,” he told us before heading out for Foley’s pub on the corner of Merrion Row, which is just up the way from Leinster House.Fifty years old? “I think it’s a good age to celebrate. And the main thing is that I’m healthy and I’m here. I feel as good now as I did 10 years ago.”The Dublin Mid-West TD said he was delighted to have a chance to meet up with all his pals again, many of whom he hasn’t seen in two years. “This is more to celebrate meeting up with people again than it is for my birthday.”It’s not a lavish do. “A few pints and I’ll be grand,” says Gino, who is delighted that his mother, Mary, will be coming along for the evening. She hasn’t had the best of health recently but her son says she is determined to be there, even though her arm is in a sling.“She’ll be the belle of the ball.”Meanwhile, Gino was just 10 years old when Richard Bruton first entered the Dáil.The former Fine Gael minister and deputy leader, who chairs the Parliamentary Party, notched up 40 years in Dáil Éireann on Friday. He won a seat for Dublin North Central on February 18th, 1982 and has represented the constituency, which is now Dublin Bay North, ever since. Having also served as a senator for a year in 1981, he could argue that his Oireachtas unbroken run s 41 years.Three-times minister Bruton (he led an unsuccessful leadership heave against Enda Kenny in 2010) became a big hit on social media two years ago when a shot of him emerging from the water after a swim in Clontarf revealed his toned physique. At the age of 67 he suddenly became the Minister for Abs.Party Leader and Tánaiste Leo Varadkar led the tributes, tweeting his congratulations to Richard for “40 years of service to his constituency and to Ireland and still on top of his game. One the most competent, creative and compassionate politicians I have had the honour to serve with.”Jennifer Carroll MacNeill, Fine Gael TD for Dún Laoghaire, tweeted her admiration for Richard and his “extraordinary work ethic”, adding “I’m still trying to match that six-pack”."},{"url":null,"title":"hong kong not allowed to live with covid but can t stop it either","story":"People sleep in hospital beds  outside the Caritas Medical Centre in Hong Kong as hospitals become overwhelmed with the coronavirus wave. Photograph: Peter ParksAFP via Getty ImagesThe scenes were straight out of China’s coronavirus playbook. Armies of workers, deployed to lock down residents. Plans to erect a massive makeshift hospital. And on Wednesday, a command from Xi Jinping, the country’s top leader, plastered across local front pages: “Make controlling the epidemic as soon as possible an overwhelming priority.”The site of the latest outbreak, though, was not mainland China, but neighbouring Hong Kong. And unlike on the mainland, where the government’s lofty language has been followed by quick results, no such relief is in sight.As Hong Kong sinks under its worst wave yet of coronavirus, overwhelmed hospitals have left patients waiting on pavements. People have stood in testing lines that wind across parks and soccer fields. Cases are still growing exponentially, as officials opt for targeted lockdowns rather than a citywide one.Researchers have warned that by summer the latest wave could kill nearly 1,000 people – more than four times the number that have died of Covid in Hong Kong over the past two years.The city’s flailing response has exposed a crucial weakness in its ability to handle coronavirus. Unlike other places facing a surge of the Omicron variant, Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese city, cannot choose to live with the virus Beijing continues to demand local elimination. But the city, which retains certain freedoms unheard-of in the mainland, also cannot wield Beijing’s full authoritarian tool kit or nearly unlimited manpower to stamp out transmission at any cost.‘Dynamic zero’Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, has struggled even to define the term that the government uses to describe its approach, “dynamic zero”. “‘Dynamic zero’ – I admit this is a policy requirement of the mainland,” she told reporters last month. “But I am not the initiator, so if you want an authoritative definition of ‘dynamic’, I’m sorry, I really can’t explain it.”At its core, the city’s crisis reflects the limitations of its unique political model. Health experts have pointed out that certain measures, such as citywide mandatory testing, would be impractical in Hong Kong, and could also stir anger in a public already deeply distrustful of the government.But as Beijing exerts ever-tighter control over Hong Kong, through a national security law and sweeping crackdown on dissent, those considerations may start to carry less weight.Some have called Hong Kong’s willingness to embrace tougher restrictions a proxy for its loyalty to Beijing. “The loopholes and oscillation in Hong Kong’s antivirus strategy show that some officials have not met the requirements for ‘firm patriotism’, said Tian Feilong, a law professor at Beijing’s Beihang University who studies Hong Kong.Last month, the Hong Kong government was forced to clarify that it was legal to make “general remarks and discussion” about the effectiveness of dynamic zero, after Junius Ho, a pro-Beijing lawmaker, suggested that questioning it could violate the security law.Meanwhile, the public health toll continues to grow. Some 12,000 people who have tested positive are still waiting to be admitted to a hospital or isolation unit, according to government figures. After five months with no Covid deaths, Hong Kong has recorded at least 21 over the past week, including a 3-year-old girl and a 100-year-old woman on Tuesday.Early successesUntil this wave, Hong Kong kept coronavirus largely in check. The city’s combination of tight social distancing rules and aggressive contact tracing meant that the previous four waves of infection were curbed relatively quickly. For much of 2021, the city recorded no local cases. But the highly transmissible Omicron variant assaulted the cracks in the city’s defences.The first local Omicron transmissions were traced to two flight attendants who returned from abroad in December. A bigger Omicron cluster was connected to a woman who was infected while in hotel quarantine after returning from Pakistan. The woman passed the virus to her husband, who spread it to a cleaner at a vast housing development.Hong Kong locked down a half-dozen buildings and tested 37,000 people last month after more than 100 people there tested positive. The virus has now spread to more than 20 senior homes and care facilities, highlighting another weakness in Hong Kong’s preparations. While more than 84 per cent of people over age 11 have had at least one shot of a vaccine, among those 70 and older, the proportion is just 56 per cent.“In a way we were a victim of our own success because the fatality rate and the infection rate were pretty good until recently,” said Regina Ip, a pro-Beijing lawmaker who was speaking by phone from self-quarantine after her driver tested positive. “Older people thought they didn’t need to be vaccinated because there could be complications. And the government was hesitant. We have avoided vaccine mandates.”As the outbreak grew, Lam at first tried to draw a clear line between Hong Kong and the mainland, even as she pledged to adhere to dynamic zero. It would be impractical to invite mainland workers to carry out door-to-door testing, she said this month, in part because of language differences the primary language in Hong Kong is Cantonese, not the Mandarin used in the mainland. Lam also rejected calls from pro-Beijing lawmakers to introduce mandatory universal testing, defending the more targeted operations.“If we give up this effective, focused testing work and rashly follow other places to conduct so-called community testing, I will not bear the consequences,” she said. “Anti-epidemic work is not a slogan.”“The Hong Kong government just follows instructions from Beijing, but they are still hesitant to go full throttle, to go all the way,” said Willy Lam, an adjunct professor of politics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “They know that most people in Hong Kong don’t trust the Chinese way of doing things.”Political pressureBut in recent weeks, as the outbreak has spiralled out of control, calls for Hong Kong to draw closer to the mainland strategy have grown. China’s state news agency and official Communist Party mouthpiece both published commentaries this month warning against any suggestion of living with the virus.The political pressure, coupled with the deteriorating public health situation, seems to have had an effect. Over the weekend, Hong Kong officials travelled to Shenzhen, across the border, to set up joint task forces with officials there. The task forces will work to increase testing capacity and build makeshift isolation facilities, like the ones used in China, the government said.On Wednesday, Beijing announced that it would also assign central government officials, in addition to the regional ones, to help oversee Hong Kong’s outbreak. But even pro-Beijing figures acknowledge that Hong Kong cannot copy the mainland model outright.When authorities this month locked down Baise, a city of about 3.6 million in southwestern China, after a flare-up of several dozen cases, they deployed 38,000 Communist Party members and workers to patrol neighbourhoods and coordinate supplies, according to the local government. Such networks are a longstanding part of the mainland’s social controls. Hong Kong has more than twice as many residents and no such network.“We lack enough organisation, mobilisation and control capabilities, and we also lack a strong government,” said Lau Siu-Kai, an adviser to Beijing in Hong Kong.Hong Kongers could also prove fiercely resistant to a citywide lockdown. When Lam visited a locked-down housing estate last month, residents showered her with insults from their windows – a display of public dissent rarely seen since the imposition of the security law.The government has hesitated to introduce more invasive contact tracing apps such as exist in the mainland, in part because of residents’ privacy concerns. But some worry that authorities will use the latest outbreak as an opportunity to push through more surveillance measures, Willy Lam, the professor, said. Trust in the Hong Kong and Beijing governments “is quite low”, he said.Health experts say the political debate has overshadowed the grim medical reality.

I crouch behind him, clutching my robust but battered high-def camera. A few feet away, a snarling F-35B Lightning Stealth Fighter, sleek as a shark and every bit as lethal, prepares to launch into the steel-grey skies of the eastern Mediterranean.On the bridge, the navigators steer directly into the wind. ‘Steady on designated flying course, one-one-zero,’ says the officer of the watch.  ‘Steady on one-one-zero, sir,’ confirms the helmsman.The F-35B needs plenty of headwind to get airborne. The aircraft has a run-up of only 350 feet to the curved ‘ski-jump’, from which it will make its final leap skywards. Inside the glass-encased flight control tower behind us, the vessel’s Commander Air, Ed Phillips, aka ‘Wings’, looks up and down the massive flight deck and, when satisfied all is clear, gives a short sharp order:All eyes turn to the green flag held aloft and rippling in the wind. Probably worth no more than a couple of quid, it is brought down to the ground with a dramatic flourish the signal for the F-35B, worth well over £100 million, to get airborne.I brace myself for the immense power about to be unleashed. I’ve witnessed this many times and know what to expect. It’ll be exhilarating, for sure, but also terrifying and probably painful. I’m determined to capture on film a spectacular close-up of a launch as near to the aircraft as possible, but the timing is critical and so far I’ve manifestly failed to pull it off.The searing blast from the rear jet nozzle has always blown me off my feet and sent me sprawling. I have the bruises and cuts to show for it and God knows how much skin I’ve now invested in the roughened, diamond-hard surface of the flight deck. But I still don’t have the footage I want. This time, two hefty sailors are ready to hold me down, or at least try to. My fear is that no amount of muscle power will be a match for the explosive thrust of what is essentially a horizontal rocket.The pilot releases the brakes and opens the throttle. The Pratt \u0026amp Whitney afterburning, turbofan engine raises its pitch to a terrifying scream as the aircraft surges forward. I clench my teeth, tense my muscles and, with my heart pounding in my ears, bear hug the camera in a semi-stable position. But how long can I hold on? Four vice-like hands press down on my hunched shoulders.It’s June 2021 and I’ve joined the ship’s company of HMS Queen Elizabeth for her first operational deployment. We are some weeks into a seven-month voyage to the South China Sea, not on exercise but, locked, loaded and ready for action, should it become necessary.The new carrier and fleet flagship, together with eight escorts (destroyers, frigates, supply ships and a submarine) comprise Carrier Strike Group 21 (CSG21) – the most powerful naval force to leave the UK in a generation. Prior to our transit through the Suez Canal and the Red Sea, on our way to the Pacific and the disputed waters of the South China Sea, the ship has been launching waves of jets on Operation Shader – in support of land forces in the fight against Islamic State in Syria. But this has prompted a reaction from the Russians. They consider this part of the Med their own backyard and are intent on letting the QE and her escorts know they’re not welcome here. But the QE is the new dog on the block and she’s here to mark her own territory, not with a wag of the tail but a snarl.Today’s launch of the F-35s, therefore, is not to attack IS but to ward off Russian warplanes attempting to overfly us. Pilots, drawn from the Fleet Air Arm, RAF and US Marine Corps, have been scrambling all day, sometimes in rapid two-minute intervals, to intercept ‘red bandits’ and escort them away at a safe range.The Russians, apart from wanting to goad the Royal Navy, are desperate to get a closer look at the QE, the most advanced aircraft carrier in the world, and also test the Task Group’s reaction procedures – not only in the air but also on the surface, with their warships, and underwater with their submarines. The QE’s Anti-Submarine Warfare Merlin Mk2 helicopters from 820 Naval Air Squadron are on constant patrol in order to monitor subsurface incursions and react accordingly. Nobody has actually opened fire, but there’s a lot of posturing and tactical lip-curling. If this is the start of a new Cold War, nobody is in doubt that things could heat up very quickly. The QE’s magazines are bursting with bombs, bullets and missiles of all descriptions and capabilities, as you’d expect on a warship that is now Britain’s main conventional strategic deterrent.Commodore Steve Moorhouse, leading CSG21, knows that Britain’s potential adversaries, the Russians and Chinese, will prod and poke his Task Group at every opportunity. ‘They want to see what we’re made of,’ he freely admits. ‘And I’m happy to show them, but professionally, in a spirit of confidence, not confrontation.’ Moorhouse is a steely commander but also a diplomat by default. After all, HMS Queen Elizabeth, a chunk of British sovereign territory, is part warship, part floating embassy. As the embodiment of ‘Global Britain’, her charge is to deliver ‘power projection’ on behalf of the nation: on the one hand that means hard-edged, lethal warfare on the other it’s about soft, political persuasion through deterrence, as well as overt support for allies around the world.Friends and foes alike will be watching this deployment with keen interest and I’m here to capture it on film for a forthcoming BBC TV series. But this isn’t the first time I’ve filmed HMS Queen Elizabeth. That was back in 2009, when I witnessed Princess Anne cutting the ship’s first steel at Govan shipyard in Glasgow. This was not so much the birth of Britain’s biggest-ever warship – more like her conception – and I was struck by the enormity of the occasion.  Sir Jonathon Band, the First Sea Lord at the time, spoke with passion to the audience and assembled media. The Queen Elizabeth Class of aircraft carrier, comprising HMS Queen Elizabeth, with HMS Prince of Wales to follow, would, he explained, ‘provide Britain with the means to deliver air power from the sea, wherever and whenever required, and in a stronger and more decisive form than ever before’. They will also, he added, ‘be the centrepiece of Britain’s military capability for many years to come’.The construction of HMS Queen Elizabeth and her sister ship meant a complete reinvention of the Royal Navy but, despite Sir Jonathon’s upbeat messaging, it was to prove a painful and long-drawn-out process. Our active carriers at the time, Ark Royal, Illustrious and Invincible, were about to be axed in the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review and with them the Navy’s Harrier squadron – its entire naval fixed-wing capability. Already, naysayers and vocal critics were provoking a heated debate over the pros and cons of a carrier-centric Navy, and whether there’d be enough escort ships to protect the carriers while at sea or sufficient sailors to man them – each would be three times the size of the Invincible Class carriers.General Sir Peter Wall, former head of the British Army, described the decision to build the new carriers as no more than a ‘vanity project’ that ‘lacked credibility’ and which could be seen to have ‘skewed the UK’s conventional defence effort to a damaging degree’. Max Hastings, ever the provocateur, suggested the new warships represented delusions of grandeur for a Navy in decline. Other denigrators were quick to point out that a large carrier is a big target – especially for the new generation of hypersonic missiles that the Chinese call ‘carrier killers’.Russia inevitably chimed in with some of its own political trash talk: ‘Just make sure you keep your new carrier away from Moscow’s warships or they’ll send it to the bottom of the sea.’Military hardware is an emotive subject, especially in the context of huge capital expenditure that might otherwise be spent on housing, welfare or the NHS, but £6 billion for two vessels (albeit a near doubling of the original budget) is modest compared to the eye-watering price tag of USS Gerald R. Ford, an American super-carrier of similar proportions which cost more than $13 billion (and which, according to the Pentagon, ‘has yet to demonstrate it can effectively defend itself from anti-ship missiles and other threats’).The glossy brochure issued by a conglomerate of shipbuilders known as the Aircraft Carrier Alliance certainly suggested that Britain was getting its money’s worth. At 65,000 tonnes, HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales would not only be the biggest warships ever built for the Royal Navy, but also the most powerful and advanced in terms of military technology and stealth capabilities – especially when married eventually to the state-of-the-art F-35B Lightning jet fighter.The sales pitch for the super-carriers came with a staggering array of facts and figures. The ships, it claimed, would be so highly automated they’d require only ‘lean-manned’ crews – less than 1,000 per ship, without aircrew. That’s broadly one fifth the size of an American crew on a similar-sized ship. They’d each have a four-acre flight deck, the size of three and a half football fields, nine decks and a hangar big enough to fit two Type 23 frigates side by side. Each carrier would have two propellers weighing 33 tonnes – exerting the same thrust as 50 high-speed trains and producing a maximum speed in excess of 27 knots (31mph). The six engines (two mighty gas turbines and four diesels) would produce enough energy to power a city the size of Swindon the electrical cabling and wiring would stretch six times round the world the ship, weighing the same as 35,000 family cars, would carry enough fuel to take those cars to the moon and back a dozen times… and on it went.The statistics were mind-boggling, but one thing was for sure: the challenge of building the first of these ships – the nine-decked HMS Queen Elizabeth – manning her, taking her to sea and getting her battle-ready was going to be a compelling story, as I learnt while following her construction in seven shipyards around the UK, culminating in her final assembly at Rosyth in Fife, like some gargantuan Lego toy. But, engineering aside, I knew that her real story would reside in the sailors yet to arrive the men and women who would breathe life into the country’s first super-carrier.  Foremost among them was Jerry Kyd, the ship’s first seagoing captain. I encountered him on the day he arrived in Rosyth in May 2016, as he addressed a fledgling ship’s company of just 456 sailors standing in front of their ship, still an inert hulk without propellers and dead in the water.‘The world’s a frisky place at the moment,’ he said. ‘And we have to be ready to respond to threats which I think are coming sooner rather than later.’ Kyd glanced towards their future home, encased in scaffolding. ‘HMS Queen Elizabeth, as big and sophisticated as she might be, is really just a huge metal box, full of pipes, wires, gadgetry and computer terminals. She’s missing one vital ingredient…’ He paused dramatically. ‘Without the flesh, blood, muscle and hearts of you, my sailors, that ship is just a robot. You, not the ship, are the most important resource at my disposal.’It was nearly a year before the QE was ready for her first sea trials. As a ‘new build’, there were bound to be problems. On the eve of our departure for the North Sea, Captain Kyd warned that there would be emergencies: ‘We’ll have floods, we’ll have fires. And casualties too. That’s the nature of this business.’For the best part of two months the ship was put through her paces off the coast of Scotland, where I joined them. The first aircraft, a Merlin helicopter, was landed on the flight deck within four days as the ship’s company got used to their largely subterranean existence deep in the belly of the beast. I watched with amazement as the sailors, many of them straight out of training, transformed the massive grey hulk not only into a working warship but a home from home. The QE was fast becoming a vibrant floating city and, with 23 nations represented from across the Commonwealth, all human life was here. My first challenge, however, was to learn my way round a ship longer than the Houses of Parliament and taller than Nelson’s Column and so gigantic that it boasted five kilometres of passageways and 3,200 compartments.Apart from a serious issue with a cracked thrust block that held one of the drive shafts in place, all went as well as could be expected. As Jerry Kyd foretold, there were plenty of fires and floods as the ship was pushed to breaking point so that her technical and seagoing limits could be identified. There were ‘casualties’ too, but thankfully only minor ones – the worst being cracked teeth and broken fingers. Sea trials completed, we finally entered Portsmouth dockyard, the ship’s designated home port, and within months the QE was officially commissioned by the Queen.After a period of maintenance, the ship set off for the next vital stage of her trials off the eastern seaboard of the US. Within hours of leaving Portsmouth we became aware of an ominous presence – a Russian Federation frigate called Admiral Makarov had closed to within two miles of our position. A highly capable warship armed with Kalibr long-range cruise missiles, the Makarov was in transit from the Baltic to Sevastopol on the Black Sea. While officially permitted to route through the English Channel she had clearly erted her course to have a closer look at our ship.  A few days later, just before starting our transatlantic crossing, we were suddenly erted into the Irish Sea to help chase off a Russian submarine spotted in British territorial waters. There was an increasing concern, as there still is, that Russians could be sussing out British underwater power and communication cabling – an obvious target for a potential enemy.  The Russian sub made a run for it as soon as we got close. Even before the QE had become operational the writing was on the wall and it was written very clearly in Cyrillic script. A sign of things to come (and indeed I write this as the world tries to second-guess Russian designs on Ukraine).Following this brief ersion we progressed across the Atlantic and the next dramatic event I witnessed was the ship’s first-ever run ashore in a foreign port, which didn’t go entirely to plan. In Mayport, Florida, after a night of heavy drinking, four sailors from the QE and two from our escort frigate, HMS Monmouth, were arrested for a range of alcohol-related offences including jaywalking, fighting and resisting arrest. Despite making headlines on both sides of the Atlantic, the episode was soon forgotten and at least part of the blame was attached to overzealous policing.  Captain Kyd, a pragmatist, reckoned that a night in jail was punishment enough for sailors letting off steam. ‘The question we have to ask ourselves,’ Kyd told his commanders, ‘is what sort of sailor would we want to go to war with? The automaton who obeys every rule, plays it safe and never takes chances? Or the free spirit who pushes his luck and breaks the odd rule?’    Kyd quickly refocused on the job in hand – namely to see an F-35B Lightning jet land on the ship’s flight deck for the first time. Helicopters were one thing, but a fighter jet that lands vertically using immense downward thrust from its enormous engine was quite another. Commander Nathan Gray, the Navy’s top test pilot, was the first to attempt a landing. It went without a hitch, although many questions remained about safety margins before the flight deck and aircraft could be handed over to front-line combat pilots. Two months of continuous, painstaking testing in all weathers, including a full-blown hurricane, gradually provided the answers. Gray, despite a few near misses, was satisfied that he and his colleagues had done all they could to ready the ship and aircraft for action.  And so to the present. Here I am aboard the QE once again – no longer on sea trials, but busy arm-wrestling the Russians, and before long she’ll be playing cat-and-mouse with the Chinese in the South China Sea. This is the acid test, with much at stake. The Prime Minister has declared he wants the Royal Navy to be the most powerful and influential in Europe by the end of the decade. CSG21 is the first step to achieving that ambition and proving that the new aircraft carrier is no white elephant but an effective instrument of government as well as an iconic symbol of nation.  Great adventure beckons and, once again, all life is here – a much expanded ship’s company of 1,650 men and women. Yes, there are the aviators yes, there are the seafarers yes, there are the marine engineers. But there are so many others: stewards, chefs, medics, gunners, aircraft handlers, writers, warfare specialists, physical trainers and intelligence officers. There is even a specialist chocolatier and, maybe because of him, a dedicated dentist and dental hygienist.‘Bleeding frozen chips!’ shouts Ronnie Lambert, an Essex boy, born and bred. ‘They want 10 more boxes in the main galley and they’re all at the back of the frickin’ fridge.’‘Well, get in there and pull ’em out,’ laughs fellow storeman Aaron Mackin. ‘It’s yer bleedin’ job.’‘Well, I’m transferring to aviation! Them boys have it easy up there. All sunshine and sea.’    The F-35B, accelerating from a standing start, rattles my bones. The heavyset sailors push down hard on my prone body as I attempt to point the camera in the right direction. The sailors are now lying on top of me – the jet stream strikes and skittles us. I roll across the deck, trying to protect my camera. Did I capture the moment of take off? I will check as soon as I can. Lying on my back I look up to see five British F-35s close in on three Russian MiGs.There will be more Russian warplanes soon. They’ll keep coming, but at least we know one thing: we have chips to go with our fish tonight. Must be a Friday.More from NewsStorm Eunice: Massive clean-up operation hampered by more weather warningsBetting shops and bingo halls could be blocked by councils in gambling crackdownComedy was funnier when it didn\u0026#39t seek to change the worldSaturday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The David Frost: My three-point plan to save Boris, the Conservative Party and the countryMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"feeling grumpy optimism has fading since age nine","story":"Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, the naïveté of youth is as heart-warming as it is baffling, but a study has found that childhood hyper-optimism begins to fade from the age of nine.Academics from University College London (UCL) set out to investigate how optimism levels change throughout childhood and what influences this.They found that constant exposure to bad outcomes causes optimism to dwindle as a child grows up and that having high expectations, only to consistently fall short, takes its toll.More than 100 children were recruited for a study and categorised into three age cohorts - eight to nine, 12 to 13, and 16 to 17. “We asked our study participants to play a game to gather treasures from different planets,” Johanna Habicht, study author from UCL, told The . “They had to learn how good these planets were and tell us how much they would earn. We found that children were much more optimistic than adolescents.”The team used mathematical models to analyse the participants and how they learned throughout the game, and to quantify their optimism.They found that the youngest cohort, who were still in primary school, were “hyper-optimistic” because they did not learn from their bad outcomes, maintaining their high expectations despite never achieving their goals. “They tend to ignore when things are not as good as they hoped,” explained Dr Tobias Hauser, lead author of the study. “The outcomes in the study were just play points, and the bad outcomes were when they received less play points than they had expected,” he told The . “Of course, in real life we encounter many kinds of outcomes that we can be disappointed by. “Starting from bad grades in school, to rejection from peers, or even achievements in sports or games. “All of these experiences influence how we see ourselves and thus how we expect the world to treat us and what we can achieve.”But while children lose some of their rose-tinted perspective as they get older, they are still more optimistic than pessimistic on the whole, even as teens.  “The adolescents are still showing an optimism bias, but just to a lesser extent,” Dr Hausman said. He added that although the study did not compare the optimism of teenagers to adults, previous research has found older adolescents are fairly similar to grown-ups in their world view: mildly optimistic on the whole, but far less so than youngsters. The biggest decline in optimism was observed between the 8-9-year-old cohort and the 12-13-year-old group. This, Dr Hausman says, may be evidence that the transition into adolescence, with the emotionally mangling cocktail that is secondary school, exams and puberty, may be a key driver behind why children lose their wondrous outlook and become more grounded. The study is published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General. Researchers now hope to expand their research by studying more people. To do this, they have turned their game into an app, called Brain Explorer, which can be played by members of the general public and will contribute to future research. “Brain Explorer allows everyone to contribute to science by playing fun games on their phone and to help us better understand the causes of mental disorders,” Dr Hausman said. “Anyone can download the app and contribute to science.”More from NewsStorm Eunice: Massive clean-up operation hampered by more weather warningsBetting shops and bingo halls could be blocked by councils in gambling crackdownComedy was funnier when it didn\u0026#39t seek to change the worldSaturday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The David Frost: My three-point plan to save Boris, the Conservative Party and the countryMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"royal minder keep boris check","story":"She was the woman who oversaw the Duchess of Sussex’s honeymoon relationship with the British press, and ran her through her paces in a strict royal training regime when she first joined the Firm. But Samantha Cohen, Harry and Meghan’s former press secretary, is now taking on a new challenge: managing Boris Johnson. It was reported last week that the PM had approached the Aussie-born veteran aide. I am told she has now accepted the PM’s offer to work in Downing Street and will have her contract finalised next week.The news – yet to be officially announced – has raised eyebrows in some circles, with one observer wondering how she will get on with the PM’s wife. Cohen previously worked at the eco charity Cool Earth, so the pair might bond over their shared interest in environmentalism. Some might ask: is an eco fan who worked with Meghan Markle really the person Johnson thinks will help win back his Tory critics?While defecting from your political party might make you some new friends on the other side of the Commons, it also has unintended consequences for your social life, as Christian Wakeford learnt after he crossed the floor from the Tories to Labour last month.The MP received a call from the bastion of Toryism in St James’s, the Carlton Club, informing him that he would be expected to cancel his membership after defecting from the Conservatives just minutes before PMQs. The club has accepted women as full members since 2008, but Labour MPs are still blackballed, it seems.Now bereft of a Mayfair private members’ club, Wakeford muses to Peterborough that the Carlton has no Left-wing equivalent. Perhaps he should start one.The denizens of Fulham have been left aghast after the news that a local hunk has decided to up sticks and leave the area. David Gandy, Britain’s best-paid model, told his online followers that he was moving full-time to his other property in Richmond – and taking a handsome £800,000 profit on the terraced family home he has lovingly restored.But the fashion icon, 41, has also rather upset his neighbours, who are concerned they will no longer have someone to admire when out and about. “I will miss bumping into you in the Fulham Waitrose bread aisle,” said one distraught West Londoner.Another admitted to hunting for Gandy while he was shopping for his three-month-old daughter Tabitha Isabella: “I often found myself in the baby food aisle for no reason other than him!”Matt Hancock turned heads this week when he appeared in some teaser images for the next episode of the Diary of a CEO podcast by Steven Bartlett, of Dragons’ Den fame.But despite the former Cabinet minister’s black turtleneck and white trainers outfit combination, the real surprise was his public appearance with his new partner, Gina Coladangelo – who memorably appeared in photographs kissing Hancock shortly before his departure from the Department of Health.I gather Hancock’s colleagues on the green benches are growing tired of hearing about his new flame. One MP grumbles that they had been told rather enough about her since she came on the scene, while a friend adds wryly: “Matt and Gina are very much in love.”Peterborough reported last week that John Bercow had been voted off in an early round of a celebrity version of The Weakest Link. Now I hear the former Commons Speaker has narrowly avoided a brush with the regulators. Bercow has taken to charging £80 a pop for videos for his fans, and was last month asked to record a clip about cryptocurrency, in which he urged viewers to “stop selling” and exercise “calm, stoicism, fortitude, and good order”. Unfortunately, the video was not clearly marked as financial advice – and he found himself reported to Britain’s advertising standards watchdog. A source in the room tells me he escaped investigation because the user who posted the video was Portuguese, so fell outside the body’s jurisdiction. Fines for breaking the rules are unlimited. He might be safer sticking to after dinner speeches.Peterborough, published every Friday at 7pm, is edited by Christopher Hope, the \u0027s chief political correspondent and the author of the daily Chopper\u0027s Politics newsletter.

Earlier this month, the Prime Minister announced that he was bringing forward the date at which the remaining legal restrictions would end. The NHS has not faced, as some had feared, an unsustainable wave of omicron admissions this winter. Thanks, in part, to the success of the booster programme, the UK has remained relatively free, certainly when compared to some European countries.There is a risk, however, that the formal end of the last legal measures will not result in a full return to normality. There is a debate, for example, about the continued provision of “free” tests to the population, with the Labour leader saying that ending the policy would be a mistake. But it is becoming harder and harder to justify the huge sums of public money spent on this initiative. We do not spend billions of pounds testing for flu, so why should we do so for Covid, especially now that the vast majority of the population has been vaccinated? All it arguably encourages is unwarranted paranoia about the coronavirus.Then there is the continued risk aversion of some local authorities, schools and hospital trusts. Already, some public sector leaders have made it clear that they intend to keep some protocols in place for longer – seen, for example, in Sadiq Khan’s insistence that masks be worn on the Tube. This cannot be allowed to continue. The point of living with Covid is that iniduals should make their own minds up about the level of risk they are prepared to accept.

In particular, he addressed the effects of cancel culture, the obsession with pronouns and efforts to “decolonise” the curriculum and, indeed, our whole history.It was one of the first times that such a senior Conservative has actually lasered in on these matters, although Dowden’s colleague Kemi Badenoch has toiled in these vineyards for some years. The Prime Minister himself is reported to be wildly scared of being seen to be engaging in “culture wars”. And the reaction to Dowden’s speech by what remains of the Left-wing press might have been a reminder of why that is.For the Left-wing media immediately denounced Dowden in the usual ways. He was accused of both starting and stoking a culture war. This is how the Left operates on these matters. It wages a vicious culture war throughout every aspect of society, from women’s sports and education to a refutation of our entire history, and then when a conservative raises even the mildest objection, they accuse said conservative of “fuelling” or “starting” a culture war.If you doubt that such a culture war is occurring on the Left, then just look almost anywhere.Consider the 10-year old schoolchildren in Nottingham being encouraged by their teachers to write letters calling on the Prime Minister to resign.As ever, students in America take things one step further. Earlier this week, high school students in Pennsylvania made a video of themselves taking matters into their own hands. Specifically, they filmed themselves going through the stacks of their school library and forcibly “decolonising” it.In the video, they proudly gather up scores of books they can never have read, including a work on Rousseau and a book by the distinguished feminist writer Christina Hoff Sommers, and throw them into bins and then a giant dumpster. “Just doing the Lord’s work,” was one of the labels they put on their video. I’m sure certain people in the inter-war years in Germany felt the same way.In the past year there have been some claims that conservatives are finally fighting back against such Left-wing excesses. In the United States, the election of Glenn Youngkin as governor of Virginia was in part achieved because he lasered in on the issue of so-called “critical race theory” being taught in American schools.The Left is slightly confused about how to answer these allegations. At present, they argue that this isive, race-baiting ideology at one and the same time doesn’t exist, is an invention of the Right, ought to exist, is excellent and should be taught everywhere. In fact, CRT certainly is being taught in US schools, and the evidence proves this in spite of the weird smokescreen put up by the American Left. In America, Youngkin’s election is seen as an important piercing of this dangerous nonsense.In the UK, we too can point to occasional victories. Some have pointed to the guidance issued to schools this week by the Department of Education recommending that contentious historical periods are taught in a “balanced” manner. Specifically, schools have been warned not to teach Black Lives Matter-style propaganda about “white privilege” and the like.Conservatives point to such guidance as victories. But the truth is that conservatives can win the odd election, and even issue the occasional piece of guidance to schools, and still woefully lose any and all cultural wars.As I have often pointed out, this problem even extends to the departments over which government ministers preside. The Civil Service in our country is infused with woke ideology, regularly participating in Diversity, Inclusion and Equity struggle sessions and the like. When it comes to public appointments, time and again the Civil Service try to ensure that only those with centre-Left or Left-wing opinions are deemed appointable to all public bodies.When you ask ministers about this, you tend to hear that these are initiatives that the Civil Service starts without the awareness of the politicians running the departments. It is a wholly inadequate excuse. If schools, universities or other public bodies were found to be doing things that their heads did not approve of, those heads would not be excused simply because they professed ignorance.Furthermore, it is exceptionally hard for ministers to lecture other public bodies to get a grip of the wildest extremes of woke in their own sector if ministers cannot get their own departments in order.The conservatives who tinker with, and make occasional interventions into these matters fail to recognise that the culture war in Britain is all but won.In America, the fight is very much still on, because American conservatives fight for every inch of ideological terrain. Often bitterly, occasionally histrionically, but dedicatedly and sincerely all the same.In Britain, by contrast, much of the Right appears to have given up a long time ago. Not in the media, or in all of our public spaces, but certainly among our public bodies and national institutions. Go, for instance, to Tate Britain in London and read the appalling denunciations in that gallery, by that gallery, of works that the gallery is exceptionally lucky to own. Just this week it issued a fresh condemnation of the beautiful and whimsical mural by Rex Whistler in its basement. A mural which the Tate has deemed, completely incorrectly, to be “racist”.Or read the description alongside one of the great masterpieces of the collection, The Resurrection, Cookham, by Stanley Spencer. A display caption placed by the gallery alongside this transportingly moving work also accuses Spencer of racism, because of what it claims are “generalising” depictions of non-white people in the painting.Spencer is guilty of reinforcing “racist stereotypes and isions” according to the Tate – thereby turning a deeply moving depiction of the Resurrection of all of humanity on the Day of Judgment into yet another banal lecture in dodgy racial politicking.Will the Tate suffer any withdrawal of funds – private or public – over these outrageous interventions of ideology into art? It should. But the moment any minister suggested such a thing, the Left would claim that the Government was engaging in a culture war.Whereas, of course, it is the Tate and its crepuscular, ignorant and cowardly trustees who are the ones polluting one of our great national collections with their juvenile radical ideology.There is a struggle going on at present over everything to do not just with our present, but with everything that ever happened in our past. Though even to say that this is a struggle is to present it as more fought-over than it is. In reality, it is a great stampede in one direction, occasionally responded to in speech, occasionally responded to in some school guidance. But it is a stampede which conservatives in Britain have vastly underestimated. To everybody’s peril.More from NewsWhen will free Covid lateral flow tests end in the UK?What is a sting jet and could Storm Eunice be deadly?Storm Eunice: Massive clean-up operation hampered by more weather warningsBetting shops and bingo halls could be blocked by councils in gambling crackdownComedy was funnier when it didn\u0026#39t seek to change the worldMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"parliament faces calls crackdown 13m","story":"Parliament faces calls for crackdown on £m back door lobbying networkCommittee chair Chris Bryant called for Parliamentary authorities to have the power to shut down All-Party Parliamentary Groupsthere are conflicts of interest.

The responsibility for the welfare and wellbeing of our most vulnerable citizens should not rest on the shoulders of charities, nor supermarkets. It’s easy to paint the large ­corporations as the villains, but questions need to be asked as to why people need p spaghetti and p pasta to survive in one of the richest economies in the world.  And the answers lie squarely at the well-heeled feet of those who have held the purse strings and policies of the country for the last  long and dismal years. Those years of austerity cuts to social care and health services mean the safety net of a decent and supportive society is less than threadbare. The triple threat of rocketing food prices, unmanageable energy bills, and an underfunded National Health Service is going to cause long-term damage to families, communities, and ­iniduals in almost every ­neighbourhood in the country.

The LGA’s Safer and Stronger Communities Board chairwoman Nesil Caliskan said: “It is time we have a regulatory framework for gambling that, above all , prioritises protecting vulnerable people from gambling-related harm and gives powers to local communities.  “The Government should take steps to reduce the volume of advertising and marketing offers that are routinely made available via television and online. “The review is a golden opportunity for the Government to implement further measures that empower local communities and their elected representatives to determine what and how many gambling premises they have in their local areas. “It is unacceptable that councils have such limited powers to refuse applications for new premises.”  Figures from  showed two million gamblers hooked or at risk of addiction, with more than , already deemed problem punters.

If today, you were constructing the best model for a European trade organisation, would it resemble the bloated, bureaucratic, monolith run by unelected, mediocre, pro-German civil servants called the EU  And more than half the country, predominantly older people staunchly proud of Britain’s history and its ­constitutional monarchy, thought not. Well, I’d like to ask them,they were constructing a model British state today, would they have a Windsor at the head of it  Park this year’s fairy-tale narrative about the past seven decades being one long, glorious reign, and focus on the past few days. The heir to the throne faces a police investigation over claims his advisers fixed a CBE for a Saudi tycoon who had given a fortune to one of his charities. Charles denies any knowledge of a deal but can’t deny secretly meeting the tycoon in Saudi Arabia, welcoming him to Clarence House, and giving him the CBE at Buckingham Palace.  The Queen’s second oldest son has just agreed a reported £million payoff to a woman who claimed he raped her when she was , as a minor under US law, which he denies. In fact he denies ever meeting her. So we’re expected to believe he’s just given £million to a complete stranger. And the royals won’t denysome of his hush money comes from the Queen’s Duchy of Lancaster tax-deductible fund.

He will also remain a Queen’s ­Counsellor of State. I can’t wait to hear how he counsels her on legislation about sex trafficking. The views of York’s citizens are deemed irrelevantbecause in our monarchical system, subjects cannot question royals.

And the morality behind Buckingham Palace finally ordering Andrew to settle the allegations against him to save the precious Platinum Jubilee. But our elected representatives cannot mention such issues in the Commons, just as we can’t see how much royals leave in their wills, because as Parliamentary bible Erskine May states: “No question can be put which brings the name of the Sovereign or the ­influence of the Crown directly before Parliament, or which casts reflections upon the ­Sovereign or the Royal Family.” Hence why MPs are forced to take an oath of allegiance to the monarch and all their heirs. What a ludicrous, humiliating stitch-up. All to keep these accidents of birth ruling over us. And to think, most Brits believe the EU is an anti-democratic gravy train which keeps charlatans in clover, while our “democracy” is the envy of the world.

If you sell goods to the EU, or buy goods from the EU and bring them into the UK, you need to be able to prove that they meet the new rules of origin requirements to access preferential tarfs. It’s vital you understand the new rules to keep your business moving. To benefit from the preferential tarfs, you must have proof that any goods you import from the EU originate there, or any goods you export to the EU originate in the UK. Proof of origin can either be a statement of origin completed by the exporter, or evidence of the importer’s knowledge of where products originate. If you cannot prove the origin, you or your EU customer may be liable to pay the full rate of customs duty and could face penalties.

Her parents, Emily, , and Rob, , from Hertfordshire, received the devastating news just weeks after taking their newborn home that she had spinal muscular atrophy- a serious genetic condition that means her muscles are extremely weak and donapostproperly.Tilly cannot walk, sit without support or swallow and the disease also affects her respiratory muscles, resulting in the use of a ventilator to help her breathing at night, HertsLive reports. Every  or  minutes or so, either Emily or Rob has to use a suction machine, similar to what you may see at a dentist, to remove any excess saliva from her mouth since sheaposs unable to swallow.  When Tilly was diagnosed with type  SMA, the most severe of the four main types, in  the prognosis was bleak. Her parents had to grapple with the news that Tilly would unlikely live beyond the age of two - but thanks to the power of modern science that all changed. Mum Emily said: At the time of [Tillyaposs] diagnosis, this particular genetic condition was one of the biggest fatal genetic conditions for babies.  Instead of your muscles growing and getting stronger, they get weaker and weaker, so it affects everything. It affects your ability to move, to hold your head, to sit, and it also affects your respiratory muscles. Tilly needs support with her breathing at night and it also affects her swallowing muscles, so sheaposs fed by a gastrostomy. The charity SMA UK has been at the forefront of research into the condition and a trial for the drug Nusinersen, marketed as Spinraza, was going to become available.However, at around six months, Tilly became gravely ill and was fighting for her le in intensive care. Although they said maybe two years [as a prognosis], it was more sort of seven to  months. Then she got really sick around six-and-a-half months and it was almost what theyaposd said and what Iaposd read from other peopleaposs stories. She continued: She pulled through and itaposs hard to think of that period because now I feel so hopeful with how she is doing, and Iaposm really proud of how sheaposs doing. The face of the disease has changed. At  months old, she was given a leline. As part of an expanded access programme, Tilly was given the treatment which she takes every four months. Itaposs been incredible, added Emily, and itaposs basically halted the progression of the disease. Sheaposs actually made a lot of gains. She can now sit up and has a lot of support, she has a spinal brace on. She can hold her head and sheaposs been doing really well. The treatment is a lumbar puncture into the spine, and Emily says itaposs been a game changer for families and iniduals living with the disease.  All these children with SMA who wouldnapost have been expected to survive beyond two are now really thriving, she added. As Tilly gets older there could be some complications with the treatment. For example, itaposs quite painful and becomes harder to administer, making it more likely to fail. Thereaposs also the possibility of scoliosis in the future too, and this could bring about further issues. But there is the possibility of a one-off treatment called zolgensma. It was originally licenced for children up to  months, meaning Tilly wasnapost eligible. Her parents are waiting to seethis may be something she can have in the future. While itaposs a positive step, itaposs hoped that there will be a cure one day, instead of a treatment that just halts the disease. That being said, the options now are a far cry from when Tilly was first diagnosed. Due to her condition, Tilly needs constant  hour care. She also has chest physio every day and hydrotherapy, which Tilly enjoys every other week, and is vital to help her muscles. Both Emily and Rob are also offered respite care for a few hours a week. Sheaposs needed a lot of support, Emily went on, but sheaposs a really happy girl. Sheaposs really brave, bright and sociable.On May , Tillyaposs family and friends will be embarking on a -mile walk from Great Ormond Street to their home in Sawbridgeworth to raise money for the childrenaposs hospital and for a new wheelchair for Tilly. Emily will be joined by her cousin Faye Morgan-Wren and friend Kate Ings, who both helped organise the event, as well as Tillyaposs granddad Bill, and Emilyaposs friend Laura Smith. I feel increasingly hopeful about the future, Mum Emily said. I feel hopeful for patients with SMA, and I think advancements in treatments really are changing the face of the disease. I want people to know, and other families who have children with this condition, that there is hope.

Despite suggestions from Location, Location, Location star Kirstie Allsopp that young people can more easily afford to buy a homethey “just move somewhere cheaper”, the pair were convinced London was the place for them and didn’t want to consider leaving the city. And with Jordon having started to save when he was a teenager, he was fairly well set up with savings by the time he began thinking about home ownership.It started when I was , Jordon toldMy London , of his saving to buy a home. My father had a financial adviser who would come over to help with finances and accounts, and after their meeting I asked: aposWho was he  What was that about  Should I open up one of those savings accounts apos Jordon grew up in Canada, where they have a type of savings account called a Registered Retirement Savings Plan designed to be used for saving for retirement or for large purchases. I started that, and my parents were contributing a small amount to it while I was in school, then when I was  or  I got my first job, Jordon said. I started to put about  per cent of my weekly earnings into that, and I put on an auto-enrolment so it just took a certain amount out of my account every month.  When I moved to the UK in  I opened a Help to Buy ISA, and began contributing to that, so I had my savings in Canada and the ISA over here. The Help to Buy ISA is a scheme in which the government will top up any savings in your ISA by  per centwhen you buy your first home. Itaposs valid on homes with a purchase price of up to £,, or £, in London. Applications for the scheme are now closed, but those who already have the ISA open can claim the  per cent bonus until November . There is also a new Help to Buy equity loan, for which first-time buyers need at least  per cent of the sale price of their new-build flat or house as a deposit. The government lends you up to  per cent - or  per centyou live in London - of the sale price, up to the regional limits. In London, the regional limit is £,.  You then borrow the rest from a mortgage lender, and the equity loan from the government is interest-free for five years. Jordon says the Help to Buy scheme was a huge help to him and Cormac, but the main bulk of his deposit came from savings heaposd been building on since he was a teenager. By October , Jordon and Cormac had saved enough to put a deposit down on their first home. Jordon says he was stung a little by the exchange rate from Canadian Dollars to GBP, but he was pleased that the deposit didnapost use up all of his savings. He was really pleased to have that buffer - helped, too, by the £, he got from the Help to Buy ISA scheme - because he needed to buy furniture and decor for his new flat. Jordon and Cormac now pay around £ a month for their mortgage repayments on their new two-bedroom flat inBarratt Londonaposs Hounslow development, High Street Quarter, which is just over half of what they were paying on rent for their previous one-bedroom home.While houses are certainly cheaper outside of London, leaving the city wasnapost something Jordon and Cormac wanted to consider. Jordon works as a clinical audiologist in Harley Street, while Cormac works as a SEND teacher in a school thataposs a -minute walk from where they live. Things may be cheaper, but not that much cheaper, outside of London, Jordon said. And the cost of public transportation in the UK is astronomical. “You guys pay a fortune for public transport. So any savings are offset by that, and evenyou save, I donapost know,  per cent [buying outside of London], you pay for that in the time cost of travelling too. Jordon says he loves having a home to call their own, with extra space for family and friends to visit from Canada or Ireland, and also knowing heaposs got an asset that heaposs invested in. Itaposs also nice to have our own space, to do what we want with it,” he said. “We just started painting the walls, and it was nice to not have to think about painting it back to white when we hand it over.” To others looking to get on the housing ladder, Jordon suggested ignoring the baby boomers who are like: aposStop having your avocado toastapos. Avocado toast isnapost breaking the bank. It isnapost the defining factor, he said. But trying to be more money conscious where you can, really askingcertain habits are conducive to or helping you to attain the money goals and milestones that you want to meet, is important, too, he said. Jordon also said that having a financial adviser is very helpful, and shopping around for the best financial products in terms of interest rates and promotional rates is crucial. He made sure to pay off his high interest debts first, making sure to use balance transfers for credit cards to pay as little interest as possible, and also ensured that he apospaid himself firstapos on payday - putting aside savings that canapost be touched the moment he got his paycheck to ensure he doesnapost overspend. Donapost be remiss to moving a little bit further afield, too - there are some lovely places within Zone  and  in London that people can take advantage of, he added.

Christopher Clinton, from Thornaby-on-Tees, North Yorkshire, sought £, compensation after a car accident on the A in Middlesbrough, back in . After the video emerged on his social media, Christoper must now pay thousands of pounds in costs,TeesideLive reported .At the time of the crash, the -year-old claimed he had injuries to his spine, hips and right shoulder. He said he was not fit to work as an asbestos remover as his job required a lot of physical activity. In , Christopher made a claim for loss of earnings because he couldn’t work and the ongoing pain.  Insurance company AXA UK reserved up to £, for the claim, as well as a further £, for his legal costs. However, due to the relatively uncomplicated nature of the crash and his age, the insurance company launched an investigation. This is when they discovered social media posts and videos showing Christopher taking part in extreme sports as well as surfing down a staircase on a construction site after he had had the accident.  He was also filmed rock climbing, skiing and swimming. Damian Rourke, from law firm Clyde  Co, said: Mr Clinton’s posts showed a very active inidual, carrying out extreme and demanding physical activities shortly after the accident. These included activities like rock climbing and skiing that simply couldn’t be carried out or even contemplated by someone with the reported ongoing physical problems.  When Mr Clinton was confronted with the evidence from his social media, he discontinued his claim in October . Deputy District Judge Crammond, sitting at Middlesbrough County Court on January , ruled that Mr Clinton had been fundamentally dishonest and ordered him to pay £, in costs. Mr Rourke added: Insurance companies and the courts will not tolerate any attempts to exaggerate injuries in order to get money.  Mr Clinton certainly didn’t help himself by filling his social media with videos of sports and activities, none of which could have been donehis claims were true. Also, at a time when the pandemic has created a log jam throughout the legal system, his action was a complete waste of the courtaposs time and delayed other more worthy cases. Tom Wilson, Head of Counter Fraud Operations at AXA UK, added: The decision against Mr Clinton should serve as a warning to anyone who is considering making a fraudulent claim. This was a clear attempt by Mr Clinton to take full advantage of an incident through exaggerating his insurance claim. The visual evidence found on Mr Clinton’s social media after the event highlighted the extent of the deception.

The current secretary had initially said he would look at the idea for England but has since thrown out the idea, The Sun reports.A source told the paper: “All the studies show the impact is negligible for the huge amounts of money that would be needed.

Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter hereAny universal change to the school day would involve signicant delivery considerations, a Department of Education review found. The review found it dficult to consider how to realise the additional teaching capacity required in order to facilitate delivery within existing legislative, contractual and workforce supply constraints. Studies have since shown that there would be minimal impact on outcomeskids were kept in school for longer. The challenge of ensuring that any additional time is not only delivered but also used well would require legislation and accountability measures sufficient to ensure quality, the review added. Teachers unions, meanwhile, have warned an extension of the school day could create an unsustainable burden on schools. In Wales, trials of longer days started earlier this month - adding five hours a week for certain pupils. A spokesperson for the Department for Education however said there had been no change in position in recent days. They added: It’s clear the pandemic has affected inidual schools and pupils dferently, meaning more targeted, flexible interventions – such as an expanded tutoring programme and signicantly increased Recovery Premium – are the most effective ways to support pupils to catch up on missed learning. The evidence is also clear that any increase in time spent in school or college will be of greatest value to students in -, given they have the least time left in education. That’s why we are increasing learning time for those students, investing £ million to add an extra hour per week of education – or  hours per year.

It is thought to be the first time a member of the royal family has brought a case against Her Majestyaposs Government.  Prince Harry - who is not in court this morning - wants to fund the security himself instead of asking taxpayers to foot the bill.Introducing the case this morning, Shaheed Fatima QC, for the Duke, said: This claim is about the fact that the claimant does not feel safe when he is in the UK given the security arrangements applied to him in June  and will continue to be applied to him. She continued: It goes without saying that he does want to come back to see family and friends and to continue to support the charities that are so close to his heart. Most of all, this is and always will be, his home.Mr Justice Swt said todayaposs proceedings were not the main hearing of the Dukeaposs claim and that it would focus on which parts of the court documents will remain private and which will be made public. At the preliminary hearing, the court heard an application by both sides for some parts of the court documents in the case to be kept private. The judge said part of Fridayaposs hearing would be heard in private, adding thatit was not it would destroy the purposes of the application before Iaposve had the opportunity to decide whether it should succeed or fail. The judge later said he would not be issuing his judgment on Friday, but instead in writing at a later date.He added: Part of that judgment may need to be confidential andso that part of the judgment will not be made publicly available. The judge said: My reasons for whatever conclusions I reach today will be made public. Last month, lawyers acting for the Duke of Sussex have written a pre-action protocol letter to the Home Office. It revealed that they would seek a judicial reviewcontinued security is not provided by the UK, when he and his family visit.  The Queen was said to have been notied in advance of Harryaposs plan to send the letter. Prince Harry was to said to have been unhappy with how his security was dealt with in the summer when he ed to the UK for the unveiling of a statue of his mother, Princess Diana.When Harry arrived in April for the funeral of his grandfather Prince Philip, Harry was met on the tarmac at Heathrow Airport by Scotland Yard protection officers.But when he came back again in July, it is thought that was not the case, and it is understood Harryaposs car was chased by photographers as he left.

The monarch is a proud great-grandmother to  little ones ranging in age from  to just five months. But just because they are relatives of Her Majesty does not mean they have royal titles.In fact, only three of them do, they are the Duke and Duchess of Cambridgeaposs children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. And some of them have not even made an appearance on the Buckingham Palace balcony at events such as Trooping the Colour.Here we take a look at the young royals who donapost have titles, and which ones havenapost been on the balcony yet... Savannah and Isla Phillips Two of the older of the Queenaposs great grandchildren without titles are Savannah and Isla Phillips.The girls, who are stood either side of Princess Charlotte in the newly seen picture are the daughters of Her Majestyaposs oldest grandchild Peter Phillips. When Peter, the son of Princess Anne, was born in , he wasnapost given a title, despite being fth in line to the throne.

This explains why Savannah, , and nine-year-old Isla do not have titles either. However, they have appeared on the Buckingham Palace balcony - most memorably during Trooping the Colour in .On that day, a cheeky Savannah could be seen teasing Prince George - putting her hand over his mouth as the National Anthem played.Mia, Lena and Lucas Tindall  Another three children to feature in the charming new image are Mia, Lena and Lucas Tindall.Their parents are the Queenaposs granddaughter Zara and her husband, former rugby player Mike Tindall. Zara, a daughter of Princess Anne, followed in the footsteps of her older brother Peter by not being given a title - so none of her children have one either. As of yet, none of the Tindall youngsters have made a balcony appearance with the rest of the royals. Archie and Lilibet Despite their dad Prince Harry being sixth in line to the throne and having the grand title the Duke of Sussex - his children Archie and Lilibet are yet to have titles of their own.However, this could all change in the future and they could become a prince princess with a HRH style and itaposs down to a rule set down more than  years ago. But will only happen when their grandfather Prince Charles becomes King.The tradition stems from Harryaposs great-great-grandfather, George V when he issued a Letters Patent in . A spokesperson for Debrett’s previously told the Mirror: “In , King George V ordered that only the grandchildren of the monarch would be entitled to use the style of prince or princess and HRH, the only exception to this order was that the eldest son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales would also be entitled to use the style HRH and Prince. The Queen stepped in ahead of Prince Georgeaposs birth to issue a Letters Patent to ensure all the Cambridgesapos children would have fitting titles. However, this does not extend to Archie and Lilibet - although when Charles is King they will be the grandchildren of the monarch and can be styled HRH and prince or princess. They too have yet to appear on the Buckingham Palace balcony - and its still unclearwe will see them up there later this year during the Platinum Jubilee Celebrations. August Brooksbank August, who turned one just weeks ago, is the baby son of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank.Unlike his mum Eugenie, who is a princess and has a HRH title - August does not as he is th in line to the throne. The royals last balcony appearance became before August was born so maybe he will be there later this year during the jubilee events  Sienna Mapelli MozziFinally, the youngest of the Queenaposs  great-granchildren is Princess Beatriceaposs daughter Sienna Mapelli Mozzi.She was born just last September and again, unlike her mum, has not been given a title from the Queen.However, as her dad Edoardo is an Italian count, she will inherit a count or countess title.  Edoardoaposs dad, Count Allessandro Mapelli Mozzi, once told the Daily Mail : “Edoardo is the only male descendent taking the family into the next generation.“He is a count, his we will be a countess automatically and any of their children will be counts or nobile donna.” Like her cousin August, she is too young to have made a balcony appearance but maybe will later this year.

Passengers reported a Ryanair flight from Fuerteventura to Manchester erted to Bordeaux in France -  miles away - because of the stormy weather. Itaposs understood one flight was forced to continue north to Glasgow Airport, Manchester Evening News reports. Manchester Airport reported dozens of cancelled flights -  in total both outbound and inbound - but said the bulk were apospreemptiveapos. Many cancellations were also thought to be due to adverse weather at a flightaposs point of origin rather than conditions in Manchester. A spokesman said the airport was operating as normal, although the ongoing situation would be monitored.  Aviation analytics firm Cirium said at least  flights due to take off or land at UK airports were cancelled on Friday. They said Heathrow suffered the worst flight disruption, with a fth of all flights cancelled. That was followed by London Cityand Manchester .  It came as more than , people tuned in to a YouTube channel livestreaming aircraft battling with high winds as they attempt to land at London’s Heathrow Airport. A Manchester Airport spokesman said: Manchester Airport continues to operate as normal, and we will monitor the situation throughout the afternoon and evening. A number of airlines have preemptively cancelled or rearranged their flights today for a iety of reasons.  As always, we advise passengers to stay in contact with their airline for the most up-to-date status of their flight. We are also strongly encouraging passengers to allow extra time for their journey to the airport today, and throughout the weekend, given the likelihood of ongoing disruption, including on road and rail networks. There were reports across the country of planes struggling to land at airports due to the high winds, with many being erted or requiring several attempts before touching down.  Passengers on easyJet flight EJU from Bordeaux to Gatwick endured two aborted landings before the plane was put in a holding pattern over the south coast and then forced toto the French city. It touched down back at its starting point more than three hours after it departed. British Airways flight BA from the US city of Chicago was due to land at Heathrow but was erted to Geneva, Switzerland.  So-called aposgo-aroundsapos are a common manoeuvre. Itaposs a standard landing procedure to take the plane around for another go at approaching the runway. Skilled pilots are often forced to use the procedurethey experience a late, sudden gust of wind, which conditions such as todayaposs brought. Several planes reached the skies above their arrival airport, but were forced toto their starting points. They include an easyJet flight from Bordeaux, France, to Gatwick, a British Airways flight from Edinburgh to Heathrow and a Lufthansa flight from Munich to Heathrow.

Pharmacist Sofia Love, , was diagnosed with eczema at birth and was prescribed creams as a teenager to prevent her skin from developing a painful and itchy rash.With her medication proving less effective as she reached her late teens, Sofiaaposs GP prescribed her a higher potency steroid cream at the age of  to alleviate her worsening symptoms. For five years her cream successfully reduced the red, painful rashes associated with the skin condition. However, in July , Sofia, from from Derbyshire, had a major flare-up in which the skin on her arms, legs, and face became red, inflamed, and itchy.  She began to think that the steroid creams she had been taking for so long were not proving to be as effective as they once had. After conducting her own research online and talking to an old friend from school who had suffered similar symptoms, Sofia began to believe her unbearably painful skin was a sign of topical steroid withdrawal - an adverse reaction to steroid creamsthey are overused or suddenly stopped. Since Sofia had been prescribed with her steroid cream for over five years, she was convinced that this was the root cause of her growing problem. Sofiaaposs condition continued to worsen and her flare ups would leave her with cracked, flaky skin and red, crusty eyes. She even had to go to AE after the extreme dryness in her eyes led to her cornea becoming stuck to her upper eyelid.  Visits to three dferent GPaposs in order to try and find a solution to her ongoing problem did not help, with doctors either not recognising topical steroid withdrawal or conversely offering alternative steroids to combat her symptoms. In January , Sofia decided that she was going to stop taking steroid creams altogether - however, the period of aposcold turkeyapos that has followed has left her feeling worse than ever before. Sofiaaposs skin constantly feels like it is aposon fire apos and aposred rawapos and at night time, her skin cracks and oozes, leaving her pillow and bed sheets damp.However, sleeping is not a surety as the combination of soreness and itchiness has left Sofia suffering from insomnia for over three months.Alongside not using her steroid creams, Sofia is undergoing a aposno moistureapos treatment in which she limits the amount of baths she has each week and avoids moisturising creams in the hope that this will alleviate her soreness in the longer term. I have had eczema all my le and was even hospitalised as a baby because it was so severe, Sofia said. It then fluctuated throughout the years so in my teens I was put on hydrocortisone which seemed to help. This then became less effective so the GP then put me on Mometasone - a high potency steroid cream which I was using for five years between the ages of eighteen to twenty three.  I then had a major flare in July last year and I realised the steroids I had been taking were no longer effective. At the same time, a girl from school made me aware of what topical steroid withdrawal was by sharing her story. I was suffering from exactly the same symptoms and was convinced this is what was happening to me too. When I started to get flare ups I would notice it was always in my eye area and I would have these violent red rashes all up my arm. My skin feels like itaposs on fire and literally burning up.  Trying to regulate my temperature has been one of the most dficult things as my skin will feel like it is incredibly hot, but the rest of my body will be freezing cold. These flare ups often happen at night which has made regular sleep almost impossible and Iaposve suffered from insomnia as a result. My skin feels very thick, like an elephantaposs, and on some days it is painful just to move. It gets so dry and cracks easily which leaves me with oozing sores. I have spoken to three dferent doctors at my local surgery and none of them were able to advise me on what to do next. When I have tried to explain, they have offered me more steroids, which I refused. After struggling to explain her condition to ious doctors, Sofia hopes that sharing her story will spread awareness for the little-known condition. With alternative treatments including cryotherapy and red light therapy planned for the near future, Sofia is hopeful that the dficult journey she has had to endure will soon reach a positive conclusion. I am hopeful for the TSW community as we are growing stronger and wiser even in the short time I have been involved, said Sofia. However, we need additional support from our healthcare system as this condition can have a serious impact on your physical and mental health. I donapost think healthcare professionals have taken this very seriously, so I hope in the future doctors will tell people the implications of long term steroid use. For my own treatment, I am looking into cryotherapy and red light therapy as I have heard these can be quite effective for helping with TSW. Ultimately, I want to try and raise as much awareness as I can for the condition. I would have never had touched topical steroids knowing the long term implication it would have on my le.

Footage taken today at Birmingham’s BHX Airport shows a Vueling plane from Paris to Birmingham vigorously rocking from side to side as it approached the runway.A Ryanair flight from Dublin can later be seen crabbing before landing at the Midlands airport. Crabbing means to point the nose of the aircraft partially into the wind, to the left or right, while keeping the plane itself moving towards the runway.  In the midst of a busy period due to school half-term, a number of flights have been cancelled coming into and out of Birmingham Airport today to destinations including Dublin, Paris, Amsterdam, Munich and Frankfurt. Winds are expected to be at their fiercest between midday and pm in the West Midlands. Elsewhere, British Airways alone has cancelled at least  flights to and from London airports:  serving Heathrow,  at London City. All the cancellations so far are domestic and European.Several other airlines have cancelled some flights in and out of Heathrow, including Aer Lingus from Cork and Dublin, Swiss from Zurich, Lufthansa from Frankfurt and KLM from Amsterdam. Loganair has also cancelled more than  domestic flights including routes from Manchester, Aberdeen, Liverpool and the Isle of Man. At Gatwick, there were  cancellations and  delayed flights. Airports and operators are advising customers to check their websites for the latest flight information and to leave extra time to travel to the airport in case of disruption to the roads.

National Highways said high-sided vehicles and other “vulnerable” vehicles such as caravans and motorbikes could be blown over so should avoid bridges and viaducts. National Highways head of road safety Jeremy Phillips urged those travelling to “plan your trip and take extra care, allowing more time for your journey”. He said: “In high winds, there’s a particular risk to lorries, caravans and motorbikes so we’d advise drivers of these vehicles to slow down.” Network Rail urged customers to avoid travelling on Friday, with many services either cancelled or delayed, and trains running at mph due to the increased risk of having to brake for debris on the track. No trains will operate in Wales for the entire day.

Shocking footage from the M show a lorry being blown over in Wales as parts of the UK is under a aposdanger to leapos rare red alert for wind. A witness said work was underway to get one of the drivers out of his cab as two lorries had been blown over, WalesOnline reports. Traffic on the M motorway between Porthcawl and Margam came to a standstill as gusts of mph caused lorries to overturn in the stormy conditions. People have been advised to stay home as Storm Eunice barrels over parts of the UK. The storm has brought mph winds, the strongest ever recorded in England, the Met Office has confirmed. The Needles on the Isle of Wight recorded the unprecedented wind gust this morning, according to a tweet by the national weather agency.Just before am this morning the Second Severn Crossing was closing because of the conditions - making it the first time both Severn crossings have been shut.  It adds that this is provisionally the highest gust ever recorded in England.Huge gusts from Storm Eunice have ripped the O Arenaaposs iconic roof to pieces, as large holes were seen in the popular London venue. It comes as people in Suffolk have been warned to charge up their phones and prepare for a blackout, as high winds threaten the power supply.  Suffolk Resilience Forum has sent out a message to all residents as severe winds of up to mph are expected until pm.Footage taken today at Birmingham’s BHX Airport shows a Vueling plane from Paris to Birmingham vigorously rocking from side to side as it approached the runway. A Ryanair flight from Dublin can later be seen crabbing before landing at the Midlands airport.  Crabbing means to point the nose of the aircraft partially into the wind, to the left or right, while keeping the plane itself moving towards the runway.Forecasters fear the cyclone could unleash a devastating sting jet, not seen in Britain for more than three decades.The cyclone storm system is expected to bring hurricane winds in parts of the UK as Brits are advised to hunker down for the day.  The Met Office had already issued two rare red warnings, only the th time this highest level has been implemented by the national weather agency. Schools, businesses and transport have been locked down, with an array of other warnings to remain through the weekend.The worst of the weather today is forecast for South Wales and the south of England. Roads across the country have been blocked by falling trees and debris, with commuters in parts of the north and Scotland waking up to a blanket of snow. Rail services across the country were cancelled, while flights have also been delayed or cancelled in airports across the UK. People being told to only travel is absolutely necessary.  A sting jet is a rare system that sees an incredibly powerful, highly concentrated area of wind within a high-speed storm. The worst of the damage caused in the Great Storm of October  has been attributed to the phenomena - so named because its satellite photos resemble a scorpionaposs tail. They are just  miles in width and last up to four hours in storms that pass across Europe. The mph jets form when a stream of cold air is pulled down into a warmer system at the head of a storm, creating evaporation and accelerating airspeeds.

It has left many wondering how longs these conditions will last and when traffic delays and cancellations couldto normal. Wind gusts in the most exposed coastal areas have been predicted to exceed mph, with a record mph winds - the strongest ever recorded in England, confirmed at The Needles, on the Isle of Wight earlier today. The red warning has been in place since am and is due to remain until noon on Friday. There are also amber warnings which apply from am to pm and cover an even larger area. The Met Office added that the dangerous weather phenomenon known as a sting jet - a small area of highly intense wind inside a storm - could form later on Friday.A sting jet is a rare system that sees an incredibly powerful, highly concentrated area of wind within a high-speed storm. The worst of the damage caused in the Great Storm of October  has been attributed to the phenomena - so named because its satellite photos resemble a scorpionaposs tail.

The jets form when a stream of cold air is pulled down into a warmer system at the head of a storm, creating evaporation and accelerating airspeeds.Major incidents have been declared across come cities and counties, with people advised not to travel unless essential.Suffolk is the latest to do this, with residents warned to charge up their phones and prepare for a blackout, as high winds threaten the power supply.  Suffolk Resilience Forum has sent out a message to all residents as severe winds of up to mph are expected until pm. Eunice comes on the back of Storm Dudley, which claimed one le and left thousands of people without power.BBC Wales weather presenter Behnaz Akhgar said: Weaposve got rain to start the day but it will clear through pretty quickly and this storm will go through pretty quickly as well.So we are expecting the main impact of the storm mid-morning and then by this afternoon it will ease off slightly so less of a danger to le later but still will have severe gales through the afternoon as well. More windy conditions to come tomorrow with outbreaks of rain over the weekend.  The forecasting service issued the warning, which covers south Wales and much of southern England, saying: Further strong winds are expected in some southern areas of the UK, which could hamper recovery efforts from Storm Eunice. There is a small chance that some roads and bridges could close and road, rail, air, and ferry services could be affected causing delays and longer journey times. Infrastructure recovery works resulting from Storm Eunice could also be hampered, i.e. power cuts may be prolonged.  The Met Office forecast for Wales for the weekend reads:A dry start with winds easing off. But a band of rain and hill snow soon sweeps across the region through the day, this also bringing gales along southern coasts. Maximum temperature °C. Winds strengthening again on Sunday with early rain turning to showers. Turning drier and less windy over the course of Monday before a band of rain pushes through on Tuesday.

Melissa Tweedie was this week struck off the teaching register after a regulator deemed her behaviour had fallen “signicantly short of the standards” expected.The then--year-old is said to have joined an -year-old pupil from Glenfer High School in Paisley, Scotland, in his hotel room after prom where they had sex.In the freshly released footage, Tweedie is seen wearing a red dress perched on a bed surrounded by young women, and holding a glass of wine, reports the Daily Record. Later that night in June , she is alleged to have told the teen: Can we for a minute act like I’m not a teacher   Other snaps from the leaving do at Glasgowaposs SWG show the former teacher on the dance floor and on a stage, surrounded by pupils. Any with evidence of the night was allegedly told to erase it. A source at the school said yesterday: This picture was taken after the prom as Melissa was hanging out with some of the sixth form girls with a glass of wine in the hotel. Of course, we all know what happened next.  “There were no drugs and nobody knows anything about her drink being spiked, as Miss Tweedie claimed to her bosses. The next day it was a bit crazy as rumours started to spread about what had happened. “This picture in the hotel has been circulating among the pupils - even though pupils were warned to delete any pictures on their phones of Miss Tweedie in the hotel.  The General Teaching Council for Scotlandheard Tweedie was seen by colleagues dancing inappropriately with pupils and drinking shots at the bar. She later went back to the Premier Inn - but claimed she only did so because of concerns pupils were taking drugs. Tweedie also told investigators that she woke up in bed beside the pupil the next day, but denied she had slept with him and claimed she may have been spiked.The allegation that she slept with the the young man, known as aposPupil Aapos, was found not proven by the . This is despite the teen claiming that he had slept with her after drinking wine, gin, shots and beer. But Tweedie, who now works in Dubai as a yoga instructor, was found to have kissed the teenager. Gary Burton, presenting officer on the , said: “There has been no evidence of remediation and given the lack of insight, remorse or evidence of remediation I submit that the risk of repetition is signicantshe was permitted toto the profession.”  The pupil at the centre of the case told the hearing he felt “sorry” for the teacher. He said: “We kissed, no one initiated it. We went downstairs and had sex in my room. “I feel really sorry for Miss Tweedie, I had already handed in my leavers form. In my eyes, it wasn’t a student event.” Police Scotland found no criminality had taken place.Read MoreRead More Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON EducationSchoolsSecondary schoolTeenagers\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Holidaymakers set toon a TUI flight from Sal to Birmingham say they were stuck in the airport for five hours with no information when their flight was delayed and eventually cancelled  minutes before it was due to depart. The disappointed flyers were later taken back to a hotel on a coach, where they were told there had been a medical emergency onboard the outgoing flight, which forced the pilot to make a stop in Tenere. It wasnapost until the next daythat the flight eventually touched down in Birmingham,  hours and  minutes later than scheduled. One passenger branded the experience a complete farce and vowed to never fly with TUI again.A TUI spokesperson said the airline did everything it could to get people home as quickly as possible, while one passenger told BirminghamLive his appeal for compensation had already been rejected.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter hereNatalie Elward, a passenger from Cardf, said rumours started to fly when the departure board in Sal Airport was switched off.My husband was on a Facebook group for our hotel and someone had mentioned on there that something had happened to the flight, said Natalie, .It was all whispers and rumours, nobody was sure what was going on. Iaposm disabled and I have to use a wheelchair when I go through the airport. I was stuck in it for six hours just waiting for someone to tell us what was going on. If we werenapost with the friends we were with, I would have cried. I was in a lot of pain. Eventually, one of the airport staff came over and said we definitely werenapost flying until the morning. We didnapost get any details about what was going on until we were on a coach going to the hotel. Thataposs why people were going mad, no one knew what was happening. We had to go back and collect our baggage then the whole flight was queuing for the coach, which was going back and forth. It was a nightmare. Obviously everyone understood that a poor manaposs health comes first, but it was the lack of communication, it was so stressful. Natalie added: The holiday was a dream, it was paradise. We were staying in a five-star hotel, all-inclusive up until that point. But once you get into the mode of going home, we just wanted to get out of there.  And there was more confusion the next morning after some people missed a .pm email from TUI while they were asleep, saying their rescheduled flight had been pushed back to later that morning. Tim Bingle, who travelled to Birmingham Airport from Buckinghamshire, said: We were told originally that a coach would be picking us up at .am the next morning so my we and I went to bed at pm. We got up about .am, got all of our stuff ready and went over to reception, only to find a note stuck on the counter saying the flight time had changed and the pick-up time would now be .am. What were we meant to do at that point  I told the TUI rep when the coach turned up that weaposd been waiting there three and a half hours and they said an email had been sent about .pm the night before. But of course, most people were asleep by that point. Itaposs ridiculous. He added: The whole thing was horrendous. Itaposs one of the worst holidays Iaposve ever been on in my le. I understand planes get erted and people get ill, but at the end of the day it just comes down to communication and we were given no information until much later on. The plane finally touched down in Birmingham  hours and  minutes later than scheduled, which passengers say was followed by another -minute delay while they waited for steps to become available. Tim says his claim for compensation from TUI has been rejected on the grounds it was caused by a medical incident. He said: People were getting very stressed and very aggravated by the end. The very least they could have done is offer us a free drink on the plane but we didnapost even get that, it was a complete farce. I % wonapost be flying with TUI again. A TUI spokesperson said: We can confirm that TOM from Sal to Birmingham on February  was delayed due to a passenger on the outbound flight requiring urgent medical attention. We understand delays can be frustrating, but we did everything we could to get passengers home as quickly as possible. The safety and wellbeing of passengers and crew is always our highest priority and we’d like to thank passengers for their patience and understanding.

At first, the washing line is the only thing anchoring the trampoline as it buffeted up into the air. But then both the washing line and garden toy fly out of her backyard.

Then Sunday sees the warning for wind and rain covering Scotland and northern England, while the alert for wind is still in place on Monday. Maps for WXCharts show that the mercury could drop to -C with up to nearly  inches of snow in Scotland on Saturday. The snow will also spread into northern England with several centimetres expected to land. Aidan McGivern of the Met Office said: Unfortunately, yet more wet and windy weather is expected this weekend, but not on the same scale as Storm Eunice.He continued: “Further showers come into Scotland, Northern Ireland and England, those falling as rain and sleet at lower levels, snow over the hills. And with temperatures dropping away, with lighter winds, with clearer spells there is a risk of a few icy patches.” A big clean-up is set to begin after Storm Eunice brought damage, disruption and record-breaking gusts of wind to the UK and Ireland, leading to the deaths of at least four people.  Millions of people were urged to stay at home on Friday due to safety fears over the impact of Eunice, one of the worst storms to hit the UK in a generation, while transport woes meant many were unable to travel. The windy conditions led to deaths and injuries in dferent parts of the country, along with travel disruption, flight cancellations, power cuts and police forces being inundated with calls. But the big clean-up could be hampered by the new yellow warnings in place. Train networks were disrupted with flying debris, while there was damage to buildings and homes.  A number of train operators extended warnings not to travel into Saturday. Winds of mph have been provisionally recorded at the Needles on the Isle of Wight, which,veried, would be the highest ever recorded in England. The previous record was mph at Gwennap Head in Cornwall in . Footage shared online captured planes struggling to land in high winds, damage to the roof of the O arena in London, and the spire of St Thomas Church in Wells, Somerset, crashing to the ground.  On the transport network, several routes were closed. Wind speeds forced both the M Prince of Wales Bridge and M Severn Bridge into Wales to close to traffic for what is believed to be the first time in history, while the Humber Bridge linking Yorkshire and Lincolnshire closed from .pm. The A in Buxton was also closed on Friday afternoon after a lorry blew over, causing minor injuries. Train operators across Britain urged passengers to avoid travelling altogether, with no services operating in Wales for the entire day and seven train operators suspending all routes. UK forecast for the next  days Today: Further rain moving eastwards across many parts, perhaps turning to snow briefly over parts of Northern Ireland, north Wales, the north Midlands and Yorkshire, a slight cover possible. Turning windy again in south, with coastal gales. Chilly in north. Tonight: Some snow for a time across Scotland. Otherwise rain is expected, heavy in the north and west, patchy and light in the south and sheltered parts where. Turning milder. Sunday: Persistent rain for some northwestern areas, before heavy, squally rain sweeps southeast. This followed by brighter weather and showers, wintry in northwest. Further gales mild start, colder in northwest later. Outlook for Monday to Wednesday: Changeable and often windy, with spells of rain interspersed with sunny clear spells and showers, wintry at times in the north. Mild by day, although some colder nights with occasional frost.

I had no clue how I was going to handle the situation until the lovely man approached me. At first I wasn’t sure why he was approaching me but he did something amazing.  She added: I felt a weight had been lted off my shoulders, I didn’t have to panic about what I was going to do in order to pay for my fuel. He took me back inside to the assistant and asked him to ‘pass the young lady her phone, I’m going to pay for her fuel’. Not only did he do this, but he also bought a chocolate bar for my little boy. The embarrassment and sadness was gone in a moment but at the same time, I was so taken back I couldn’t quite get my head around the situation. I instantly felt better and came to the realisation that someone really had just seen my struggle and helped where they could. It made me smile and I was just so so grateful and taken back that there are still some lovely caring people out there. Those with dignity and humanity. She continued: I would like to express my wholehearted thankfulness to him and how wonderful and kind he is. He came to my aid in my time of need, I’d love to thank him for coming to my rescue. It reinstates my belief that there are still great people out there who would do a wonderful sincere gesture to someone in need of help at a critical time. I think he’s just witnessed the whole situation of seeing a young lady with her little boy. And probably at some point in his le he has also been the person in front struggling. I would like to think he understands how it feels to be the other person and knowing himself he was in a position to help that’s why he did what he did. He must have been in a position to help otherwise why would he  Why me  Or maybe he just felt sorry for me, times are hard for everyone at the moment and some people are just in slightly better positions in le than others.

The charity is on a mission to provide a place of safety for animals in danger, to educate on the needs of neutering both pets and strays and to neuter stray dogs and cats to prevent the birth of more animals onto the streets. Victoria said: Happy is a really lovely boy who was hit by a car causing him to lose the use of his back legs. It has taken him a while to adjust to his new normal after being an active dog before his accident.Happy is incontinent and will require bladder expression three to four times a day - but Miracle’s Mission is able to provide training for this. Happy needs a garden with grass so that he is able to drag himself without developing sores, said Victoria He is a large dog so any potential foster carers or adopters will need to be able to lt him. Although he has been friendly to the other dogs in his current foster home, Harry has been known to have shown some aggressive behaviour in his previous home Victoria added: He could live with a calm and friendly female dog and any foster carer or adopter would need to have space to facilitate slow introductions. He is not cat or child tested. He is simply searching for a loving home that can accept and love a dog who is incontinent and uses wheels on walks.If you’re interested in rehoming Happy, please contact Miracle’s Mission viainfo@miraclesmission.org.

But after changing brands and seeing no improvement, her GP later diagnosed her with scabies and sent her away with some creams. After seeing a lump on her neck, doctors referred her to hospital - only to find out she had cancer. The make-up artist from Liverpool has gone viral on TikTok explaining how it took six months after scabies diagnosis for doctors to eventually discover her cancer. In November , April was diagnosed with blood cancer Hodgkinaposs lymphoma.April shared her experience in a video on TikTok, which has now racked up over . million views and , likes. “I had this sense that something was wrong, April told Jam Press. I’d even told my mum I thought I had cancer but she put that down to me feeling so anxious.  “Turns out I was right and I’m so glad I kept going back to the doctors. I knew my own body. She even sent her dog away for two weeks, just in case she was allergic. April said: “At first I was trying to work out what I was allergic to. My skin itched day and night from my head to my feet. I was tearing at my skin. “I couldn’t sleep and I was making myself bleed, I was red raw. I knew it couldn’t be scabies as it’s highly contagious and my boyfriend hadn’t caught it.  “I couldn’t get a face-to-face appointment because of Covid so I kept sending more pictures but the doctors said I had no rash or distinctive skin marks for them to make a diagnosis. “In October, I found a lump in my neck that grew quickly. Within three weeks I had an appointment at a specialist head and neck centre. “I was diagnosed with cancer that day after blood tests, CT scans and a biopsy showed I had blood cancer and it was a tumour on my neck.”April’s boyfriend, Sean O’Flaherty, , had been waiting in the car during April’s four-hour appointment but was allowed inside when she was told the news. April said: “I knew as soon as Sean was allowed in [that] it was cancer. I was so scared and just cried and cried. I couldn’t believe I had to drive home and tell my parents I had cancer. I was devastated.” April now faces six months of twice-weekly chemotherapy cycles to kill the cancer which has spread from a lymph node in her neck to her chest and around her windpipe. To make matters worse, April suffered a second tragedy when – before starting chemo – she underwent egg retrieval in case her future fertility was affected and suffered complications.  The fertility drugs used caused oian hyperstimulation syndrome , which made her oies swell and leak fluid into her body. April was in hospital for two weeks with fluid on her lungs and doctors ended up being able to retrieve seven eggs and four embryos. She recently took to TikTok to share her story in the hopes that it will help others and encourage them to trust their instincts. April added: “Iaposm raising awareness for everything Iaposm going through because I want people to know they know their body best.  “If my story helps one person to push for an appointment and listen to their body then I’ll be glad.” The clip racked up more than , likes and was viewed five million times. One user said: “So proud of you! Keep fighting angel x.” “Strong woman,” another person commented. Someone  added: “What you’re going through must be one of the scariest times in your le, thank you for sharing this.

Karyn added: It was like a slap in the face. I should listen to my friendaposs advice but I have to learn the hard way, it was a massive wake up call. I was telling Grace about my love le and how Iaposve been treated badly in the past and Iaposm basically giving up and losing hope. I wasnapost crying but I was definitely down.

Jonathan Gerrish, , who was originally from Lancashire, we Ellen Chung, , their one-year-old daughter Muji and the familyaposs dog, Oski, were all found dead in the Sierra National Forest in Calornia on August , . A police investigation into the mysterious deaths lasted months, but they ultimately concluded they died from hyperthermia and dehydration while hiking in C temperatures. Now the Mariposa County Sherfaposs Office has released the devastating messages the software engineer had tried to send out before dying. The final message read:can you help us. On savage lundy trail heading back to Hites cove trail. No water or verheating with baby.” The text never reached who it was meant for because of poor service. The dad had also attempted to make five calls to dferent numbers - none of which ever went through.  Sherf Jeremy Briese said the data from Jonathanaposs phone confirmed the teamaposs initial findings. Detectives had initially launched a murder probe but they then ruled out homicide. Jonathan, Ellen and Muji were found . miles from their vehicle in temperatures that could have soared above F , Mariposa County Sherf Jeremy Briese said. They were found with one empty water bottle and a bottle of formula between them, which indicated the heat and lack of sustenance likely contributed to their death.  For Mariposa County, this is rare, Sherf Briese told reporters at a conference. This is the first hyperthermia cause of death that Iaposve witnessed here in  years. A friend of the couple, Sidney Radanovich, told the San Francisco Chronicle they had recently relocated from San Francisco after falling in love with the Mariposa area. Radanovich added: They were such a loving couple, they loved each other quite a bit.  Their family had previously thanked police for having truly gone the extra mileapos in trying to find answers. In a statement, they said: “The loss of the family is pain beyond words and when that pain is compacted by lack of knowledge about their death, the questions of where, why, when and how to fill the void, day and night. “Some questions have been answered, and we will use this to help us come to terms with this. “They will remain with us wherever we go, or whatever we do”.

I had one teacher tell me, yeah, drop out, work at McDonald’s since I’ll never amount to anything more in le,” he said.  I dropped out of high school and made a bet with my parents:I make a million dollars by the time I’m , I don’t have to go back to school or go to college.

Even the police seemed mystied as to what was going on when they showed them aposhuman hairapos theyaposd found in their exhaust pipe.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here. Deborah told how she was planning a Valentineaposs party last Thursdaywhen her husband arrived home looking aposvisibly rattledapos. The -year-old AE doctor had a large aposclump of hairapos in his hand, explaining that it had been hanging out of their  Ford Expedition.Flustered, they headed out to the driveway, where William began fishing more of the stuff out of the exhaust pipe. Mum-of-four Deborah instantly feared there were human remains inside the family motor, before her true crime knowledge even led her to wonderit could be aposvoodooapos from someone aposout to get themapos. They called the police and even they were left stumped by the whole thing. Weaposd explained that we found it in our exhaust pipe, didnapost know what it was and assumed it wasnapost human hair, recalls Deborah. The law enforcement officer looked at it with total confusion. He was just as baffled as we were. He started kicking it around and looking for body parts. He said there werenapost any, there wasnapost a scalp thataposd make him think it was human hair and there was nothing to indicate it was once alive. He said heaposd file a report and went to ask our neighbours to review their CCTV. Thankfully Deborahaposs brother-in-law was soon able to solve the mystery - it wasnapost human hair at all, it was all caused by a broken silencer, which sheds insulation material when it is about to break.  Speaking about the ordeal, Deborah said: When William ed, he came in and was really flustered and rattled. He said aposDeb, thereaposs hair coming out of our exhaust pipeapos. He held up a clump of hair. He didnapost know what was going on. Heaposs a very calm guy, heaposs used to handling emergencies for work but he was very flustered. I knew something was freaking him out. He said there was a lot more in there and he couldnapost get it with his hands. He grabbed a clothes hanger and went off to finish pulling it out. I went outside to help him and when I got to our car, I saw this mound of hair.  She continued: I instantly thought it could be remains in the car. We listen to crime podcasts when riding in the car together. We both thought it looked exactly like human hair. I thought aposis this a witch-like thing  Is this voodoo apos I didnapost know much about it but it seemed like something out of one of the podcasts weaposd listened to, or The Ring, or Blair Witch Project. It looked like hair. It was soft like hair. I couldnapost really process what was going on. The pair went back inside while William washed his hands and decided they should call the police, fearful someone had tried to intentionally tamper with their car. We didnapost see anybody parts or claws that would make us think it was an animal. It almost looked like a Halloween wig, the mum explained It looked like an intentional act and someone was sabotaging our car. We didnapost know who, or why, but more importantly, we didnapost know what the hair was. Soon their mystery was solved and the couple couldnapost help but laugh when they learned the truth - admitting they were relieved not to be the protagonists in their own horror movie. Deborah, , shared images of the bizarre find online, where she claims her friends joked the aposhighlightedapos muffler hair looked nicer than their own. Deborah said: Weaposd sent out a message to say aposlook what we found - this is horribleapos. Our brother-in-law, whoaposs an IT guy, looked it up online and found what looked exactly like what weaposd found. He said in some cars thereaposs fibrous material they use for insulation. It looks and feels like human hair. When that breaks down, when a muffler is about to go, it sheds the hair-like product out of the tailpipe. I couldnapost believe anything mechanical could cause something like this but sure enough, it looked exactly like what weaposd found. People were seeing the story on social media and they were as horried as I was. I was surprised by the number of people who had had similar happen to them. A lot of my friends were like aposhow does this muffler have such beautul hair with highlights and lowlightsapos  They were joking that the muffler has nicer hair than them.We pay for stories.

The teacher was about to start work in China when she visited the village of Mapapa, in Zambia. She was shocked by the poverty she encountered and decided to set up a free school in the village.The mum also took in  children and started detailing her experience on Tik Tok, where her videos have garnered millions of views.

Today these children are fully clothed receiving nutritious, daily meals and are happy and thriving, free to play in a safe environment. Many of the children are now only one year from graduating elementary school. This presents us with the very real and urgent need for a secondary school.Without it, the children won’t be able to graduate high school and, in all likelihood, end up back where they started: living in places where food is scarce, the water unsanitary, and the girls facing the very real threat of being sold as child-brides. In addition, we are in desperate need of a proper medical clinic. Currently, the village clinic is a small, poorly equipped shack. What few supplies it has are frequently and easily stolen.The children who come to us are often in need of urgent medical care, some diagnosed with chronic illnesses.

The footage captures three of the shipaposs staff holding her arms behind her back as things turned frantic on deck.She can be heard yelling out the name aposAliciaapos as guards help her up a flight of stairs after an alleged hot tub incident. The unnamed passenger was on board the -floor Carnival Valor when it is claimed she jumped into the ocean. A search was then launched  miles from Louisiana coast, but it has now been called off by the Coast Guard in the Gulf of Mexico.  Crews threw le rafts and a flare to help Coast Guard officials with their search for the woman.The woman was removed by security following an alleged hot tub incident on the pool deck of the ship, which carries , guests and , crew members. She was on a five-day cruise that departed New Orleans on Saturday and struggled with security before going overboard.The video doesn’t show the moment she aposjumpedapos off the ship and it isn’t clear how she broke free from the guards.One passengers claimed the woman hit the side of the boat before hitting the water face first.Witnesses have come forward to give their accounts of what happened on board the , ton ship, and said she was escorted away by the Carnival Valor security. Passenger Kim Barnette told WAFB: Security got her out of the hot tub.Whenever they got to take her into custody, apparently she was upset and went over the rail.  Fellow holidaymaker Emil Avenarius told Nola: Security tried to calm her down, and she was belligerent toward them. They had to restrain her because she was combative. She broke loose and flipped herself over the side. The Coast Guard, who were assisted by its aircrew, searched about , square miles for  hours for the woman. They suspended their search at pm on Thursday.  The decision to suspend a search-and-rescue case is never one we come to lightly, Chief Warrant Officer Tricia Eldredge, Command Duty Officer at Sector New Orleans, told Fox . We offer our deepest sympathies to the family during this dficult time. Carnival confirmed their care team is providing support to the womanaposs husband and family.

Preparatory work starts from February  to drop kerbs and improve access.Business access will remain open, with some delays as work takes place outside doorways. The work is planned to minimise impact on the businesses.Resurfacing work on existing footpaths will start from February . Weather permitting, this phase of the work is due to take two-to-three weeks.Councillor Robin Currie, policy lead for the economy and rural growth, said: #We are committed to making Argyll and Bute a fantastic place to work, live and visit.#The Tarbert improvement works is great news for the town and community.

greeting those spectators who arrived to support the team.Refreshingly, though, a group of youngsters were amongst the entourage travelling with the north Glasgow visitors, and they soon felt at home, happily mixing with the Pupils# own young supporters and joining in song.First, an attempted Pupils clearance found its way to Finnart#s number , who kept his composure to slot home a close-range finish and make it two goals in two games against the Pupils.Then, a header from a swirling cross from Finnart#s left-hand side couldn#t be kept out, despite the efforts of Alasdair Ferguson in

He was protected well by right back Conner Brown, left back Burns and central defensive pairing Ross Souden and captain Keith Mitchell.With less than  minutes remaining, McCallum – who had shted into central midfield with the introduction of second sub and debutant Cameron Wylie at right midfield – intercepted a ball from a Glenvale player, his tackle putting Lang one on one with the hosts# keeper.Lang showed excellent composure for his tender years to slot the ball low into the net with his right foot, just inside the box, his teammates joining him in celebration.After seeing out the final five minutes of regulation time, four nervy minutes of added time were played as Glenvale pushed for an equaliser.In the st minute, Ferguson was called upon to make the save of the day, stopping a powerful Glenvale drive from  yards out, before a Pupils defender cleared the danger.The final whistle sounded soon after and the Pupils# squad and management could cheer a hard-earned, much-needed win, especially impressive considering the inexperience of much of the squad, who are still learning at this level, but judging by this showing, are certainly contributing.Tomorrow , the Pupils host high-flying Harmony Row from Govan, at Kintyre Park.Kick-off pm.

Avoid plantingthe ground is frozen or extremely waterlogged.Your planting hole should be no deeper than the roots, but at least three times the diameter of the root ball.It#s a good idea to soak bare-rooted trees for about  minutes before planting.Place the tree in the planting hole so the first flare of roots on the stem are level with the soil surface. If you plant the tree too deep, it can result in rot and disease.You may need to insert a stake for top heavy or larger trees. Refill the planting hole, firm gently and water in.Drought stress is common in newly-planted trees so make sure you keep watering throughout the growing season.

describes the proposals to axe music tuition as #catastrophic# and urged the council to re-consider.He wrote: #I feel it would be disastrous for the area to lose this essential musical training, not only to the local people whose lives are enriched by music, but also for the tourism on which so much of the local economy depends.#Campbeltown and the surrounding district is famed throughout the

If you are sure you know something to be the case beyond contradiction, you don#t need faith.Doubt, on the other hand, is strongly linked with faith because, while you may have faith strong enough to move mountains, there is always the possibility your faith is misplaced.I would argue the existence of God is proven by large amounts of evidence, but in the end that is a matter of faith.The Bible recognises this right at the start where Adam and Eve leave the Garden of Eden and do not see God face-to-face anymore.From now on, they, and we who come after them, must live by faith.This is what it is to be human – and faith is always open to challenge.When suffering occurs, when disaster looms, people ask, #Where was God # and use what has happened to deny God exists.Yet the faithful keep believing. Why There have been many attempts by faithful people to explain unbearable tragedies with faith in a loving God. Few are convincing – at least at the time.For me, the love that people give to one another is God reflected in human goodness.Living by faith is not easy. Sometimes it means being assailed by doubts and I believe we must be honest about our questions.After all, did not Jesus say: #The truth will set you free.# When those most bitter and painful tragedies strike us down, faith can be a consolation – sometimes the only consolation – even as at the time it is tested to breaking point."},{"url":null,"title":"minato-sushi-cheese-lady-boost-haddington-town-centre","story":"The Cheese Lady on Haddington High Street is moving into the former butcher premises of Colin D Peat on neighbouring Court Street.The move from High Street has opened the door for Minato Sushi to bring the Japanese delicacy to the town centre.The changing face of the town centre was welcomed by councillors Tom Trotter and John McMillan, with the new businesses set to open this summer.Jen Kerr, of Minato Sushi, stressed there was still plenty of work ahead at the business before the doors opened.The -year-old, of Port Seton, who will run the business with her boyfriend Tom Cuddy, described it as “a real dream come true”.She said: “We are really excited.

customers across the UK – from £, to £, – will see those on default tarfs paying by direct debit having to fork out an extra £ a year, while prepayment customers will see an increase of £ from £, to £,.The increase has been described as “absolutely devastating for households across Scotland” by Energy Action Scotland, which says it will force many to “choose between heating and eating”.The huge rise, which is being blamed on soaring global gas prices, is expected to see  per cent of households in East Lothian enter fuel poverty for the first time, while  per cent of households in the county are expected to be pushed into extreme fuel poverty as a result, according to the  local authority Scottish House Condition report.But residents who are struggling to make ends meet are being urged not to “suffer in silence”.Paul McLennan, East Lothian MSP, has vowed to do what he can to help people who find themselves in a challenging situation, while South Scotland MSPs Craig Hoy and Martin Whitfield have also urged those who need help to get in touch.: Energy price cap increase: UK households to pay £, from April after Ofgem announcementMr McLennan said: “One in three Scots already find bills unaffordable and almost half a million people across the country have had to sacrice food to deal with unaffordable bills – this is simply shameful.“My constituency team is on hand to help anyone who is worried about the upcoming energy price increase and can offer support in contacting your supplier, applying for Government grants, or signposting to consumer groups and charities who can help with calculating debts and understanding what your options are.“I know that many of these measures do not go far enough, but please do not suffer in silence as the energy cap increase comes into effect.“My team and I will do all that we can to help to prevent locals from making the choice between heating or eating.”Fellow MSP Mr Hoy also encouraged people to get in touch.He said: “It is deeply concerning that up to one in four East Lothian households are at risk of entering fuel poverty.“This is a global crisis and we must do all we can to support people at this hugely dficult time.“The UK Government and Rishi Sunak stepped up to provide extra funding to the Scottish Government and it is right that support was passed on in the form of council tax rebates.“However, the devil will be in the detail of who exactly will be eligible for these payments and we need to see that from SNP Ministers.“My team and I are keen to engage and happy to help any constituent who is struggling with recent increases in the cost of living.“Please do not hesitate to get in touch.”: Why is the UK suffering a cost-of-living squeeze and what action is being taken And fellow South Scotland MSP Mr Whitfield said: “The energy price cap rise is a devastating blow for thousands of local households, pushing many more into fuel poverty.“More must be done to support people, which is why Labour is calling for a windfall tax on oil and gas and a cut in VAT on energy prices to save Scottish households up to £, as well as targeted support for the hardest-hit with a £ Scottish Fuel Payment.“While the impact of rising bills will be deeply concerning for many, especially those on low or fixed incomes, it’s important to remember there is help available.“My staff and I can provide assistance, but East Lothian Council’s welfare rights service and local CABs, as well as national advice services, are also on hand to determinepeople are eligible for any additional funding.“As well as seeking to ensure households struggling with their bills get the help they need, I’ll also keep campaigning for further measures to support consumers and fix our broken energy market to help keep bills low in the future.”Kenny MacAskill, East Lothian MP, also expressed his concern over the price rise.He said: “Energy price rises, and at the level they’re coming in at, will hit many hard.“It’s absurd that East Lothian should see fuel poverty with a nuclear power station, wind energy set to flow ashore and Scotland energy sufficient in oil and gas. This isn’t a natural climate disaster but one largely of political making.“Action should be taken by both the UK and Scottish Governments to protect the poorest and mitigate hardship for all. Windfall taxes, VAT reduction and direct payments to the poorest and most threatened households are required. It confirms why Scotland must be in charge of its own energy policy and the natural wealth of its shores.”  Frazer Scott, CEO of Energy Action Scotland, said of the rise: “The energy price rises announced this month are absolutely devastating for households across Scotland.“It impacts most on those households in the lowest incomes, who spend a signicantly higher proportion of their incomes to heat and power their homes – or indeed simply cannot heat and power their homes to the comfort levels that maintain health and wellbeing.“These households will be unable to afford an adequate level of thermal comfort to maintain their health and wellbeing, and people will be forced to choose between heating and eating.“There are important short and long term priorities.“We are absolutely in a crisis and there needs to be a crisis response.“As it stands, the quantum of support provided by UK Government to Scottish Government is simply inadequate.“This payment appears to be better targeted to the households most in need compared to England but in Scotland this will provide little comfort to the , Scottish households in extreme fuel poverty, facing declining health and wellbeing, and excess deaths attributable to fuel poverty.”  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: “The East Lothian Poverty Plan adopted by the council in October  highlighted fuel poverty as a major and growing concern. It identied measures to be put in place to continue the work to combat fuel poverty and support people facing rising fuel costs.“The council has already increased its Scottish Welfare Fund budget by £, to increase support provided in crisis grants and a new Fuel Poverty Fund to help people in financial dficulty and facing hardship due to rising fuel costs.“We are aware that the predicted rise in fuel costs is a serious concern for East Lothian residents, so we will continue to monitor the situation and promote the financial advice and support available from the council and other agencies, including Changeworks, as well as working together with partners on any possible further interventions to support our residents.“This includes continuing our work to ensure that council homes are as

The podcaster, author and dating advisor turned up on Nihal Arthanayake on  Live on Monday to talk about what she called the ick.What’s the ick  Glad you asked. “The ick is a feeling of repulsion for somebody who you were once into,” LalalaLetMeExplain, umm, explained.“It’s that feeling of going from thinking, ‘Wow, I really want to kiss you,’ to ‘ you breathe one more time I’m going to vomit.’“It could be rational.

But then I am a very clumsy man .Listeners offered their own ick-related symptoms. “He called the pandemic Panny D,” one said. Which is totally understandable, I’d say. Other icks included “the way he chewed his burger”, “the way he walked to the bar” and “the way she took the bun off her burger spooned mayo onto it and proceeded to tap it down with her fingers”.“Psychopath, absolute psychopath clearly,” Layla said about that one.It would appear that public art is an ick for lots of people. In Art Came in the Night , Edinburgh artist Kevin Harman explained what is involved in making public art, the responses to it and how it can be embraced by local communities. Or not. One public artwork in Govan was set on fire. It was suggested that this showed a hands-on engagement and ownership with the art in question, which felt like a slightly optimistic reading.But this was an interesting programme that asked tough questions of the role of public art but didn’t start from the position that it is some kind of indulgence or imposition. Whether it was in Glenrothes or Dunfermline or Kirkcaldy, Harman found examples of art that is loved by their communities.

The pattern continued, week after week, up until the most recent publication on Wednesday with case rates of  per , in the unvaccinated compared to  and  per , respectively in the double-vaccinated and boosted.\" alt\"HeraldScotland: England is also seeing higher case rates in the vaccinated \" class\"editor-image\"England is also seeing higher case rates in the vaccinatedScotland is not unique - England and Ontario in Canada are reporting exactly the same phenomenon.In Scotlands case, Omicron exposed a weakness in the data: the size of the unvaccinated population had long been overestimated.: It may be fine - but its a gamble - Should Scotland end self-isolation too If Scotlands total population is counted based on the number of people registered with GPs here, it comes out % higher than officialestimates from the National Records of Scotland.In order to track people who test positive according to their vaccination status, however, health records are required.But then things become even worse: when GP registration is used to estimate the percentage of unvaccinated Scots aged -plus, it comes out at % compared to % using NRS figures.Overestimating the size of the unvaccinated population matters much less when prevalence is low, but becomes increasingly problematic by the time one in  people are infected. on case rates\" alt\"HeraldScotland: Table showing effect of denominatoron case rates\" class\"editor-image\"Table showing effect of denominatoron case rates Supposing the actual case rate were two per , for example, it would be be halved to one per .Butthe prevalence quadruples - as it has compared to a year ago - the gulf between the correct and incorrect figure widens and you end up with an actual rate of eight per  coming out as four per , all because the denominatoris so out of whack.The problem is that GP registrations count \"ghost\" patients: those on practice lists, but no longer resident in Scotland. People recently vaccinated in Scotland, on the other hand, will almost all still be living here.Separately, there is also evidence that vaccinated iniduals are more likely to get tested and, in particular, to self-report a positive lateral flow result - a bias which has become potentially more consequential recently.: Weird data shows Scotlands Covid case rates lowest in the unvaccinatedMeanwhile, Omicron also resulted in the hospitalisation rate among the double-vaccinated pulling ahead of the unvaccinated in December, for the first time, for dferent reasons.Omicron arrived just as second dose vaccination was waning. Those double-vaccinated iniduals ending up in hospital were overwhelmingly over  , and overdue for their booster.Hospital admission rates in the most recent week. Mortality and hospitalisation rates have remained consistently much lower in the boosted group throughout the Omicron wave The fact that these elderly people had not yet had a booster mostly reflects complex health issues and frailty, compared to unvaccinated and boosted people of the same age. Some will have been hospitalised for these pre-existing conditions only to contract Covid on the wards.\"We dont think its in the public interest really now to publish [the data] because its so misleading,\" one PHS official told the Herald.The tables will be published quarterly now, instead of weekly.Yet withdrawing the statistics in a bid to to prevent them becoming fodder for antivaxxers also has the effect, surely, of making them seem like some sort of embarrassing smoking gun to be hidden \"Im sure well get accused of a cover up,\" added the official.\"I am worried about that.\""},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh-auctioneers-lead-sale-rare-18th-century-dolls-house","story":"With precise attention to detail, it is a dolls house which offers a unique insight into a period of time.Now this rare surviving mid-th century doll’s house is to go under the hammer at Lyon  Turnbull’s Edinburgh showroom next Thursday when bidding is due to start at £,.Read more: Architect behind Burrell Collection redesign says it has opened up the heart of the buildingThe Evans Baby House, part of the ‘Five Centuries: Furniture, Paintings  Works of Art’ auction is an amazing piece of social and cultural history showcasing th century interiors and tiny artefacts.The Baby House, an earlier term for what became known as a doll’s house, was first documented in a book by Vivien Greene in , reprinted in , in which she recounts the fascinating history of The Evans Baby House. Ms Green, a notable authority on English dolls’ houses of the th and th centuries, was also the we of novelist Graham Greene.  She wrote of this particular doll’s house: “This story of its recovery is in its miniature way as exciting and touching to read as any history of a real house bought back by its original owners after alienation…”  The house came into the ownership of the Evans family in Buckinghamshire in the early th century and was given to a female member, Anne, by a Miss Hancock,thought to be her godmother.Read more: Glasgow workplace parking fees could bring in £millionAnne Evans, an English poet and composer, and her sibling Emma, were sisters of archaeologist, geologist and collector, Sir John Evans. Sir John went on to have a son, Sir Arthur Evans, their nephew, and the archaeologist best known for his excavation of the so-called Palace of Minos in  and his discovery of the Minoan civilisation.Anne’s sister Emma Hubbard, , became the biographer of their doll’s house, detailing that some time later it was given to a younger member of the Hancock family, the original owners, and was never heard of again until .However, by remarkable coincidence, in January of that year, Emma visited the Evelina Hospital for children in London and happened to see and identy the house, buying it back for a donation of four guineas in .  After rescuing the Baby House, Emma set about renovating it. A special feature from this era being miniature framed photographs depicting members of the Evans and Hubbard families, which hang in the first-floor drawing room.The original tinted prints in the upper and middle floors were retained, one of which depicts the Gothic tower at Whitton Park, Middlesex, as well as a small sepia drawing by her father.  It’s thought that Emma sourced some of the current furniture, which includes a lovely little chest of drawers on the ground floor, th century bedroom furniture and an earthenware dinner set, complete with original box. Later additions include the children in the nursery and a male doll which Emma described as having ‘mutton-chop whiskers.’Emma is believed to have passed the doll’s house to her brother, Sir John, and through him by descent to his daughter, granddaughter and great-granddaughter, the late Mary Harley . Marywas brought up in rural Suffolk and educated at the Universities of St Andrews and Oxford.Theo Burrell, the specialist at Lyon  Turnbull responsible for the sale said: “This is an exceptional doll’s house that tells a terric story. Not only was it in the hands of a distinguished family, the amazing record of its existence and its rediscovery makes it a sought-after piece. It’s absolutely enchanting and I know it will continue to give great pleasure to future generations.”"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-yes-campaign-leaders-must-act-toxic-culture","story":"To win we have to persuade unionists to change their minds. Leaving aside the repugnant practice of abuse, do those who engage in it believe it is possible to convert someone by shouting “traitor” and much worse at them  Perhaps we can start on a new path of civilised dialogue by acknowledging that, while we think dferently on the constitution, adherence to the Union is a legitimate position, which is not surprising considering the  years of its existence.The present toxicity in our body politic requires the leadership of the independence movement to lead us away from it, because of its potential malignant effect upon the character of the future Scotland we hope to win. Getting a majority is vital for that objective, butthat independent Scotland is to progress and flourish, all of its people, including those who lost the argument, have to be willing to trust, cooperate and work together. Success will not comea signicant minority feel aggrieved at being singled out as “treasonous” and “scum”.Robust and biting debate is inevitable on such a momentous issue of Scotland in or out of the Union. Butan independent Scotland is to be successful, it will need a high level of harmony and agreement among its people and for that we need to recognise red lines that should never be crossed. Disrespect for the views of others, dressed in bile and hatred, is corrosive of democratic le, and will be a malignant legacy in the Scotland we want. It is time for some to look beyond the present and contemplate the future, and realise that they must now desist from their present practices.Jim Sillars, Edinburgh.* IT says much about the state of our politics that the allegations of abuse brought into focus by the BBCs Sarah Smith have been instantly weaponised by unionist politicians from the Scottish Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats to condemn \"nationalism\".Its abundant from many a newspaper headline and the Twitter accounts of opposition MSPs and their parties that the bile, hatred and misogyny called out by Sarah Smith is also meted out on a daily basis to Nicola Sturgeon and Kate Forbes, who thankfully appear to have a much thicker skin than journalists.In a healthier political climate, opposition politicians would make this balanced observation for the greater good, but their party lines and allegiances clearly negate this option.Alistair McBay, Perth.SORRY COMMENT ON THE NATIONSARAH Smith reveals that she is relieved to be out of Scotland and in the US after the abuse she received while BBC Scotland Editor. She named no names, but did mention being \"demonised quite heavily… amongst certain parts of the population\". This is a very sorry comment on the state that Scotland has developed into, especially since .Ms Smith was in the news during the pandemic for saying that Nicola Sturgeon was \"enjoying\" the extras powers she could exercise. Ms Sturgeon tweeted that she was not enjoying the pandemic at all, and her hurt tones were taken as a signal by her nationalist followers to retaliate. They bombard Ms Smith with aggressive and insulting messages on social media. The better-educated among us know that \"enjoy\" has ious meanings, including \"possess\". That was lost on the social media warriors, and, apparently, on Ms Sturgeon herself.Ms Smith says that that was not a one-off, that she received \"vitriolic attention most of the time\". What kind of country has Scotland become that that it is now acceptable \"amongst certain parts of the population\"  The answer is: a nationalist one.Jill Stephenson, Edinburgh.PLAYING THE SOCIAL MEDIA GAMERESEARCH I conducted in a Clydeside engineering plantfor my doctoral thesis  years ago included asking respondents what newspapers, television news and current affairs programmes they read watched and whether they perceived any political slant in those read watched. With newspapers a political line was often observed, but television was identied as neutral. I wonderI would get the same answers today Of course, in the late s, consumption of media reports was largely passive, opportunities for the reader viewer to respond being limited to such as Points of View and Letters to the Editor. This though is no longer the case, with social media s such as Facebook and Twitter, as well as the legion of bloggers, making passive consumption something media commentators can only look back on.For instance, Sarah Smith claims in a tweet to have tried “to be fair and impartial”, which she may well have considered herself to be, but part of her audience didn’t. And sometimes they had good reason, such as when she reported the annual figure for patients waiting four hours in AEas a weekly figure. Of course, mistakes get made, but how likely is that almost two per cent of the Scottish population were even in AE in a particular week, never mind having to wait more than four hours Of course, as in “the old days” a “correction” was made, though damage had been done at the time. Another instance is, though, more concerning, her claim that Nicola Sturgeon was “enjoying” the Covid pandemic. This was explained by Ms Smith on Twitter, that she meant to say “she [Ms Sturgeon] has embraced the opportunity to make a policy unique to Scotland. I said enjoyed by mistake”. Perhaps, given that her error had started the whole process, an apology, prior to withdrawal, might have been more in order  But no, the political point just had to be made.Lastly, might I point out that Ms Smith, like many other journalists, some of whom make similar complaints, plays the social media “game”. As an experienced \"player\" did she really imagine that Thursday night’s tweet “Sharing this will no doubt invite all my *fans* on Twitter to take another shot” was going to be welcomed positively and warmly  Or did it get the reaction she wanted Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.WATCH OUT FOR AMERICAI FOUND your report on Sarah Smith regarding bile, hatred and misogyny in Scottish politics an interesting read, but I do hope that she is not naive enough to believe that by relocating in America as the BBCs correspondent that she is entering a country that is bereft of the self-same problems she is leaving in Scotland.Our politics are not perfect by a long way. I wonder how long she will tolerate the ballyhoo and razzamatazz of America, before she s to our shores as a less naive person.Neil Stewart, Balfron.LACK OF BALANCE ON DEBATE NIGHTIT is disingenuous for any politician to echo the term “isive referendum” when the reason for holding a referendum is when opinion is clearly split on a signicant issue, such as Scotland’s constitutional future. What is more “isive” is when our self-proclaimed impartial public broadcaster fails to provide balance in its news and political programmes.With the resumption of BBC Scotland’s Debate Night the BBC has an opportunity to improve upon,not fully recty, the mistakes of the past, but instead on Wednesday night the public was subjected to the views of another predominantly anti-independence and another seemingly contrived pro-Union audience with a host in Stephen Jardine who still insists on interrupting SNP politicians while content to facilitate more propaganda from anti-independence advocates. Anas Sarwar of the Labour Party was repeatedly given free rein to voice his shallow sound-bites without being held to account by our intrepid host. When Pete Wishart of the SNP attempted toMr Sarwar to fundamental realities by stating the facts that only the UK Government could introduce a windfall tax and that this was not going to happen any time soon under the Tories, Mr Wishart’s contribution was abruptly curtailed by Mr Jardine.Perhapsthe BBC were to host serious and balanced debates on Scotland’s constitutional future any sense of “isiveness” might disappear as the Scottish public becomes convinced of the merits of self-determination, but perhaps this is why the BBC and anti-independence politicians will continue to deny the people of Scotland a truly impartial public broadcasting service and why a referendum, or constitutional change vote in the next General Election, is now a democratic necessity.Stan Grodynski, Longniddry.REMEMBER CHERNOBYLDOUG Maughansays he has \"never understood the safety concerns about nuclear power\", to which I would reply succinctly: Chernobyl.I could expand by adding the fact that more than , people were forced to leave their homes in the immediate aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster and  years later, many districts of Norway were still having to test animals for radiation.More generally, there is no case for nuclear energy in Scotland – we are already creating so much energy from other, cheaper, renewable sources that it is simply unnecessary.David Patrick, Edinburgh.WINDS OF CHANGEI SEEM to recall a UK minister telling the people of the Highland that they did not deserve an enhanced cold weather  winter payment, because “they were used to the cold”. Now we have the BBC asserting mph winds are more serious in the south than in the north, because “Scotland has these high winds every winter”. That’ll be a relief to those in the north-east of Scotland and England who were without power for a week.

His Argentine teammate Emiliano Boffelli converted to cut the gap to - after  minutes and they reduced the margin to three just before the break when Munster hooker Diarmuid Barron was penalised for obstructing scrum-half Ben Vellacott and Boffelli kicked the penalty.But then a high tackle by centre James Lang on Zebo saw Healy go down the left touchline and with an advantage being played after the maul was pulled down, Munster created enough of an overlap for deft hands from Healy to send Zebo over for his th try for the province, with the conversion pushing the lead out to - at the break.It was a much tighter affair in the third quarter with Edinburgh taking Munster on up front and they reduced the margin to seven when Boffelli slotted a penalty from  metres after  minutes.The game hung in the balance at that stage as both sides started to empty their benches and while Edinburgh threatened down the left, Munster dealt with the danger and countered with Dan Goggin and Mike Haley cutting superb lines as they broke diagonally from inside halfway and Zebo was on hand to supply the finished in the left corner, with Healy converting to make it - going into the final quarter of a good contest.Edinburgh responded but when they opted to tap a penalty in front of the posts Dave Kilcoyne’s last act on his th appearance for Munster was to dislodge the ball from his opposite loosehead Boan Venter, before he departed to rapturous applause.Edinburgh got a leline though nine minutes from time when Henry Pyrgos sniped over under the posts, with Boffelli converting to leave it -.But that was as close as they got and Zebo completed his hat-trick and wrapped up the bonus point three minutes from time when Healy sent him over in the left corner before adding the extras.Scorers – Munster: Tries: S Zebo , F Wycherley .

Keeping such a vast number on the straight and narrow must’ve been broadly equivalent to the mighty logistical operation Noah faced when he was herding ious beasts up the gangway of his floating zoo. “I think the average heart rate was about  beats-per-minute so there was no need for exercise after that,” he added with a sense of panting achievement.Making sure golf in his own backyard remains in rude health is Erskine’s enduring passion. The opportunity to drive the game into local schools, meanwhile, is, as he puts it, “Willy Wonka’s golden ticket” in terms of development. Thanks to funding from the Children’s Golf Trust, Erskine now has the financial clout to spread the golfing gospel. “We get paid to take golf in there, the schools don’t pay a thing and it’s during curriculum time from Primary One through to Primary Seven,” he explained of his recent visit to Heathhall Primary School in Dumfries. “To get access to so many kids is huge. The hope is that we can go into every school in the town for years to come. We started on Thursday and we’ve already had loads of messages from parents of children who’d never tried golf saying they loved it.”In the home of golf, there has been a long-standing debate about getting the game Scotland gave to the world on to the school curriculum. Erskine, unsurprisingly, is a staunch advocate.“The game would really prosper,” said the PGA pro. “When I first started my business about  years ago, I went into schools and charged £ per pupil. It was hugely popular but I’ve not been in once since. It can be hard getting into schools. If they are doing golfing programmes they have to pay. That can eat into their education budget. \"This way, though, the costs are covered, the teachers love it and the kids get additional PE from it. We had kids who may not have been the most physically active, there were some with disabilities, but they all took part and engaged. Not many sports can do that. It’s a game for everybody. We are using arithmetic, we are explaining rules, we are promoting etiquette but most of all we’re having fun. I don’t see why golf in school is not championed more.”In a topical twist to the chinwag, the popularity of curling in Erskine’s native county cropped up. Fortunately for this jammy scribe, I was speaking to Erskine on the eve of Team GB’s Olympic showdown on ice where the Galloway trio of Bobby Lammie, Hammy McMillan and Grant Hardie were going for gold. Erskine saw at first hand the benefits of promoting curling in schools.“Bobby was a class golfer and he used to come to my junior classes at Portpatrick,” noted Erskine. “The way things have been going out in Beijing, he’s obviously made the right decision to focus on curling. When I was originally trying to get golf into schools, curling was already going through them in Dumfries  Galloway. The county has loads of curlers and clubs are bursting at the seams. That shows it works.”Erskine’s own golfing education was served in the relative isolation of Portpatrick on the western fringes of Galloway but this rural, idyllic location had plenty of advantages. “We were fortunate that we had a short par- course there and could create our own learning environment on it,” he reflected. “Those types of facilities, where kids can actually get out and learn on a short course, are what Scotland sorely lacks. Most clubs will have a junior medal. Butyou put them out on a hole that’s  yards long, and they just hit it  yards, then they can come away with a  or something and their confidence can take an early hit. \"But put them on a hole that’s  yards long, where they have a chance to hit it on the green and may even have a putt for an eagle, and it changes their whole perception of the sport. That’s what we need more of.”There is plenty of good work being done across Scotland to nurture junior golf.

They didn’t want to announce that I’d been dropped because it would adversely affect audience figures, so they made it look asI’d walked away from them rather than the other way round.“They had a chat with my agent and announced that I was going to GB News when they’d done no more than askI’d be interested in joining them.”He added: “’I’m not going to have myself derided as some sort of has-been. I may be male and pale but I’m still at the top of my game.”Holmes claimed that show runners at ITV are “’middle-aged white managers”.“When are they going to start being erse with their management “The ersity is only on screen. It’s hypocritical.”Following news of Holmes’ departure from ITV, the channel said: “We would like to wish Eamonn all of the very best in his new role.“As a duo, Eamonn and Ruth have been part of the This Morning presenting team for the last  years and we thank Eamonn for all of his hard work and contribution to the show.”Langsford continues to work with ITV as an anchor on Loose Women and a member of the This Morning team.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645089617694.jpg--1_700_people_apply_for_a_life_less_ordinary_with_stena_line.jpg?1645089617000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220217news1 700 people apply for a life less ordinary with stena line","story":"Ferry company Stena Line has been overwhelmed with the positive response from the public to its recent recruitment campaign ‘A Le Less Ordinary’, which aims to fill  vacant positions onboard its Irish Sea ferries. , applications were received from people across the UK and Republic of Ireland.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueTristan Morrow, Kilkenny-born founder of Irish Unionist Party . Credit: Tristan Morrow.Niamh CampbellTwitterEmailFebruary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA young Kilkenny unionist has revealed that he and his family were forced to move to Northern Ireland after receiving IRA death threats.Tristan Morrowhas made headlines for creating the Irish Unionist Party . He believes the island of Ireland as a whole should become part of the UK – and in turn, separated from the EU – due to what he sees as universal economic benefits for all nations involved.The idea for his new political movement stemmed from his research of past, archetypal Irish unionists.“I then came in contact with a man from Co Clare with similar views to me,” he told the Belfast .“Quickly, we got a big group of southern people who have unionist views. Somebody said that we should start a movement over this and we thought it was a pretty good idea. We started it within the last year, maybe the year before, and we took it quite seriously.“At the moment, we haven’t been having or going to events, but so far we have  members and we should be getting a whole lot more in the coming weeks due to a new contact with the Donegal Orange Lodge. There’s massive interest in it.”But Mr Morrow’s views have led to stress and abuse towards him and other members of his group.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up He added: “One of our members got sent a picture of a revolver gun and the guy said he knew where he lived and actually mentioned his house address. We quickly got that sorted by reporting it.“I have received some real-le threats from local republicans. I’m out in the countryside and whenever I’m on my walk into town and back home, I’ve had a car stop in the middle of the road and just rev at me for a good  seconds, and as they’ve driven past they#ve shouted ‘tiocfaidh ar lá’.“I#ve had to live up here in Northern Ireland for a few years now, due to my family having to move away from Kilkenny because of the IRA. I believe it was the Co Laois IRA that had decided they had enough of my family and they gave us a week to move, otherwise they#d kill us all.”Raised on a Kilkenny farm, Mr Morrow said his family is still supportive of him.“My father had saidI was going fully public about my views, that he would stand with me,” he added.He also believes the whole of Ireland should have a referendum to determine whether it would want to join or leave the UK.“In my perfect scenario, I would imagine Ireland taking part within the union sort of like how Scotland does. A united Ireland would be beneficial for both sides, but also I would like us to be united with the English economically and as one nation. I don’t see how we could not benefit from it.“And it sort of seems that the only reason people don’t want it is over tribalism. Sort of like, ‘they’re English, we don’t want to be united with the English’.”He also noted that while some members of the IUP want to remain within the EU, he would like to see Ireland follow a Brexit-like referendum.“The majority of us would like to see us out of the EU and to have more uptake into the actual world stage of economic trade, especially with the Commonwealth.“We#ve had a lot of new converts to unionism who have literally no background with it. But due to what happened in  [the financial crash], a lot of them have become outright unionists.”Mr Morrow spoke of one man from Limerick, who he said took him around dilapidated streets in the city which were once thriving with shops and businesses, but are now “rotting away”.“He was talking about how after  years, this is what all that has won us - just nothing.”Mr Morrow said that he looks “forward to what the future holds” and has welcomed the support of some like-minded unionists from Northern Ireland, including independent politicians and members of the UUP.On Wednesday, he tweeted: “Irish Unionism will be normalised in due time.If Ireland is to be united, it will only be possible through unionism heading the charge.I will always be a Kilkenny man, my family loves Kilkenny and I will never give up on my hometown.After facing some online backlash for the post, Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie replied: “Stay safe Tristan. Nobody deserves threats for having a political view.”Most ReadStorm Eunice: At least four dead in England and ROI, while snow and ice expected to continue into Saturday for Northern Ireland PSNI confirms ‘sudden death’ on Belfast to Lisburn train lineMeet the Kilkenny teen who has set up his own party to secure the unication of Ireland under British ruleBelfast man Gary Alexander Baird denies murdering his we SusanDrink driver who left dying cyclistunconscious in field jailed and bannedTop VideosPlayVideo: Cars collide on Glenshane Pass as heavy snow arrives with Storm EunicePlayPlanes struggle to land as Storm Eunice causes disruption across the UKPlayVideo: Moment group save BMW from inward tide on Kerry beachLatest Northern IrelandAll-Ireland club winner found guilty of involvement with ATM theft gangNI actor who got his big break in Neighbours hopes soap can be saved after Channel  axeFlight festival ‘shot down in secret, with no explanation’Day of devastation as Storm Eunice wreaks havoc in UK and IrelandDonaldson is under fire over trade mission to CameroonLatestRicky Warwick’s ready to rockCold case expert: ‘We should be careful about forensic sciencewe want to go on relying on it to help give justice’All-Ireland club winner found guilty of involvement with ATM theft gangNI actor who got his big break in Neighbours hopes soap can be saved after Channel  axeFlight festival ‘shot down in secret, with no explanation’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

When it was announced that the new curator would be serving both Newry and Downpatrick this caused great consternation.ldquoWe can understand that frustration and since our local councils were brought together seven years ago where parity should have existed between Newry, Mourne and Down, it has felt that the legacy Down area has been left behind somewhat.ldquoWe have to be straightforward about the facts and Downpatrick is the county town. This carries major signicance. The historical and ecclesiastical heritage of Downpatrick is equally signicant, as is our links to St Patrick. The museum in Downpatrick is the Down County Museum and must be treated as such.The SDLP politicians say while they appreciate the local authorityrsquos need for a curator that serves both Downpatrick and Newry, they are firmly on the view that the curator must be based in Downpatrick.Cllr Enright confirmed that he and Cllr Brown have also been meeting with the Friends of the Museum over the past few weeks and will be calling for a special motion on the restructuring plan to be debated publicly at next monthrsquos full council meeting.ldquoThe council proposal makes no sense whatsoever at all to promote the relatively insignicant Bagelrsquos Castle in Newry over the Down County Museum which is one of the premier professional conservancy and historical centres in Northern Ireland, added Cllr Enright.Cllr Brownrsquos motion calls for a full-time curator to be based at and responsible for the Down County Museum and that the existing curatorial posts of keeper and assistant keeper of collections are permanently filled and not downgraded, with the vital and highly skilled role of the museumrsquos technician photographer also retained and not downgraded.ldquoI am calling for council officers to develop, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, a new, long-term strategic plan for how the council can most effectively invest in museums across the district, he confirmed.ldquoCouncillors are highly concerned by the plans to downgrade staff provision at the Down County Museum and to base the only full-time museum curator in Newry. We are also very concerned about the lack of adequate consultation with key stakeholders, in particular, the Friends of Down County Museum..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16February2022_Irish.jpg","title":"Documents of United Irish leader Thomas Russell  shows rich history held  in Down County Museum  ","story":"MANY people in County Down and beyond will be familiar with the words of Florence Mary Wilsonrsquos popular ballad, The Man from God Knows Where, published in  in her best-known collection of poetry, The Coming of the Earls.Her enigmatic subject was Thomas Russell mdash soldier, social reformer and revolutionary mdash who was hanged outside what is now Down County Museum in October .An intimate of Theobald Wolfe Tone, Russell was posted to Belfast as an ensign in the th Regiment of Foot in  and became a founding member of the Society of United Irishmen the following year.Associated with the development of the United Irishmenrsquos insurrectionary strategy in the mid-s, Russell journeyed across Co Down mobilising support for what was expected to be a rebellion supported by French arms. Arrested in Belfast in September , he was a prisoner in Dublin when the Rising raged in  and was despatched along with other State prisoners to Fort George in Scotland the following year.Liberated in , Russell threw himself back into revolutionary politics in support of Robert Emmetrsquos ill-fated coup by attempting to raise once again the standard of rebellion in Co Down. After an anticlimactic call to arms in Loughinisland in July , Russell escaped the county only to be arrested in Dublin and ed to Downpatrick for trial and execution.One of the earliest collections acquired four decades ago by the fledgling Down County Museum was a small parcel of documents relating to the trial of Thomas Russell.The documents include the order from the viceroy, Lord Hardwicke, to initiate proceedings against Russell and the list of jurors who would decide his fate, not that it was ever in doubt. Also contained within the collection is a series of fascinating depositions sworn before local gentry which condemned not only Russell, but two Co Down men, James Corry and James Drake, to execution.The improbability of success for the  Rising is revealed in the deposition of Patrick Doran from Annadorn, who said that ldquonone but fools andmadmen would endorse a Rising so soon after the sobering experience of . Doranrsquos deposition goes on to describe Russellrsquos green Generalrsquos coat, decorated with gold lace and rich epaulettes.Another deposition, from Hugh Magennis, of Ballydugan, provides us with the vivid impression of Russellrsquos ldquomilitary step and appearance, while William Cosby of Saintfield described the mysterious stranger of Wilsonrsquos ballad as a ldquolarge handsome looking man.Such witness statements helped to deliver a guilty verdict and Russell was executed outside the County Gaol, now Down County Museum, on Friday, October , . He was buried in the parish churchyard his gravestone arranged and paid for by the indomitable Mary Ann McCracken of Belfast.These documents held in Down County Museum shed considerable light on an episode of local history that had profound national signicance. Scholars of th century Ireland have visited the museum to consult its rich archive and conferences staged there to discuss the sitersquos deep imprint on Irish history and memory.The size and quality of its collections and the historical importance of its buildings underpin the importance of the internationally-recognised Down County Museum.The ongoing depletion of its highly-qualied and committed staff, which under Newry, Mourne and Down Council proposals now appears to include only a part-time curator, the replacement of the keeper of collections and an assistant with two new positions at a signicantly lower grade, and the removal of the important position of a photographer technician, reflects a disregard for the heritage industry in the county and represents an insult to the hundreds of donors who presented valued family possessions to Down County Museum in the good faith that the Council would preserve, celebrate and cherish them.The fear of many is that the downgrading of the Museum mdash for that is what this is mdash will lead to a reluctance among the public to donate artefacts to the collection and undermine applications for the funding of future projects.The public knows exactly what kind of jewel we have in Down County Museum. One can only hope that a broader awareness of the worrying impact of the Councilrsquos vision will create a clamour whereby the lsquoWrong should cease and the Right prevailrsquo..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16February2022_TableTennis.jpg","title":"Drumaness A and B square off  ","story":"THE ladies of Drumaness B, still buoyant from their win over Strangford B, were unable to repeat another giant killing act against their club-mates, Drumaness A.But in a good glamoured match attended by the league secretary, they can be pleased with their team performance while the result was never in doubt.The title holders conceding  points to the B teammade sure that they got enough points in every game to stay ahead of the have-a-go opposition.Pat Mulholland started the ball rolling with a  pointwinning margin against Philomena Rogan before Charlie Murray added another  points in his match with Katy Rice and Hugh Scott collected a similar winning margin over Norma Gilgunn for an overall score of  points.The ladies were more resolute in the next round of matches and were more content in their performance than points and finished the match with a respectable score overall..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16February2022_AC.jpg","title":"East Down AC  ","story":"LAST Wednesday some of the East Down AC juniors headed to Mallusk for the Ulster Schoolsrsquo Cross Country Championships.On this occasion they were running in school colours rather than the red and yellow of East Down AC but several of the club coaches were in attendance and watching with interest.The athletes had to qualy for the honour of racing at this level through an inidual top  place or as part of a team that came in the top three at the district qualiers.Although the course was fairly flat and the ground mostly firm underfoot, the long flat stretches were interspersed with a sharp, slippy rises and muddy turns so runners had to choose whether to run wide for safer footing or risk slipping by following the shortest route.The squally showers and very strong gusty winds were an added challenge.Jessica Martinrepresenting Victoria College Belfast over a distance of m came th out of a field of  runners in a time of ..Year Nine girlshad four EDAC runners in the pack Erin Moore, Cara Napier and Charlotte Barr.

Nineteen other councillors, from the SDLP, Ulster Unionists, DUP and Alliance voted in favour.A lively debate was sparked by the SDLPrsquos Mr John Doris and involved  other councillors.Mr Doris said while he was keen to support the charity which will benefit from the drag hunt the council has money invested in Delamont and he felt it was ldquoinappropriate for the horses and hounds to go across the council track of land.He said the Delamont country park is taking shape very well and it would be ldquovery unwise to allow it to be used in this way.Mr Doris told councillors it would be ldquofoolish even to allow a drag hunt on an experimental basis.He said there is no guarantee that the hunt will stay on the periphery of Delamont.Party colleague, Mr Cathal O Baoill, argued in favour of permitting the hunt. He said the type of person who is a hunting, shooting and fishing man, like something from the Irish RM, is a major tourist attraction. It is a section of the countryside and a major cultural aspect which should be preserved.He pointed out thatthe hunt is successful, it will result in a smelly bag being torn apart.DOWNPATRICK ndash An alternative line has been suggested this week for the poundm Downpatrick town centre by-pass.Down Ulster Unionist councillor, Mr William Biggerstaff, is suggesting that the road could be constructed along part of the route of the former railway line.Mr Biggerstaff believes thatthe line is adopted by the Department of Environment, it will considerably reduce the costs of the provision.ldquoI would envisage incorporating part of the old railway line embankment as the foundation for a new roads system, said Mr Biggerstaff.He expressed concern that the Government-backed regeneration of Downpatrick will be hampered by the failure to resolve the traffic problem.ldquoThere will be no point in regenerating Downpatrickthere isnrsquot road network facility to make use of, she said.ldquoAfter meeting officials of the Department, it is my view that the by-pass will eventually go ahead.

The Eastern Health Board has announced that intends closing Mourne House residential home for the elderly, despite a strong protest lobby.A spokesman for the Southern Board said last weekrsquos vote was ldquototally unanimous and followed preliminary discussions with staff and patientsrsquo relatives.The two-storey building, which was built in the rsquos, was turned into a holiday home for the mentally handicapped in . At one stage it provided holiday accommodation for  patients.With the Board running down its holiday operations at Navan House in recent years, it is now being used as an extension of the Boardrsquos mental health hospital in Armagh and contains  patients.The spokesman said the decision to close is in line with Board policy aimed at ing people to the community.ldquoNavan House costs around pound, a year to run. The Board believes this money could be better spent developing community services, he continued.The spokesman said a final decision will only be taken following consultations with patients, staff, local councillors and community groups.ldquoThere is a general recognition that we should have fewer long-stay patients in mental hospitals. There is no need to retain a facility which is  miles away from the main hospital in Armagh, the spokesman added.CROSSGAR ndash SDLP MP, Mr Eddie McGrady, has reported success in his campaign to have the mains water system in the Crossgar Killyleagh area improved.The South Down MP pointed out that after serious supply problems just before Christmas  he took the meter up with the Minister, Mr Richard Needham.ldquoI am now pleased that the Department having considered a study is designing a scheme to lay a waterman from Raleigh to New Line, Crossgar, which will increase the reliability of the supply to the Killyleagh and Shirley areas. This work should commence later this year, said Mr McGrady.ldquoThis study also identied the need to replace two watermains in Killyleagh.

This is a crucially important exercise and it must happen as soon as possible.Cllr Curran believes one area that requires particular focus is developing Downpatrickrsquos night-time economy which he is confident would help breathe new le into the town centre.He is also keen for Downpatrick to have an umbrella body representing all business groups and interests, pointing to the success of Chambers of Commerce which he believes play important roles.ldquoAgreeing the way forward for Downpatrick is crucial and a new strategy can help kick-start the townrsquos economic revival, especially at a time when ambitious plans are being advanced for the regeneration of the former Irish Street police base and a number of empty adjacent buildings, Cllr Curran added.Welcoming plans for the workshop, Cllr Hanlon said it has been identied that a strategic plan needs to be considered to focus on the needs of the town.She also confirmed that she as met with a number of stakeholders who believe that Downpatrick needs a strategic plan.ldquoThere is so much effort and productive work from local groups such as the Town Committee and Community Collective alongside local businesses, Cllr Hanlon continued. ldquoEngagement from a iety of stakeholders via theworkshop will ensure that we have a bold and progressive plan for the future of Downpatrick.She added: ldquoCouncil assistance to facilitate this is will be imperative as we continue to build our local economy, arts and events offerings..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16February2022_Minister.jpg","title":"Tributes and presentations to Downpatrick clergyman  ","story":"ANOTHER chapter in the distinguished history of Downpatrick Non-Subscribing Presbyterian Church closed last Sunday when the Rev Dr David Speers preached his final service after  yearsrsquo service.Dr Steers, who was also in charge of Ballee and Clough Non-Subscribing Presbyterian churches, is leaving the district to take up a new post in Dunmurry.He introduced his final service with the history of the replica High Cross which stands at the entrance to the Down Cathedral, explaining how its engravings depict Jesus Christ and the prophets St Anthony and Paul and how the illustrations guided the early Christians over a thousand years agoDr Steers said the Non-Subscribing congregation in Downpatrick worships in a building erected over  years ago, encouraging them to keep this faith going.He continued this theme with readings from Psalm  and the first letter to John, explaining the dference in the perception of God from the Old to the New Testament, with the departing ministerrsquos sermon reminding the congregation that despite their comfortable lives, to continue to do Godrsquos work in the community.Laura Patterson accompanied the hymns lsquoHoly, holy, holyrsquo, lsquoJust as I amrsquo, The Lordrsquos my shepherdrsquo and lsquoGod sent his Sonrsquo.At the conclusion of the service, church treasurer, Carol Nixon, spoke of Dr Steers leadership, pastoral care and how he led by example, fully participating in all the church worship and witness as well as many fundraising events.In addition, she reminded those in attendance of his leadership, both within the church group and in the community where he is well known and respected by all denominations, and wishing him the congregationrsquos blessing in his new charge.The Downpatrick churchrsquos senior elder, Mr Freddie Straney, made a presentation to Dr Steers and thanked him for his loyalty and  yearsrsquo service.Eileen Neill, on behalf of the younger members, presented Dr. Steers with a delightful and talented illustration of the Downpatrick church which she had created, with Ms Nixon presenting the ministerrsquos we Sue, with a flower arrangement, thanking her for the many ways she had supported her husband both in and outside the pulpit.Also during Sundayrsquos service, the congregation took the opportunity of presenting Mary Stewart with a gold brooch, church illustration by Eileen Neill, flowers and rose plants to mark her  years as church secretary.Dr Steers responded to his gts with moving words which touched everyonersquos spirit.He recalled how he became associated with the church in  and was in charge in  before being fully appointed in the group, also thanking Mary for all her work.The ious speeches were dficult and emotional, but very sincere and from the heart. It was a day of surprises which will remain in the thoughts of the retiring minister and his we, church members and office-bearers.Although Covid restrictions prevented the members from giving Dr. Steers and Sue a send-off befitting their service to them, such was their appreciation that it took two hours for everyone to say farewell.As the churchrsquos fourth longest serving minister, Dr Steers completed  years in full time charge in addition to being minister-in-charge for several sessions between  and .He was a member of the local ministerial group which organises collective worship and remembrance events such as inter-denominational services and Remembrance Sunday as well as highlighting and supporting worthy causes.Over the years Dr Steers conducted in excess  regular services as well as special services including Christmas celebrations. In addition, he undertook over  memorial services as well as weddings, renewal of vows and baptisms with these totals undoubtedly tripling when the Ballee and Clough churches are included.Dr Steers represented the denomination in  at a special service in Transylvania and attended and conducted the funeral services both here and on the mainland of some of the churchrsquos most distinguished serving ministers.Over the years, while celebrating the churchrsquos tercentenary, Dr Steers was a tremendous support in the church history and, more recently, its graveyard inion booklet.He also compiled a book entitled rsquoFirst World War Roll of Honour of the Non-Subscribing Presbyterian Church of Irelandrsquo containing all the members of the denomination who served and who gave their lives in defence of our country. The publication was launched at a special service in our church in November .Former church secretary Mary Stewart added: ldquoWhen the church history is read in years to come our records, just as they have down through the ages, will record names and dates of those who served.ldquoWe know however that a le of service goes beyond this. It includes sharing moments of sadness and tears but also memories of joy and laughter which we have had together in Downpatrick.

PA archive“And yet people’s understanding about plants, except in a very kind of narrow way, has not kept up with that. I think this will bring it home.”It’s a concept that the show’s executive producer Mike Gunton concurs with.“I wanted to do a Planet Earth for plants – because obviously your first thought with plants is, ‘It’s going to be like Gardeners’ World, it’s going to be dull’,” the Bafta-winning producer says, glancing over at Sir David as the broadcaster rehearses his lines.“Planet Earth, I think, gives you a sense that there’s going to be some drama and some scale. It is constructed by habitat, so I wanted to replicate that. There’s tropical worlds, desert worlds, water worlds, seasonal worlds, and human worlds.”Sir David Attenborough address the COP conference in Glasgow on November , As the first ever Creative Director of the BBC’s Natural History Unit, Gunton has played a pivotal role in the production of hit BBC documentaries including Planet Earth II, Dynasties and Africa.It’s a proven track record that sees him ideally placed to take on the mammoth challenge posed by The Green Planet. Reuniting with Dynasties series producer Rupert Barrington, the series – which premiered on the eve of November’s COP summit in Glasgow – saw Sir Davidto screens as series narrator.Sir David hopes people, after watching the series, will begin to understand the primordial importance plants play in human le.The veteran naturalist describes the world of plants as “a parallel world on which we depend, and which up to now we have largely ignored,I speak on behalf of urbanised man.”“Over half the population of the world according to the UN are urbanised, live in cities, only see cultivated plants and never see a wild community of plants. “But that wild community is there, outside urban circumstances normally, and we depend upon it. And we better jolly well care for it,” he warns.Recalling how the series proposal was met with the words “we’re ploughing a new furrow” from Sir David, Gunton says he knew the project needed to be an immersive viewing experience in order to capture the minds of viewers.“The green ecosystems are an incredibly strong web which underpins all le – and because it’s so complex and so strong, it’s an unchallengeable Jenga tower,” says Gunton. “What’s been happening is that we’ve been pulling the bricks out, but because we’re plant-blind, we haven’t really cared or noticed that we’ve pulled these bricks out.“As we know, with a Jenga tower,you just pull that last brick out, the whole thing collapses. “What we’re trying to say is, be more aware of those Jenga blocks, becauseyou knock down that tower, it’s curtains.”Noting the ever-present challenge of bringing the natural world to le, Gunton explains how the unit developed never-before-seen technology, resulting in a new approach to filmmaking.Based upon a widely-used technique known as time-lapse photography – a process by which a moving object is photographed consistently over a period of time and when played back, appears as a fast-forwarded video – the concept emerged after producer Paul Williams chanced upon a YouTube video uploaded by American visual engineer, Chris Field.Already a fan of botanical photography, Field had tinkered with existing electronics to create a customised camera capable of capturing the movement of plant le. Together with the BBC’s in-house team, they set about developing the technology in order to not only capture a simple time-lapse, but allow viewers to travel along the rainforest floor alongside plants and insects. It’s a project that also saw the Natural History Unit embrace drone technology – a more eco-friendly and immersive alternative to helicopters. Harnessing the skills of two competitive first-person-view drone pilots, the drones were able to weave through the rainforest canopy at high speed, capturing footage unlike anything previously seen.Recounting how the five year production saw the team – including Sir David, travel the world in search of exotic plant le, it’s clear that age is but a number to the veteran naturalist.“David is in his s, so we had to be quite careful about the number of locations and the amount of time away, but we managed to [go] to all the habitats,” says Gunton, listing off a swathe of trips across South America and Europe. “We’ve been to rainforests, deserts, water worlds, and the Arctic – we actually even went to the Arctic Circle.”The team also travelled to Costa Rica, visiting La Selva Biological Station – and what they saw there should bring hope, as the research centre has become famous for giving vast swathes of their land back to the natural rainforest.“Plants will rewire land for you, and that’s what David is saying,” says Gunton. “The planet heals itself, we just need to give it the chance to do it.”‘I’M SWANNING AROUND THE WORLD LOOKING AT THE MOST FABULOUSLY INTERESTING THINGS’: A POTTED BIO OF SIR DAVIDSir David Attenborough was born on May ,  in Isleworth, Middlesex, and grew up in College House on the campus of the University College, Leicester, where his father, Frederick, was principal.He is the middle of three sons his elder brother, Richard , became an actor and director, and his younger brother, John , was an executive at Italian car manufacturer Alfa Romeo.Attenborough spent his childhood collecting fossils, stones, and natural specimens. He spent much time in the grounds of the university. Aged around , he heard that the zoology department needed a large supply of newts, which he offered through his father to supply for d each. The source was a pond right next to the department. In , Sir David and his brother Richard attended a lecture by Grey Owlat De Montfort Hall, Leicester, and were influenced by his advocacy of conservation. According to Richard, David was: “Bowled over by the man’s determination to save the beaver, by his profound knowledge of the flora and fauna of the Canadian wilderness and by his warnings of ecological disaster should the delicate balance between them be destroyed. “The idea that mankind was endangering nature by recklessly despoiling and plundering its riches was unheard of at the time, but it is one that has remained part of Dave’s own credo to this day.”Sir David was educated at Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys in Leicester and won a scholarship to Clare College, Cambridge in  to study geology and zoology.In , he was called up for national service in the Royal Navy and spent two years stationed in North Wales and the Firth of Forth. In , Attenborough married Jane Elizabeth Ebsworth Oriel. The couple had two children, Robert and Susan. Jane died in . Robert is a senior lecturer in bioanthropology at a university in Canberra and his daughter Susan is a former primary school headmistress.Sir David had a pacemaker fitted in June , as well as a double knee replacement in . But the ebullient naturalist and broadcaster’s passion for what he does remains undimmed despite his formidable age.He is quoted as commenting in September : “If I was earning my money by hewing coal I would be very glad indeed to stop. But I’m not. “I’m swanning round the world looking at the most fabulously interesting things. “Such good fortune!”‘SURELY WORKING TOGETHER WE ARE POWERFUL ENOUGH TO SAVE THIS PLANET’ SIR DAVID TOLD COP CONFERENCEAt the COP summit in Glasgow on November  last year, Sir David Attenborough called on world leaders and climate change activists to be “motivated by hope rather than fear” to avoid climate catastrophe.Speaking in front of an audience that included the US president, Joe Biden, at the conference’s opening ceremony, the broadcaster and naturalist said humanity was “already in trouble”.He also appealed to the political leaders and heads of state gathered for the two-week summit to commit to holding global temperature rises to .C above pre-industrial levels, the lower of two limits set out in the  Paris climate agreement.Sir David said: “Everything we have achieved in the last , years has been enabled because of the [climate] stability during this time.“The global temperature has not wavered over this period by more than either plus or minus one degree Celsius – until now. We are already in trouble. The stability we all depend on is breaking.“This story is one of inequality as well as instability. Today, those who have done the least to cause this problem are among those to be hardest hit. Ultimately, all of us will feel the impact, some of which is unavoidable.“Is this how our story is due to end “A tale of the smartest species doomed by that all too human characteristic of failing to see the bigger picture in pursuit of short-term goals ”He added his voice to increasingly growing calls for world leaders to thrash out a commitment to the .C temperature limit and called on young people to “rewrite our story”.“Perhaps the fact that the people most affected by climate change are no longer some imagined future generation but young people alive today, perhaps that will give us the impetus we need to rewrite our story.“To turn this tragedy into a triumph – we are after all the greatest problem solvers to have ever existed on Earth. We now understand this problem, we know how to stop the number rising and put it in reverse.“We must recapture billions of tonnes of carbon from the air.”Attenborough also highlighted that “no nation has completed its development because no advanced nation is yet sustainable”, and demanded “all nations have a good standard of living and a modest [carbon] footprint”.He concluded: “The people alive now and the generation to come will look at this conference and consider one thing – did the number stop rising and start to drop as a result of commitments made here  “There’s every reason to believe that the answer can be yes. “If working apart we are forces powerful enough to destabilise our planet, surely working together we are powerful enough to save it.”The Green Planet is available to watch on the BBC iPlayer.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The UK did get much of its early response badly wrong but then became a global leader in terms of vaccine development and rollout.Yet when there was a flow of articles in Ireland, or penned by Irish authors in UK papers, attacking London’s handling of the pandemic, there was no reaction in Britain.You might say this is a reflection of British arrogance, and that is partly true . But it is noticed in informed circles, where the lack of response is rooted in an intuitive understanding that Ireland can attack Britain but by goodness Britain can’t attack Ireland.ImagineIreland was perceived to be wrong on a major matter of public policy, and British commentators said so publicly and repeatedly in media on either side of the Irish Sea. I have never seen that happen, and do not expect to see it.Thus the truth is almost the opposite of the caricature: far from the UK believing in its greatness, it is full of self criticism, while it is Ireland that can act superior. Its president, Michael D Higgins, illustrates this double standard. It is often said that he has done much for reconciliation, which is true in that he has attended a range of ceremonies that show respect for all traditions, including the British and unionist ones. But he talks ashe has an entrenched belief in the historical moral goodness of Ireland and the wrongness of Britain. From time to time he wants to scold us about it.Observers this week, such as the artist Brian John Spencer, have pointed out how inappropriate it is that the head of state of a country which has a school system dominated by the Catholic church should lecture us in Northern Ireland on integrated education.If he was going to attack separate education in NI, why did he not single out the Catholic church for criticism  People talk about Catholic and Protestant schools but as far back as the s, when I was in class, many so-called Protestant schools were schools with a distant church origin that had long since become largely secular and mixed.Schools with a religiously mixed intake were somewhat atypical in that they tended to be grammar schools with many middle class pupils. Even so, it was a trend that has become marked with time. Some such ‘Protestant’ schools in greater Belfast have a : pupil mix.To this day few Catholic schools have that level of integration.Aside from the odd grumble, unionists or British people say little in response to the judgemental speeches from President Higgins.It is hard to imagine a British royal uttering any historical criticism of Ireland. Or even a UK cabinet minister doing so, let alone repeatedly making such speeches.Patience with President Higgins did briefly snap over the Armagh centenary service. An event that was made so neutral that it barely mentioned Northern Ireland, and certainly did not dare to celebrate it, was nonetheless too much of a recognition of NI for him.Yet his criticism over the years has kept coming: he turned down an invite to an RIC memorial he instructed unionists to be generous over  he said Britain must face up to its history of reprisals he accused Britain of feigned amnesia over imperialism of not treating the Irish as equals over the famine for its handling of an Indian mutiny.Here is a suggestion to President Higgins. If he is going to impart his views so freely, andhe is keen on reconciliation, then surprise us. Talk about Troubles statistics, and acknowledge the unionist wound, particularly in border areas, at the fact that republicans killed twice as many people as anyone , and often fled to a Republic that would not extradite them.If that is too stark a topic, then speak of the good things, such as the lingering British cultural and physical infrastructure in the Republic — the architecture or the system of laws and parliamentary democracy.Michael D HigginsNorthern IrelandBoris JohnsonBrexitBen Lowry  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularStorm Franklin : Heres what the next storm is called after Storm Eunice - and when it could hit the UKMarkethill loyalist protest rally hears of ‘grave threat’ posed by NI Protocol‘DUP-Sinn Fein tinkering with Good Friday Agreement has caused surge in ‘sectarian headcount’ elections’, say members of SDLP and UUP talks teams which secured the  dealWhat time will Storm Eunice hit  When and where will Storm Eunice hit - and will it snow in Northern Ireland Storm Eunice round-up: Has Storm Eunice finished  - Whats the weather forecast for this evening Most PopularWhat’s going to happen in Season  of Netflix’s Bridgerton: what happens in Julia Quinn’s novels, where to buyBest Aldi dupes : top perfume, skincare, beauty, makeup, cleansing balm products from Lacura to le CreusetBest cocktail shaker sets UK : mix the perfect drink with one of these excellent cocktail shakersBest robot vacuum cleaner UK : top cleaners for pet hair and more from Dyson to SharkCan the right mattress help with back pain  We review Simba, Nectar, Dormeo and Tempur mattresses                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

There was better value football matches there some days than from highly paid stars at Goodison ParkBefore that announcement it appeared that Irish football clubs were going to lose the multi-million scheme that could have redeveloped local stadia.The minister’s initial decision to halt the funding while at the same approving of millions to redevelop the GAA’s Casement Park in west Belfast came under fierce criticism within the local football community.However, some of that criticism clouded the real issue and indeed the cause of the Irish League by suggesting her original determination was motivated by sectarianism. Because it clunkily characterised the policy as one of pitting the allegedly Catholic-Nationalist GAA against an allegedly Protestant-Nationalist Irish Football community. Which to those who follow and love the Irish League is an objectionable, inaccurate stereotyping of the local sport.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

I recall a time when going to matches away from home was often physically perilous and when you could be subjected to attacks involving hand grenades courtesy of the UFF, bricks, bottles, steel so-called ‘Chinese darts’ and even hot coals chucked over us by irate grannies.On top of the physical violence and threats there was the ubiquitous sectarian chanting and abuse which lasted for decades.In fairness and in total honesty some of us were not blameless angels either and I am still ashamed of aspects of my own teenage behaviour following the Reds at certain fixtures in the late s and early to mid s.Mercully those days have faded far into the past and the atmosphere around grounds in the st century across Northern Ireland has been generally become de-toxied.The Irish League and the IFA have a code of conduct outlawing sectarian and racial abuse, which by and large the overwhelming majority of fans adhere to. Hooliganism is an extreme rarity and even when there is an odd outbreak of thuggery the fan bases condemn it without equivocation.In relation to the other important stuff – the quality of the football on the pitch – there has been a marked improvement over the last  years or more in the pace, passing and moving in Irish League games.A few weeks ago, on some rare days off I watched for nostalgia purposes reruns of ‘The Big Match’ on ITV. One of the most striking things about revisiting topflightclashes between the likes of West Ham and Spurs in the s was how much slower the tempo of even English elite football was the time.It also hit me thatyou could time travel one of the current leading Irish League football teams back to land-of-the-seventies given their pacey play they could give these top English sides from those days a real run for their money on the field.Whatever side you support at whichever level in Irish League football there is plenty to be proud of about the local game these days. As someone who has spent far too many tears and treasure watching often disinterested multi-millionaire English Premiership footballers sometimes casually lose games in the most lucrative league in the world the Irish League by contrast gives the ordinary fan real value for money.For instance, I remember one scintillating Saturday afternoon at Solitude attending a thrilling - draw with Linfield about a decade ago. Later that evening I sailed across the Irish Sea for the Merseyside derby which ended the next day in a drab - draw.The entrance fee at the North Belfast stadium cost £ while it was the guts of £ to enter Goodison Park  hours later. I know which game I was short changed in.The one aspect of Irish League football which is still a crying shame is the dilapidated nature of so many of stadia. From decaying, rotting stands like the old main stand at Solitude to the vile toilets at other grounds across Northern Ireland the state of the stadiums has long been a disgrace. Fans regardless of their religious or political allegiances were and are united in seeing a province wide upgrade of their grounds.The £. million initially promised to transform these grounds was aimed at giving supporters decent surroundings to watch their teams in safety, comfort, and dignity. The Northern Ireland Football League’s tenacious campaign under Gerard Lawlor may finally have paid idends. However, to depict that struggle was one tainted by sectarianism is to denigrate that achievement.  To refract that battle through the prism of sectarian ision was something clubs and their fans didn’t need in forcing the minister’s U-turn.Sinn FeinGAANorthern IrelandDeirdre HargeyCasement Park  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularStorm Franklin : Heres what the next storm is called after Storm Eunice - and when it could hit the UKMarkethill loyalist protest rally hears of ‘grave threat’ posed by NI Protocol‘DUP-Sinn Fein tinkering with Good Friday Agreement has caused surge in ‘sectarian headcount’ elections’, say members of SDLP and UUP talks teams which secured the  dealWhat time will Storm Eunice hit  When and where will Storm Eunice hit - and will it snow in Northern Ireland Storm Eunice round-up: Has Storm Eunice finished  - Whats the weather forecast for this evening Most PopularWhat’s going to happen in Season  of Netflix’s Bridgerton: what happens in Julia Quinn’s novels, where to buyBest Aldi dupes : top perfume, skincare, beauty, makeup, cleansing balm products from Lacura to le CreusetBest cocktail shaker sets UK : mix the perfect drink with one of these excellent cocktail shakersBest robot vacuum cleaner UK : top cleaners for pet hair and more from Dyson to SharkCan the right mattress help with back pain  We review Simba, Nectar, Dormeo and Tempur mattresses                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Both of them blamed DUP-Sinn Fein tinkering with the Good Friday Agreement - a deal driven by the UUP and SDLP - by means of the St Andrew’s Agreement in  . Both said the DUP-Sinn Fein tinkering seriously damaged the partnership ethos of the  deal, as envisioned by its UUP and SDLP architects.Lord Reg Empey and Alban Maginness, members of the UUP and SDLP talks teams that secured the Good Friday Agreement, say DUP and Sinn Fein tinkering of the agreement led directly to more sectarian politics we see today.Lord Empey said: “What has happened is that the agreement that we negotiated [in ] was changed.”He said this was done in   in the legislation based on the St Andrew’s agreement.“Under our proposals that we had ratied [in ], the largest party in the largest designation, i.e. unionist or nationalist, would provide the First Minister and the largest party in the second largest designation would be the deputy First Minister. Two names then went before the assembly on a single resolution to be elected by the assembly in a cross community vote. But that was changed to suit Paisley and McGuinness.”He claims Paisley did not want to be seen on a joint resolution with former IRA commander Martin McGuinness and that McGuinness did not want to be subject to a unionist veto, due to his paramilitary past. And this, he believes, this is at the root of the tensions today.“It has completely changed the way the whole way devolution operates. The tenor of election manestos changed after that with a major focus on keeping the other party out or securing First Minister for Sinn Fein.”He added that under the original legislation, “there would be no question of Sinn Fein being first minister because there would be more pro-union MLAs than nationalist MLAs.”But his criticism does not simply extend back to  .“The DUP has also been resisting attempts in Parliament that we have been making in the last number of months and weeks to try and change the legislation back to the original proposal.”Former SDLP MLA Alban Maginnis agreed the tone of politics has declined.“It is both polarised and rancorous but there is a degree of rancour which should not be there given the elapse of some  years since the GFA.”John Hume wanted “power sharing... partnership between nationalists and unionists in the new assembly and the new executive and indeed between north and south.”This had started to blossom, he said. “But then the radical changes that took place in terms of voting and so forth in  [in the St Andrews Agreement].”“And that I think led to a more polarised electoral race between Sinn Fein and the DUP.”He terms the DUP and Sinn Fein “ethno-nationalist blocs” whereas the UUP and SDLP he terms “civic nationalist parties”.He believes both David Trimble and John Hume made major sacrices, even in terms of their own parties, to secure the Belfast Agreement.“They were selfless in their approach. They wanted a settlement, they wanted to solve problems, they wanted to bring their communities together in terms of partnership and there were people there who didn’t want that to happen, particularly the DUP and Sinn Fein.”He accepts that Ian Paisley, Martin McGuinness and Peter Robinson all worked together well in the top two jobs, but says the DUP and Sinn Fein grassroots were not supportive.Askedhe thinks “ethnonationalism” needs a “bogeyman” in order to , he claimed: “Ethnonationalism sees itself in a struggle to defend itself and its political community and it is therefore constantly being defensive and at the same time trying to assert its dominance one over the other. I think that is the problem.”The News Letter asked the DUP and Sinn Fein why they changed the means of electing the First and Deputy First Minister - and why they didn’t back recent efforts to change it back again. The News Letter also askedthey prefer the St Andrew’s arrangements because they believe it will better motivate their voters to turn out The DUP response did not address any of the questions.Fermanagh  South Tyrone MLA Deborah Erskine responded: “A SF win at the election would take Northern Ireland in the wrong direction. They would have more MLAs, more Ministers and more influence than any other party. That would be bad for Northern Ireland.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Not only was it an eyesore but it took away that access to Ballycastle Beach for so many people.“Given the huge focus on the outdoors and people accessing our beaches and countryside much more as a result of the pandemic, there is a huge pressure on myself and others locally about when the council will have this reinstated. Can we have that timeline ”Mr Thompson responded to the Glens DEA councillor: “We already have a design for it in-house due to the fact it was originally built and we plan to replace it with the exact same materials that were high quality and used before.“Part of the reason for the delay is we had enquired through our Infrastructure team about getting it replaced before now but there was an issue about the supply of materials. We were told we simply couldn’t get the larch in the qualities and quality that we wanted.“We believe now we can get those so we will go out to procurement with a view to replacing the structure as per the original specication and quality that was provided when the scheme was completed in .”The recommendation to advance the replacement of both the viewing  in Ballycastle and the Runkerry Footbridge passed unanimously.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fcacbaebfbedca   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_baeadcdeddd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645089617694.jpg--1_700_people_apply_for_a_life_less_ordinary_with_stena_line.jpg?164508961700","title":"  people apply for a life less ordinary with stena line ","story":"Ferry company Stena Line has been overwhelmed with the positive response from the public to its recent recruitment campaign ‘A Le Less Ordinary’, which aims to fill  vacant positions onboard its Irish Sea ferries. , applications were received from people across the UK and Republic of Ireland. The campaign promoted the unique nature of le onboard, with % time-off providing the perfect work-le balance for people wanting to live and work onboard for either a one or two-week sht and then spend equal time off. The positions available are part of the Onboard Sales and Servicesteam, with vacancies for service assistants and chefs. With January being the traditional time of the year when many people look for a new career, Stena Line had hoped for a favourable response but even the most optimistic of predictions could not have expected it to be so over-subscribed. Stena Line has now undertaken the initial stage of the selection process and, for the first-time, is hosting two Open Days for prospective candidates on Monday th February, where they will get a chance to meet members of Stena Line’s crews. The Open Days are taking place in Belfast and Birkenhead with the latter being held onboard one of Stena Line’s newest ferries, Stena Edda, giving candidates a chance to get a first-hand taste of le onboard on the Irish Sea. Stephen Bryden, Stena Line’s Head of Onboard Sales and Services, commented on the success of the campaign: “I am astonished by the public’s response to the A Le Less Ordinary recruitment campaign. We have never received so many applications. It really goes to show how many people are attracted to a le at sea with a company like Stena Line. Now our HR team has the challenge of how to sort and interview so many applicants, but that is a nice challenge to have. Thank you to every single person that has applied to work with us.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fcacbaebfbedca   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_baeadcdeddd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645203863237.jpg--covid_19___fri_18th_feb_figures.jpg?164520386300","title":"covid  fri th feb figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows four further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.
